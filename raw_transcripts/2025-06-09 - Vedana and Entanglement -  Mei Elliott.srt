1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:08,000
all right so good morning my name is May uh the the talk today is going to be on

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,880
vdana or feeling tone um and so to for those who aren't familiar with it uh uh

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,960
I'll spend some time in the meditation um inviting you to explore vaydana in

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,320
your own experience and that will aid in your understanding of the dharma talk as

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,760
a whole to have a felt sense of it um uh so if you're not familiar with what

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:37,920
vdana is just a very brief introduction to it uh vdana is typically translated

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:46,480
as feeling tone and it refers to um this spectrum of pleasant unpleasant or

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,000
neither uh so all of our experiences have a feeling tone so on um in life

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,120
there's extremely pleasant we might think of vdana on a spectrum so uh very

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:04,640
pleasant on one end of the spectrum um very unpleasant on the other end of the

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,520
spectrum and in between we might say it's neutral neither pleasant nor unpleasant so in this sit today we'll

12
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:20,759
explore vdana uh as it relates to body sensations uh to sounds uh and maybe even visual

13
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,000
sights so that's what you can expect uh we'll start by settling in uh just

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:34,320
sensing the body being with the breath uh and sitting in silence for a while before we uh we get into feeling tone so

15
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:43,759
uh so why don't you go ahead and find a posture that feels supportive for you to sit in uh a posture that is uh upright

16
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,400
and relaxed

17
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,159
and just take some time to settle in with the

18
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:14,560
body you might connect with your home base for the meditation uh for a lot of people that's

19
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:22,959
the breathing for some it might be the soundsscape or a global sense of the body

20
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,550
sitting taking some time to settle with your home base with your

21
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:42,680
[Music] anchor landing in the present moment

22
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:52,040
having taken some time to settle in we'll now shift our attention to

23
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:59,360
vdana to feeling tone and we'll start by exploring it in

24
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:06,040
the body and we'll do this with a couple of body

25
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:13,839
scans and we'll start at the top of the head and do a slow scan down to the feet

26
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,399
and for our first scan uh we'll be noticing any

27
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:24,639
sensations that register as unpleasant

28
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:30,639
it might be very slightly unpleasant moderately unpleasant it

29
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:37,480
could be very unpleasant and when we meet these

30
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:44,839
sensations seeing if we can do so with a sense of ease and relaxation

31
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:54,040
scanning down the forehead feeling the

32
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:01,399
jaw maybe there's some tightness in the jaw that feels unpleasant

33
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,240
sensing the neck the

34
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:25,519
shoulders the torso sensing anything that might

35
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,920
register as unpleasant

36
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,480
it could be tension or tightness or

37
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,399
pressure sensing the

38
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,519
arms the wrists and hands

39
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,440
and the hips and legs

40
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,279
sensing anything

41
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:44,839
unpleasant when you finish just coming back to the breath

42
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:08,519
we'll start another scan now at the top of the head uh going at about the same

43
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:14,880
pace uh noticing anything that's

44
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:22,560
pleasant and it might be ever so slightly

45
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:44,959
pleasant i'll allow you to go at your own pace sensing maybe it's an area that feels

46
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,880
relaxed or spacious

47
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:01,600
maybe an area of the body that feels like a nice temperature just a little

48
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,799
pleasant maybe a softening

49
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:37,640
a slightly pleasant tingling maybe in the hands

50
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:59,840
making your way through the body sensing for anything

51
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:09,799
pleasant that's fine if you don't find anything it may be that there aren't any pleasant

52
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:17,000
sensations sometimes we'll catch just a little pleasantness in the body

53
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,760
when you finish your skin coming back to the breath

54
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:06,840
and beginning another scan of the body from head to toe uh this time

55
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:13,840
noticing vdana feeling tone that's neither pleasant nor unpleasant so this

56
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:21,280
is vdana that we might call neutral and often much of our experience

57
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,640
is neutral sensation that doesn't feel

58
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,240
pleasant or unpleasant so going down the forehead the

59
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:40,760
face in your own time your own pace sensing neutral sensations

60
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,360
neither pleasant nor unpleasant

61
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:17,200
often neutral sensations are less interesting for the mind so we tend not

62
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:25,120
to pay attention to them so it can take some extra energy

63
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,240
uh to stay with them

64
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:44,280
and you finish your scan landing with the breath again

65
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:26,000
now letting go of the breath and we'll shift our attention now to explore

66
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,840
vaydana uh in the soundsscape

67
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:42,200
so resting in this uh vast field of

68
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:49,600
hearing we can hear sometimes we can hear sounds within our own

69
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,720
bodies sounds within the

70
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:05,120
room and sometimes sounds outside the room maybe traffic or a bird

71
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:11,120
call so we'll see if we can stay with this field of

72
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:19,760
hearing and as we listen we'll be attuning to feeling tone we'll be attuning to this sense of pleasant

73
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:27,200
unpleasant and neutral so as you hear a sound uh see if you can have a soft

74
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,640
mental note in the background that acknowledges the feeling tone of that

75
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:41,320
sound so even as you hear my voice you might notice if the sound of the voice

76
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:51,640
registers as pleasant unpleasant or neither neutral

77
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:02,120
and you may find that it changes when you hear different sounds vana isn't

78
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:07,080
fixed it comes and goes

79
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:58,640
maybe just a soft background note

80
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,520
neutral unpleasant

81
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,600
neutral

82
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,120
neutral neutral

83
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:41,559
our task with vana is just to be with the feeling tone as it

84
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:46,960
is if it's pleasant we don't grasp hold of it and

85
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,559
try to get more if it's unpleasant can we be with

86
00:27:52,559 --> 00:28:00,480
it without aversion without rejecting it and if it's neutral can we stay with

87
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:09,080
it without zoning out without getting lost in thought

88
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,520
we can release our focus on the soundsscape and we'll shift now to do a

89
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:29,679
little experimentation with the vdena of thinking so thoughts and emotions also

90
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,919
have vdana

91
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:41,440
so to experiment with this you might bring to mind uh someone that you love

92
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,520
or that you care about so that might be a mental picture

93
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:53,480
of them or just have a felt sense of them

94
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,360
and now notice the vadena associated with that thought or

95
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,640
that sense of the person

96
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:37,960
And often we find that it might be pleasant maybe a little pleasant or very

97
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:43,799
pleasant to think about someone that we care about

98
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,278
to notice an unpleasant

99
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:02,240
thought you might think about something on your to-do list that you're not so

100
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:10,480
excited about not getting lost in thought about it just just bringing up maybe the

101
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,600
headline or a mental image of doing the task

102
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,960
it may be that just the idea to-do list

103
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,480
registered as unpleasant

104
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:51,240
so noticing the vena whatever you're seeing in your mind whatever that task

105
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,000
is that thought it's an

106
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:04,360
idea it might be you might see words in the mind it might be a

107
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:09,840
picture so noticing the feeling tone of the words or picture in the mind related

108
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:17,559
to this task so this is just the

109
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:22,960
vdena of the thought the idea that doesn't mean that the task

110
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,559
itself will actually be that

111
00:32:30,519 --> 00:32:37,600
way but it may be that the the thought has unpleasant va

112
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,200
So letting go of these images down coming back to the

113
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,518
breath the

114
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:19,159
body reconnecting with a sensation that's neutral or pleasant

115
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:47,599
[Music]

116

www.mmayeliot.com good morning May thank you for our guided meditation thank you

144
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:05,520
you'd like to move in uh so I'd like to start the talk this morning with a very short poem it's a

145
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:13,440
very short poem at the very the beginning of a very long book uh the book is the Vudi Maga uh fifth century

146
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:20,079
commentarial teachings by Buddha Gossa uh and in it uh it references Goa

147
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:25,320
so that's the Buddha goes like this a tangle

148
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:33,839
within a tangle without the whole world is tangled in a

149
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:39,240
tangle gota I ask you

150
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:45,880
this who can untangle this tangle

151
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:54,880
uh so when I was a kid um maybe seven years old or so uh my

152
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:01,440
parents took me to the Grand Canyon and um uh for those who might not be from

153
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,880
the US or familiar with this area this fly really likes the Grand

154
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:13,359
Canyon um hi little friend um so uh for

155
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:19,680
those who aren't from the US the Grand Canyon is uh probably one of the geologic wonders of the world um it's

156
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,839
really extraordinary um but interestingly enough uh one of my uh

157
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:34,720
like key memories from that trip was not of the Grand Canyon but of the gift shop

158
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,000
uh there was um uh there was a little toy in the gift

159
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:48,240
shop uh that consisted of um two pieces of metal and each metal was kind of like a little loop and the loops were hooked

160
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,920
together kind of something kind of like this and they looked like inextricably

161
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,680
linked like they couldn't be decoupled like they couldn't be taken apart but if

162
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:05,160
you keep mo ke kept moving them um if you did it for a very long

163
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:10,720
time eventually they would decouple um so I

164
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:18,119
was just like obsessed with this toy totally fixated on it um it was like the

165
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:25,359
highlight of the Grand Canyon trip um so um so I was remembering that toy and

166
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:31,119
that experience and I was thinking about how many times in my life um I've been

167
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:38,480
totally fixated on some inner puzzle some um you know some story or complex

168
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,560
life situation uh and I'm really just obsessed with trying to figure it out

169
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,160
trying to to find the solution to figure out the right thing to say or do and in

170
00:40:50,160 --> 00:41:00,000
being so captivated by this inner puzzle uh I'm missing the um the majesty which

171
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:07,440
is my life and I think that this is something that a lot of us do we get caught we get

172
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:14,800
so caught in our um we get so entangled in uh our inner challenges our inner

173
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,800
puzzles uh that we don't even notice that the Grand Canyon is right there

174
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:29,440
waiting for us that the full beauty and awe of our life uh is somehow missing

175
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:34,160
we're not quite seeing it because we're so fixated on these

176
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:44,079
puzzles so uh of course that toy is long gone uh but I'm still really interested

177
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:50,359
uh in how we get caught how we get caught in these puzzles uh how we get

178
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:57,839
entangled and then how do we become unentangled how do we become unentangled

179
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:04,800
so the Buddha talked about entanglement and this very process of learning to be

180
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:11,560
um to be free of entanglement to be free of suffering to be free of stress in our

181
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:17,720
life so today the focus of the talk is on one of these gateways to

182
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:24,319
unentanglement and more specifically uh the talk is on vana or feeling tone uh

183
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:31,680
so for those of you who weren't here at the beginning of the meditation I'll provide a little recap for you uh so

184
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,960
vdena uh it's typically translated as feeling tone sometimes it's translated

185
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,000
as hyonic tone um hyonic tone or

186
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:50,240
effective tone and when I say feeling this is not talking about an emotion or a body

187
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:58,960
sensation it's referring to uh the pleasantness unpleasantness or neutrality of experience uh so I had

188
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:04,079
mentioned the spectrum so we can think of vdana as being on a spectrum with one

189
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,880
end of the spectrum being like the most pleasant thing a human can

190
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:16,880
experience and then there's like very pleasant and then quite

191
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:23,240
pleasant pleasant uh a little less pleasant slightly pleasant you know

192
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:28,640
neutral a little unpleasant etc all the way to the most unpleasant

193
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:35,160
thing a human can experience you know it could be the emotions associated with the loss of a loved

194
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:41,920
one or uh severe physical pain you know so so this is that

195
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:49,680
spectrum of va so one of the most famous sutas uh

196
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:56,000
the sati patana suta which uh is uh forms the basis for many of our I should

197
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,599
say most of our meditation instruction in the west um the satipadana

198
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:08,560
foundations of mindfulness it goes over four foundations I'll just mention a couple uh one is the body one is the

199
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,920
mind and one is vdana so it's really interesting to me

200
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:21,599
that the Buddha only gave one foundation to the the the body only one foundation to the mind and vana gets an entire

201
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:29,119
foundation to itself so what's up with that like that that caught my attention

202
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:35,200
like this this must be important if the Buddha gave an entire foundation uh the Buddha said you know there's four things

203
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:43,040
to pay attention to and one of them is vana so um so why is that the reason one

204
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:49,520
of the main reasons vdana gets so much airtime from the Buddha uh is because it

205
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:59,319
plays a critical role in why we suffer it plays a critical role in how we get

206
00:44:59,319 --> 00:45:07,000
entangled uh so one of the teachers that the the teachings that the Buddha offered uh that best explains how we get

207
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:13,839
entangled is dependent origination uh it's also known as dependent arising uh

208
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:19,640
also known as the 12-fold chain the poly is paticha

209
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:27,359
samupada uh so uh this teaching uh at first glance well even after first

210
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:35,280
glance it can seem very complicated uh uh very hard to understand confusing uh

211
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:41,680
but very simply uh the 12-fold chain uh it's just a description of how we get

212
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:47,599
caught in suffering the cycle of suffering it's often depicted as a wheel the 12 links kind of going around in a

213
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:52,920
chain we just go round and round the circle circle of suffering the cycle of

214
00:45:52,920 --> 00:46:00,240
suffering um so uh so I appreciate that it's called the 12-fold chain because

215
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:07,280
awakening is sometimes called or referred to as freedom from bondage so

216
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:14,400
when we become awakened it's kind of like we become unchained kind of unhooked um but what's

217
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:22,160
amazing is it's actually possible to break the chain to break this cycle of suffering before full liberation so

218
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:29,839
that's what I'm interested in today in this talk that we can actually break the chain we can we can uh stop entanglement

219
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:34,880
from happening um uh here and now and we

220
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:42,640
don't need to wait for um for some future enlightenment uh so in the talk uh today

221
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:48,400
I'll be talking about just four of the links and of those four are just really zooming in on two of them and what's

222
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:54,400
nice about the four I'm going to mention is that uh you don't need to know anything else about the rest of the

223
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:01,280
chain for them to be useful and applicable and what's also nice about them is you can experience them in your

224
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,720
life um they're not theoretical so um let's go through them

225
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,800
and maybe I'll just say all of them to begin with uh so um the six

226
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:16,960
senses contact vdena craving and that's the

227
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:26,240
order six senses contact vdena craving so uh six senses so you're all

228
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:31,720
familiar with the five senses eyes ears nose mouth

229
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:37,920
body and then the sixth in Buddhism is the mind so those are the six senses we

230
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:43,240
can all experience those next link

231
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:48,359
contact so if you can see me right now that's a moment of

232
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:54,640
contact if you can hear me right now that's a moment of contact so contact

233
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:01,359
refers to when a sense gate meets a sense object and we're conscious so

234
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:07,280
those three things coming together so there's a working eye there's a sight

235
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:14,880
and consciousness is present consciousness is just the the basic awareness of being awake all sentient

236
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:21,359
beings have it so it's basically saying as long as you're not under general anesthesia

237
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:27,920
um and you have a working eye and there's a sight contact is going to happen or as long as you haven't fainted

238
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:34,800
or as long as you're not in deep sleep contact is going to happen at the senses uh if you have a working sense gate and

239
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:40,319
there's an object so contact is happening all the time it's very simple

240
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:47,839
like I said if you can see me and you can hear me that's eye contact and ear contact and there's also mind contact

241
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:53,680
the mind mind as the sense gate meets an object the object is a thought or an

242
00:48:53,680 --> 00:49:00,640
emotion so that's mind contact so um so there those are the first two uh links I

243
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:06,760
wanted to share uh Six senses contact now we have

244
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:15,119
vdana so every moment of sense contact has vina has feeling tone we normally

245
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:21,200
don't notice it but every sound every body sensation every taste every thought

246
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:27,520
every emotion has feeling tone it's registering as pleasant unpleasant or

247
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,559
neither so um when we see something that we

248
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:39,359
perceive as beautiful maybe it's art or nature uh or something like that um it's

249
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:45,040
probably because that that sight object is pleasant that moment of sight contact

250
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:52,160
is pleasant if we hear a song that we like um it's because that song registers

251
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:57,200
as pleasant um for most people if they hear a chainsaw that registers as

252
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:03,280
unpleasant now every body sensation has vdana so um

253
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:09,720
as you may have noticed in the meditation one area of the body can be feeling pleasant while another feels

254
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:17,200
unpleasant um much of our experience is often neutral at the sense

255
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:27,480
gates and as the mind experiences emotions sadness might register as

256
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:33,359
unpleasant joy might register as pleasant sometimes anger can be

257
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:40,160
unpleasant sometimes we can have that sort of like self-righteous anger that can have a little pleasantness in it uh

258
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:46,240
right so be really interesting to explore the field of vana uh and not only interesting it can

259
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:52,000
be very useful um so and that'll that'll the utility of it will start to become

260
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,079
become clear as we explain um as I explain the next link

261
00:50:57,079 --> 00:51:02,720
so six senses uh when we have the six senses we can

262
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:10,559
have contact every moment of contact leads to vdana and uh for the untrained mind the

263
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:18,240
knee-jerk reaction to vdana is craving that's the next link craving so um to

264
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:24,800
highlight the relevance of craving for you I want to remind you of the Buddha's four noble truths i'm just going to

265
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:30,280
mention the first two uh first noble truth uh there is

266
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:37,280
suffering second noble truth the source of suffering is craving so this is

267
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:44,079
really radical right the source of suffering he's not saying the source of suffering is unpleasant vana we usually

268
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:49,599
think that unpleasant things are the source of suffering but that's not what he's saying he's saying that it's

269
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,800
actually the wanting and not wanting that's the suffering the rejection of

270
00:51:54,800 --> 00:52:01,920
experience or the grabbing hold of experience that's our suffering so the craving and of course the the other side

271
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:07,760
of the coin of craving is aversion so wanting and not wanting so why why are

272
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:14,319
those suffering like why does that why is that suffering so the secret message

273
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:20,599
behind craving and aversion are that this moment is not

274
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:26,640
enough if craving for something else is present um or aversion is present it's

275
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:34,160
saying that this moment needs to be better or different more or less in

276
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:41,440
order to be content in order to be happy so inherently within the wanting and not

277
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:47,920
wanting there's a sense that this moment isn't okay um that I need something different

278
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,440
in order to be happy so it can be hard to see that because we're so fixated on

279
00:52:53,440 --> 00:53:00,000
the object of desire what it is we want to get but really embedded in that whole process of mind the whole wanting and

280
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:06,319
wanting wanting and not wanting system is dissatisfaction so that's why craving

281
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:14,240
is duka that's why craving is suffering so um so returning to dependent arising

282
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:20,880
these links here so I had said the knee-jerk reaction to vdana is craving

283
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:26,079
so what happens is we experience pleasant vaydana we immediately want

284
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:31,960
more that's that movement from vdana to craving we experience unpleasant

285
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:38,800
vaydana and we immediately want to get rid of it or we want less of it that's the aversion right we want to fix it or

286
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:45,839
change it or destroy it or get rid of it if we experience neutral vana uh

287
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:52,319
we're usually bored uh it's not interesting to us and so um we go into

288
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:57,359
delusion delusion is like getting lost in the thinking mind in the narrative of

289
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:04,720
um I me and mine so we check out um we go into selfing uh so so this is that

290
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:13,000
that movement through the chain so six senses contact vdena

291
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,640
craving so um so we can see this in our experience it happens really fast but

292
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:24,960
I'll share a short example of um of this kind of sequence occurring that I

293
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:32,000
noticed some years ago uh so I was having a snack at home uh it was um some

294
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:38,559
nut butter i think it was like almond butter or something like that and I'm sitting in the kitchen eating my nut

295
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:45,599
butter straight out of the jar delicious my favorite uh and I should mention nut

296
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:52,640
butter is like a high ticket item in my family like it is a coveted item so So

297
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:58,880
I'm really enjoying my snack i finish I put it back in the fridge i'm about to close the door and then I realized there

298
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:06,079
was something just like a little strange about the way that I put the jar in the fridge and I realized I didn't just set

299
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:11,280
the jar in the fridge i kind of like moved some things out of the way put the

300
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:19,280
jar in and then moved those items back so you know how a dog will take a

301
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:26,079
bone in the backyard and dig a hole and put the bone in and then cover it with dirt

302
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:31,280
that's what was happening so um so you know I could have

303
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:38,599
been hard on myself about this like oh come on you know you've done you know renunciate monastic training focusing on

304
00:55:38,599 --> 00:55:45,839
generosity and you know giving things up and um but fortunately I was just amused

305
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:53,040
when I saw this um and it was just interesting to see this is just what the mind does this was just the chain of

306
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:58,599
dependent origination and action six senses in this case there was a

307
00:55:58,599 --> 00:56:04,880
mouth there's a moment of contact the mouth made made contact with some almond

308
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:10,079
butter i was conscious you there's consciousness present um I wasn't under

309
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:15,240
general anesthesia um I hadn't fainted you know so so there's a moment of

310
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:22,680
contact that contact was very pleasant and that pleasantness led to

311
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:31,280
craving and clinging and I did not want to share so so that's that chain that's how

312
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:38,559
that occurs and this is happening all day long for

313
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:46,119
us so there's this uh this classic suta uh called the dart or the arrow it's

314
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:52,960
samutanikaya 36.6 um some of you may know it as uh the

315
00:56:52,960 --> 00:57:00,599
teaching on the second arrow uh it's a really very commonly taught suta uh

316
00:57:00,599 --> 00:57:08,240
however a lot of people don't know that it's actually about vana so um so I'm going to read you a

317
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:14,319
little section from it when an untaught worldling I love

318
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:20,319
this phrase an untaught worldling refers just to an untrained person a person who hasn't practiced the teachings of a

319
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:28,880
Buddha who hasn't done the introspective training so when an untaught worldling is touched by a by painful vadena they

320
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:35,480
worry and grieve they lament beat their breast weep and are

321
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:41,839
distraught they thus experience two kinds of vana a bodily

322
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:47,520
and a mental adena it is as if a person were pierced

323
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:56,400
by an arrow and following the first piercing they are hit by a second arrow

324
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:02,000
so um so the first arrow so let's say there's uh we have knee pain so there's

325
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:10,720
some unpleasant vana of the knee pain that unpleasant vadena that's the first arrow but then uh when we grieve and

326
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:15,920
worry and lament when we go oh my gosh my knee hurts how am I going to afford

327
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:24,400
seeing a doctor what if I need surgery what if I have a limp who will love me if I have a limp um that's the second

328
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:31,040
era So um so that description of the first arrow and the second arrow those are

329
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:37,319
those two links of dependent arising that we've been talking about that's vdana and

330
00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:44,760
craving unpleasant knee pain that's the vdana the uh the aversion the fear the

331
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:51,040
worry that's the craving specifically that's aversion right so that's that

332
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:58,040
movement and within that movement is the movement from freedom to

333
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:05,200
suffering um because remember vana pleasant unpleasant neutral is not

334
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:10,480
the source of suffering the Buddha said cravings the source of suffering so

335
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:17,839
that's that shift that shift from ease to dooka right there

336
00:59:17,839 --> 00:59:24,000
so um so one aspect of training as a Zen

337
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:30,000
monk is uh being trained as a ceremonial instrumentalist so you become kind of

338
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:37,520
like a Zen musician um and in uh residential Zen training uh there are a

339
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,559
lot of ceremonies like a lot of ceremonies and there's all different

340
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:49,280
instruments uh so there are drums there are bells of all different sizes i

341
00:59:49,280 --> 00:59:57,079
remember at Tasahara there was one that was like almost big enough to take a bath in um there are

342
00:59:57,079 --> 01:00:03,440
um there are let's see um uh a variety of kind of like I don't

343
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:09,200
even know what to call them uh like what an English translation would be there's one called the makugio that's like a red

344
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:16,000
lacquered fish that you hit with a mallet um there was a large wooden hanging fish um and you hit it right in

345
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:22,160
the eye with a mallet so all these different instruments um and sometimes the

346
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:28,880
instrumental parts are quite complex um which is kind of a vulnerable thing for

347
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:35,359
a Zen monk who didn't choose to move to a monastery to be a musician

348
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:42,880
a lot a lot of Zen monks don't really have a lot of musical tendencies um including myself uh so so sometimes

349
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:49,640
this was challenging and of course if if you make a mistake the whole assembly hears right

350
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:56,960
so so um during one ceremony at uh city center San Francisco Zen Center uh the

351
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:02,400
former Abbis Blanch Hartman was um was officiating so that means that she was

352
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:10,319
the the main priest for the ceremony and she was making all of the offerings and things like that and um the Doan the

353
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:15,520
instrumentalist who's playing the bells um uh needs to be hitting each bell at a

354
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:21,599
very specific time uh choreographed aligned with what the the abbis is doing

355
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:26,640
in the ceremony and so the whole assembly knows exactly when the bells are supposed to happen they've heard it

356
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:32,559
a million times uh and on this particular day the Doan was um a woman

357
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:39,079
who was moving right along until she hit a bell at the wrong

358
01:01:39,079 --> 01:01:44,359
time she hit the bell and immediately she

359
01:01:44,359 --> 01:01:49,680
winced that sort of that facial expression that's like the universal

360
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:56,000
expression of damn it so she hits the bell wints the abb

361
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:03,599
looks over because she hears that the bell is wrong and then of course the ceremony continues um so at the end of the

362
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:09,520
service the woman who was playing the bells went up to Blanch and she apologized for hitting the bell at the

363
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:15,240
wrong time and Blanch she responds she

364
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:22,119
says "Mistakes on the bells are inevitable but the

365
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:31,130
face the face was [Laughter]

366
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:38,359
extra." So the unpleasant sound of the incorrect

367
01:02:38,359 --> 01:02:44,200
bell inevitable that's the first arrow right the

368
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:51,200
wse that's extra that's the second arrow the wse is the second arrow so that wse

369
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:56,400
of aversion that movement from vana to

370
01:02:56,760 --> 01:03:03,960
craving so what is our alternative how do we break the

371
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:09,280
chain so how do we keep suffering from arising

372
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:17,599
so the key is learning to rest in vdana learning to experience vdana

373
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:23,520
without reacting to it so can you be with the pleasantness

374
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:28,559
of experience without chasing it grasping for more

375
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:34,079
and can you be with unpleasant experience without aversion without

376
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:41,480
rejecting it without trying to get rid of it or get away from it so this is our

377
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:48,240
task and what's worth noting is um when we think about the chain we still have

378
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:56,480
six senses uh they still make contact with objects and vana still arises

379
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:02,799
vana is a benign force even after Buddha the Buddha's enlightenment the Buddha still

380
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:10,640
experienced Vdana he still experienced pleasant and unpleasant he still had really bad back pain but what he didn't

381
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:16,160
have was craving and aversion that's what's different about

382
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:22,720
the liberated mind it doesn't have craving and aversion so you don't need to get rid of what's unpleasant in your

383
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:31,440
life you don't have to chase what's pleasant in order to be free you can just be with what is

384
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:37,119
without anything extra and that's what's

385
01:04:37,799 --> 01:04:42,920
freeing so that's that's how we become

386
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:50,280
unentangled tell me go how to untangle this tangle

387
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:00,319
so um for many people

388
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:05,799
uh it's difficult to decouple vdana and

389
01:05:05,799 --> 01:05:12,319
craving and I might say uh that it's a victory just to start noticing vaydana

390
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:18,559
at all and so that's where I'd like to suggest you start

391
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:25,200
uh start uh in terms of uh the practice of decoupling vaydana and craving where

392
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:33,359
we start is just starting to be mindful of vaydana in our life so starting to identify it so that

393
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:38,720
second foundation of mindfulness vdana so you might start by noticing it

394
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:46,880
in your meditation practice you might uh spend a period of medit meditation just noticing vana kind of how we did today

395
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:52,400
um where you see if you can notice uh pleasant neutral and unpleasant

396
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:59,160
sensations in the body uh see if you can notice pleasant unpleasant neutral uh

397
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:04,720
sounds uh try opening your eyes and seeing if you can identify pleasant

398
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:12,640
unpleasant and neutral visual objects sights uh it gets really interesting to do this

399
01:06:12,640 --> 01:06:20,400
with emotions and moods and particularly so with thoughts if you can catch them

400
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:26,240
it's really easy to get lost in thoughts and not be able to see them clearly but if you can see them clearly you can

401
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:31,440
begin to see how much the vdana of thoughts uh controls our life has so

402
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:39,559
much power over us so getting interested in vdana starting to notice it um becomes a gateway to

403
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:45,839
wisdom we um maybe I could say we get wise about vaydana when we become

404
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:52,640
mindful of it so I I want to say a few things about the way that we get wise about vaydana

405
01:06:52,640 --> 01:07:00,240
so you can see how this can affect us so one way is that we start to see that

406
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:06,640
vdana is impermanent that it's really transitory that it's always changing you

407
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:13,119
know we think that vana is fixed um you know we we chase some object you know uh

408
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:21,160
ice cream is always pleasant or maybe more dangerously um

409
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:29,240
exerson uh is always terrible or even worse um x- type of

410
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:34,720
people uh like I always hate x- type of people you know we have this sense that

411
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:41,520
maybe there's some some unpleasant vdana associated with certain people that we don't like you know that's and that's

412
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:49,160
how they are it's always unpleasant so that's assuming that vdana doesn't change um and we have a lot of

413
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:54,880
assumptions about vaydana not changing but as we begin to examine it and it

414
01:07:54,880 --> 01:08:02,799
experience it in our life we see that it's almost vaneta operates almost like uh raindrops on a pond just coming and

415
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:08,960
going coming and going even within a single mouthful of food um the vdena

416
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:15,359
will change there'll be like a peak of pleasantness in the chewing and then it just kind then it becomes a little more

417
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:22,640
neutral and then we swallow and oh the vet is gone so check it out for yourself um

418
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:28,400
when we begin to see that vdana is impermanent we start to see how feudile

419
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:33,920
it is to grasp it why grab hold of something why chase

420
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:41,400
something why spend sometime so much time trying to fix or reject or get rid of something when that vana is

421
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:47,278
impermanent when it doesn't last so that starts to undermine our

422
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:54,159
tendency to move from vayana to craving right that starts to make it so seeing

423
01:08:54,159 --> 01:09:01,920
seeing clearly that things are impermanent that vdana is impermanent it starts to allow us to break the chain it

424
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:08,719
starts to allow us to just rest in vdana you know why get so entangled in the vdena with craving with wanting and not

425
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:15,480
wanting when we know it's going to change anyway i can just rest here

426
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:26,000
some of you may have had the experience of getting uh a new toy maybe a new article of clothing uh or maybe a new

427
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:33,600
gadget uh maybe a cell phone maybe something bigger a new car or something like that uh and being really excited

428
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:41,838
about it for like two weeks and there's like a like fever

429
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:48,798
pitch pleasantness associated with that experience and then something happens we

430
01:09:48,799 --> 01:09:55,360
often don't even notice it but that new item just kind of fades into the background of our life like it kind of

431
01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:01,600
just becomes normal and we don't really notice it anymore and then we need a new toy in order to experience that fever

432
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:10,480
pitch pleasure or a new experience so all that's happening with that first item is that the vdena went from very

433
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:18,800
very pleasant to neutral and so that example um uh is to

434
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:25,040
express that one vdena changes but also another way that we get wise about

435
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:30,880
vaydana uh is that um we begin to see that vdena

436
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:38,280
is not inherent to the object like a new car like

437
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:45,719
um pleasant vadena is not embedded in the new car it's not fixed in the new

438
01:10:45,719 --> 01:10:50,880
car uh shockingly pleasant vadena is not

439
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:56,080
embedded in ice cream like it's possible to have ice

440
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:01,600
cream that's neutral it's possible to have ice cream that's unpleasant um it

441
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,640
changes and it's not fixed it's not embedded in the object it's not inherent

442
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:12,480
to the object so all of this undermines the tendency

443
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:18,040
to cling seeing this undermines the tendency to cling

444
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:31,440
so one area where you might see this for yourself where you might be able to see that capacity to um to rest in vana

445
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:39,600
without clinging is to start noticing noticing things that are just slightly pleasant or slightly unpleasant because

446
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:44,960
we have a greater capacity to be with them without reactivity so just in your

447
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:50,800
life notice if some there's maybe um a food that's just slightly pleasant and

448
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:58,640
you might notice there's no craving with it oh interesting i'm not craving for a second helping oh okay i'm actually

449
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:03,760
seeing how I can experience something pleasant without craving so then you

450
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:09,800
just get a little taste of what's that what that's like to see the two decoupled to see vana and craving

451
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:15,520
decoupled for a lot of people um they're so used to those two forces coming to

452
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:21,679
happening at the same time that it's hard to see that they could be separate so you can play around with it with

453
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:29,679
vdena that's not as strong uh because it's more obvious there another place you might notice um

454
01:12:29,679 --> 01:12:35,120
or maybe I should say another practice you might play with um is noting

455
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:43,760
practice we did a little of that in the meditation uh this can be helpful for uh both recognizing vaydana and also uh not

456
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:51,120
getting hooked by it not getting entangled with it um so you might just notice um uh when when v when you're

457
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:57,159
you're attending to va you just might use a soft mental note um pleasant

458
01:12:57,159 --> 01:13:03,840
pleasant pleasant or unpleasant unpleasant maybe a phone rings during

459
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:10,080
your meditation and normally you'd go "Why does the phone always ring during meditation it's so distracting i wish it

460
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:15,320
wouldn't do that." But instead you might just note

461
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:22,400
unpleasant unpleasant unpleasant so this is one way that you

462
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:28,000
can just uh incorporate another tool to noticing vana and not getting hooked by

463
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,000
it

464
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:41,920
maybe just um I want to say a little more about how

465
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:47,760
wholesome it is to rest in vana when we do this uh it's a little

466
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:53,840
like a foretaste of enlightenment so one definition of

467
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:59,840
enlightenment um is the complete uprooting of craving

468
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:06,880
aversion and delusion the complete uprooting of craving aversion and delusion so when we

469
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:14,159
can rest in vdana when we can just be with pleasant unpleasant and neutral without craving

470
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:20,000
without aversion and without delusion that's a mind a lot like the

471
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:27,120
liberated mind so don't miss it don't miss that mind uh

472
01:14:27,120 --> 01:14:35,120
enjoy it and know that it's possible it's possible to break the chain here and now to rest in something very close

473
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:40,719
to freedom uh not full enlightenment it's not full enlightenment but it's

474
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:47,679
like a taste of the peace that's possible so this this is how we become

475
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:54,400
unentangled so I I'm going to end with a a poem a

476
01:14:54,400 --> 01:15:02,159
piece of a poem i'm not going to read it all it's called in this passing moment by Hogan Bay and I share it because part

477
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:08,560
of our task with vana is to choose the vdana we have right then rather than

478
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:13,600
trying to get better vana choose the vena we have rather than

479
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:19,320
trying to get rid of the unpleasant and get the pleasant

480
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:28,880
in this passing moment karma ripens and all things come to be i vow to choose

481
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:34,040
what is if there is cost I choose to

482
01:15:34,040 --> 01:15:42,520
pay if there is need I choose to give if there is pain I choose to

483
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:48,159
feel if there is sorrow I choose to grieve

484
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:53,640
when burning I choose heat when

485
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:58,920
calm I choose peace when

486
01:15:58,920 --> 01:16:06,360
starving I choose hunger when happy I choose

487
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:11,560
joy whom I encounter I choose to

488
01:16:11,560 --> 01:16:17,080
meet what I shoulder I choose to

489
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:22,199
bear when it is my death I choose to

490
01:16:22,199 --> 01:16:28,040
die where this takes me I choose to

491
01:16:28,040 --> 01:16:34,760
go being with what is I respond to what

492
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:40,159
is this life is as real as a dream

493
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:47,000
the one who knows it cannot be found and truth is not a

494
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:53,159
thing therefore I vow to choose this dharma entrance

495
01:16:53,159 --> 01:16:58,239
gate may all Buddhas and wise ones help

496
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:05,640
me live this vow let's sit together

497
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:49,760
thank you for your kind attention so we now have a little time

498
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:56,159
for questions or comments um and please just say your

499
01:17:56,159 --> 01:18:03,360
name before you before you share we have a mic i don't know martha there's somebody in the back

500
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:14,239
here thank Oh Kurt thank you very much of course thank you um two quick

501
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:19,960
questions how do you spell Vana and what is the uh how can

502
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:26,320
we find what you just read that I choose to I choose to those are my two

503
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:36,960
questions great so vdana it's spelled v as in victor e d a n a vdana typically

504
01:18:36,960 --> 01:18:45,280
poly v's are pronounced w's so I could argue that it should be pronounced but um in the west we usually

505
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:51,760
say vana so for consistency we'll stick with that um the poem if you want to uh

506
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:58,560
note the title it's called In This Passing Moment by Hogan Bae and this is

507
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:05,320
recorded so if you just go to the IMC website you can hear that title and look it up and then you can see the full poem

508
01:19:05,320 --> 01:19:09,880
too great thanks

509
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:15,719
I'm going just bring it over here

510
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:24,640
good morning my name is Mizu and I'm so happy to be here i have two questions

511
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:29,719
also um the first one came to mind as you were reading the

512
01:19:29,719 --> 01:19:38,800
poem um so I'm asking the question sort of backwards um the questions two

513
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:44,920
questions um the first one is what is the feeling tone or vdana

514
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:51,120
of accepting what is yeah so uh was everybody able to hear the question

515
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:57,239
great so what is the feeling tone or vdana of accepting what is so

516
01:19:57,239 --> 01:20:04,840
um typically uh acceptance registers as pleasant uh sometimes

517
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:12,159
neutral and I should uh I should say that remember that vdana isn't fixed um

518
01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:19,600
and it's not consistent uh so there isn't one consistent reliable feeling tone associ associated with acceptance

519
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:26,480
however there are trends uh so typically it's it's uh pleasant or neutral and you

520
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:32,320
might imagine a time for yourself where there was some sort of clinging or holding on or struggle and then that

521
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:38,320
shift to accept acceptance often acceptance is a state of non-clinging right so non-suffering

522
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:43,440
and that's pleasant non-suffering is very pleasant yes I thought so thank you

523
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:50,080
I just wanted to clarify that for myself um and then the second question

524
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:57,440
uh is about vana still as it relates to duka and going back to the story of the

525
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:02,840
arrows there's a first arrow and then there's a second arrow

526
01:21:02,840 --> 01:21:08,080
So the vdana isn't an arrow at all the

527
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:15,679
Buddha actually he he uh to clarify he was saying the vdana is like a first arrow like we do there are painful

528
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:20,960
things in our life we can experience extreme physical pain and that's like a

529
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:28,159
first arrow but then the reactivity the wanting and not wanting that's the second arrow so it kind of goes along

530
01:21:28,159 --> 01:21:33,520
with the phrase uh that you may have heard uh pain is inevitable but

531
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:39,440
suffering is optional okay so then the last question I'm sorry

532
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:45,840
um just to get into the full clarification of duca then is duca only

533
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:53,199
then the second arrow and not the first arrow which is vana so typically uh

534
01:21:53,199 --> 01:22:03,360
typically when we're talking about duca we're talking about the suffering that's optional yeah so one k could consider um

535
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:08,719
physical pain as duca also um as uh

536
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:14,880
sometimes the the Buddha would refer to duca as uh sickness old age death uh

537
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:20,159
these things that are very you know first arrow very primary um but

538
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:26,639
typically when we're talking about dooka we're referring to that optional type a second era yeah because that's the

539
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:31,800
that's the dooka we have some say over that's the type that's optional

540
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:36,960
yeah so I think we should probably stop there but if anybody has any questions

541
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:43,600
after we close you're welcome to come up and we can chat a little more so thank you so much for coming today and uh

542
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:49,920
you're welcome to stay for tea and treats take care everyone
