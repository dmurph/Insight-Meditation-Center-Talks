1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,880
folks nice to see the names over there

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:19,400
um yeah happy to be uh happy to be with you so um so yeah welcome I'll say say a

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,920
few things and uh and then we'll uh we'll

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,920
sit um

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,079
so I was uh at a at a family gathering

6
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,360
uh this past weekend and um was one a

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,520
member from uh extended family uh as

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,520
a very adorable three-year-old and he was telling me that

9
00:00:52,520 --> 00:01:01,640
uh sometimes uh in the middle of the night a three-year-old wakes up and

10
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:10,560
says gets his dad says papa papa I'm so

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,479
tired and uh something about aside from being

12
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,759
extremely cute something about that made me think of meditation practice and I

13
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:33,399
don't know what the equivalent is but maybe it's something like Papa how do do I become

14
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:40,799
aware Papa wears the dhma

15
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,920
right maybe there's more right

16
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:58,560
here so on this theme of more right

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:05,360
here I I heard about uh a retreat some years ago I don't know

18
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,640
anything more about it than what I'll tell you but it was a retreat and all of

19
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:18,319
the practice was done laying down and the theme was something like

20
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,920
Awakening through the deepest

21
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,680
relaxation and I think back then when I heard of it I was like well

22
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:37,680
I don't know I don't know about that right but

23
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:45,480
uh there's probably something to that was speaking with a longtime

24
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,760
practitioner who uh described in a very lovely way a kind of something on

25
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,239
Retreat that happened and described it as a sizable

26
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,840
relaxation and that that lasted some days

27
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,560
and on the one hand we don't fetishize

28
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,959
relaxation Tranquility gives the notion that

29
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:25,200
uh tension is the enemy or something like this and on the other hand on the other

30
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,080
hand tension or we could say nonre ation is

31
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:38,159
the signature of many different currents of

32
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:45,159
suffering so we could say clinging is

33
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:53,040
tension we could say selfing is tension suffering is tension greed is

34
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:00,760
most definitely tension hatred is tension

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,879
maybe maybe I don't know maybe even delusion has its own kind of tension the

36
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,760
tension of being out of step with the way things

37
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,400
are and sometimes we we don't have any idea

38
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,320
how tense we are until we actually relax

39
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,320
deeply we don't know the kind of layers of

40
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,800
of suffering to which we've acclimatized basically you know usually we talk about

41
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:42,759
the desperation of getting rid of suffering and fidgeting our way out of Sam Sor these kind of things but there

42
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:47,880
may be certain ways in which we're actually resigned to the suffering or we

43
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:54,880
barely even detect it as suffering and sometimes with a sizable

44
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,440
relaxation or something kind of deep release of some

45
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,639
kind there's um the tension that's been

46
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:13,199
subtly coating our body mind uh Falls away and we realize that uh what we had

47
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:20,000
been holding and and

48
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:28,240
so without turning tension into an enemy into another object of

49
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:35,160
craving we look look for ways we can relax ways in which we can detect the

50
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,880
tension of greed of hatred of clinging of

51
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,039
self and

52
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:57,800
relax so what's here Papa I'm so

53
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,560
tired but the beds right

54
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,120
here sit

55
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
together

56
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,560
e e

57
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:48,199
maybe we the way we actually relax is

58
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:53,479
to give tension

59
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,440
permission to do whatever it wants to do in our hearts

60
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:32,479
e

61
00:09:10,079 --> 00:09:18,600
maybe we look for a way of of breathing of directing or

62
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:28,360
breath that brings uh even a kind of Whisper of ease

63
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
relaxation

64
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,360
e e

65
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:45,399
when we uh hike up a steep uh Hill or something uh gravity is not

66
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:47,680
our

67
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,200
friend but uh here it is

68
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:21,199
Sly soothing effects of the the downward pull of

69
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:32,839
gravity maybe our spine extends ever so gently towards the sky but then we

70
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:40,720
give everything else to Gravity soothed by

71
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
gravity

72
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

73
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,160
e e

74
00:13:52,240 --> 00:14:01,040
the signature of self is that kind of

75
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:15,040
attention kind of density in our

76
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,959
mind contractive force

77
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:36,759
can we breathe into

78
00:14:53,759 --> 00:15:00,199
that relinquishing ownership over

79
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:18,320
everything nothing more to [Music]

80
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,600
prove to oneself to

81
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
others

82
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

83
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

84
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,880
e e

85
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,000
you cannot be found

86
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,520
out

87
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,799
WEA e

88
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:52,600
clinging is a majorly complicated

89
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:11,480
maybe like trying to fit [Music] our heart-shaped harp

90
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:18,360
into uh square hole or something like

91
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:29,158
that letting go simplifies everything

92
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:42,279
there may be the grief of not getting but it's a very simple

93
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
grief e

94
00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:00,600
our hatred can never ever

95
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:03,039
work

96
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:32,000
out it seems that that which is deeply

97
00:21:32,679 --> 00:21:36,278
objectionable even

98
00:21:38,039 --> 00:21:41,960
horrific warrants our

99
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,360
hate no

100
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,200
we

101
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
relax

102
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,480
e e

103
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,760
delusions of

104
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,440
permanence and more

105
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:10,720
morality some permanent pleasure that ends craving it's

106
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:20,120
delusion requires us to avert our gaze from what is

107
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,919
so contains some tension

108
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:40,278
so we just keep

109
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,840
relaxing

110
00:24:53,159 --> 00:25:00,320
softening loving our attention to death as

111
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,200
teacher rashin and young would

112
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
say

113
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
e e

114
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:38,159
keep putting things down until uh awareness feels weight

115
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
less

116
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

117
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

118
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
e

119
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
e

120
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
e e

121
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
for e

122
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:20,320
okay good to uh good to sit with you

123
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:28,760
um so uh I'll be away next week it's uh juneth uh there'll be a special program

124
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:36,440
not on this channel but uh at this time I believe and so check the the website

125
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:44,000
and um I'll be back on the following week the uh the 26

126
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,760
so um okay

127
00:31:50,760 --> 00:32:00,519
so uh I was asked to to give a kind of uh

128
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:08,679
blessing at a at a uh family event and um uh kind of religious right of right

129
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:15,880
of passage uh ceremony and friends and family gathered and

130
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,960
uh and just in the days before that I

131
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,360
just sat down to reflect okay what what do I want to say and it was sort of two

132
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:38,440
two words immediately arose in my mind love and time love

133
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:45,799
time and those [Music] are not words that I

134
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:51,480
usually pair together but there they were love and

135
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:58,440
time love only becomes meaningful

136
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:08,919
because of time the limitations of time for for anything to uh to matter in

137
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:15,799
a sense we have to believe in uh the kind of unique Irreplaceable

138
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:21,399
value of something someone and

139
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:29,320
so uh meaning and finitude are deeply linked

140
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:38,200
this uh writer philosopher hogland for anything to be intelligible

141
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:45,200
as mattering they write for anything to be at stake we have to believe in the

142
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,279
Irreplaceable value of someone or something that is

143
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:55,919
finite the recognition of finitude does not offer any guarantees that we will

144
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:02,120
lead a responsible life and take better care of one another but without the

145
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:07,200
recognition of finitude questions of responsibility and

146
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:14,760
Care could not even take hold of us to turn toward you to focus our Gaze

147
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:24,919
on another and attach ourselves to what we see is the deepest movement of secular

148
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:30,679
confession we are turned back to our lives not as something that is our

149
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:35,960
property but as a form of existence that is altogether finite and altogether

150
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:41,320
dependent on others this is not the end of

151
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:49,200
responsibility it is the beginning and

152
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:55,200
so immortality uh might very well

153
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:01,720
destroy our meaning our love matters because of

154
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,119
finitude and sometimes uh I think about

155
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:13,200
kind of superhero movies I don't just think about them I sometimes watch them

156
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,800
not that often but

157
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:24,320
sometimes sometimes and the hero the hero is

158
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:32,079
almost kind of invincible but not completely right if there were no such

159
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:37,920
thing as Kryptonite there'd be no drama at all

160
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:44,839
right and so finitude mortality loss the kind of

161
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:53,720
inevitability of grief that's encoded in every moment of

162
00:35:53,800 --> 00:36:03,000
love and that's part of why I tend to elevate grief above

163
00:36:03,319 --> 00:36:12,000
the swamp of afflictive feeling it's a it's a special one

164
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,160
believe and uh uh it's tied grief is tied to time to

165
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:25,319
love I just kind of cannot imagine a spiritual life somehow divorced from

166
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:33,200
grief time enriches the quality of our

167
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:40,040
love there are certain kinds of love that just depend on some measure

168
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:47,079
of continuity across time you know

169
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:58,440
um just across across the years there's a kind of um a richness to love that that seems

170
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:06,359
to contain all the time before all the moments before contained in this present

171
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:14,960
moment of love the kind of um the depth of karmic

172
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,760
entanglement the love over time love over

173
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:28,599
time the way uh love is bound up with with

174
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:38,119
um repetition with continuity with Evolution the richness of Love Grows with

175
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:43,839
time so I say yeah love is Meaningful because of

176
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:50,599
time but time time is only really meaningful because there is love our

177
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:55,079
lives are meaningful because there is

178
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:03,560
love what what are we here to do anyway you know really what are we here to

179
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:14,079
do fight you know to enact as much craving is as humanly

180
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:20,160
possible in one lifetime kind of folly of

181
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:26,760
it uh so much of our life only makes sense

182
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:34,520
in in light of Eternity as if this doesn't end as if this goes on forever

183
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:41,480
yeah I could justify that if I were never to die but we need finitude to

184
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:47,119
sober us up time is

185
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:54,880
Meaningful because of love and love can look many different ways many

186
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,440
different ways but uh for our lives to be meaningful depends

187
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:06,440
on love in one form or another the this tradition Buddhist

188
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,640
tradition uh love is likened to the glue of the world that which

189
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:18,240
prevents dis integration you I like that image of just like oh yeah that love

190
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,640
holds things together holds people together the world trembles in all

191
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:32,480
directions the Buddha said maybe love like uh is what what prevents

192
00:39:32,839 --> 00:39:40,200
disintegration and the kind of um the barrenness of life in the absence

193
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:48,640
of love this kind of the absence of love makes every horror

194
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:59,359
possible and there there are so many um species of love that might make a life

195
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:06,480
meaningful you know classically it's um it's uh the Brahma vajar is the

196
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:12,760
Divine abodes kindness and compassion Joy equinity yeah those are beautiful

197
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:18,920
species of love but yeah it's just the beginning in a

198
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:25,400
way just the beginning of the ways we might love and maybe it's

199
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:33,359
worth just reflecting on all the different faces of

200
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:39,560
love in relational life

201
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:47,720
uh which is on my mind at this uh ceremony you know the the kind of the

202
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:53,760
intricacies and the beauty and the particularities of the heart of the

203
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:00,319
other whether that's a a friend or a lover child partner what family of one

204
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:06,720
kind or another it's like the their particularity their their sort of beauty

205
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:11,960
and even their Neurosis their radios syncrasy the particularities of the

206
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:18,599
heart of of others evokes its own species of love you know it's like our

207
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:24,160
heart constellates in a very particular way

208
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,720
depending on what's in front of us

209
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:38,920
and so how many ways are there to uh to love we we sort of just

210
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:48,319
keep looking exploring love and time it's good

211
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:55,359
to to Mark time to to keep track of our time to keep an

212
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:03,318
eye on finitude to keep track track of our love

213
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:13,880
and maybe maybe we treat treat each day as a kind of right of passage you

214
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:19,280

215
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,319
