1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,720
so for reflections today

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,759
i'd like to speak share some thoughts

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:22,720
about trust about trust

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:33,440
as i was alluding to trust in the meditation dropping it in here

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,399
and there trust the sense of trust that can be so supportive

6
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,719
for a practice for our life or humanity for the way we show up who we are in the world

7
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:57,600
supporting ourselves and others so trust the word in pali

8
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,240
often transliterate transliterated or written

9
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,840
as s-a-d-d-h-a

10
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:23,200
beautiful word literally means to place our heart upon to place our

11
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,320
heart upon so sada it's not an intellectual endeavor

12
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,799
to place our heart upon something to give our heart to something to trust in it to

13
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:44,320
give our heart to it it's also sada translated often not just as trust

14
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:55,840
but also faith or confidence or even inspiration

15
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:04,240
for some [Music] they arrive in the practice of

16
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:11,760
meditation mindfulness buddhism turning away from faith

17
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,640
perhaps from this idea of faith or blind faith that's requested

18
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,240
in theistic religions that you have to believe in something before you can

19
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:33,120
[Music] be part of the practices so for some people that resonates so they come to

20
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,239
to this practice from an intellectual place perhaps and that's okay or from a place of

21
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,280
suffering perhaps but not not wanting to have faith place faith

22
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,680
in something it just seems too much and some people in fact turn away like faith again and buddhism

23
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:59,040
faith wait i thought i got away from that so you might resonate with that or not

24
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,640
for some people um trust

25
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:12,879
in the divine is not in opposition to this practice there are many practitioners of of other

26
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:19,040
theistic religions and faiths who also practice mindfulness buddhism

27
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:27,440
etc and there is no opposition to trust in the divine and also have have trust in the buddha

28
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,879
sangha dharma buddha dharma sangha as i'll talk about it

29
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:40,239
in the in a bit so and yeah there is no there's no issue there's no opposition

30
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:50,640
yet some others after practicing in this tradition

31
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:58,959
they actually open up to more divinity and to the sacred through this practice

32
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:05,439
through this practice as as many of us might feel into touch into

33
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:12,840
experience something that's quite profound and unfathomable in our own first person

34
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,519
experience so it might feel opening up to a

35
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:25,199
dimension of sacred or divinity without without putting it

36
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:30,080
in the box not letting it be in a box

37
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:37,040
where wherever whatever you resonate with or not

38
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,520
and maybe having curious curiosity about what your resonance is with

39
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:51,360
perhaps the terms as i've introduced them so far trust faith confidence

40
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:59,280
inspiration different nuances of this word sada of this word sada

41
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:07,440
so what is surely true and prominent in in this path that we practice

42
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,680
together is um as the buddha has said

43
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,440
come and see for yourself come and see for yourself you don't have to sign up

44
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,840
to anything at the beginning you just come and see for yourself if it works for you

45
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:35,440
great and if it doesn't great it's come and see for yourself

46
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:43,440
so in many ways this practice excuse me

47
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,840
so in many no still the tickle in the throat is here hold on sick

48
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,720
okay let's try that again

49
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,680
all right i think it's going to come and go i trust it will be okay and we'll see so

50
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:22,400
i hate pasako come and see for yourself so um there is a sense of

51
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,919
you know there needs to be still even with that come and see for yourself there needs to

52
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:33,600
be some sort of trust some level of faith some level of trust

53
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,400
but okay i'm going to give myself to it because even if we

54
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,600
you know if we come to it with the invitation of ahipasico we come to it but we're just

55
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,160
apprehensive we're not giving our heart to it um it it may not work we we need to give

56
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,560
our hearts to it trust it at least for a certain amount of time and then if it's working great if it's

57
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,479
not then it's not working for you or but but if we're checking our watch every five

58
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:11,280
minutes okay is it working is it working um do i have more ease freedom am i enlightened yet

59
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,319
oh it must be enlightened you know just just if if there's not a sense of trust giving yourself to this practice

60
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,639
with humility um it it probably won't work

61
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,319
so there needs to be that sense of trust or faith and it could be

62
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,880
and they could be borrowed trust it could be borrowed trust or bright trust they're

63
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,919
different borrowed a bright trust before it becomes

64
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:49,360
verified trust and then if it as it moves to unshakable

65
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:56,479
trust so so it often starts with bright trust we

66
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:04,319
see someone we who who's different who's acting in the way we want to

67
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:12,240
be in the world or act or they have more freedom they have more ease um so that

68
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:19,120
sense of um bright that sense of brightness of of the trust

69
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:25,680
there's sense of brightness there um like oh i'm attracted to this there

70
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,039
is something there is something that inspires me there's something that's inspiring my

71
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:40,800
trust ah and then there can be borrowed trust borrow trust

72
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,480
which can be similar to bright trust in that you're borrowing trust from from what

73
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:53,440
you're witnessing in another person and i often actually work with borrowed

74
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:01,920
trust in practice meetings with with with students where i can see their capacity i can see

75
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:09,120
their beauty i can see their goodness and when they are hesitant and then they say

76
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,800
well i don't know about this and i say okay i have full trust in you

77
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,640
i i fully trust i fully trust you um with this practice with this

78
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,040
invitation with what you're about to to to undertake is it okay if i hold it

79
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:34,560
for you and for you to have borrowed trust to have the trust that i have that i

80
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,600
have in you to borrow from that for now until you see for yourself

81
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:49,680
and it becomes verified trust becomes a verified trust because then after a while it feels like wait this

82
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,240
this thing works this thing works oh there is it so it becomes verified

83
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:03,440
it's not bright or borrowed anymore it becomes verified yes

84
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:10,160
you realize you look back perhaps in your life and see again it's practices like stock market

85
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,560
don't check on it every single day every single hour but look at it long term if you've been practicing for

86
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,360
weeks and months look look at months or even years

87
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,200
consider some areas of your life where you used to

88
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,959
be very upset anxious etc etc things that were really

89
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,880
challenging for you that are not challenging anymore and c oh

90
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:45,200
verify trust something is shifting i have more peace more ease more love

91
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:52,000
more gratitude whatever it might be whatever it is you're you're serving and trusting

92
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:59,680
and after a while of doing this practice it becomes it becomes unshakable trust

93
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,720
your your trust becomes unshakable you know it works of course it does

94
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,079
and yeah you might have a day or two or a week or a month when you have monkey mind and this and that

95
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:16,079
but you have unshakable trust that you're planting seeds it's working

96
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:23,680
quote unquote working in some ways that you may not be able to fathom and in some ways it's opening you up

97
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,720
even if in your in the way

98
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,680
you're judging it it seems like it's not working but trust try you becomes unshakeable trust yes of

99
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:43,040
course i'm giving my heart to this i've given my heart to this so

100
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:50,320
so trust or faith i will use that word faith there's a sense of faith

101
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,160
that gets developed after a while after a while and a sense of confidence

102
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,360
confidence in yourself i like the word confidence somehow

103
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,120
sometimes it might feel a little intellectual and yet it can also feel

104
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,399
embodied a sense of ah confidence in the heart i like to point

105
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:19,759
in the heart center but sense of confidence like yes trust confidence

106
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:27,279
so it could be that actually these different terms these different translations such as inspiration for

107
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:33,200
example it can refer to the earlier um to the bright trust like ah

108
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:39,200
inspiration and then later it becomes maybe again we can

109
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,600
i can wax philosophical about all these terms but maybe after a while when it becomes

110
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:52,000
unshakable trust there's it's actually faith that that translation works better for it

111
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,440
but maybe at first inspiration works better as a translation of sadha

112
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,959
maybe later borrow trust verify trust confidence as one of the

113
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:11,440
translations and then unshakeable trust or faith just putting the cards on the table at the

114
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,760
end so so trust is needed it is needed

115
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:26,639
and in fact if it wasn't for trust we wouldn't be here right now practicing together because

116
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:33,839
the buddha after his awakening the story goes that he didn't want to

117
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,680
teach he didn't want to teach he thought oh the dharma is

118
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:48,480
i can't teach this people won't get it why why do i bother and and he was asked

119
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,600
by his friends his his the the five disciples by his first five friends

120
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,480
no please please they're bonte dear sir there will be people with little dust in

121
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,680
their eyes with little dust in their eyes who will understand

122
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,639
who will understand the dharma so he trusted that there are people with

123
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:19,199
little dust in their eyes that yes there might be other people who

124
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:26,880
won't understand won't listen won't get it but that's okay trusting that there will be people with

125
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:33,120
little trust in their eyes who would understand and that's such a beautiful metaphor little does we

126
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,800
we all have dust we little dust isn't that great it doesn't say people with no dust in their eyes yeah

127
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:45,120
little does we still don't see clearly we have confusion and delusion and you know all that

128
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:52,320
um you know hatred ill will and attachment yeah your little dust but still

129
00:14:53,040 --> 00:15:00,480
to see the dharma to see the beauty the beauty of these teachings the beauty of this path that can open us up in these

130
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,920
profound ways so thanks to his trust to

131
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:13,760
to have shared what he discovered here we are so and of course

132
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:20,959
going even further had he had not had he uh had no trust in his ability in his

133
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:27,199
own um in his own being etc etc all the inner trust and faith in

134
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:33,759
him actually sitting under the bodhi tree and saying i'm not going to get get up until i'm awakened all that trust

135
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:39,519
all that sense of confidence that that really went through his own

136
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,839
discovery and and to think that he wasn't a god figure he was a human being just like

137
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:52,000
us the same dna and a human being just like us

138
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:00,880
so so with with the idea of of trust or sadha sada

139
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:07,440
um in this tradition it's it's often invited

140
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,720
for the triple jewel so i want to say a little bit about that

141
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:19,600
as i referred to trust in buddha dharma sangha earlier so what does that mean let's decode it a little bit

142
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,519
because we can take it by face value oh yeah trust in buddha this human being that

143
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:32,720
existed trust in the dharma the writings and the teachings or trust in the sangha the the

144
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,199
community of practitioners now and in the past so yes that's absolutely one way

145
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:45,680
to to interpret it and yet and yet

146
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,759
there is a much more profound i would say deeper another dimension

147
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:57,680
for our hearts to open to what actually this idea of trust in the triple jewel means

148
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:05,438
for us to have a meaningful even more meaningful um even more

149
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,160
meaningful personal relationship to it

150
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:16,000
so first and foremost trust in the buddha

151
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,520
in addition to the historical figure but the buddha within

152
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:31,039
to trust that this being right here is not broken

153
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:39,440
or damaged goods or bad that trusting that you are inherently

154
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:45,919
you are inherently good you're inherently lovable you're inherently loved

155
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:51,919
completely loved beyond all the imaginations beyond

156
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:58,160
all the ways that you judge yourself so trusting in the buddha nature

157
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,240
trusting in the goodness in your capacity for awakening that yes

158
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,640
you too i too it's it's here it's here and

159
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,160
it's a trust that above it's above and beyond the personhood

160
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:24,240
it's trust in something that's above and beyond what you can control so much

161
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:30,160
yes there are things that we can do practices and we do our best we do our part we do

162
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:38,000
we hold our end of the bargain and trusting that the other part something that's above and beyond

163
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,840
what we can fathom control that yes there's this goodness

164
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:55,360
so trusting having faith fully trusting giving our heart to

165
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,600
giving our heart to giving our heart to

166
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,720
the goodness the beauty that shines and trust it's here trust it's here

167
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:15,120
even if at times we can't see it or it gets lost trusting that it's here

168
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:27,039
the second of the triple jewel the dharma trusting in the dharma

169
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:34,320
yes the amazing teachings the poly canon all of this

170
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,760
that's passed down yes this is pretty awesome and yet

171
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:47,760
another way of relating to it another way of relating to it is

172
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,559
trusting the lawful the lawful unfolding

173
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,200
of of the universe of the world this the the lawful unfolding it's it's unfolding

174
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,440
according to laws according to to order that i don't

175
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:16,880
understand i don't understand but i trust but i trust

176
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,480
i trust it's goodness i trust it's goodness

177
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:30,000
and this is something that has been brought this this importance of this trusting this

178
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:37,679
this the universe the lawful nature of universe we see that both in in here in this practice and

179
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:44,080
so many different practices that it's important to to make that choice

180
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,720
albert einstein my hero one of my heroes puts it

181
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:57,360
quite beautifully actually that one of the most important lessons or one of the

182
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:04,400
most important decisions that we make in our lives is to decide

183
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:11,280
whether the universe is a good

184
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:20,480
is whether there's goodness in the universe whether we trust it or whether it's neither good nor bad

185
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:27,520
that god is playing dice with the universe is what he said or that it's actually unfriendly we

186
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,120
don't trust it he said this is the most important decision we need to make because

187
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:40,799
if we decide that the the the universe the lawful nature

188
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:48,080
the nature in its lawful ways there is not goodness in it it's there there's

189
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:55,120
ill will and we don't trust it then we use all

190
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:02,080
our might we use all our science all our energy in order to to defend ourselves destroy it there's a

191
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:09,360
sense of distrust that that comes up and we don't revere we don't appreciate

192
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,720
nature etc if we if we think that that the world universe dharma is

193
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:24,559
neither filled with goodness nor nor it will but it's kind of like ah

194
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:32,159
it's random random random then then he suggested that we end up

195
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:38,559
kind of feeling lost and nihilistic like uh whatever what's the point it's

196
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:45,520
it's all random and yet the third choice if we have a sense of trust

197
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:52,400
in the goodness and we can choose to do that if we have a sense of trust in the goodness

198
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:59,360
of the natural laws then we use our science our minds our

199
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,799
hearts to defend to defend it to support it to love it to

200
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:10,799
um and and we actually will be happier ourselves it turns out there are

201
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:18,640
studies or psychological studies that point to how both personal

202
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:25,440
or personal as well as societal happiness is linked to the level of trust

203
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:31,039
wow who would know who would know

204
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:39,039
that trust is related to both personal and societal happiness and it turns out societies that are more

205
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:44,720
trusting and of course than personal persons who are more trusting

206
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:51,600
there is more happiness more well-being and also there's links between kindness

207
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:58,159
that can actually increase level of trust and happiness so kindness

208
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:05,200
some there's a study that suggests that it's um works

209
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,720
as a link between trust and happiness so random acts of kindness maybe try this

210
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,760
out don't take my word for it don't take the research of this researcher don't

211
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,279
take their results first see what happens if you if in some relationship for example or in some

212
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:30,159
community you start doing acts of kindness random acts of kindness to to notice over time how that might shift

213
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:37,760
how that might shift the the link between the happiness and the trust in between

214
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:43,520
this community and this relationship and there are also more studies about

215
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:50,080
the connection between trust and oxytocin and how it modulates fear depression

216
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:55,840
it's it's absolutely fascinating trust giving our hearts to giving our hearts

217
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:03,679
to so the third of the triple jewel being the sangha again as i was

218
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:10,320
relating to it having this sense of trust in basic human goodness and humanity and

219
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:18,240
people around you with you and humanity at large that even if people are expressing their

220
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:24,799
anger frustration and in the will that that there's still common humanity there is but in nature

221
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:31,039
in every single being and in fact every time you get into a car you're trusting

222
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:36,159
in the basic goodness of humanity there is this this social

223
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:42,320
trust that okay i'm going to stay in my lane you're going to stay in your life we're going to do our best and of course your

224
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,480
things could happen but you're going to do your best i'm going to do my best it's kind of a sense of a trust

225
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:54,880
if there was no trust in the world nothing would would ever happen get done

226
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,679
so much more i can say about that but but time is short so

227
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,200
so as a practice

228
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:15,039
trust can serve so in so many ways it can serve us in so

229
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:22,640
many ways and i invite you to to explore and discover it for yourself

230
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:30,159
in one way that it can show up is as an antidote to anxiety fear and

231
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,559
worry

232
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:43,039
and the practice could be trusting trusting that it's okay so if in this

233
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,480
moment anxiety arises having a sense of

234
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:55,440
perhaps spaciousness like actually can i trust that it's okay this

235
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:02,880
anxiety can be here but it can be held in a wider perspective trusting that it's okay no matter what

236
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:10,400
it's okay ah trust trusting in the okainess no matter what

237
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:18,000
similarly with fear which is often future oriented um i had this experience recently a

238
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,120
thought came up thinking and i felt a tightness in my chest oh

239
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:31,600
ouch what if this thing happens then i thought what came up for me was um

240
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:38,480
i trust that it'll be okay no matter what even if this thing awful

241
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:44,799
thing happens it'll still be okay there's a basic okayness and

242
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:50,159
and oh it just it just released to release the sense of

243
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:57,039
the sense of fear or worry and in fact awakening

244
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:04,320
nibana nirvana one of the translations is fearlessness and this is the path of

245
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,919
fearlessness where there is no fear no matter what happens

246
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:16,320
what or what is happening like whether we deem it to be good bad

247
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,960
if we take ourself out of it with in a bigger sense of spaciousness

248
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,080
and having unshakable trust that gets developed as we practice

249
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:33,679
more and more and more this sense of fearlessness no matter what there's

250
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,720
nothing to fear because nothing can truly happen

251
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:44,720
to you and i'll say that it may not make sense but there's

252
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,720
nothing that truly can happen to you if that's you it's all okay

253
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:58,159
you're really okay it's all okay and i'll drop drop that in as a zen koan

254
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,480
which i fully believe and i'll leave that be as huh and i won't try to explain it

255
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:11,520
because it's not one of those things to be explained it's it's to be experienced

256
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:19,600
and one last thing you know it's about um you know you've said fake it till you

257
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:27,520
become it well fake it till you make it but i like to say fake it till you become it see what happens if you bring in

258
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,799
trust if you bring interest if you practice it if you practice it

259
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:40,559
until you become it you really become it so what do you lay your heart upon

260
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:48,080
what do you trust and i thank you all i thank you for

261
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:54,799
showing up in the best way you've been able to we've been able to

262
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,399
showing up for ourselves for those we love for all beings

263
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:06,640
everywhere may all beings be happy may all beings

264
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:12,880
have fearlessness may all beings be free

265
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,469
