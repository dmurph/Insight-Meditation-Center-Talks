1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:08,400
so good morning uh good afternoon welcome uh to to all of you

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,519
i see there's a watermark on the uh

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:21,359
the video um where i'm i'm running the youtube and so using my zoom account and

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:27,199
uh david geffen gave i think a quarter billion dollars to

5
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:35,840
ucla and so you get your name on imc's zoom feed uh for that kind of sum

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,320
uh anyway um happy to be uh to be with you

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,960
to be sitting together and um um

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,399
yeah maybe i'll just say say a word before we sit um

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,600
a mentor of mine we'll do some some we'll settle in do some

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,560
meta practice loving kindness practice mentor of mine um

11
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,640
said matthew there's a difference between

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,280
kindness and niceness and you're being nice

13
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:31,119
so um yeah meta is not

14
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:38,159
niceness you know it's a deeper kindness and it's not pretending

15
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,000
it's not pretending we have to be very careful about

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,200
pretending to feel one thing when we're feeling another in our practice

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:02:00,000
because um when we pretend it erodes some confidence in

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,119
our path in ourselves our heart is very sensitive to the

19
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,560
misalignment of of pretending

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:18,080
and so we're never asked to pretend yeah we're never asked to pretend

21
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:26,000
um this is about um

22
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,440
an authentic encounter with our own heart and there's some way to connect with

23
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,959
what's actually here in an authentic way there was some one

24
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:46,160
of the brahmaviharas is here for you yeah one of them is always here for you

25
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,080
and so there's never a need to pretend to turn kindness into niceness or

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,120
something like this so um

27
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,720
let's uh let's sit together

28
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:43,159
it's a spirit of kindness towards your own body

29
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,280
the astounding number of things it's doing right

30
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,040
in this moment even if our attention goes

31
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,719
to uh what feels like it's doing wrong

32
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,680
one of my teachers said the your body your body

33
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,320
is done

34
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:55,120
generosity some kind of gift

35
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,319
your body is donna

36
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:24,160
maybe this begins to open your heart

37
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:36,759
as we settle breathe as we do his first couple minutes

38
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:33,959
um that is love in the face of goodness

39
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,600
so we can attune

40
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,800
to our own our own goodness

41
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,680
it's not grandiose or something the goodness

42
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:21,279
is we might detect is nothing we would want to brag about it's a goodness that

43
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:27,920
softens our heart maybe it's a goodness that you overlook

44
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,519
always in yourself

45
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,760
i promise this is not a self-indulgent

46
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,200
kind of uh affirmation

47
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:39,200
the more deeply we sense in and appreciate and abide in our

48
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,640
own goodness more obvious that becomes in the eyes of

49
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,640
others

50
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,680
so we consider our goodness

51
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:26,320
maybe rest in the kind of heart center your chest

52
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,360
and pulsating feeling life

53
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,879
of maybe a little bit of warmth

54
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,600
a little softening

55
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,920
a little bit of love

56
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:08,600
and just stay with the signs of love and care and softening

57
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:40,079
so when we silently whisper to ourselves

58
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,079
we would be happy

59
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:54,560
it's really not a prayer about some future that may come

60
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,720
it is a way of touching into the heart right now

61
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:11,038
of ringing a bell and then listening to the reverberations in your body

62
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,798
softening your body making your

63
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,480
body more porous

64
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,720
we are moved by our own goodness

65
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:43,639
moved by the innocence of our own longing to be happy

66
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,400
foreign

67
00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:00,320
maybe it's useful to use a words

68
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,760
images

69
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,240
maybe happy

70
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,440
i be safe protected

71
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:34,600
man live with ease

72
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,080
we start to drop some of the vigilance

73
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,559
the vigilance of patrolling ourself the vigilance

74
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,120
of arrogance the vigilance of self-hatred

75
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,919
we drop all of that

76
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,520
maybe right now it's safe enough

77
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,000
to be moved by your own goodness

78
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,559
to abide in this kind of quiet love

79
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:39,600
you don't offer yourself this meta because of something

80
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:46,360
you just offer that

81
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,480
foreign

82
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:42,080
so um it's nice too nice to practice with you

83
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:48,080
you know i i know i said ever pretend in your practice something

84
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:53,520
like that but then you know what i thought of i thought of carol wilson saying

85
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:59,760
fake meta is better than real aversion any day

86
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:06,799
yeah that stuck with me that's true yeah

87
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:12,640
but um kind of kidding aside uh i do

88
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:20,960
feel like we want to be careful about pretending and sometimes the brahmavahara realm

89
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:28,320
feels like a zone where we're being enlisted to pretend something

90
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:35,919
and the heart rebels against that sense of in authenticity

91
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:42,159
and so the encouragement is to find find our own

92
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:48,240
ways like how can we have this really intimate encounter with the moment

93
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:56,240
and find ways of practicing that um that feel real alive true

94
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:03,039
so um the

95
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:07,440
the buddha said that um

96
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:16,960
suggested that that fear and wanting are two sides of the same coin

97
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:24,720
the coin of uh of clinging yeah and uh sometimes i don't i don't

98
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,960
like to kind of trot out neuroscience so often but sometimes i

99
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,880
read something that reminds me a lot of dharma

100
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,960
so the point is not to get the science exactly but to hear the resonance with

101
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:49,440
what this tradition offers is uh shelley warlow and um

102
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:56,159
her colleague ken barrage so motivational salience can occur with

103
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:02,159
either positive valence as incentive or negative valence as fear

104
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,440
and it's possible to flip the valence between the two forms under some

105
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,720
conditions despite being affectively opposite the

106
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,039
two may still share some neural and psychological features

107
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:25,440
normally both may engage mesolimbic systems including dopamine

108
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,399
signals in the nucleus accumbens consistent with an amygdala role in

109
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:38,799
bivalent positive and negative motivational salients

110
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:45,200
some neurons can respond to both aversive outcomes or rewarding outcomes or to their

111
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:53,360
predictive cues rather than strictly encoding only reward or fear per se some neurons might

112
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,960
integrate sensory information context and motivational state

113
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:05,039
to assign motivational salience with positive or negative valence

114
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:12,480
to particular targets making them either wanted or feared

115
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:22,638
wanting and fear they seem about as far apart as possible

116
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:28,960
but maybe they're closer siblings than they might

117
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,960
appear

118
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:41,679
um scientist k tai she says uh fear has an authoritarian

119
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:48,079
command over the rest of the brain [Music] and tiknot han said

120
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,119
fearlessness is the ultimate joy

121
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:02,160
and so meta practices heart practice is really um

122
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,480
about stepping out of wanting and stepping out of fear

123
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,440
and sometimes we step out of that and there's just love

124
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,119
but um but sometimes meta practice of course is um

125
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:31,400
we step out of wanting and fear by getting really close to it

126
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:37,599
so anxiety depends

127
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:43,839
uh on avoidance to some measure the medicine

128
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:50,320
around anxiety is actually to approach the feared experience we drain

129
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:56,720
the affective emotional charge from our anxiety and avoidance

130
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,079
by doing the opposite by moving towards and mindfulness

131
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:08,720
is one way of moving towards it's an approach

132
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,400
orientation all of mindfulness is an approach orientation

133
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:20,000
we permit our pain into awareness

134
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:26,640
but in a sense love is like the fullest approach we can

135
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:34,079
make with our pain with our love we get we get so

136
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:40,720
close to what is unresolved in our heart that we begin

137
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:47,519
to habituate to it and that pain loses some of its

138
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:55,839
electrical charge we start to uh

139
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:02,079
the the met uh actually starts to be a way of of digesting

140
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:10,240
digesting fear this was you know one of the the classical ways that that uh meta is

141
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,599
prescribed for fear

142
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:23,599
we're stepping out of of of fear and and out of uh

143
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:31,839
wanting or controlling right because we know there is attached

144
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:37,440
love you know a love that includes some measure of possessiveness

145
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,720
and and there's a love that is a pure giving

146
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,880
no controlling yeah and attach love that sounds bad in

147
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:55,839
buddhist spheres right but it's okay like we're gonna have to pick our spots i feel

148
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:04,240
as humans maybe especially as lay people people with with partners or children

149
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:10,480
parents and commitments some measure of

150
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,839
attachment is i think

151
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:22,240
inevitable i i saw a friend um i've known for

152
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:30,000
for many years now and i've known his daughter who's now 13 since since her birth

153
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,640
and um and i asked asked him you know how how are you

154
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,400
and he quoted i think it's susan orlean uh the writer

155
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:49,040
um he said um a parent is only as happy as their least

156
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:55,280
happy child and i don't even have kids but i know

157
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,960
enough to just be touched by that sentiment you

158
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,200
know okay yeah only as happy as a

159
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:14,480
least happy child you know some measure of uh

160
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:21,119
i don't know what we want to call that the complexities of these bonds these

161
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:27,520
karmically rich bonds with people that i don't think can be

162
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,880
purified of all clinging or something like that can we consent to that can we

163
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,240
bear that with grace

164
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,599
and and we cultivate

165
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,960
the love that is without conditions uh

166
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:56,480
that is um a warmth without control or possession

167
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,599
the warmth the kindness of of metta

168
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:08,720
which is a kind of simple friendliness and kindness while wishing

169
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:14,240
the proximate cause being seeing the goodness seeing goodness love in the

170
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,280
face of goodness

171
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,720
this is an image of a mother cow

172
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:31,200
gazing at her calf and

173
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:37,960
sometimes we're the mother cow sometimes with a cow

174
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:47,760
but we we sense goodness yeah there is well wishing

175
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:54,480
and just for me amidst this this kind of cycle of um

176
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,599
of grieving you know i've become so sensitive to

177
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,920
goodness like

178
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:10,160
just just little bits of it that i see in others you know

179
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:15,359
uh if i'm gonna cry that's what's gonna make me do it goodness is gonna make me

180
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:22,800
cry and um a phenomena in

181
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,400
in uh psychology known as moral elevation where witnessing

182
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,440
good witness and goodness yeah witnessing acts of moral beauty

183
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:40,960
inspires and elevates us and we become more devoted to goodness in seeing it we

184
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,160
become the kind of wholesome pro-social

185
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:53,760
um movement of our own heart is drawn out by witnessing it right we become very

186
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,560
this practice makes us very sensitive to goodness

187
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,160
and lovingkindness is being moved by your own goodness

188
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,520
it's being moved by it it's not the goodness we put on

189
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:18,640
our resume or something yeah and as i said in the the sid it's not

190
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:25,119
even like well i'll offer this love like because of yeah you get into the because

191
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:32,640
of and then there's always the contradictory whatever you know you get

192
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:41,520
into debates about worthiness and deserving and all this and it's like no no no not because of i'm just offering

193
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:49,040
care yeah being moved moved by your own goodness

194
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:57,440
and to abide in this is um very healing very healing and

195
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:05,759
not self-indulgent it will connect us more deeply with all beings

196
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:12,760
and a sense of of warmth of

197
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,319
radiating from our heart there's sometimes just so we get quiet there's

198
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:26,640
nothing but warmth there's nothing on the other side of our love and emerging from that emerging from

199
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:33,119
that it really dramatizes the pain of

200
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:40,720
hatred of divisiveness of separation of aversion

201
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:48,960
hatred becomes less and less tenable less and less terrible

202
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:56,400
and so sometimes metta is abiding in love and

203
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:03,119
sometimes it is lowering our our resistance bringing

204
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:09,680
love to what needs love because um the truth of dukkha

205
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:17,200
that needs to be mourned for a long time and that takes love

206
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,119
it really is um often

207
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:29,520
almost unbelievable that the young human is like this

208
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:38,560
being human is like this it's gonna take some love to open to

209
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:46,640
and and the meta practice it helps kind of

210
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:54,079
um sometimes we just cannot feel something until the love thaws out something in

211
00:44:54,079 --> 00:45:00,640
our heart and so in these ways meta is is both a

212
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:06,640
it's a purification practice and it's a practice of cultivation

213
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:12,079
many many blessings of meta

214
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:21,200
so stop and um

215
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,800
yeah i wish you all um much uh much goodness today yeah

216
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,160
let us let us be attuned to the signs of goodness in ourselves and others

217
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:39,000
open our heart to that today okay thank you
