1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:10,160
greetings everyone I'm delighted to be here with you again

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:19,740
I the theme um for this week is tastes of freedom

3
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,560
and uh yesterday um

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:33,140
we explored feeling and tasting as a way of putting in place

5
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:39,260
conditions that open the door to Freedom

6
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,500
today will evoke the power and the protection

7
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,039
of creating conditions of what's called or usually translated into English as

8
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,360
seclusion viveca and Pali

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,500
yesterday um when we were talking about

10
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:20,040
the key to the path to Freedom the door to Freedom

11
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,060
I talked about the dangers of

12
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:34,560
giving the reactive mind the upper hand of wanting more of

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:43,460
what we desire or what's Pleasant grasping or wanting to push away

14
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:52,078
um what we don't like what we're aversive to what is unpleasant

15
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,460
and so those two conditions are two of the most important factors and and the

16
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:05,159
Buddha able instructions on how to do meditations on these factors

17
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,160
but there's a third one so in addition to Pleasant I want more

18
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:18,599
or unpleasant get me out of here there's also neither Pleasant nor

19
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:24,980
unpleasant which is sometimes called neutral

20
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,739
and this one is a bit hard to describe the

21
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:36,780
flavor of or how it feels because we're not sure how it feels we're not sure if

22
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,599
it's Pleasant or unpleasant there's a there's kind of an element of maybe confusion

23
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:49,379
in uh that third um feeling tone of neither

24
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:57,120
Pleasant nor unpleasant and what this is pointing to is that all

25
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,660
three of the feeling tones Pleasant unpleasant and neither

26
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:08,940
are in response to what is often called in the

27
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,599
polytexts the three poisons

28
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,739
and these are serious poisons these are really what uh put the roadblocks in the

29
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:28,280
way for us on the path to Awakening

30
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:36,080
they are greed eight and delusion

31
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:46,860
so if we want to be independent in our practice

32
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:54,200
we have to overcome our uh instinctive

33
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,640
response to whatever comes in the sense doors

34
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:08,099
it's almost it's simultaneous as soon as it comes in the Mind knows or categorizes it

35
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:13,819
as pleasant unpleasant or neither

36
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:20,220
and so what we're dealing with is

37
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:27,720
um in each of these three poisons of course there's a very very very broad spectrum

38
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:34,080
on how they might appear in our consciousness

39
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:42,540
um if we haven't practiced very much uh we might be just extremely reactive

40
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:48,840
uh by Nature and um yeah and you know as soon as

41
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:53,880
something slightly unpleasant arises you know we're already

42
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,180
in in uh uh

43
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:04,440
Fleet Mountain getting bling mode

44
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:11,880
and if something uh delicious comes up then we're just already before we even

45
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:21,300
know it we're off on some fantasy but if what arises uh is neither

46
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:26,759
Pleasant nor unpleasant then we're not sure how to respond and

47
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:34,099
this is exactly what the poison of delusion is all about

48
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:40,320
that we don't know what is wholesome and unwholesome

49
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:48,240
we haven't learned to discern uh which way we should go at the fork in

50
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,580
the road that is in front of us in virtually each moment

51
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:02,880
so a lot of this path is about uh cultivating our capacity

52
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,960
or Discerning the wholesome and the unwholesome so that we know which way to

53
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:17,479
go when something like um green or hatred comes up

54
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:28,340
so to begin with

55
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:34,880
uh take your meditation posture

56
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:42,539
and then feel the connection of the body with

57
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:49,340
whatever you're sitting on or lying on or standing on

58
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,840
and then let your roots go deep down into the Earth

59
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,220
giving you a sense of stability

60
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:18,180
and drawing on this groundedness in the posture

61
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:26,940
we can begin to explore a little road trip through the body

62
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:34,380
by scanning from the feet to the crown of the head

63
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:42,060
little by little and every time we direct our awareness to a certain part

64
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,639
of the body we also use that moment to see if there

65
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:55,020
might be something there that we could relax a little bit or

66
00:07:55,020 --> 00:08:04,280
soften letting go of tensions as we go along

67
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,500
so closing the eyes

68
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:18,000
and inviting our awareness into the feet

69
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,199
is there something there that we can let go of a little bit

70
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:33,680
and the same with moving up the lower legs

71
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:37,219
the upper legs

72
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:47,760
and the hips the Basin the pelvis the connection of the pelvis

73
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:55,760
with our support and with the Earth

74
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:07,019
sometimes the endings in the hip joint

75
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:15,200
and they get stuck and it's very useful

76
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,940
to let them grow go a little bit

77
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:28,880
and then bringing the awareness to the belly

78
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:37,140
and then it's called the Harlot and in Zen practice this is the center

79
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:43,620
of gravity for us physically but also as the center

80
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:50,060
of where we um invite the mind

81
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:59,940
so can we let the belly relax a little bit let it all hang out slightly

82
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,760
nobody's looking at us doesn't matter

83
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:14,120
and then gently moving up through the diaphragm

84
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:18,079
and Into the Heart area

85
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:28,339
how does it feel in there in your heart center

86
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:38,360
of a pleasant feeling or warmth and

87
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:48,560
bowing Maybe or perhaps an unpleasant feeling because

88
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:56,060
you just lost a loved one and

89
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:03,720
that's where your heart center is at now is doing The Grieving that it needs to

90
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:10,140
do and so we make friends with whatever

91
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:14,899
arises in our hearts

92
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,500
not needing to push anything away in order to be able to meditate

93
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,639
then coming up the spine

94
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:39,720
to the shoulder blades and if you can letting the shoulders

95
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,339
themselves would drop a little bit

96
00:11:53,160 --> 00:12:00,800
inviting awareness into the upper arms the elbows

97
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:07,440
lower arms wrists and

98
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,959
fingers softening as we go

99
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,399
releasing as we go

100
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,140
now bring your awareness to

101
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:34,200
the head area and check to see if your head is well

102
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:41,420
balanced at the top of your spine

103
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:47,279
so that it doesn't require any extra energy

104
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:53,760
to keep your head upright it does require some

105
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:01,320
wakefulness but there's no physical constraint

106
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:09,139
in having an erect posture

107
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:17,720
if they had aligned with the heart and the belly and the Earth

108
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:27,800
what's it like inside the head area

109
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,060
what's it like in the thinking muscle

110
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:44,600
is it active is it producing stories or

111
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,899
living in the past or living in the future

112
00:13:53,279 --> 00:14:02,940
and if so the invitation is to say to that mind that loves stories

113
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:11,180
and distractions say okay I see you but not now

114
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:16,220
I'm going to stay with their breath

115
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,500
and I'm coming to the jaw

116
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,940
listening the lips

117
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:40,220
the cheeks all around the eyes

118
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,540
forehead the scalp

119
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,699
softness

120
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:05,579
to the extent possible and if you find tensions in the body by

121
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:11,940
all means don't berate yourself for that because that will only make things worse

122
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:19,079
so if something is really tight and you can't seem to do anything about it

123
00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:25,220
and be friends with that practice with that

124
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:41,160
and now egg a long deep

125
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:47,880
inhale feeling the whole length of the inhale

126
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:54,120
as you do it and then as you exhale

127
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:00,420
long bound release

128
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:12,540
and now all you have to do is stay with the cycle of the brush

129
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:20,420
simple right yeah simple but not so easy

130
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:26,699
so when the mind wanders off

131
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:33,660
as Minds tend to do then we try to catch that before we're

132
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:39,660
we've been in some kind of a fantasy for 10 minutes or

133
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:47,279
we've been in some sort of recrimination about the past

134
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:54,480
is going on and on and it's not the first time we've been through this particular screenplay

135
00:16:55,259 --> 00:16:58,879
we just say no thank you

136
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:09,500
so just as we leave our shoes outside the door when we come into our meditation area

137
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:17,819
we leave our thoughts responsibilities lands

138
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:25,520
deceptions and stories out there with issues

139
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:35,100
and to the extent we can we stay stay with

140
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:44,299
the cycle of the breath fully present for the inhale

141
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:58,880
holy present for the out hail and for those little spaces in between

142
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:12,600
and if you should find that there's at the corners of your mouth

143
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:19,380
burned up a little bit into a half smile or even better the corners of your eyes

144
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:22,640
and a half smile

145
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,860
these use that as an entry

146
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:38,220
into a pleasant feeling for your meditation

147
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,700
that's really not only permitted but encouraged

148
00:19:15,179 --> 00:19:17,659
oh

149
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:24,720
being able to sit here in our spot

150
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,100
on this beautiful planet

151
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,340
the Buddha talked about the place he sat as his

152
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:42,059
body mandala where he picture a beautiful mandala

153
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:49,280
on the ground and body of course means enlightenment

154
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:59,340
their connection with the Earth and then connection with their breath

155
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:06,120
allow you to inhabit this mandala

156
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,260
of Awakening

157
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:21,120
keeping ourselves secluded from the three poisons of greed hate and

158
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:28,278
delusion secluded from

159
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,039
reactivity

160
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,059
to our experience

161
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:46,460
we can be protected by this seclusion

162
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:57,679
and nurtured in a way that opens the doors

163
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:03,559
or putting in place the conditions

164
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,320
that lead to Awakening

165
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:43,400
and as we come to the end of this meditation

166
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:49,740
let's take a few moments to

167
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:58,700
open our hearts through all beings everywhere

168
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,658
any of whom are suffering

169
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:13,320
many of whom are caught in delusional reactivity

170
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:22,100
or in oppressive greed or in dishonest hatred

171
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:32,340
and let us offer the benefits

172
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,900
of our practice in all directions

173
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,740
may all beings be safe

174
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:57,740
and feeling that sense of safety may all beings be contented

175
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:07,860
with contentment we don't need anything else

176
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:15,019
so with that in all beings be peaceful

177
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:26,120
and may all beings everywhere be free

178
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,969
[Music]

179
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:42,690
[Music]

180
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,739
[Music]

181
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,660
[Music]

182
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,620
thank you

183
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:35,399
greetings everyone lovely to be here with you again

184
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:43,679
and I just I'd like to just let you know that I'm not able to see your comments

185
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:51,360
in the chat on YouTube or in Zoom but they are very welcome indeed and I

186
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:58,640
will be able to see them after uh finishing the teaching

187
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:00,799
um

188
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:10,679
so the theme for this week is tastes of freedom

189
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:17,820
and last week Ying Chen talked about the

190
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:24,120
multifaceted multi-dimensional aspect

191
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,740
of the path of practice

192
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:36,000
and she read some stories from Gill's little Anthology the monastery

193
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,760
Within and of course the these the monastery

194
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:47,100
within is a is a metaphor and

195
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:53,760
it's a metaphor for our practice

196
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:00,799
and that the seat of our practice is inside

197
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:07,740
we don't have to go to some Monastery off in the mountains to

198
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:12,779
[Music] no seclusion

199
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:19,860
to be protected we have everything we need to awaken

200
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:25,039
right here in this body and mind

201
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,179
that's quite amazing

202
00:32:30,059 --> 00:32:36,779
and the theme for this week is tastes of freedom

203
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:43,679
so as as I've shared before um the path to Freedom

204
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,620
is your past there's no carbon copy

205
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:57,779
there's you can of course uh see from people you admire how you'd

206
00:32:57,779 --> 00:33:03,179
like to practice that doesn't mean you can do it

207
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:11,220
I met um children Suzuki roshi when I was only 21 years old and very troubled young

208
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:17,760
girl and um and yet

209
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,960
it was abundantly clear that

210
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:31,559
he incarnated Awakening and so that's kind of a mystery you know

211
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:37,279
how how does that happen um

212
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:45,179
so for many of us uh

213
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:51,899
um in this tradition the vipassana tradition in the terravada tradition

214
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:58,799
um the Buddha does not teach the importance of sudden enlightenment

215
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:06,679
sometimes his his uh in person disciples monks and nuns and

216
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:11,820
amen and women uh did

217
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:19,980
um wake up quickly when they heard him speak or when he was giving them a an instruction specifically for them

218
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:25,520
but you know most of us in the last 2600 years

219
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:33,780
we actually have to figure it out for ourselves and it's a gradual path

220
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:40,138
and so this gradual path also means

221
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:48,480
gradual Awakening which is why even before we become

222
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,618
enlightened and are free

223
00:34:54,659 --> 00:35:01,400
free from suffering brief read hate and delusion

224
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:09,780
totally free than that that's usually for most of us at the end

225
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:15,060
of a very long dedicated practice

226
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,140
but even at a very early stage when we're

227
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:29,520
just beginning it's possible to have tastes of this freedom

228
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:36,300
and that's what I'm trying to share with you this week through these teachings

229
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:43,220
so in the theme of uh tastes of freedom

230
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:50,220
yesterday we explored feeling and tasting

231
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:57,920
as a way of putting in place the conditions that open the door to Freedom

232
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:05,280
and this requires very very very dedicated mindfulness

233
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,119
so as you may know in the factors of Awakening the very first one is

234
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:17,520
mindfulness or perhaps better translated as awareness

235
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,820
so on the whole path as we walk it

236
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:30,960
where we place our awareness is going to determine

237
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,240
how we find our way

238
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,720
so uh you may have heard the story of

239
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:49,500
somebody said uh you know he's walking along and

240
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:58,520
um and there's people in front who are uh about to give the Deep ditches on each side and

241
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:04,140
one person was just about to fall into the ditch on the right and

242
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:11,099
he'd say go to the left go to the left and then somebody else was about to fall

243
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:18,540
into the ditch on the left and he'd say go to the right go to the right so there's not a

244
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:26,220
uh an answer to how we walk this path

245
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:32,280
that is not contingent upon Where We Are and what our mindset is

246
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,980
so it's really um a big job for us to get to know

247
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:43,020
ourselves and I think also

248
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:47,119
um to befriend ourselves

249
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:53,760
you know if you're um trying to

250
00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:00,599
train a young puppy and it's an adorable puppy you know puppies are adorable

251
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:08,460
um if you yell at your puppy and it's cold them uh severely and kick them and

252
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:13,740
just you know uh severe training

253
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:21,720
they're going to grow up to be uh and unhappy and maybe vicious dog

254
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:29,339
on the other hand if you give your puppy rewards instead of uh

255
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:36,599
beating them or kicking them or yelling at them then you'll end up with a dog that

256
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:42,420
enjoys being in your presence and will do anything you ask

257
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:49,380
because they're so happy to be with you so you know we need to to train our

258
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:55,560
minds the way um a skilled drug trainer would train a

259
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:03,599
puppy so vinegar doesn't work

260
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:09,480
um but sweetness is is a pretty good strategy

261
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:17,000
and um in uh

262
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:22,520
the the vest probably can and um there is

263
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:28,020
everything that Scholars have have analyzed there is one meditation

264
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:35,040
practice that most Scholars are very confident that the Buddha actually practiced

265
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:42,078
himself and that is mindfulness of breathing

266
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:52,020
and also when the Buddha describes

267
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:58,920
his Awakening and uh coming out of that he describes

268
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:05,400
um he describes the mindfulness of breathing

269
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:11,280
and so this is this is the practice that's not appropriate for everybody in

270
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,339
the world uh if someone has

271
00:40:16,339 --> 00:40:24,359
nearly uh drowned or nearly suffocated to death uh

272
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:30,000
they might be too scared of the breath to want to go there you know not having enough breath

273
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,640
so uh it's not a hundred percent pertinent for all practitioners

274
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:41,460
awareness of their breathing but it is uh

275
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:47,579
it is a what's a Buddha

276
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:53,900
taught and practice themselves more than anything else

277
00:40:55,140 --> 00:41:02,160
um so if we read the anapana satisuta which

278
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:09,839
is majima 118 uh it begins uh and and I'll read it to

279
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:16,079
you uh it's it's from my own translation um

280
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:21,599
what the Buddha says before he even starts to give instructions so in the

281
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:28,020
prologue there's a beautiful description of the setting and the monks all being

282
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:33,180
um and nuns being ready for these teachings

283
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:38,880
and then when he's beginning to give his instructions

284
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:46,020
this is what we need to pay attention to he says here

285
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:51,320
a practitioner gone to the forest

286
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:01,619
so far from noisy villages through the base of a tree

287
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:08,040
or to someplace empty sits down

288
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:14,339
in their meditation posture placing the body straight

289
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:19,980
having established mindfulness awareness

290
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:25,760
in front as the first priority

291
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:33,660
so we we could do um you know a whole two-week Retreat just on this one instruction at the

292
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:39,660
beginning of the anupanasati but it's it's very profound

293
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:45,000
and um so

294
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,040
before we even sit down we're cultivating emptiness

295
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:55,500
we are looking for seclusion from distractions

296
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:00,960
we're going to some remote place and when

297
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:08,579
our mindfulness is perfectly uh in place and well established then we

298
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:13,700
know we are sitting on our body mandala

299
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:21,240
um even the word forest in ballet aranya

300
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:26,640
the literal meaning so it is remoteness

301
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,740
so I think that all these instructions have

302
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:37,500
a lot to do with their uh metaphoric meaning

303
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:42,960
that yes it's it's good to go out in the middle of the forest but even more important

304
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,440
it's crucial to be secluded from our

305
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:53,760
distractions and so we wrap ourselves in this cozy

306
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,859
cloak or shawl of seclusion

307
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:06,900
vivecta and that's that that ability to stay

308
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:12,660
without jumping off in the thought train this way or going back into the past that way you're planning or thinking

309
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:18,359
about lunch or whatever you know it we stay and we stay and we

310
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:25,140
stay and that um quality of seclusion even if it's

311
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:32,480
just very brief is one of the keys to Freedom

312
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:39,420
so um I'll stop there

313
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:43,099
and um

314
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,640
if you'd like uh a little assignment for the next 24 hours

315
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,099
um you might try to keep track of

316
00:44:56,099 --> 00:45:03,020
what takes you off on tangents and then also feel

317
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:08,400
taste the the flavor of your experience as you come back

318
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:14,220
uh to being in the present moment with whatever you're doing

319
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:20,700
whether it's washing your face or cutting the carrots or sitting

320
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:27,540
meditation so

321
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:34,260
thank you very much and we will now migrate to the zoo room for any

322
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:39,740
questions you may have thank you for being here

323

326
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:54,200
