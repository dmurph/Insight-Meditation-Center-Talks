00:00:00,919 --> 00:00:06,799
so um I wanted to uh bring in a

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:13,000
uh a few words from this book that I really like um the name of the book is

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,320
called the way to love the way to love here it is you can see all the the

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,920
little footnote the the little uh papers I have in there um uh as remind as as

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,439
bookmarks uh so the book is by Anthony the Melo it's called the last meditations of anth need the

6
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,040
mow and I've actually given a talk a Dharma a couple of Dharma talks uh on

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,280
this on um Audio Drama before um so if you become interested and curious you

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,600
can go listen to those but I want to bring something else in tonight so so the um Anthony the

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,039
Melo forget now if he was a Jesuit priest or what denomination he was but

10
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,120
he was a priest in India and he was exposed to uh Buddhist teach teachings

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:09,759
and the way he writes it's both Buddhist and Christian very in a very interesting way and and um he he doesn't mince words

12
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:18,119
he it's it's it's um sometimes his language is is very biting very sharp um

13
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:24,400
and and I bring in my own I substitute my own words for for what he uses what

14
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,520
he says and yet there's such Clarity to his teaching such Clarity to the ways

15
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,600
like his sword of wisdom really sword cutting so so what I wanted to bring in

16
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,840
tonight is um yeah the a few few lines from this

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:47,960
chapter that's called love one another and at the beginning it's it says what

18
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:54,479
is love take a look at a rose is it possible for the rose to say I shall

19
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,280
offer my fragrance to good people and withhold it from bad people again he's

20
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:08,080
using language that you we usually don't use right good and bad but anyway here we go so here with a grain of take with

21
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,280
a grain of salt and yet so I shall offer my fragrance to good people and withhold

22
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,720
it from bad people or can you imagine a lamp that withholds its Rays from a

23
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,120
wicked person who seeks to walk in its light it could only do that by seizing

24
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:33,519
to be a lamb and observe how helplessly and IND rately a tree gives its shade to

25
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,599
everyone good and bad young and old high and low to animals and humans and every

26
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:44,120
living creature even to the one who seeks to cut it

27
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:51,560
down so this is the first quality of love it's indiscriminate

28
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:59,879
character and of course he goes on but I just want to pause here it's indiscriminate character so here love

29
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:06,319
really this is the practice of meta of loving kindness It's indiscriminate it's

30
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:13,120
it's exalted abundant it doesn't hold back from this person or that person

31
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,560
um just because that person has irritated us or

32
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,239
or um or is continuing to irritate us or or has spoken behind our backs or

33
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:35,239
whatever it might be ah this is this is the extent of mental which is asking us a lot and yet asking

34
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:41,159
so much of ourselves it it invites us to enter a different dimension of being

35
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:47,560
it's not the conventional way of Being Human TI for t

36
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:55,040
uh friends enemy it's it invites us these practices invite us to to

37
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:02,680
enter this be Dimension beyond the conven itional way of being this this

38
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,519
contractual way of being it these practices this this indiscriminate love

39
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:18,799
indiscriminate meta loving kindness goodness good will it invites us to

40
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:25,759
um to enter into a possibility of being above and beyond

41
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:32,080
what we take ourselves to be what we how we recognize our eles to be so so I want

42
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,759
to invite us to explore that dimension of um

43
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:46,320
indiscriminate meta abundant exalted not holding back um and again

44
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,120
this this does not make sense in the conventional way of being right in the

45
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:59,080
conventional being good bad this person I like them I give them my meta my good willll my friendliness or this person no

46
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:04,919
I don't I hold back but what if like a rose we share our goodness our Good Will

47
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:10,960
with all beings indiscriminately what what what might happen What might happen

48
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,919
to our hearts to our minds to the to the way we show up in the world um to the

49
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:24,199
way we see ourselves or or perhaps to the way we have

50
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:30,800
this vision of what might be possible for us for others and for the way of

51
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,600
being in the world so that's my invitation for our practice so with that

52
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:44,880
I'd like to invite us to settle into our chairs cushions wherever you are

53
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:55,720
comfortable let us Begin by imagining that we are a tree

54
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:04,360
just as Anthony Theo was talking about a tree that offer its shap shade to everyone

55
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:10,840
indiscriminately let's imagine we are a tree [Music]

56
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:18,080
sitting here a tree that's well rooted into the

57
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,280
Earth Rec connected to the

58
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:33,198
Earth feeling our ourselves landing on the Earth relaxing our

59
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,560
muscles nothing to do or accomplish but just to

60
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,479
let Earth Hold Us receive

61
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,080
us does it feel like to be a tree know trees it doesn't seem like they are

62
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:59,680
working so hard to be to hold themselves up they're naturally held up by Nature

63
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:10,000
held by the Earth up by their cellulose structure

64
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:18,319
fibers receiving the nutrients they [Music]

65
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:26,160
need receiving CO2 the tree being

66
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:32,720
breathed by the air CO2 oxygen breathing breathing in

67
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:40,520
CO2 breathing out oxygen we do the opposite but imagine you're a

68
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,918
tree it's all happening on its

69
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:58,319
own don't have to work so hard to be to

70
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
try

71
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:12,680
offering our weight to the Earth letting this process of breathing

72
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:18,159
happen on its own Breath by

73
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
breath

74
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,760
one one breath at a time calming soothing

75
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,320
settling practicing being a tree

76
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,079
stable tall

77
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:01,040
grounded and the forest with other trees

78
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,200
and imagine that like a tree whatever you need is provided for

79
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:26,000
you there is abundance the air is Rich with nutrients

80
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:34,839
moisture there's water there's

81
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,560
sun it's

82
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
okay

83
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,760
now imagine that as a

84
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:20,360
tree you're providing shade you're providing oxygen clean air and providing

85
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,519
shade indiscriminately

86
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:36,440
and in this metaphor shade is her good well

87
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:44,399
producing oxygen is an expression of this being's good will

88
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
indiscriminately

89
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,959
seur leave Le a a tree with many leaves full of

90
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:19,440
foliage providing shade in the hot summer

91
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,440
sun not just for people you cared about let them sit in your shade the shade of

92
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,680
your

93
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:40,360
goodwi can imagine them having relief from

94
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,519
heat you perhaps you become

95
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:54,480
happy please that first people you care

96
00:14:55,079 --> 00:15:00,680
about are benefiting from your shade from your Goodwill

97
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:18,880
and now you can imagine that some people you don't

98
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:26,920
know some neutral beings also come and sit in the shade

99
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,160
and and they [Music]

100
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:41,800
too are spared the heat enjoy the Goodwill of your

101
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,040
shade you're being of benefit of

102
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,519
service your good willll is indiscriminate see how that might

103
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,480
feel relating to this

104
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
idea

105
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,798
and feel a sense of

106
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:23,480
delight that might be there feeling your Goodwill your shade benefiting

107
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:34,200
others indiscriminately and now allowing

108
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,679
inviting some people perhaps that you've been entangled

109
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,840
with in your mind's eye invite them to sit in your

110
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:55,760
shade allowing yourself to

111
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,400
stretch little bit

112
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,280
we don't want to Define we don't want to limit people we are ENT entangled with

113
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:14,559
or have been just to our entanglement or their worst

114
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,080
moments or their

115
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:34,120
misbehavior what if we choose in this moment just in this metaphor for just try it on for size trying on

116
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:41,640
generosity this metaphor allowing them inviting them to enjoy have a

117
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,720
respit from the heat in our

118
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
shade

119
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:57,240
you're a well-rooted tree strong all full of folage

120
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,720
magnificent with beautiful

121
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:11,640
shade beautiful Goodwill allowing so many beings to

122
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,640
benefit

123
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:31,320
indiscriminately imagine them having a picnic relaxing having a cool drink of

124
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,240
water and the Bliss of your

125
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
shade

126
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
e

127
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:38,020
we practice generosity of heart for our own sake so that our hearts are

128
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:45,640
[Music] calm loving forgiving

129
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
spacious

130
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:59,840
may we be of benefit may we

131
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:07,039
recognize how how expansive our

132
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:14,079
hearts the generosity the goodwi of our hearts can can [Music]

133
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
be

134
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:04,480
and may we sit in the cool shade of our own

135
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,880
tree be the beneficiary of our own good will not hold it back from

136
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:18,120
ourselves imagine yourself sh sitting under the shade of your own

137
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,880
tree not holding back the

138
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,799
goodness not holding back the goodness from yourself

139
00:24:53,159 --> 00:25:00,559
may all beings be well and may all all beings be

140
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:16,039
free and may all beings including ourselves share their Good

141
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:25,759
Will generously and discriminant with others including

142
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:33,729
themselves [Music]

143
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,760
everyone thanks for your

144
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:51,000
practice so

145
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:57,799
yeah if you joined later I read at the beginning I read these few lines from

146
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:06,000
the book The Way to Love by Anthony the Melo which the chapter is called love

147
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,039
one another and the line that I emphasized was the first quality of Love is that it's

148
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:20,559
indiscriminate so maybe I also say as I mentioned at the beginning if you want

149
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:27,440
to listen to a longer talk about Anthony Dello in this book uh on Audio Dharma

150
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,679
the two talks one is called the way to love and the other one is I think called getting lost on the way to love or

151
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:41,720
something like that so now I'd like to invite us to explore this this expansion of the heart

152
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:49,120
as if our Goodwill was a shade of of our tree what happened for you with the

153
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:56,000
invitation of imagining people you cared about neutral people and then people you've been entangled with to come sit

154
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,279
under your shade did something shift was there an expansion in your heart like oh

155
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,840
yeah this is possible I can actually see you this person being happy and sitting

156
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:13,679
with their children and you know having a picnic oh yeah it's it's wow under the shade of my tree actually it feels good

157
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:22,240
this this this metaphor this way of entering into Goodwill through this metaphor of providing shade for others

158
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,520
it's it's a subtle way of expressing good willll it's not that direct may you be well may you be happy but it's a

159
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:34,000
subtle way of providing happiness and well-being in this metaphor so so I

160
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,679
wonder what you might have noticed so the invitation is in small groups as we're going to engage with one another

161
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:47,799
in a moment to um each person will have a chance to explore and say okay as as I

162
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:54,200
explore this this is what happened it surprised me or nothing happened and this was the edge again you're exploring

163
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,960
for your own benefit not to educate not to impress anyone it's just an

164
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:07,399
exploration of your own heart and please don't comment on each other's uh uh

165
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:14,640
Reflections no questions asked no uh and and please stay with the practice not

166
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:20,120
what happened today yesterday just stay with the practice stay close exploring

167
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:26,640
for your own sake one person will offer one nugget the next person one nugget the next person another nugget and we'll

168
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,120
go around and round around and the order will be reverse alphabetical order and

169
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,919
um if you're new to Happ there is the uh happier breakout room etiquette which is

170
00:28:38,919 --> 00:28:44,039
in the chat you can click on that take a look um and we want to really offer a

171
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:49,640
space of kindness and care for ourselves for one another it's not just oh go Talk

172
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,559
Amongst yourselves it's engaging respectfully

173
00:28:55,559 --> 00:29:00,679
indiscriminately uh caringly with one another imagine that as you enter the

174
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:07,640
breakout rooms you're all trees and you all have Goodwill and you you all share

175
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,840
your Goodwill with with one another not judgment but just practice what does it

176
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:18,960
feel like to share your Goodwill with one another

177
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,080
so so I'm going to create the bre couch

178
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:31,279
rooms be kind to yourselves be kind to one another there'll be about

179

184
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,760

188
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:42,360
aloha aloha I really love this thank you so much I um I'm so yeah I don't know if

189
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:50,039
I've mentioned before but I wrote a poem um around my birthday last year where I wrote about falling in love with a tree

190
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:55,320
and um and I hadn't written poems as an adult so it inspired me to write

191
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:03,080
multiple poems and been really struggling with somebody two people who have been so harsh to me and such mean

192
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:09,760
mean such very challenging words towards me and it's almost inspired me to just

193
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,679
text back like I love you or or something and I don't know if I have it

194
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:22,919
in me yet but I love the inspiration of it so um it's a possibility in my heart

195
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:28,639
to do that so thank you thank you you Amy beautiful

196
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:34,679
thank you so much and and I love hearing your your your relationship with trees falling in love with trees so so in this

197
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:42,120
practice imagining yourself as a tree providing shade and and also I hear how

198
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:48,600
doing this practice provided some possibility with the people who've been challenging and harsh with you recently

199
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:55,440
imagining you didn't say it but I'm assuming seeing them sitting in the shade of your tree open something up

200
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,840
open the possibility of of reaching out and normalizing

201
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:07,320
relations at least letting them know that your heart is open in whatever way that's appropriate for

202
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:16,919
you yeah thank thank you Amy beautiful one of you um sent a uh private message

203
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:24,159
uh I love the tree reflection and it fit in well with an unusual and amazing book

204
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:30,039
I'm reading the underst story ah I don't know the under story

205
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:36,000
interesting um if if you felt compelled to to raise your hand and say more that

206
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,880
that if it feels appropriate please do so okay second and last reflection right

207
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:49,919
now that I see Claire your hand is up thank you Nikki my reason for raising

208
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:57,639
my hand is much more pragmatic I was wondering if Neil could post the title of the book that you were using uh oh

209
00:32:57,639 --> 00:33:03,519
yes great I have no doubt the information will be shared with you Neil

210
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,919
is a there it is there you go Neil is on top of it okay thanks Claire thank you

211
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:14,799
thanks Neil that's great Peggy

212
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:21,639
please oh I was just gonna say I think the book is the over story oh over what

213
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:30,000
did I oh the over story oh oh okay it was maybe I wrote Under story before Oh yes you're under story it's over under

214
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,480
over you know what over under middle that's

215
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,200
great great any anything you want to share about that or it's

216
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:49,519
good oh I think you you might have muted yourself already you disappeared so I don't see you anymore but if it's

217
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:54,440
relevant you can raise your hand there are a few other Reflections let's see

218
00:33:54,919 --> 00:34:00,080
um another uh reflection I hugg trees and when I was

219
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,880
hiking today I hugged a tree and asked what wisdom they could share the tree is

220
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,599
only a tree doesn't doesn't question itself I like that a tree doesn't question

221
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:18,158
itself I I sit under the tree and I I sat under the tree and I felt the shade

222
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:24,960
nice nice another reflection or question see I am a little concerned that I want

223
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:31,398
to have love and empathy for others a little much a little too much there is an element of desperation and

224
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:37,800
self-hatred on my end maybe overstating that wait I'm not quite following I'm

225
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:44,440
little concerned that I want to have love and empathy for others a little too much oh I see so maybe it's just like oh

226
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:50,200
I want so much to have love and empathy for others maybe an element of desperation pushing it too much oh like

227
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:57,118
and self-hatred I get it so say like I'm not good enough I need to love others more is I think that's what the

228
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,440
reflection is oh my dear dear heart start with yourself sit under the shade

229
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,920
of your own tree start with yourself it's you can't

230
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,599
push um empathy and care for others it see yourself as a beloved other first

231
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:24,240
and foremost and let it an ease into it um oh I see Neil has also posted the

232
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:32,520

236
00:35:52,920 --> 00:36:00,640

237
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,839

239
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:18,640
you know we can't push we can't really um make

240
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,760
