00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,440
hello on this Monday beginning of our week together

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:13,480
and welcome all of you and for me it's very nice to be back after having been

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:21,039
at um our Retreat Retreat Center in Santa Cruz teaching a week-long

4
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,800
retreat so

5
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,880
um the last week I was teaching on this samadi

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:40,440
series The I talked about samadi is involves

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,559
Simplicity and a subtleness a

8
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:50,640
steadiness a spaciousness and a

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,600
sweetness and these this is definitely true but all those qualities can lend

10
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:03,719
itself to an a suggestion idea that somebody should be like kind of

11
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,880
making oneself really cozy like reading a really nice book or

12
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:17,479
something and well there's something something true about that uh the rolling kind of curling up

13
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:24,159
to read a good book on the couch uh it becomes mostly kind of a

14
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,159
mental effort the body has gotten cozy but the body is not engaged

15
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,560
included in the effort so with

16
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:43,759
samadi the body is definitely included as part of the picture samadi is

17
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:53,399
inclusion samadi is um unification somebody is uh integration somebody is

18
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:00,039
gathering together all of who we are including all of us and part of it is

19
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:08,319
our body our posture and um we can see in sports and crafts and

20
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:14,879
different situations in life where we really kind of get into a

21
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:22,560
posture that we're ready we're prepared we're ready for what comes next

22
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,239
we're um engaged with the whole body attentive with the whole body so I can

23
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:36,200
imagine for some of you if you had the occasion uh to drive

24
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:45,879
um the Dal lamba around a very busy City on the freeway and

25
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:52,080
we're a lot of traffic that uh if you knew that was going to be the case when you sat down

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,319
at the steering wheel you might sit up straight you might have

27
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,760
both hands on the wheel you might really be fully there for this important

28
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,040
activity you wouldn't be casual and just kind of have one arm you know draping

29
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:16,840
out on the window and one hand kind of casually maybe with two fingers holding the steering wheel and kind of kind of

30
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:24,120
slumping back and low writing kind of you would bring all of yourself to be

31
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,959
there for that event out of respect and care for this wonderful guest that you're caring for

32
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:38,640
so the balance here is to how to be settled and simple

33
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:46,439
and and but also come along with your body be inclusive of your

34
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:52,760
body and for some people that's uh sitting in a

35
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,959
posture that manifests or expresses

36
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,920
attentiveness a Readiness

37
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:09,040
availability I remember when I was uh parent of young

38
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,640
children the children might stand on the edge of something like the trampoline which is you know I don't know it's

39
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,479
maybe four feet high and there was pretty small and they wanted to jump into my arms and I'd say wait a minute

40
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:29,440
and I would get my whole self ready this was important I didn't want to not catch them drop them on the

41
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,680
ground so I would take a stance I wasn't they weren't heavy it wasn't going to be a

42
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,919
big thing to catch them but I wanted to get ready and be available really be

43
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:46,639
there relaxed but fully there with my whole body ready to catch

44
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:57,000
them so to assume now a meditation posture a posture that maybe for you ex

45
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,520
Expresses in whatever way your body allows you to do this

46
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,198
expresses um

47
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:15,320
attentiveness expresses a Readiness an

48
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:22,880
openness to be here to catch to be available with all of who you are to

49
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,360
this moment for some people that's adjusting

50
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,759
this spine a little bit even if you're laying down you can

51
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:40,160
maybe sometimes wiggle or move a little bit

52
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,039
so maybe so the middle of the spine by the between the shoulder blades can be

53
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:53,880
little bit more flattened or shoulder blades come

54
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,800
down chest little bit more open

55
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:08,599
that the hands are in a position that is not too casual it's

56
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:14,280
intentional hands that show that you're here and ready and

57
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,960
available the hands are not forgotten

58
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,000
incidental and with the whole body being the arena for

59
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,919
samadi to gently close your eyes so you can better feel your

60
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:53,360
body and to take some time intentionally letting your attention roam around your

61
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,080
body almost like awareness is like a soft kind hand that

62
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,759
gently touches the different spots of the body

63
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,199
and and conveys the message yes you too are included

64
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,230
here you too were going to knit together into a

65
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:26,479
[Music] whole body participating in meditation

66
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:48,560
and then within this body just as you are not changing

67
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,720
anything be aware of the body breathing but continue roaming the

68
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,879
attention round to different places in the body

69
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:07,479
where the movements and activity of breathing can be

70
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,159
experienced maybe the movements of the

71
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:31,440
belly and gently softening the belly

72
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,200
if that allows the movements to be Freer more

73
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,880
open the movements and sensations of the chest and diaphragm

74
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,040
perhaps there's if it's not too subtle you can feel the

75
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:25,399
movement of the back rib cage or the sides of the rib cage

76
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:52,040
and maybe you can feel the movements of your collar bones and shoulders as you

77
00:09:52,800 --> 00:10:01,320
breathe and if you can't very gently just enough breathe more

78
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,000
deeply until you feel maybe the collone and shoulders moving

79
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:36,600
and maybe you can be aware of the sensations of breathing in and out through the

80
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:45,199
nose maybe a slight tingling changing temperature

81
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,560
and as you breathe in and out

82
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:24,279
almost as if writing the wave of breathing in and breathing

83
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:30,720
out become aware of the thinking mind

84
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,519
the activity agitation any tension or

85
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,760
pressure even it could be as simple as a location we're thinking or

86
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:53,279
visualizing occurs and with breathing being like a

87
00:11:53,279 --> 00:12:01,240
massage for the Mind soften the thinking mind

88
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,720
mind and then on the next two or three

89
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,759
exhales relaxing and softening the whole

90
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:46,760
body especially any way in which you're bracing yourself against life in your

91
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,240
whole body

92
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,680
and then wherever you feel your breathing

93
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:30,760
begin feeling the place maybe deep inside first sensations of

94
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:38,160
breathing in maybe deep in the belly

95
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:45,760
area or the diaphragm maybe someplace in the

96
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:54,759
chest and as the inhale

97
00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:02,279
grows let the whole body receive the

98
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:07,000
inhale Let the Body receive the

99
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,440
movements of the

100
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,199
inhale so that with the inhale

101
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,639
the whole body much of the body where it's

102
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,120
easy is filled or alive

103
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,839
or with Sensations the sense of

104
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:56,920
receiving into the body the movements of breathing of in

105
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,920
inhale

106
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:17,600
and then on the exhale a sense of the other direction

107
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,279
that the whole body settles relaxes

108
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:30,959
towards the settling point the end of the exale

109
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:46,800
a gentle expansion outwards through the

110
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,759
body and a gentle whole body body settling back

111
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:59,959
towards the settling point at the end of the exhale

112
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,600
maybe deep in the b in the belly

113
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,480
with the inhale receiving awareness

114
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:06,199
throughout the body with a

115
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:13,918
wave the movements of breathing in letting awareness

116
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,558
spread and be received through the

117
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:34,159
body and on the exhale allowing a settling

118
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:43,400
relaxing where the whole body somehow relaxes towards the

119
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,039
settling point

120
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:06,280
and then very gently with a voice that is a whisper

121
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:13,200
quieting the mind count the

122
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,158
exhales one to

123
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,640
10 so the count participates with a settling towards the

124
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,640
settling point and don't count the

125
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:41,640
inhales let the silence be spaced for the Body

126
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:48,919
Sensations to be received in space in the

127
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
body

128
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
for

129
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

130
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

131
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,600
for for

132
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

133
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

134
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,480
for for

135
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:28,440
gently give yourself over to counting 10 breaths 10 exhales

136
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:35,919
maybe each account being said in the mind is spreads over the

137
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,919
exhale

138
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,120
one

139
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
2

140
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

141
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
for for

142
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:54,480
and then as we come to the end of this sitting do again or continue to feel the

143
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,080
rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

144
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,640
and maybe with breathing

145
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:10,000
in to

146
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:18,960
receive whatever sense you can feel the outer

147
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,120
World appearing Here and Now

148
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,158
sounds spatial awareness

149
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:37,679
your imagination of where you sit neighborhood

150
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:46,679
community the whole world arise as you breathe

151
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:53,760
in and as you exhale you let it all spread wide

152
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:03,519
outwards on the tip of your care and

153
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:15,519
love to receive on the inhale and spread Good Will kindness

154
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,760
meta out into this

155
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:28,518
world breathing in breathing out kindness

156
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:37,240
breathing in the world breathing

157
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,600
out

158
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:52,158
love breathing in and having space for all things in a relaxed

159
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,840
awareness breathing out compassion

160
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:14,600
and may whatever ability we learn to be

161
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:23,480
present steady concentrated in

162
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:28,600
meditation may it support the way that we can do so

163
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:34,480
for the people in our lives for this world that we

164
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:43,919
share May our meditation support the growing sense of kinship with all

165
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:51,519
beings in which we're

166
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:59,720
receptive to the whole world so that

167
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,360
we can transmit basic kindness to

168
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:14,000
everyone may all beings be happy may all

169
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:22,039
beings be safe may all beings be

170
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,880
peaceful may all beings be free

171
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:37,360
and may we live to contribute to those four

172

[Music]

173
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:02,200
things for [Music]

174
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:47,960
hello and welcome to this ongoing series on samade and uh this week since this is

175
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:55,600
Monday this week I'll say that the theme will be um related to

176
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:00,840
the literal meaning of some body which is a gathering

177
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:07,840
together and sometimes some is called a process of unification unifying the

178
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,679
mind but not just the mind because anything the Mind knows and feels and

179
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:22,480
experiences is part of the mind um every you know our nervous

180
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:29,039
system neurons uh go throughout the body

181
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:37,039
and um and wherever the nerves are activated by whatever stimulates them is

182
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:42,320
part of the mind when we die we don't feel anything

183
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:50,159
any sensation we feel in the body is part of the overall mind that we live

184
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:55,799
within we live part of and the unification then one of the

185
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:02,159
key things about the unification of the mind that Sade is that's really helpful

186
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,519
is to be grounded in the body to include the

187
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:14,720
body so this unification means inclusion and inclusion of as much as we

188
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:22,080
can and the people who develop concentrations without including the

189
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,200
body some people live from the neck up and it's possible to get a kind of a

190
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:33,320
laser Focus really focused with the mind some people who spend the day doing uh

191
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:38,840
intense maybe concentrated work on the computer on the

192
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:44,919
screen can be very focused and uh people can say wow that person's concentrated

193
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:52,320
and so much so that maybe they don't hear other people in the room or someone coming in you're so involved but it's

194
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:59,240
all from the neck up it's all a mental um mind kind of brain activity that's

195
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,559
being and if we use that for developing the Sade of

196
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:10,440
meditation uh meditation tends to become kind of lopsided and occasionally it

197
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:16,079
actually develops a u uh kind of uh

198
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,919
unhealthy States uh within sometimes tension builds up in the rest of the

199
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:27,760
body that's not useful for somebody um and U but when the whole

200
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:35,040
body is included then there can be a more relaxation it's easier for the mind to

201
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:40,320
then to be balanced be settled to not be contracted or

202
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:49,839
narrow and so to include the body as part of um uh the practice of

203
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:56,480
samadi is invaluable and one of the reasons for this is that as we continue practicing

204
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,800
samadi and some point um different I just for the time being I'll call them

205
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,960
energies different uh uh Expressions

206
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:15,760
energies emotions feelings um uh that arise with somadi uh are much more

207
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:22,560
supportive and much more uh supportive of further samat supportive of us uh if

208
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:30,520
they're if the whole body is included in feeling them it's almost like some of the emot states that come with Z are

209
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:36,240
felt so much better and Fuller if the body is available to receive them or

210
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:43,200
transmit them or to include them so the body is a tremendous support

211
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:50,200
for the unification process if it's if somebody is unifying the mind then um

212
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:57,400
and the mind is the you know wherever the nerves are in the body we want to include the body the body that we can

213
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:03,760
feel feel and sense every sensation we feel

214
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,880
is uh an extension of the Mind the nervous system that we

215
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:15,280
have neurons and uh and to be willing to relax and open and

216
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:23,920
feel allows this growing movement towards inclusion this too everything's included

217
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,560
no there's no outside and um

218
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:36,200
and as the settling of somebody we might not be so hearing the external world we

219
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:41,400
might not be thinking about the external world but there's a growing feeling that

220
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:47,440
that the awareness is now inclusive it just Broad and everything's included

221
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:55,680
within it and um and the Paradox is seemingly that uh the more we settle on

222
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:03,240
some settling spot or gather some Gathering Spot that we have it could be

223
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:10,040
um the movements of the belly some as deep settling in the belly a spot where

224
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:17,480
the breath begins and ends it could be the movements of the chest could be Sensations in the nostril there's

225
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:23,119
different places that can be the Gathering Place where everything's

226
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:29,319
included and as the the the the Paradox is that as we get more settled in that

227
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:36,480
Gathering Place uh steady settled present at at the same time there's a

228
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:41,800
the Mind becomes wider bigger more expansive if the mind gets narrower and

229
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:49,160
tight and contracted um then um probably somebody will be a little bit

230
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:58,599
lopsided so for today what what I want what I want to emphasize is the inclusion of the body in a process of um

231
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:06,079
of that helps both settling and allows the unification it's almost like the more we're in the body more we have a

232
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:12,119
receptacle to receive whatever is happening in the world uh we we increase

233
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:18,720
our capacity to include all that's happening in our mind our hearts our

234
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:25,079
bodies here now and U not a few people will feel

235
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:30,560
that as their Sade develops there's a lot of calm that allows them to go into their

236
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:37,599
life and have kind of a calm spaciousness that allows there's a room for what happens in the world and what

237
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:43,319
people say to just come and be held and be there without

238
00:38:43,319 --> 00:38:49,440
reactivity BEC partly because of this sense of expansiveness through the body

239
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,920
and beyond that can happen so again the Paradox is that there's a way of

240
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:01,599
relaxing into this settling spot the Gathering Spot and um and let that be

241
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:09,839
kind of like the the um Center the centering spot that allow that then begins to open

242
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:18,079
up and include and allows things to gather everything is included everything is here so one way to do this in

243
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:25,920
meditation with the breathing is um is to uh uh allow the

244
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,400
inhale be to be a time to feel the body more fully more

245
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:36,920
expensively and uh it's almost like the breath is a massage and and you have to

246
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:43,240
release your hands to uh to feel and make room for what's there so when the

247
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:50,960
massage your hands come down to neede to to uh to relax to uh as you you know

248
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:58,400
then the kneading happens there has to be this rhythm of releasing and and you

249
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:05,440
know kneading so the same way kind of the the breathing in this this uh making

250
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:12,720
space relaxing opening allowing things to open and feel the hole receive it

251
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:18,440
kind of a receiving of everything in the body as we breathe in and so that inhale

252
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:24,520
out receiving the inhale and then the coming together the

253
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:30,640
Gathering the settling the Contracting of the body as we exhale and to ride

254
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:36,480
that massage ride that wave of expansion and contraction some people have used

255
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:43,880
the image of a jellyfish for breathing you if jellyfish moves itself through the Water by opening and closing

256
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:51,240
expanding and Contracting this opening to everything and then Contracting coming

257
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:57,800
back and um and then to count and uh for the for

258
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:04,280
um to be sometimes the counting uh is such an invaluable thing to do so the

259
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:09,960
thinking mind has something to do rather than the thinking mind taking us away

260
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:17,760
from this inclusive kind of awareness it's the counting is using a thinking mind to stay present it could be

261
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,599
something different than counting it could be a label or word it could be the

262
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:31,079
word he that uh just maybe every exhale saying here is a reminder to really be

263
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:39,760
here and so rather than again the thinking mind just thinking about something unrelated and off you go but

264
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:48,079
the counting also there's a little extra oomph that has to be there to remember the count and um and kind of really Hold

265
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:54,240
Steady with the count and that engages the mind so more of the mind is involved

266
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:00,680
the part of the mind that has to remember uh to be present and remember that

267
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:07,240
remember the count also the same kind of mind that has to be remembered to stay present so we're kind of gently just

268
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:12,720
enough to remember the count so one on the exhale

269
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:19,319
two on the next exhale three and um and so it might seem like

270
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:25,920
I'm suggesting a lot of things to do but it's a unified ho of receiving the

271
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:33,720
inhale settling on the exhale as we settle the count

272
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:40,319
one and uh all for the purpose of Simplicity subtleness

273
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:46,800
steadiness spaciousness and sweetness

274
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,240
so don't be hooked into don't be tricked by all

275
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:57,800
these words and instructions that I'm giving that you make it complicated

276
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:03,960
keep it simple and uh and we'll continue so the

277
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:10,760
theme today this week will be inclusion that how we gather together unify as

278
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:16,040
part of samadi and the body is invaluable part of that and so for today

279
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,760
going through the day you might see if how you can be more inclusive in your

280
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,440
body how you can have a posture that supports readiness

281
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:33,800
engagement presence steadiness stability be careful kind of study your

282
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:41,240
posture see what you can do uprightness and uh and see what you can

283
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:47,119
do for um uh staying in this body feeling it as

284
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:54,280
you go through the world as you like the inhale receive it almost as if through the receiving the inhale you're more

285
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:59,440
there to receive the people you're talking to you're with so your body is

286
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:06,000
with you here and may be keeping you steady and calm in the middle of difficult

287
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:15,599
situations so thank you very much and uh I look forward to continuing tomorrow
