1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:07,560
so I will start with a guided meditation short guided meditation

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,340
and

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,619
maybe I'll start off giving some instructions and then we'll kind of

4
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:26,240
go into the silence so hopefully there's a little bit for everyone

5
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,660
so just taking a moment and

6
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,079
getting settled in the

7
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,699
the seated posture

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,440
it's always been interesting to me that

9
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:02,219
some of the most experienced meditators that I know

10
00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:08,100
take really take their time to find their posture

11
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:13,920
you know maybe we could say that during the whole meditation

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,820
we're continually finding our posture we're continually discovering what it

13
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:26,540
means to be centered

14
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,860
to be balanced

15
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,000
to be upright

16
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:49,079
I don't think the sitting posture is is some particular place we get to

17
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:57,060
but is this exploration so just to take a few moments and feel

18
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:04,740
into this body who what does it mean for this body

19
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,259
be grounded

20
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,000
and alert

21
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,780
what does it mean for this body to be at ease

22
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,860
there

23
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,959
putting the eyes closed if that feels helpful

24
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,099
and perhaps taking a few deep deliberate breaths

25
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,819
and with each out breath

26
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,379
just noticing this letting go

27
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,580
is there some way in each out breath we can

28
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:22,699
let go of the momentum

29
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:29,539
of the thinking mind the momentum

30
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,259
conditioned habitual

31
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:48,320
thoughts and let ourselves be here

32
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,340
remembering that in this practice

33
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,780
our primary intention is simply

34
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:21,320
to be present for what's happening

35
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:47,360
In This Moment sounds are coming and going

36
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,240
Sensations the body

37
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:05,300
are being felt

38
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:29,819
this moment also includes our mental activity

39
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:36,080
thoughts passing through

40
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,819
images in the mind

41
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,479
feelings and moods emotions

42
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,520
all part of the fabric of this moment

43
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:46,220
can we allow ourselves to

44
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:50,220
receive experience

45
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,460
receiving sounds

46
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:27,800
receiving any of the sensations of the body

47
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,959
as they manifest

48
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:43,279
at some point we may notice that this body is breathing

49
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:03,500
we may notice the rise and fall of the belly

50
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:19,339
the expansion and contraction the chest

51
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:38,000
or perhaps the flow of air right at the nostrils

52
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:05,220
seeing if we can be present for one

53
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:09,920
complete in breath

54
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,079
one complete out breath

55
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,519
just one breath

56
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:50,360
there's no need to breathe in some particular way

57
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:01,700
but rather just observe

58
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:08,959
and notice this breath

59
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,600
sometimes the breath will be long

60
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,560
sometimes short

61
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,779
times shallow

62
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,639
sometimes deep

63
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,720
with each in-breath

64
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,540
this opening

65
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:50,579
receiving

66
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:04,339
welcoming thank you

67
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,339
and with each out breath

68
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,760
wonderful letting go

69
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,779
releasing

70
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,160
giving back

71
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:18,178
perhaps we can notice

72
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:25,640
and tune into the Rhythm

73
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,900
of our breathing

74
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,720
rhythm of

75
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,780
welcoming in

76
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,740
and letting go

77
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,900
foreign

78
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:13,160
thoughts will come

79
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:18,500
feelings will come

80
00:20:21,539 --> 00:20:24,620
not a problem

81
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,400
whatever we experience

82
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,419
as part of the fabric of this moment

83
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:01,880
is worth our care

84
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,000
or attention

85
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,399
oh

86
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:41,000
is it possible to rest here

87
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:52,340
right in the middle of this flow of experience

88
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:59,659
thoughts floating by

89
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:11,059
sensations of breathing sensations of the body

90
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,679
sounds

91
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,480
passing through

92
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:14,299
in the final few minutes of the meditation

93
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:25,700
perhaps we can take a moment to

94
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:34,220
acknowledge whatever may be difficult right now

95
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:41,898
whatever may be challenging painful

96
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:49,220
in this heart in this mind

97
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,340
this body

98
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:04,640
to include this to meet this with

99
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:15,320
our warmth our care

100
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,220
compassion

101
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:41,580
foreign

102
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:50,640
[Music]

103
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:05,539
good morning and welcome again to IMC I know Hillary has an announcement

104
00:34:05,539 --> 00:34:11,460
good morning it's so wonderful to see so many people here on our pod luck Sunday

105
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:16,800
so whether or not you brought something totally fine feel free to to join us

106
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,839
after the Dharma talk for our potluck and um there's seating inside and

107
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:29,040
outside so whatever feels comfortable for you and we'll just um just kind of make a line at the table and we'll ring

108
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:35,220
a bell and have a blessing before the food and and we also welcome anybody to

109
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:41,179
help at the end to help with clean up thank you

110
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:48,118
just uh just a reminder that all the teachings here are freely given there's

111
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:55,679
never a charge the entire Center runs on donations so if you're inclined to make a donation there's a box near the front

112
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,780
door with the spelling of the teacher's name and a slot for operations there's

113
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:08,220
also an electronic kiosk near the library door if that's more convenient and our teacher this morning is Max

114
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:14,359
ernstein good morning Max good morning good morning

115
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:22,820
well it's it's very nice to see

116
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:27,839
to see you and to be with you and to see so many people here

117
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:35,640
it feels like the good old days before that thing happened called covid

118
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:41,940
and um I feel like maybe I should introduce

119
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:47,540
myself a little bit because it's been a while since I've been here and

120
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:55,800
one of the great things about a place like IMC is there's old friends who are who are familiar and

121
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:02,040
have been coming for for years and I'm always new people who are coming in

122
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:07,380
and so it's such a great mix um

123
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:14,839
I first walked in these doors so to speak but it wasn't these doors

124
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:19,859
in I think in 1999 so

125
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:24,078
um this group had a

126
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:31,140
had a few times that it would meet at the Quaker Friends Meeting House in Palo Alto I

127
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:37,980
don't know if does anyone remember that just was here then yeah so okay yeah laughs

128
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:46,619
and um I remember I walked in and it was a

129
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:52,200
I think people were sitting you know was a little bit of like a rectangular room and people were sitting

130
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:57,720
facing the center and a friend had told me that there was

131
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:03,000
meditation it sounded interesting and I walked in and everyone was just

132
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,900
sitting there quietly and so I just sat down and was kind of waiting for it to start

133
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:17,700
waiting waiting waiting you know and then at some point okay

134
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:20,359
this is it

135
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:29,720
and that's sort of been my practice for the last 20 years you know

136
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:36,060
waiting waiting and then it's like oh yeah this is it this is it

137
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:41,599
cool um

138
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:54,000
I was just thinking to myself during the meditation how wonderful it feels

139
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,160
um to sit in the sitting posture and I think those of us who

140
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:05,040
have developed a little bit of a meditation practice over time

141
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:11,940
it sounds a little cliche but this idea of kind of coming home you know and coming home to ourselves

142
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:18,599
and coming home to the moment and for me when I sit down and cross my legs

143
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:26,280
and kind of sit up straight and close my eyes it's like oh yeah right I forgot

144
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:35,280
about this in my dramas in my problems in my suffering oh yeah this is possible this

145
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,579
is possible to [Music] um to be here

146
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:48,440
to open to what's going on

147
00:38:48,839 --> 00:38:54,720
um in a simple way and even though it's simple

148
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,099
I think that

149
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:08,160
the meditation posture whatever that means for you whatever that means for your body but it's that orientation

150
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,819
to our life the meditation posture

151
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,740
brings a great power a great power

152
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:28,940
um but it's not a power it's it's not a kind of um

153
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:38,099
I don't think it's a it's a power to do or a power to assert or a power to

154
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:43,280
fix but it's a it's a power to accept

155
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,480
ourselves and it's a power to accept things as they are

156
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:55,440
you know so for me I associate the meditation posture with this capacity

157
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,519
to accept things as they are and

158
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:07,020
a close friend of mine recently lost a parent and she was going

159
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:12,300
through this process when her father was quite quite sick for

160
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:19,040
a few years and then you know um

161
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,500
sort of in hospice for a few months and

162
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:31,920
we talked about this a little bit it's like you know it's like what can we do what can we do in a situation where we

163
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:39,780
don't have control you know where we're there we want to be

164
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:47,220
present we want to be helpful we want to be awake we

165
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,760
and my suggestion was find a few moments every day

166
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,820
to sit in this posture just take this posture you know

167
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:06,180
and I think there's so much strength that can come from that that capacity

168
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:12,480
to open to our life as it is

169
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,900
you know

170
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:25,980
so that's one of the teachings that you

171
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:32,040
know has kind of stuck with me over these years and

172
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:38,160
I don't have the kind of mind that can really track or remember complicated

173
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:44,339
lists you know Buddhism has a lot of lists there's the 12 this and the 16 this and

174
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:50,520
this and you know they're great they're great and

175
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:59,838
um but to just sit down and let this moment be what it is

176
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:06,300
and soften the kind of struggle and soften the resistance and soften

177
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:11,760
the self that's always trying to get what it wants and get away from what it

178
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:18,380
doesn't want you know that's what stayed with me um

179
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:25,079
but it's funny how these some images or some teachings will will

180
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:31,619
land in the mind and a few weeks ago or maybe it was last

181
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:39,119
week I was here um and we had a one day sitting and it was it was a silent basically a day of of

182
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:45,500
quiet Day of Silence and I gave a talk at the end of the day

183
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:52,619
but what I was remembering was this story that I guess I heard early in my

184
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:59,640
practice and I was after I started sitting here with Gil in Palo Alto

185
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:05,520
so in those days Gil used to talk a lot about Zen because you know Gil who is the founding

186
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:12,480
teacher of the center also has a Zen practice and started his practice in Zen in the 70s I guess this was closer to

187
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,599
the 70s it was the 90s and so I heard a lot about Zen from Gil and

188
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:24,780
I got very interested in Zen Zen Center and send my beginner's mind which is kind of

189
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:30,240
the famous book that the teacher there Suzuki roshu wrote and so I started sitting in San

190
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:36,240
Francisco at the Zen Center as well and somehow I heard this story

191
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,640
about how um

192
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:51,300
you know in a Zen meditation Hall all the students are sitting facing the wall

193
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:58,140
have you you know have you ever seen that yeah it's a different format so all the students are facing the wall and

194
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:03,180
then the teachers at the front of the room facing the students and then usually there's another

195
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:08,640
kind of student who's facing out who's kind of like the meditation home manager

196
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,060
I think they call the Eno in the Japanese so the Eno comes in later and kind of

197
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:20,579
makes sure everything is okay and you know and so

198
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:26,040
this is a story that this manager the student told that

199
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:34,740
all the students were sitting and Suzuki roshi was there facing the hall and the manager walked in and saw one of

200
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:41,359
the Scrolls on the wall was a little bit Askew it was a little crooked

201
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:48,359
so being the manager and being in the Zen tradition where if you know Zen

202
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:55,680
it's a little I don't want to say OCD but everything needs to be lined up needs to

203
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:01,140
be perfect you bow in a very particular way and you walk into the room with a particular foot

204
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:08,400
not your left foot I can't remember which one it is but it's one you know it's the left to the right and you and it's a choreographed and it's kind of a

205
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:14,040
mindfulness thing and it's kind of just the way we do things the thing it's very

206
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:21,359
beautiful you know that there's a way there's a right way of doing it

207
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:28,380
so anyway the manager walked in and saw the scroll was crooked and so he straightened the scroll and

208
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,359
then went over and found a seat and found

209
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:41,040
and then uh Suzuki roshi the teacher got up to walk out of the room

210
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,420
and on his way out

211
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,240
he reached over for the scroll and

212
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:58,020
messed it up again quick you know could slanted it I walked out

213
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:04,020
you know in one beautiful graceful gesture and that was the story

214
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:08,839
you know and

215
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:16,460
in my early days of Zen practice I'm sure I heard that story and

216
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:23,400
you know it stayed with me and one of the things I appreciated about it was it was a little bit of a

217
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:30,180
corrective for especially in Zen there was a sense that there's a right way to do everything

218
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:36,900
and being a kind of overachieving

219
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:44,040
want to be perfectionist or something I was kind of trying to do things the right way and I'm sure that everyone was watching

220
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:49,560
you know and um and there are times that everybody

221
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:54,960
watches and then because you get your meals in the meditation Hall so they're

222
00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:00,720
servers who come in and serve you and everyone's just there looking at you serve and you there's a certain way you

223
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:07,160
do it in a certain way you bow and you think and so um

224
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:13,740
there's that element of it and and usually in a community Zen Community like you know in any Community

225
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:19,500
there's a person or two who really enjoys correcting you and telling

226
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:24,839
you that it's not supposed to do that and

227
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:30,180
so this story for me was a great teaching

228
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:37,079
and there was something there was something about it that

229
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:42,560
um for me was a

230
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:49,380
a pointer that we're not in this practice we're not

231
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:56,640
trying to endlessly correct endlessly fix endlessly perfect

232
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:02,819
you know we're not trying to scrub the mind of all of its

233
00:48:02,819 --> 00:48:08,520
bad things and insert all these good things and you

234
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:15,480
know that's not quite it you know maybe there's a maybe there's some there's a you know some some aspect

235
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:24,240
there of that but that's not the that's not the point and so for me this idea of

236
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,359
um

237
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:37,079
kind of changing you know letting letting things be

238
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:42,780
letting things be as they are that was the teaching that I got from that

239
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:48,000
and then when we sit down to meditate um

240
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,900
we're opening to the experience of this moment however it happens to be

241
00:48:54,900 --> 00:49:00,240
however it happens to be sometimes

242
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:06,839
will feel calm sometimes we'll feel agitated usually there's going to be a mix

243
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:12,180
of a lot of different things going on and thoughts coming through

244
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:17,480
and feelings and

245
00:49:17,819 --> 00:49:23,579
you know I love the fact that our Center here is

246
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:28,800
you know is it a neighborhood people are driving and kids are laughing

247
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:35,040
and there's cars and people talking and you know we're sitting in the middle of

248
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:44,460
life we're sitting in the middle of our life we're not we're not trying to get to some

249
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:50,839
absolute silence silent place and

250
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:59,339
you know I know for myself early in my practice I had the model of I need to be I need

251
00:49:59,339 --> 00:50:06,799
to have complete silence you know so like earplugs or

252
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:13,680
I mean there's a there's a place for that like when I fly I like to you know I have my

253
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:20,700
headphones and my eye mask and I'm trying to just you know disappear

254
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:28,020
um but I think meditation is not about disappearing and it's not about escaping

255
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:34,319
to some place where nothing can bother us nothing can touch

256
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:42,839
us um it's more about opening more and more to

257
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:49,020
our life and our life is not a

258
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:54,119
um what are those called the the chamber

259
00:50:54,119 --> 00:51:01,200
the flotation tank you know if it's totally want to get to a place where I just it's totally silent

260
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:07,380
totally peaceful I can't feel anything am I here you know yeah maybe maybe we

261
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:16,200
have moments like that that could be nice but um if our freedom if our peace only comes

262
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:21,859
from when everybody else does what we want them to do be quiet

263
00:51:21,859 --> 00:51:27,200
I don't know how how valuable that freedom is

264
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:33,559
but when we can be free when we can be at ease

265
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:40,140
when a parent is sick when we're late for work when we're stressed about something when

266
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:47,880
we're sad about something where we're irritated when we're wanting something

267
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:53,339
well I think that's a more valuable Freedom that's a

268
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:59,599
that's that is um

269
00:51:59,819 --> 00:52:07,079
to be awake to be aware to be alive

270
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:12,240
right in the middle of delusion right in the middle of our life

271
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:18,000
without attaching to delusion or enlightenment

272
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,099
um so I was saying the other day that

273
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:28,319
in one of the um places I practiced

274
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:34,520
there was a scroll on the wall and the translation of this goal was

275
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:43,800
um don't remove delusion

276
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:50,700
don't even seek the truth you think well

277
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:58,279
but isn't the Buddha's teaching removed illusion

278
00:52:59,339 --> 00:53:05,520
seek the truth one day

279
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:11,400
Etc so why why would there be this teaching right next to the Buddha saying

280
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:19,760
don't remove delusion don't even seek the truth

281
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:29,040
and so for me it was this great pointer this great

282
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:35,099
reminder that um

283
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:42,059
it's closer what we're looking for what we're seeking the Dharma

284
00:53:42,059 --> 00:53:51,119
is closer than any idea any any division of even delusion and truth

285
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:58,140
it's here it's this and to let things be to open to to this

286
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:06,420
moment truth is not in some future moment some better moment

287
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:14,520
when I'm some better version of me and the world is some better version of itself then I can be happy then I can be

288
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:20,640
free if it's not here where where could it possibly be if it's

289
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:28,500
not here um so here's a here's a little story that

290
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:34,680
maybe is presenting uh some

291
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:39,900
aspect of this once there was a monk who lived in an

292
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:47,099
old Temple taking care of his retired teacher and tending the temples rather famous

293
00:54:47,099 --> 00:54:52,200
garden one day visitors were coming from far

294
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:57,660
away to admire the garden and so he spent the morning meticulously raking

295
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:04,920
the sand and Gathering up all the Stray leaves after he had gotten everything to look

296
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:11,720
just right he noticed his old Master Looking Over the Garden Wall at his work

297
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:18,119
very nice the old man said but there's one thing missing

298
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:25,380
what's that ask the Monk taking hold of a branch of a tree

299
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:31,859
that leaned Over the Garden Wall the master gave it a good Shake sending

300
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:38,579
Autumn Leaves cascading Every Which Way onto the pristinely raked sand

301
00:55:38,579 --> 00:55:45,079
there said the old master now it's perfect

302
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:58,680
if you've ever gone to Japan or seen these these Zen Gardens

303
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:06,059
you know and the stones are kind of raked in a certain way and it may be a maple tree in the corner and

304
00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:12,619
and they're beautiful and they're it's a kind of serenity

305
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:22,680
no it's there's like a Harmony of and

306
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:29,040
Stillness and you know if there aren't a lot of tourists and all this you know

307
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:37,500
but you know you kind of kind of It kind of puts you it becomes your mind you know it's it's one image of the Mind

308
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:44,220
and and so to be in an environment like that and you see oh this one Lone Tree

309
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:49,319
is relating to the pond

310
00:56:49,319 --> 00:56:56,160
and it's relating to the stones okay and you're kind of there

311
00:56:56,160 --> 00:57:01,500
um but there's also something about it that's very meticulous

312
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:08,400
that's very controlled that's very deliberate you know and certainly there's a place

313
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:16,339
for that and it's a certain kind of beauty so then why would the master you know

314
00:57:16,339 --> 00:57:22,800
mess it all up and

315
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:28,079
um maybe it's not an accident that the master is as you know in the story

316
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:33,900
anyway is a kind of old guy experience I kind of Imagine

317
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:41,819
imagine him as someone who's has seen a lot of life has done a lot of practice

318
00:57:41,819 --> 00:57:48,440
has a mind that's that's really wide that's really

319
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:54,319
inclusive that's really um

320
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:01,140
welcoming and I kind of Imagine The Young Monk

321
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:08,220
as someone who has a lot of energy who has a lot of ambition in a way

322
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:16,940
and wants to do something wants to accomplish something has this energy for practice wants to get it right

323
00:58:17,819 --> 00:58:20,480
and

324
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:29,660
you know so so maybe in a way we could say these are two different models of of

325
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:34,880
the Mind of Dharma practice

326
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:41,640
one is that were continually raking continually cleaning

327
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:47,280
up continually um

328
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:55,260
you know taking care in a way it's beautiful I mean I think when we sit down and we notice that

329
00:58:55,260 --> 00:59:02,059
the mind is all over the place and I'm so you know thinking about oh that happened oh I'm kind of stuck and

330
00:59:02,059 --> 00:59:09,480
yesterday or last week or 10 years ago and then to kind of say oh yeah I'm here

331
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:15,558
you know and to sit up a little straighter to come back to the breath

332
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:23,040
and apply myself and put some energy and gather the mind

333
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:29,339
I mean that's important that's you know that's what we're doing and I think this is the side of practice

334
00:59:29,339 --> 00:59:35,599
that's kind of like a training you know um

335
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:43,260
I don't play piano I wish I did um actually I wish I played guitar but

336
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:51,558
um I think that learning an instrument

337
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:59,040
or learning anything is a little bit like this this learning

338
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:06,180
of mindfulness and breathing you know we first sit down and we talk about okay just follow your breath

339
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:13,200
like that sounds easy you know there there with a couple of breaths and then we're gone totally gone

340
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:18,420
you know and if you've ever done this practice of counting the breath you know

341
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:23,940
if you're familiar with that you know it's great I still do it sometimes and

342
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:30,799
it's like with each out breath you're just very quietly

343
01:00:32,099 --> 01:00:37,500
say a number you know not random number just like one to ten basically so it's

344
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:42,150
like [Laughter]

345
01:00:43,859 --> 01:00:47,960
you know so you're breathing in and then

346
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:54,540
you kind of play with it and then the way I think about it is like the number

347
01:00:54,540 --> 01:01:00,540
it's like a little label that the thinking mind if you give our thinking mind something to do

348
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:07,578
give it a little activity so we're not thinking just randomly so much so it's like

349
01:01:07,859 --> 01:01:14,280
and so but 90 of the awareness is with the sensations with the feeling of the

350
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:21,500
breath but then there's little lame of one than breathing in to

351
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:28,500
three and then once we get to ten we start again at one

352
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:34,200
so you kind of do these Cycles and so you know

353
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:41,280
if it's just this wonderful way of sort of helping the mind

354
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:47,700
stay with the breath and accompany the breath but usually when I when I offer this to

355
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:55,559
people to groups or something and then we'll talk about it afterwards like who didn't get higher than three in a

356
01:01:55,559 --> 01:02:03,000
few you know because we get to you know one and two and then the mind is just off

357
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:08,099
then we notice we notice whenever we notice whenever we wake up we just come

358
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:13,380
back to one so it's this great it's a little bit like

359
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:19,920
I mean this sounds a little pejorative say like training wheels but I still use training wheels I think

360
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:25,520
it's great it's like it's like it just helps us

361
01:02:25,619 --> 01:02:31,319
it just aligns us aligns the body and the mind and the breath

362
01:02:31,319 --> 01:02:37,680
um so this is kind of a training and and so maybe in a way we could say this is like

363
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:43,859
raking the garden cleaning up the garden we're organizing the mind

364
01:02:43,859 --> 01:02:51,540
we're sweeping the mind but that's not all there is to this

365
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:57,599
practice um and so what is it

366
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:04,440
to be able to not only accept that

367
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:11,940
the uncontrollability of Life the uncontrollability of the wind sweeping

368
01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:17,700
up the leaves whipping up the leaves you know

369
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:25,920
um if any of any of us have a garden and no it's I mean it's like you know it's continuous right you clean up only in

370
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:31,020
the next moment it's like it's all it's like okay

371
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:37,020
um so practice is not about once and for all

372
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:43,380
it's not about I'm going to meditate so one day I can just sit back

373
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:50,420
and enjoy the Perfection of this clean pristine Garden that has no

374
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:56,700
mess no squirrels who are eating our ripe

375
01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:04,200
tomatoes no you know no trucks going by and noisy

376
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:10,760
trucks and I just don't like the trucks and you know whatever it is um

377
01:04:12,299 --> 01:04:21,059
and so maybe the master is saying the point of practice is to see the uncontrollability

378
01:04:21,059 --> 01:04:27,000
is to see the mess as its own kind of perfection

379
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:33,420
it's like oh yeah when I take this posture

380
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:40,460
and I open the mind and open the heart and let myself feel

381
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:48,599
let myself think let myself breathe I can sense that this moment

382
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:55,220
is just what it is you know um

383
01:04:55,380 --> 01:05:01,859
and it has its own kind of perfection and all of the Dharma all of the truths

384
01:05:01,859 --> 01:05:08,640
of the Dharma of impermanence of interdependence of emptiness

385
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:15,720
is all here you know it's here in the sounds of the baby right

386
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:20,900
it's here in [Music] um

387
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:29,000
the mind that's worrying about something are those worries some

388
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:35,099
fault of mine is there some problem or is it just another

389
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:40,980
of the Endless expressions of this moment you know

390
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:47,700
um so I think when we can open to ourselves and open to our life that way

391
01:05:47,700 --> 01:05:53,280
is such a gift such a gift we give to ourselves this is a gift

392
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:57,920
we give to others um

393
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:05,040
so I in my own practice I've become a little bit allergic to the kind of once

394
01:06:05,040 --> 01:06:12,680
and for all thinking of like because the other side of once and for all is

395
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:20,720
I'm not there yet maybe I'll never get there

396
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:28,500
what am I doing here why you know what if you're doing all these years and and this is a very very common

397
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:35,579
you know feeling that meditators have um but I think of practice a little bit

398
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:40,400
more like sorry for the

399
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:47,700
prosaic or kind of tidion is that even a thing so example but it's a little bit

400
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:55,559
more like brushing our teeth you know we don't really think that okay if I

401
01:06:55,559 --> 01:07:02,579
brush my teeth really well maybe I'll never I'll never have to brush my teeth again I'll press them so

402
01:07:02,579 --> 01:07:08,640
well if I get so clean I'm done

403
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:13,859
you know what a relief you know no it's like

404
01:07:13,859 --> 01:07:20,400
it's like part of our ongoing care for ourselves that we accept that this is part of

405
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:27,900
being alive right that um I'm not expecting Miracles when I

406
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:33,000
brush my teeth I'm not brushing my teeth waiting for

407
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:41,180
um some once and for all Big Bang experience

408
01:07:42,059 --> 01:07:50,880
um you know so ordinary it's it's so woven into the fabric of

409
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:58,020
our life that we don't even we have to convince myself that it's a good idea yeah you just do

410
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:03,059
it and maybe there's a way that Dharma

411
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:08,819
practice can be more like brushing our teeth

412
01:08:08,819 --> 01:08:14,640
that we sit down and we we

413
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:16,759
um

414
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:24,560
who it's like we

415
01:08:26,759 --> 01:08:32,278
we metabolize our day

416
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:38,580
this is one of the reasons I love meditating at night I know I know early morning meditation is a

417
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:46,199
very virtuous thing if you're a very good person

418
01:08:46,199 --> 01:08:51,420
you get up very early

419
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:57,660
I remember when I was living in a Zen monastery they would start the cities I think at

420
01:08:57,660 --> 01:09:05,338
tassaharas it's like 3 40 something like that 350. and then you know but they don't just

421
01:09:05,339 --> 01:09:10,679
leave it up to your virtue because if you don't show up at 350

422
01:09:10,679 --> 01:09:15,838
you get a knock on your door

423
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:18,619
Max

424
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:28,560
is everything okay [Laughter] there is a person whose job is to round

425
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:35,520
up all of the stragglers it's kind of great you know

426
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:42,120
because in the monastery it's a kind of training if you do it

427
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:49,859
whether you want to do it or not so in a way it's the easiest place to

428
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:56,340
practice because someone's basically telling you go meditate now okay you're gonna ring

429
01:09:56,340 --> 01:10:02,520
the bell you go ring the bell you stop and um in our own life it's a little you

430
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:09,060
know it's more nuanced but I love meditating at night because it's like this

431
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:16,860
it's like metabolizing the day and I just often spend a few minutes and

432
01:10:16,860 --> 01:10:21,900
just doing nothing just sitting there and

433
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:27,659
just just feeling what's what's going on

434
01:10:27,659 --> 01:10:33,679
um so

435
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:42,719
it's not that glamorous but I think the day in Day Out

436
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:49,920
meditation as brushing our teeth is a great practice it is a deep

437
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:55,260
practice and as I often think about it it's like you know

438
01:10:55,260 --> 01:11:01,820
do you remember phone books I know they're kind of a a bad example

439
01:11:02,040 --> 01:11:08,940
I feel so dated rather you know one page of a phone book

440
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:14,940
it's like so insubstantial it's nothing right it's this thin thin paper

441
01:11:14,940 --> 01:11:20,960
and so I think a day of practice a day of sitting down

442
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:26,760
and being with this mind as it is exactly as it is

443
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:34,380
it's like one page the phone book but you know you do that day after day

444
01:11:34,380 --> 01:11:40,260
after day and something substantial develops you

445
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:45,840
know and there's a real thing there and so

446
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,840
um

447
01:11:51,420 --> 01:11:57,060
Maybe with that kind of consistency of being

448
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:03,600
kind to ourselves of of growing our capacity

449
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:10,520
to be with the full range of who we are the full range of emotions the full range of

450
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:16,820
experiences that life gives us um

451
01:12:17,100 --> 01:12:24,739
we can see that we can appreciate

452
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:30,480
when the garden is pristine and we can appreciate when it's full of

453
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:35,820
leaves when it's a mess when it's when our life is full

454
01:12:35,820 --> 01:12:42,719
of meetings and difficult conversations and

455
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:48,239
stress and you know and

456
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:55,980
and to find the beauty in in each thing in each moment and you know I hear this

457
01:12:55,980 --> 01:13:02,880
baby and I have three of them so it's it's heart opening for me

458
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:08,880
and the thing that stuns me is how fast it goes you know babies are changing

459
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:15,360
like so quickly we don't perceive how we're changing you

460
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:21,900
know we're also changing um but it's like it's this great reminder

461
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:29,219
for me to and just enjoy enjoy each moment and it

462
01:13:29,219 --> 01:13:35,940
goes by so quickly and I think meditation is a way of

463
01:13:35,940 --> 01:13:42,679
reminding us and teaching us um

464
01:13:44,699 --> 01:13:51,239
that each moment is it you know don't save don't save ourselves

465
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:57,600
for some imagine moment in the future you know so

466
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:04,260
we're so so often we give up this moment if you think there's something better

467
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:10,820
has to be something better right but um

468
01:14:16,620 --> 01:14:22,920
it's one of the uh that's one of the memories I have of those stories from early in my zen

469
01:14:22,920 --> 01:14:28,199
practice and as the story went we were

470
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:33,719
students were on one of these long meditation Retreats and you know and in the Zen tradition you there's pretty

471
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:39,780
strict and you don't move you can't move and so you have a pain a lot of you know

472
01:14:39,780 --> 01:14:47,159
usually some physical pain in your knees or this if it's burning or [Applause]

473
01:14:47,159 --> 01:14:53,400
so in the middle of one of these week-long sachines teacher

474
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:59,940
comes in and is going to give a little a little word of encouragement right a little something to open our

475
01:14:59,940 --> 01:15:06,480
hearts and help us and what why not Suzuki where she says

476
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:14,960
something like doesn't get better later

477
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:38,940
so and I think it's up to us is that is that depressing

478
01:15:38,940 --> 01:15:44,239
or is that liberating you know

479
01:15:44,580 --> 01:15:52,020
and I think that some of the most present some of

480
01:15:52,020 --> 01:16:00,198
the most awake beings I've had the Good Fortune of being with

481
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:06,320
maybe it's no coincidence have been either very young children

482
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:12,239
or people who are

483
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:18,300
at the very end of their life you know that these two

484
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:26,760
extremes these two ends of the lifespan where the children don't

485
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:33,480
the children are just are just in the moment right and they don't know enough to

486
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:38,880
compare or worry or

487
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:44,580
um anticipate

488
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:50,219
you know they're just there they're just delighted by every new thing

489
01:16:50,219 --> 01:16:55,739
and and then the friends who've been at the

490
01:16:55,739 --> 01:17:00,320
end of life it's like they too

491
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:07,580
are not waiting anymore are not um

492
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:16,800
someone I know this acquaintance of mine who's kind of a Dharma teacher she's a Dharma teacher I think she she wrote a

493
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:21,840
book called Death and the subtitle is

494
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:28,320
the end of self-improvement [Laughter]

495
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:33,900
you know finally

496
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:36,678
finally

497
01:17:46,679 --> 01:17:53,760
I had a friend maybe I'll end in a minute but I I had a friend who

498
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:59,100
was this lovely woman in her 70s

499
01:17:59,100 --> 01:18:05,820
I think when I knew her she was 77 and we knew each other because we were

500
01:18:05,820 --> 01:18:12,120
part of a cohort of the Buddhist chaplaincy program which is part of this you know Gill and

501
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:17,880
Paul Haller and Jennifer block for many years have taught a chaplaincy

502
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:22,980
program and this we I did this in 2007 I think so it was a while ago

503
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:28,380
and and this woman we became friends and we

504
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:33,540
would kind of meet for lunch and the program ended and she was so wonderful and she

505
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:40,140
she was a psychotherapist but she had many different lives and many different careers and she just had this great

506
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:47,360
sense of humor and down to earth wisdom and I just loved being with her

507
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:55,380
and um she was so healthy and so vibrant and so

508
01:18:55,380 --> 01:19:01,980
full of life that it was a shock to me that a few years later she

509
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:08,880
was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and

510
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:14,100
and it was one of those things where you know

511
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:20,820
not no good treatments and so she basically said

512
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:27,600
I want to enjoy as much time as I have left whether it's

513
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:33,420
five years or five weeks and I when I feel like I'm no longer

514
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:38,880
myself I want to be able to kind of you know push a button

515
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:46,140
and and let go and this was before all of this was legal and other anyway she kind of had

516
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:53,760
some arrangements to do all this and she but what what she found was in

517
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:59,219
those I think it might have been maybe 10 weeks eight weeks 10 weeks that she had

518
01:19:59,219 --> 01:20:05,880
she became so happy she was so free and she was so happy and

519
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:11,400
she even met with some of her Buddhist teachers to say is something wrong with me

520
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:16,500
why am I so happy why do I feel so she's like

521
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:22,620
she you know it was like a weight was lifted from her shoulders

522
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:28,679
that she wasn't um you know I don't know exactly what she

523
01:20:28,679 --> 01:20:33,719
felt but it you know I imagine that she could really

524
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:39,540
be alive and appreciate safer each moment without worrying about the future

525
01:20:39,540 --> 01:20:44,699
without worrying about this or that and she was so happy

526
01:20:44,699 --> 01:20:50,640
and instead of a funeral she when she felt that she was really

527
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:58,260
getting close she threw a huge party and had her closest friends come and

528
01:20:58,260 --> 01:21:03,780
they drank cocktails and played cards all night

529
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:09,060
and this was who she this was how she you know wanted to

530
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:15,659
um celebrate you know and memorialize her herself and

531
01:21:15,659 --> 01:21:21,659
celebrate her life and so I sometimes think about her and I think

532
01:21:21,659 --> 01:21:26,940
about these kind of two extremes of life

533
01:21:26,940 --> 01:21:32,900
and then here we are kind of in the middle right and we do have to think about the future

534
01:21:32,900 --> 01:21:38,340
and we do want to improve and you know and that is the side of

535
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:44,580
practice where we're tending the garden we're taking care of things we're

536
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:51,600
developing our skills we're raking the leaves and then there's the side of letting

537
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:58,320
every single leaf fall exactly where it falls

538
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:04,340
and seeing the perfection in

539
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:11,239
in this as well so

540
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:19,320
maybe I'll what time do we stop 11 or 10. no no oh no okay sorry

541
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:25,800
