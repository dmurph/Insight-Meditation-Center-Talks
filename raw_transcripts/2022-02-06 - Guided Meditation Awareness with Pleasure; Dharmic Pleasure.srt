1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:08,800
so welcome to our first time back after our latest

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,200
pandemic pause and so those of you are here welcome it's very nice to be together and

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,720
it's actually i i think i under-appreciated how valuable it was to

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,720
be together as community i mean i always valued it so two years ago i would have of course

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,800
it's valuable but now i feel it's a whole different dimension of value and just

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,719
sharing and being together and there's something almost like uh

7
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,719
like if you're thirsty and you drink some refreshing waters ah that feels good there's a whole feeling of being a

8
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,280
community that i get now that something i didn't know needed to be satisfied or get satiated

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,280
or something so welcome back and for those of you online welcome back and

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,480
know that there's about 25 people here here at imc

11
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,560
and so i'll have both of people here in my mind and also all of

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,000
you online so for the meditation today i want to uh

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,439
offer a variation or a dimension of this mindfulness practice

14
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,840
it's a i think it's a relatively common human phenomenon

15
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,720
to get preoccupied with something and to be fixated on something be concerned with something

16
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,880
and they say that some of us have negative biases so sometimes we get focused on what's negative or difficult

17
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:46,560
or off or something and uh and sometimes when we hear the

18
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,280
meditation instruction like just focus on your breathing which we kind of some people translate

19
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,119
that to themselves oh this is another time i'm supposed to be fixated narrowly focused on something just be

20
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,680
with that and then there's this tension between you know being narrowly focused because it's effort to do that

21
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,760
and the mind wants to wander away or something so there's an art to not having the

22
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,200
meditative attention fixated to not translate one pointedness to

23
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,280
holding the attention tight on something like the breathing but rather to have the attention we have

24
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:30,400
a softness to it a floating quality to it that allows you to take in the wider

25
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,800
context of what's happening so it would be a little bit like

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,760
if you're walking in a park with a friend having a you know you're involved in the conversation and with a friend that's

27
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:51,519
the focus of attention you would say the center of gravity of attention but you're also taking in the park as

28
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,360
you walk because you have to make sure you don't you know step on a rock or in a branch

29
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,840
that's fallen or you know when you you don't even think about it but then you're synchronized so you come to a

30
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,360
curve in the path you both curve around together so you're taking in

31
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,879
the wider context maybe even the niceness of it the beautiful greenery the peacefulness of

32
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:22,000
it and it just feels good not you taking in that kind of being relaxed or something inspired by the park setting

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,560
as opposed to walking next to the freeway on the shoulder you know with your friend the cars rushing by it'd be very different

34
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,319
right so this ability to kind of take in the peripheral

35
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,599
context of the situation it can be very helpful for meditation

36
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,840
and it can uh so as you're focusing on the breathing it's not just important to stay with the

37
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:53,840
breath but in a relaxed way almost like you're opening attention up you're also taking in the wider context

38
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,120
of you sitting there and one of those contexts context

39
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,720
is that which is that which is going well that which feels pleasant

40
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,599
where there's some sense of ease and the chances are that somewhere in the field in your field of attention in

41
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:18,320
your body and your mind there's probably something that feels pleasant enjoyable about sitting quietly

42
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:26,639
here what might be loud is that something that's not enjoyable not pleasant

43
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,720
can you be can you be open enough in your attention not to deny

44
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,880
anything that's unpleasant anything is difficult but to be wide enough you can also include

45
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,520
what is pleasant what's an easeful what's enjoyable about it all so if you're focusing on the breathing

46
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,600
relaxed soft attention of the breathing kind of like you're resting on the breathing

47
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,520
but without working at it too much just kind of gently open and there's some kind of

48
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,039
embodied context for breathing that feels nice it feels good

49
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,840
it feels pleasant or useful or even if it might feel you feel lousy

50
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:16,000
today we're not denying you're lousy feeling lousy not you like it i'm denying you're lousy but that you

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:22,560
but but that you might feel lousy does it make some sense

52
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,080
those of you here are not in good so so let's try that a little bit so

53
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,360
assuming a meditation posture

54
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:50,720
and a way that feels nice for you can you adjust your posture

55
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,880
so that yours feels nice to be in your body some of you it might help to

56
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,000
relax something some of you it might mean sitting up

57
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,360
straighter sitting up in a way that feels more confident

58
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:27,120
and then as if you're going to enjoy yourself doing it slowly luxuriously

59
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,960
take a few long slow deep breaths

60
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:47,319
maybe exhaling in a way that feels enjoyable or pleasant

61
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,240
maybe part of the enjoyment is as you exhale to relax your body

62
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal

63
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:26,880
and perhaps you can continue relaxing on the exhale but if you're able to soften or relax

64
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,000
some muscles take the time to feel the pleasure of

65
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,520
that the goodness of that

66
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,880
relaxing the muscles of your face

67
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,400
if you can soften your shoulders

68
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,919
does anything in that softening feel pleasant

69
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,320
on the exhale relaxing the belly

70
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:55,399
and perhaps on the exhale a global relaxation of your body

71
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,440
and then sitting here quietly notice if there's any

72
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,800
pleasure global pleasure or

73
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:30,000
pleasantness that resides in your body

74
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,839
even if parts of you feel uncomfortable

75
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:43,760
maybe there's a subtle global feeling of

76
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:52,560
aliveness awareness in the body

77
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:03,080
a tingling or vibration that has a kind of subtle pleasure to it

78
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,920
maybe it's a kind of global or maybe it's very specific

79
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:19,279
sometimes it can be just simple as

80
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,640
a feeling of pleasure with the lips touching it especially if you make a little half

81
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,640
smile

82
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:50,480
and for a few moments let your global awareness float around your body

83
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,720
touching into wherever in the body it feels comfortable or feels pleasure

84
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:03,760
pleasant or where there's a sense of ease

85
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:15,839
not so much looking for it but it's just allowing it to

86
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,920
your attention to float and settle float and touch in

87
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,519
randomly wherever it goes

88
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,480
and letting that be their peripheral attention

89
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:50,519
center the awareness of the sensations of the body breathing

90
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,000
almost as if the breathing body is a like a wave in the

91
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:18,079
vast ocean that goes up and down

92
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,320
but the wave is part of this larger ocean

93
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:35,000
so the breathing the sensations of breathing in and out

94
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,519
we're part of this wider global experience of the body

95
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,920
and is there some way that you can

96
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:13,120
help the attention be enjoyable a soft floating awareness

97
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:19,279
that floats along with the comings and goings of the breath

98
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,800
not fixating

99
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,800
an attention which is receptive

100
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,480
loose awareness

101
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:55,120
so that part of the peripheral awareness is a very simple

102
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,399
pleasure of being aware

103
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,240
and as you focus on your breathing

104
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,680
the central focus the center of focus is breathing

105
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,880
and all around it peripheral awareness

106
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,360
it su supports you with a feeling of pleasure

107
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,360
pleasantness

108
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,360
however subtle it might be

109
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,920
you

110
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,920
you

111
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,919
you

112
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,919
you

113
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,360
if you're wanting one drink often thought

114
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,840
if you quiet your thinking mind

115
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:41,480
can you feel better the pleasure of being present here

116
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:57,320
and have that pleasure support the attention resting on breathing

117
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,919
you

118
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,919
you

119
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,840
okay

120
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,919
you

121
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,880
uh

122
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,919
you

123
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:48,559
if something within you is a little bit calmer or settled

124
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,960
than when you started meditating

125
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:01,679
perhaps you can feel the pleasantness of that calm or subtleness

126
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:15,279
no matter how subtle it is and gently breathe with it

127
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,320
breathe through it

128
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,480
and then from with whatever is pleasant

129
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:56,720
enjoyable has a feeling of rightness within you

130
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,919
from that place turning your attention outwards

131
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:12,078
to those of you here to the people sitting in this room

132
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,158
to the people online to the others who are sitting online

133
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,720
meditating now

134
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:30,919
and see if there's a simple way to

135
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:43,960
consider the people around you in the context of your pleasant feeling

136
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:57,440
perhaps wishing for them some of the same pleasantness

137
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:04,160
calmness ease that you're experiencing now or that you

138
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,680
have experienced in the past

139
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,839
and to end this meditation

140
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,599
with the aspiration the wish

141
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:32,720
for the welfare of others may all beings

142
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:40,400
be happy may all beings be safe

143
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,240
may all beings be peaceful

144
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,119
and may all beings be free

145
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
um

146
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,040
hmm

147
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,838
so hello everyone and welcome

148
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,839
and the topic for today is

149
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:07,359
dharmic pleasure the pleasure that comes from dharma

150
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:13,359
practice and one of the principles that

151
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:19,599
i'm going to offer is the principle that sometimes

152
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:26,640
what is unpleasant can be overcome by what is pleasant

153
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:33,200
sometimes pain can be overcome by pleasure

154
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,560
or dealt with through pleasure but not just any pleasantness or any

155
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:44,000
pleasure but what can be called dharmic pleasure

156
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:51,520
so what is that there's a story in the suttos teachings of the buddha

157
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:57,359
about uh it's possible it's the the buddha's cousin

158
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:02,320
who is a layperson who comes to the buddha and he says

159
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,320
uh i have this preoccupation

160
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:14,560
that is getting in my way and i can't really

161
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,838
make progress in the dharma or something because there's preoccupation

162
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,640
and uh and the preoccupation is overly attached

163
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:33,280
to sensual pleasure and so that's a sensual pleasure is an obstacle because

164
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:40,720
i'm constantly thinking about it or imagining it or wanting it or something concerned with it

165
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,520
and the buddha says that's the way it is that if you're uh if you're preoccupied

166
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:54,240
and caught up in sensual pleasure it's really hard to make progress on the dharma path

167
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:03,520
and back in ancient india and in buddhist time there was other religious traditions

168
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:09,760
that saw this as well that uh that sensual pleasures of all kinds were

169
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,880
an obstacle to some kind of spiritual progress

170
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:21,920
and they advocated asceticism sometimes a radical denial of all pleasure and all that sometimes actually

171
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,960
intentional taking on the pain there are some people who believe that you can only overcome pain with pain

172
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,800
so you know get into it and uh

173
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,599
and so he said yeah that's uh but so the buddha agreed with a man yeah there can be an obstacle

174
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,720
in preoccupation essential pleasure and then remarkably the buddha said that

175
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,240
before i was enlightened i also was preoccupied with sensual

176
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,920
pleasures in a way that interfered with my practice interfered with things

177
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:05,599
so he knew intimately for himself how this can work and then he says the only way

178
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:11,040
something like this the way to overcome this preoccupation concern

179
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:17,040
is through pleasure is through what i'm calling dharmic pleasure he doesn't use that term

180
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,160
epidharmic pleasure that there is a kind of pleasure you can

181
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,800
cultivate that

182
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:34,079
has an antidote to the preoccupation with sensual pleasure

183
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:41,839
and one way to see this is that there is another kind of pleasure a feeling of wellness of goodness of

184
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:47,440
of uh that is a reconditioning factor

185
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,680
and uh we're very dif very strongly influenced by the conditions in which we live in

186
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,359
and that we say we can be conditioned by them they're a lifelong kind of conditioning

187
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:05,119
so people who live with constant threat growing up can be conditioned to be afraid and

188
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:12,640
anxious and wherever they go they're kind of have their eyes open looking at how to be safe because they feel that's what they've learned taken in

189
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,400
there are people who have been horribly wounded scarred emotionally by what happens to

190
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,640
them and that and that creates a conditioning that creates a

191
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,640
kind of an influence that leads a lasting impression and a lasting perspective in which to look at the

192
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:37,440
world like the world is a dangerous place because people are threatening or something

193
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,240
and there's all these series of conditionings we have some people receive the conditioning

194
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:50,640
that you're successful if you have a lot of pleasure and so you should really and you get you

195
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:56,480
get rewarded for having sensual pleasure and so you want to have lots of pleasure because that's how you feel rewarded you

196
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,000
feel good and feel like everything's okay in the world and that's been the conditioning now over and over again that's been

197
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:09,119
reinforced in different kinds of ways and and these kinds of conditionings can

198
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:15,839
lead to an intensity around the pursuit of sensual pleasure of all kinds

199
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:20,880
it could certainly can be sexual it can be the pleasure of

200
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,440
alcohol and drugs it can be the pleasures of the intellect

201
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,280
pleasures of adventures pleasures of a daredevil who just you know engaged

202
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:39,200
and fully absorbed in some kind of thing that has their it brings their attention fully into the

203
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:46,400
present moment and clears out everything else it feels so alive and so connected some people fear

204
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,960
uh you know and doing things that are frightening brings a kind of aliveness they don't have any other time in their life and so that feels so good to have

205
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:59,040
that aliveness there was a

206
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,400
i remember many years i told this story a few times many years ago i saw a little documentary

207
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,880
about a man who had spent his early part of his adult life

208
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,640
spending a lot of time like on the weekends riding his motorcycle all over and that's how he cleared his mind and

209
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,839
got ready for work and enjoyed just driving his big motorcycle around him

210
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:27,119
but then uh he and his wife had a baby

211
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:33,119
and he couldn't spend the weekend away on his motorcycle so he had to find a quicker way to clear

212
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:40,720
his mind and be ready to start fresh and everything so he took up the the sport

213
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,319
of uh paragliding and it looked this typical kind of paraglider kind of apparently i don't

214
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:52,640
know if that's the right word but he could put it into a packet into a backpack and uh

215
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:59,920
and then early in the morning at dawn he would climb up in these skyscrapers that were being built in his city

216
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:05,920
so it was still kind of open and everything but he would sneak sneak into the into the building climb up to the top

217
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,960
and and then he would jump from the top into the street below where there's no

218
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:16,000
traffic yet just as dawn was happening and he had a friend with a car a getaway

219
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:23,200
car waiting down below to drive off drive to hikimov and that's how he cleared his mind

220
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:30,000
you know and that's how you know he something good happened and he felt alive and good and present

221
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:35,359
so there's all these ways in which we are pursuing some kind of feeling of

222
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:40,400
feelings alive and good and that sometimes involves pursuit of

223
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:47,760
pleasure or exp having getting experience in life good things

224
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:53,359
and uh and sometimes those kinds of pursuits

225
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:58,720
don't really fill us don't really meet some deeper need that we have

226
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:05,359
and in fact as we almost need to can repeat the same pleasure in order to be distracted from some deeper wound some

227
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:10,800
deeper loneliness some deeper angst some deeper

228
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:17,040
depression some deeper or something and and so people then repeat the same thing

229
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:23,680
rather you're yearning for more and more and more so the buddha said that

230
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,960
what's you know that they said yeah that way doesn't work

231
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:35,839
but in order to kind of not have this pursuit of central pleasure be an obstacle

232
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:42,960
you have to experience a non-sensual pleasure a pleasure that's not of the physical

233
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:50,400
senses and a pleasure which he used the word unwholesome when it's not unwholesome that

234
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,839
uh unless unskillful and so and then what he used as an

235
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:02,720
example for this was the certain kind of pleasure that comes from meditation practice

236
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:09,920
that a certain kind of joy and well-being and happiness that can well up from the inside

237
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:16,480
and this idea of welling up from the inside is a is a

238
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,920
very different source for a sense of well-being than the sense of

239
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:28,720
pleasure or even well-being that can come from getting stimulated by good experiences from the

240
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:35,680
outside in so it might feel really good to have a really good meal tasty meal your

241
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,720
favorite meal and there's nothing wrong with that but if you're simply taking in the

242
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:45,920
pleasure of it that's uh what you're being then it's only of the

243
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,200
senses if the person who made the meal for you

244
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:56,480
did it with a lot of love and it touched something inside of you like wow

245
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,599
this feels i can feel the generosity and the goodness of this person who's doing something

246
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:07,760
that could touch something that's not of the senses that might touch your heart in some way

247
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:14,319
and that has a very different impact on us than the conditioning that comes from just just the senses just the pleasure

248
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:19,680
of the food it's not the food that we're benefiting from the most it's rather the

249
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:28,000
goodness of it so a story i like to tell is my you know a lasting impression that still with me

250
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:35,040
it probably was a at the time i didn't know it was it conditioned me it had his lifelong influence on me

251
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:42,640
but was staying at my grandmother's house when i was like maybe somewhere between seven and ten

252
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:50,400
and waking up in the mornings beautiful light and staying in bed with this all wooden room is in norway

253
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,760
with a norwegian comforter and this bright norwegian light coming in through the window and just being all cozy

254
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,800
reading donald duck magazines in norwegian

255
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:07,359
and uh she would bring in a tray with toast butter and cheese on it

256
00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:15,119
and uh and it was nice i would stay in bed eating the toast you know with the reading the donald duck magazines

257
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:20,400
but uh somehow not unbeknownst to me at that time

258
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:27,280
i was taking in the goodness the safety the warmth the love of that situation of my grandmother

259
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:34,319
and i still carry inmate with me that feeling that memory of that goodness so certainly the toast with cheese was

260
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:40,079
pleasant essentially but it was some deeper

261
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:45,760
feeling that well spring from inside something deeper was born or was awoken

262
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:51,599
or was allowed that did something special just a simple thing she did

263
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:59,520
and uh and so and so to awaken this wellspring

264
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:04,960
something that can goodness a pleasure that can arise from the inside out

265
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:12,800
and not continually looking for it in the world is the the path of the dharma

266
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:18,400
certainly it could have been my lifelong pursuit is to find someone who was just like my

267
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,760
grandmother and make sure i had got the right kind of comforter the right kind of wooden

268
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:30,160
bed and make sure that they brought the toast and butter in every morning at the right time of day

269
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:35,680
when the light was shining through getting just to get everything set up and have someone who's just just like my

270
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:42,000
grandmother and so that that somehow but that's just that i think in a strict

271
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:50,079
way that in buddhism is just trying to get the world of the senses just organized around you

272
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:55,920
to try to replicate something but what is it to

273
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,119
but in dharma practice what we're doing is we're not looking at external world for this

274
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:09,599
but we're looking to see how can we awaken something inside that becomes a reconditioning

275
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:16,640
that dissipates any kind of attachment to comfort sensual comfort physical comfort

276
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:22,720
any kind of attachment to sensual or physical pleasure any kind of attachments to

277
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:30,960
physical or sensual stimulation of any kind at all including intellectual stimulation

278
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,400
and the so the buddha said you can't really overcome this addiction or preoccupation with this kind of physical

279
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,838
pleasure sensual pleasure without this dharmic pleasure

280
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:48,880
and uh you know one of the ways he talked about this dharmic pleasure more his language

281
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:55,558
he called it a pleasure not of the flesh

282
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:05,680
so not of the flesh meaning nothing physical was being stimulated

283
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:11,839
and so have you had any experiences where there was enough sense of well-being of

284
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:18,480
safety of quiet of comfort or something setting and the environment

285
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:24,480
was just right that you felt something not so much nourished from the outside

286
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:31,200
but allowed something inside to settle to open to be at ease to feel safe

287
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:38,160
so that there was a wellspring within that began to flow and move through you

288
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:44,559
it requires being in a different way than most people are i think in their ordinary life

289
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:50,880
where maybe we're just keeping ourselves busy we have a to-do list we're doing this and that we're trying to maybe just

290
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,960
be busy or keep ourselves entertained like you know some people have

291
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:02,839
do what's called it's a term i only learned a few years ago binge

292
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:09,200
watching uh you know there's some kind of tv program that just like there's all these series you can watch like 10

293
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:15,119
series and in one day stay up all night

294
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:21,920
so that might be physically placed this buddha would call kind of a pleasure of the senses

295
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:28,400
but it doesn't create the environment the situation the context that awakens something from the inside

296
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:34,720
out probably not and so what uh

297
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:40,720
so meditation for the buddha was he presented that as the means

298
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:48,960
for this deeper healing pleasure that's possible to have

299
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:54,640
and uh you know he didn't have netflix he didn't have all the things we have in

300
00:52:54,640 --> 00:53:00,800
the modern world that people use you know to try to assuage

301
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:06,480
how they're feeling uncomfortable and so the buddha said buddha did not

302
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:12,839
teach that you overcome pain with pain he taught you overcome

303
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:18,160
pleasure you overcome pain with pleasure

304
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:24,720
he did not say you overcome pleasure with pain he said you overcome pleasure with

305
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:31,920
pleasure and overcome here means overcoming our attachments or preoccupation or fixation

306
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:38,160
so whether things are the vexation has to do with things that are pleasant or the fixation has to do with things

307
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:43,839
that are unpleasant both are uh kind of healed

308
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:51,359
through feeling this dharmic well-being this dharmic pleasure and so the art of

309
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:58,079
of discovering a way of feeling a certain kind of inner pleasure or well-being

310
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:06,000
and letting that be the context in which you experience your life so i'll give you an example for me

311
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,440
it's not dramatic but maybe you can fill in a way that's meaningful for you

312
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:17,680
it was probably something like this happens to many of you like sometimes i sit down a bit had a busy day

313
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:25,200
doing a lot of things or something or a lot of feelings a lot of something going on and i sit down to meditate

314
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:31,839
and i discover that my breathing is not relaxed there's kind of i'm contracted in the

315
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:37,280
chest a little bit and if i sit and feel that it actually feels unpleasant

316
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:43,520
on the top of the inhale but what i do is i

317
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:51,520
relax a bit around it and i feel it's not doesn't have to be dramatic very subtle sense of well-being

318
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,880
or pleasure in the wider body the global body

319
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:01,920
part of it's a pleasure that comes from just the pleasure or the goodness

320
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:07,280
of being conscious of things just being aware of things

321
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:14,160
it feels good for me and then i'll as i stay focusing on my breathing

322
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:21,520
i just contentedly feel the discomfort of my breathing without making it a problem

323
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:29,520
and but i feel the discomfort in this wider field of pleasure of pleasantness of goodness

324
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,559
that's there so i can end up being feeling very content

325
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:41,119
feeling the discomfort because it's not the f it's not the whole picture

326
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:46,720
it's not ever not it's not not the i'm not fixated on it

327
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:52,000
early in my meditation practice many years ago i would have gotten so caught up and

328
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,319
preoccupied oh i shouldn't be breathing that way this is a problem i'm a bad meditator what do i have to do to stop having this

329
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:06,079
discomfort i'm not supposed to have it and i've got what i i tied myself in knots around these kinds of things

330
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:13,280
and because of this kind of negativity by us perhaps or this idea that supposed to you know deal with these problems i'm

331
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:21,200
supposed to be just everything's supposed to be different and now i just oh look at that

332
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:28,240
i guess the cause the conditions of the day my breathing is a little bit is uncomfortable

333
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:34,000
and it's okay and and i feel that discomfort in this wider feeling of

334
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:41,040
pleasure and that has healed my tendency to be preoccupied the

335
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:49,040
shoulds the judgments the idea that i'm wrong something relaxes that way

336
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:57,040
and so this idea of there's a dharmic pleasure

337
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:03,359
a pleasure not of the senses not of the flesh something that kind of is belongs more

338
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:08,400
to the wellspring that we allow for that we open up to

339
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:14,319
and then we allow ourselves to be conditioned by it there's an art allowing ourselves to be

340
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:20,319
influenced by that and perhaps in your daily life there are moments

341
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:25,960
situations where you feel something like this

342
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:32,880
but maybe you're not you don't linger long enough in it you just have to go you know

343
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:38,079
you know you have your to-do list okay let's go to the next thing you jump in your car and you're tense

344
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:43,680
driving but the fact that you just were in the park with a friend and and going for a nice walk and feeling

345
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:48,960
kind of peaceful that's besides the point once you get in your car to go to the next important

346
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:54,240
thing but what about lingering or staying with

347
00:57:54,240 --> 00:58:00,559
these feelings some of these dharmic pleasures can

348
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:06,799
we benefit the most if we allow them to take them in we let them oh this is good

349
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:15,200
in spite of the fact that i feel unhappy right today there is also this goodness here

350
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:20,480
if we get preoccupied with our unhappiness we're going to be

351
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,760
probably more likely influenced by the unflapping happiness

352
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:34,079
in a negative way but if we allow ourselves to be unhappy but feel it in a wider field

353
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:39,839
of something that feels easeful or pleasant or open

354
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:47,280
then that can be an influence that heals some of unhappiness

355
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:54,319
so what are some of the things that we can feel some of it is a global awareness of the

356
00:58:54,319 --> 00:59:00,480
body that's bigger than any particular place where we feel uncomfortable or feel pain

357
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:05,920
in the body it's not always available to us but there might be some feeling of

358
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:11,760
subtle vibration or subtle energy flow or subtle tingling

359
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:18,720
or subtle spaciousness one of the things that's happened to me over the years of practice

360
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:24,640
i have a lot of space in my body now at least that's what it feels like to me

361
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:31,119
it looks like a very spacious beautiful big place in there i closed my eyes and i was so surprised when i went to

362
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:37,520
some years ago i started going once a year to a in a community college nearby that has a

363
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:42,880
anatomy lab where they spend time with the cadaver it's all get cut open you can see the

364
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,000
inside and i was so surprised there's no space in there

365
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,599
it's just packed with organs and everything like wow they don't have any space but i have

366
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:59,680
lots of space this this space is not real space but it's the space that of

367
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:05,440
you know just somehow i experience i feel the space i feel

368
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:11,920
spacious very inside and around very spacious and that spaciousness feels nice

369
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:17,200
when i was younger i would have didn't think that space like that was something to focus on

370
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:22,880
now i feel that it's kind of like you go into a big big

371
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:29,760
sacred space and it's a space in the high ceilings then everything that somehow makes the place feel kind

372
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:36,960
of sacred or quiet or peaceful and so to feel the spaciousness within

373
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,880
for me as a positive conditioning force

374
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:49,200
sometimes it's uh it's uh some of the things that we do

375
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:57,200
that has a positive influence because of the goodness of doing it being generous

376
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:03,680
not giving but a giving which is generous

377
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:11,599
or giving that has a feeling of love with it or honesty

378
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:18,640
not the honesty that's a duty but the honesty that sets something free inside you're not hiding or contracted

379
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:24,240
it's making it decontracts us and to feel that feel the goodness of

380
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:29,680
honesty of truthfulness the

381
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:36,799
kindness compassion the kind of kindness and compassion

382
01:01:36,799 --> 01:01:42,000
again there's not a should and not a duty not a like you know

383
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:49,440
i'm supposed to i'm you know i'm a good buddhist i'm supposed to be this way i'm going to kind of buckle down to be kind

384
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:55,680
but rather to discover how to open and allow for a softness a

385
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:01,839
tenderness where of course you want to be kind of course that's good

386
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:08,160
and all these things learning how to do these things in a way discovering your way

387
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:15,599
not someone else's way we're doing living going through life you do things you speak things you act

388
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:22,480
in ways that feels really good for you on the inside out

389
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:29,599
some people sometimes say in buddhism they talk about actions which are beautiful

390
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:36,400
but i think the beauty is not the external grace in which you do things but rather the feeling of beauty from

391
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:42,000
the inside out as you do it and what does it take to do things in a

392
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,359
beautiful way i don't think you can do them in a hurry

393
01:02:47,359 --> 01:02:53,920
i think hurry interferes with any of this deeper

394
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:59,839
well-being that can recondition us and heal us and show us something different

395
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:06,240
so it requires something of us and one of the things it requires is non-hurry

396
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:14,079
to feel to be present one of the forms of primary forms of

397
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:19,920
dharmic pleasure that the buddha emphasized for this purpose this reconditioning purpose this

398
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:25,200
way of overcoming preoccupation with sensual pleasure

399
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:31,119
was the kind of well-being that arises when we get

400
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:37,440
our attention becomes unified organized in a unified way

401
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:42,720
to be fully engaged absorbed in one thing

402
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:48,319
i say that very carefully and all these all those words because i could have said when we just

403
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:53,440
get concentrated on one thing but to say concentrated some people then

404
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:59,359
get fixated this tight attention they bear down they narrow down to

405
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:04,640
really stay and be present and that is not the unified

406
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:10,839
composed attention with which we get organized

407
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:16,480
around being absorbed in one thing

408
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:24,640
and so some of some of you maybe have felt a wonderful feeling of maybe well-being

409
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:30,559
being absorbed and reading a good novel just it just feels so good just to be like you know if the world around you

410
01:04:30,559 --> 01:04:37,200
falls away you get pulled into the novel some of you might have the craft you do

411
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:42,720
where you're you could say i'm absorbed absorbing the craft but you're not fixating on any one part of the craft

412
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:49,520
it's the whole phenomena that feels good and you make you might be idly thinking about things that

413
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:55,520
but your your mind hasn't stopped thinking but everything is organized around the craft or playing a musical

414
01:04:55,520 --> 01:05:02,640
instrument or doing art or going for a walk sometimes in a natural setting

415
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:09,839
so in meditation that's the kind of absorption that is possible

416
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:16,559
that uh the buddha was emphasizing that gives birth to a deeper sense of

417
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:22,480
well-springing of well-being of joy of happiness of

418
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:28,079
delight and that we're allowed to feel pleasure

419
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:36,319
dharmic pleasure we're allowed to feel good in fact to to be fixated

420
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:44,480
on what's uncomfortable what's difficult emotionally physically

421
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:51,680
in the world the fixation is a bad influence on us

422
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:55,200
the fixation is stressful

423
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:03,119
we don't have to ignore the difficulties we have but we can hold them

424
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:10,400
in a different context than one that's told by the being fixated on it and so they to using meditation to begin

425
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:16,319
relaxing the fixations softening the way we get preoccupied by things

426
01:06:16,319 --> 01:06:22,799
opening up the developing a soft receptive floating awareness

427
01:06:22,799 --> 01:06:27,839
an awareness because it's not fixated can start becoming aware of the

428
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:33,920
peripheral context of this of our situation

429
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:38,960
and by the way peripheral context what i mean is

430
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:44,000
uh if we're involved with our breathing for example that's the primary center of our

431
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,520
attention meditating we're not only taking in the breathing

432
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:56,240
hanging on for dear life but we're also the peripheral attention takes in the goodness

433
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:02,880
the subtle very subtle perhaps pleasure well-being of the situation we're in maybe

434
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:09,759
physically to feel where where does feel good

435
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:16,640
and there's often more more goodness more pleasure than most people take advantage of

436
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:22,960
and here's a here's an example that i find kind of fascinating

437
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:28,960
if i feel tense in my body it feels uncomfortable

438
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:35,520
i can relax attention and then notice that i'm tensed somewhere else

439
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:39,838
and you try to deal with that or something else is a problem

440
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:46,799
but what happened was that in i ignored the fact that as i released the tension

441
01:07:46,799 --> 01:07:54,480
there was a feeling of subtle pleasure relief in my shoulders as i relaxed

442
01:07:54,480 --> 01:08:02,400
so what should i focus on the the tension the painful tension

443
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:10,720
that i'm glad went away or the pleasure that replaced it

444
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:16,798
the same relaxation happens but am i keep focusing on what's

445
01:08:16,799 --> 01:08:22,159
negative or can i focus on the positive side of it

446
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:28,000
so there's many situations where i learned to relax for example

447
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:33,278
and feel the goodness of the relaxation that i wouldn't have done early in my

448
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:38,798
life because i'm because i'm just going barreling ahead with one preoccupation

449
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:44,880
concern after the other check that off relax the shoulders what's next to do

450
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:50,000
what's what's the next thing to worry about but again this idea of not hurrying and

451
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:55,278
taking the time and chances are there's more

452
01:08:55,279 --> 01:09:01,359
non-sensual pleasure dharmic pleasure that's available in any given time than

453
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:10,080
you than you allow that you recognize i've sat at meetings and been impatient

454
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:17,440
and the impatient didn't go away but by somehow settling into my body i could feel there was wider in my body

455
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:23,920
there was in fact a sense of feeling a little bit alive nicely vital relaxing

456
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:31,040
that created a different context for feeling the impatience and uh earlier in my life i would have

457
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:37,440
just kind of been caught by the impatience now i know better

458
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:45,920
now i think oh i'm impatient what else is going on here and can i feel that larger context

459
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:51,359
of just the pleasure of just being alive right now and now

460
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:57,040
breathe with the impatience now i'll be with it so i'm not fixated on it it's being held

461
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:04,320
in a wider context so i call this the peripheral attention

462
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:10,239
and uh and to float the attention between the central focus and the peripheral

463
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:16,400
to be focus on the on the central focus of what needs to be needs attention but to

464
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:23,040
hold that with the peripheral attention of what feels good which feels pleasant that supports this ability to get

465
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:28,880
absorbed composed gathered around unified about something

466
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:33,920
and then lo and behold this uh this kind of staying very very

467
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:40,400
still and quiet and absorbed in something like the breathing or other things

468
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:46,800
i can start producing this deeper wellsprings and i keep using the word wellsprings because the buddha and talking about

469
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:54,080
this kind of absorption uses the metaphor analogy of an underground spring underwater

470
01:10:54,080 --> 01:11:01,199
spring in a lake a wellspring of water that flows into the lake from below

471
01:11:01,199 --> 01:11:06,320
and uh i think it uses that metaphor uh purposefully because that's how it can

472
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:13,120
feel inside of us that this wellspring with us flows from someplace within and flows outward and

473
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:18,960
through the body this vibration this energy this tingling this

474
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:24,080
warmth this glow whatever it might i don't know how the right term for you is

475
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:29,360
and so to allow ourselves give yourself time to feel make room for some other

476
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:37,440
way of feeling they take the time and room to feel dharmic pleasure

477
01:11:38,159 --> 01:11:44,640
and in this way pleasure overcomes attachment to pleasure

478
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:51,199
isn't that convenient and the buddha was very specific about

479
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:56,560
in the context of ancient india that we don't use

480
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:03,120
pain to overcome pleasure we don't use pain to overcome pain

481
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:08,480
but for him you use we use pleasure to overcome the preoccupation both with

482
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:13,679
pain and pleasure and so

483
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:20,840
how might this work for you i suspect that

484
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:27,520
uh probably for many of you i probably didn't speak about this very well in a way that

485
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:33,120
was specific enough for you but i hope what it did was at least turn the mirror

486
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:38,800
back to yourself and to see you know what is there some way that you know

487
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:44,320
in your terms and your experience what i'm talking about i've been talking about something that would be useful for

488
01:12:44,320 --> 01:12:51,280
you to take more time with and make room for and not be in a hurry for

489
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:57,040
and not be tricked by the mind's preoccupations and the

490
01:12:57,040 --> 01:13:02,080
mind's to-do list and the mind's previous conditioning

491
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:08,640
that maybe gets you kind of constantly on the treadmill of doing things which are actually

492
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:15,040
continue being a poor influence on you but being able to shift in gears

493
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:21,198
to allow a healthy appropriate new influence new conditioning

494
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:27,199
that allows you then to take in and benefit

495
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:32,400
from the deeper and deeper way that mindfulness can make gather you together to be

496
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:38,800
really present for your experience so just there's more and more nurturing there's more and more healing there's

497
01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:45,280
more and more goodness and pleasure

498
01:13:45,280 --> 01:13:51,440
in the practice so uh

499
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:58,960
i hope this is uh something that you can identify in yourself and find useful and

500
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:04,960
thank you for being here today and we have a couple of minutes would anyone like to ask any questions about this or

501
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:08,080
clarifications or

502
01:14:10,080 --> 01:14:13,640
or anything else

503
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:22,239
here behind you bill i'll try those of you online i'll try to look at the chat and see if you have a

504
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:28,159
question but this question may be somewhat unclear

505
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:33,600
even to myself what are the gray areas between dharmic pleasure and the sensual

506
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:39,360
pressure where you can't tell the difference which one are you now engaged in

507
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:45,120
yes aware that the gray area where we can't tell the difference between dharmic pleasure and

508
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:50,560
sensual pleasure sometimes they come together that's part of the reason why it's not so clear

509
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:57,040
and so it takes some time to be able to allow for both to be there not assume that it can be it should only be one or

510
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:02,800
the other there's nothing inherently wrong with sensual pleasure and so

511
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:08,880
so in buddhism we're not dismissing sensual pleasure off hand it's the attachment to it

512
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:14,159
but so and as we feel this uh so so dismissing it or feeling that sensual

513
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:19,520
pleasure is wrong doesn't allow us to see how they operate they can operate together they can both

514
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:25,800
be there thank you very much blessing

515
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:45,920
gil i remember a quote that i think is from the verses of the elder nuns i'm not sure

516
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:51,600
that part of your talk reminded me of i take delight and attention to all

517
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:58,080
suffering states i take delight and attention to all suffering states that's how i remember it well that's a great

518
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:04,640
one yeah that's a good fantastic so i think it's a it's a uh

519
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:10,320
i think it's a common assumption by people that if you're suffering

520
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:16,640
that's suffering by itself that's all that all that's going on because of this negativity bias because of the

521
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:21,840
preoccupation with it because the ways which are thinking get so pulled into

522
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:27,199
that world that we're just thinking about it all the time but to learn to not be caught in

523
01:16:27,199 --> 01:16:32,960
thoughts to learn how to open up attention into a wider field

524
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:39,760
and just the idea of discovering the preciousness of being conscious of being mindful being aware

525
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:46,480
and how awareness of something can feel pleasant enjoyable or just a rightness

526
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:53,920
to it there's freedom in in the awareness of it so so it's possible to be aware

527
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:59,040
of suffering states and actually feel joy

528
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:05,600
like when i talked about feeling my discomfort with my breathing sometimes when i kind of turn towards it with the

529
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:11,440
spacious mind and body and feel it just my ability to do that i sometimes

530
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:17,600
get a little smile oh look at that it's so good to be mindful

531
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:24,719
and whereas in the past i wouldn't have noticed that so so that i suspected something like that

532
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:31,199
so as i say it again i take the light and attention toward

533
01:17:31,199 --> 01:17:37,760
all suffering states yeah it's a lot better than alternative

534
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,040
anything else

535
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:57,880
or is everyone else here online are you speaking about leaning into the pain

536
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:03,520
leaning into the pain well you know that might be fun that might if with the right kind of

537
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:07,920
mindfulness and attention that could be fun

538
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:16,960
but not but so i wouldn't rule it out but i'm not really encouraging people to lean into the pain but if you have pain

539
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:22,719
to begin with you want to be wise about it and you want to have lots of options and be able

540
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:30,480
to find your way with it and uh and one of the ways to find your way with it is to hold the pain

541
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:37,360
uh in in a wider field of pleasure well-being or freedom of attention or something just hold it in awareness

542
01:18:37,360 --> 01:18:44,080
without being caught by it and one of the things that does is it allows us to

543
01:18:44,080 --> 01:18:49,920
see the pain more clearly so we can be wiser about what to do with

544
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:57,120
it and there's lots of options so it might be that we should take an aspirin

545
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:02,400
it might be that we should ignore it and it might be that we should

546
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:09,040
you know really bring careful attention to really feel it closely and intimately there's so

547
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:14,880
many choices you know but whatever but you first have to stop long enough

548
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:20,159
to check it out so anyway that's my response to that

549
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:26,719
question so okay

550
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:36,280
so maybe that's enough you know i kind of feel like

551
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:43,760
i just gave you a hot potato and now you have it to practice it

552
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:49,920
and hopefully you get dharmically warmed by it in a nice

553
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:54,520
way thank you very much
