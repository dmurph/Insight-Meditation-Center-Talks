1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:08,480
hello again so my name is Maria

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,400
strotman and um I have been around IMC for something

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:23,640
over 25 years as a student and a teacher of the

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:31,599
Dharma and I use those two words interchangeably

5
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:38,399
teacher and student because the one thing I'm sure

6
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,559
of is that I don't know I don't

7
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:52,120
know there are many things I don't know and the things that I'm sure of I'm

8
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:58,920
unsure of in the last few

9
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,240
weeks we have been talking about nonh

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,759
hatred how do we deal with conflict how are we in the midst of the

11
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:19,759
unacceptable and floating around in the back of my mind is well we really have to talk about forgiveness and because

12
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,040
I've been talking about forgiveness to a number of students over the last few

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,119
months and have to deal with the fact that basically they are rejecting what I

14
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:40,520
say I've had to think about why is that why is it that what I say about

15
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,159
forgiveness comes across as something that's just not possible how do we

16
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:53,320
forgive what is unacceptable you know on the face of it

17
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,560
they just don't go together if it's unacceptable how can I forgive

18
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:07,399
it I can't say it's okay I'll just forget

19
00:02:07,399 --> 00:02:12,440
it so the good news is that's what not what I mean by

20
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:16,800
forgiveness it's not what I mean by

21
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,879
forgiveness so I'm going to spend a little bit of time talking about what we

22
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:29,040
mean when we say forgiveness and what I mean when I say forgiveness and why we

23
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,640
get tank l in this I can't let go of this harm that you have done

24
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,840
me so so one of the things that's true is when we think about forgiveness we

25
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:47,720
are used to thinking of it almost as a transaction you have harmed me you now

26
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:54,040
owe me there is a debt to be paid there is a need for Retribution there's rep

27
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:02,280
reparations you must apologize you must pay me back there there's a need to even things

28
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:08,799
up you know we we kind of think of it as a balance somehow somehow the word

29
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:17,640
forgiveness has taken on a connotation of something bought and

30
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,760
sold something that where there there is this transaction between one activity

31
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,680
and and another but

32
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,920
forgiveness is actually a state of mind and it's a state of mind that has

33
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:42,680
to do with what one holds in one's heart what do you hold in your heart

34
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,159
what do I hold in my

35
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,120
heart so what do we do how do we live with hatred and

36
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,280
conflict and ill will and the uncertain certainties that

37
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,560
come with them how do we keep from falling into

38
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,439
anger and ill will when someone harms us when someone is doing something that we

39
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:19,919
find abhorent how do we keep from falling into that feeling of you must not only

40
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:27,800
you must be stopped but you must pay back that payback feature somehow has gotten embedded in

41
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,400
our idea of forgiveness if I forgive you then I'm telling you it's

42
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:40,840
okay really huh I don't intend to say it's

43
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,720
okay I don't intend to say that it's all

44
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,039
right the dictionary says that uh forgiveness is to cease to feel

45
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:57,280
resentment against on account of a wrong

46
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,880
committed that's the dictionary differ to cease to feel

47
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:10,280
resistance resentment ah now now we're getting

48
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:15,880
closer resentment how could you how could you

49
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:21,160
have done that to me how could they do that to

50
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,520
them and the buildup of that resentment you know I've lived long

51
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:35,400
enough that a lot of bad things have happened in my life things that I've been resentful

52
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,639
about things that have been harmful to me things I thought were

53
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:51,120
wrong some of those things I carried around with me for a very very very long

54
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:05,759
time and in letting go of those things I didn't pardon them I didn't absolve

55
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,960
people it's not as if forgiveness is necessarily tied to

56
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,360
confession I was raised Catholic so you know I got used to going in saying

57
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:26,000
confession and the priest would tell me how many Hail Marys I had to say so that I could wipe those sins

58
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,880
away you know this tendency to say if I do something bad that I have to pay for

59
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:39,280
it yeah I can see some I can see some reason for

60
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,960
Retribution but the person who's holding the other end of that string and saying

61
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,800
I'm not going to let go of that string I'm going to tie myself to you the question is why why are you tying

62
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:58,400
yourself to that bad event why am I tying myself to my

63
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,520
ex-husband's foibles what's that

64
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:11,800
about why am I carrying around resistance resentment for someone

65
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:19,199
stealing my work and Publishing it why why why why hold on to it what

66
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,440
difference does it make it makes a difference real difference it's a

67
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:31,319
harming but holding on to the resentment is not harming anybody but me

68
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:43,000
that's the part that part of the suffering I don't want to hold on to that anymore that's the part that we get rid

69
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,879
of in in forgiveness so there are lots of definitions for for uh synonyms for for

70
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:56,080
forgiveness things like pardon remission Indulgence understanding tolerance

71
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,840
somehow all of those seem to give somebody a pass right right I don't want to give anybody a pass I don't want to

72
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:08,280
say it's okay I don't want to say it doesn't

73
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,039
matter I might want to provide people with Mercy with

74
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:20,039
clemency that kind of forgiveness where I say okay okay but

75
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:25,599
suppose suppose I decide I'm going to forgive you because now you're going to owe

76
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:32,000
me H now we're back into the transaction phase and it's not Mercy at

77
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,880
all it's something entirely different now it's much more

78
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,200
vengeful or

79
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:50,120
greedy I've known people who have totally destroyed relationships because

80
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:57,200
they're waiting for an apology if if you can't apologize to me

81
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,480
that's it it's over really over an

82
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:14,360
apology because there's so much weight on that apology it has something to do with who I am and what I mean and who

83
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:20,800
you are and what you mean and we really load up these things that are

84
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:28,079
harmful and we build them into something we create we we create a harm story and

85
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:36,760
then when it starts to fade we build it up again we retell the story so that we can be angry

86
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:48,120
again and Wars full of savagery and cruelty have Arisen from murderous

87
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,959
attacks not everything is

88
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:02,839
Trivial when harm is done we tend to establish blame we measure the amount of

89
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:09,000
harm we vow we're not going to forget them we're not going to forget this

90
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,560
source of harm we don't condem condone this

91
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,440
behavior and therefore you need to be

92
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:28,040
punished and we measure it out you know so much punishment for so much

93
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
offense

94
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:44,920
somehow we need to step away from this tendency to take those who harm us as

95
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:51,560
somehow directing against me and mine and who I am and what I am the

96
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:57,440
self-interest of the harm the

97
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
self-interest

98
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:13,120
when we look at it from the Buddhist point of view there there is what we call a forgiveness practice and it's

99
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:21,160
usually best based on a couple of different ideas one of which is don't hold hatred in one's heart non-h hatred

100
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:30,079
the practice of non-h hatred which is kind of where I'm going to go with this the importance of forgiving oneself

101
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:37,040
so that we don't turn harm against us and turn it into self-criticism and uh a

102
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:45,600
belief that this wouldn't have happened if I'd been a better person and and the third one is non- clinging

103
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,480
non- clinging don't hold on to that

104
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,959
string but how do we refer to the process of letting go of the past

105
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:08,079
without saying something about pretending there wasn't any hurt or granting somebody a free pass or making

106
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:14,040
an excuse for someone so at one point in my practice I decided that I was

107
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:20,560
carrying a lot of resentment toward my father and I spent a lot of time doing

108
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,839
forgiveness practice around my father and eventually I came to the

109
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:32,279
point where I said okay you know what he did the best he could do and I got to

110
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:37,480
let go of that and about the 150th time I heard myself say he did the best he

111
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,800
could do I realized I was making an excuse for him and what if it wasn't the

112
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:51,000
best he could do and I had to start the whole thing over again because I hadn't let go of it I

113
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,399
just made an excuse for it so one of the things about

114
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,240
forgiveness is you have to be brutally honest you have to really look at what you're

115
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:09,560
what you're deciding and why you're deciding it what am I saying about

116
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:16,680
it but to me forgiveness means renouncing the suffering of anger and

117
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:22,120
resentment renouncing the suffering that comes with anger and

118
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:30,760
resentment that's what forgiveness is it almost doesn't matter who the person is

119
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:42,519
myself EX's in my life governments doing things I don't

120
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:50,639
believe in the anger and the hatred I have to

121
00:13:50,639 --> 00:14:00,759
own the resentment I have to own they didn't create that I am

122
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:09,759
that's that's kind of tough really you know somebody harms you and then you have to take you have to take

123
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:15,320
responsibility for your response yep that's how it

124
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,800
works that's how it

125
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,959
works we have to stay in a place where we don't hold grudges or hold on to Old

126
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:33,040
hurts or arrive at a place where we don't hold

127
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:39,759
grudges or hold on to Old hurts because you know face it we all have

128
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,560
them but letting go of them is also

129
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,759
possible and then one day you wake up and you say what was the big

130
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:58,800
deal why was that so hard I still don't agree with what that

131
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:06,040
person did and I'm not going to go to them and say it was okay but I can go to them and

132
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:13,199
say you know what I'm free of you now I'm actually free of

133
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:19,240
that because I am not holding ill will toward

134
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,480
you because of that that's what freedom

135
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:31,880
is and that's what forgiveness is it's residing in the place where I am

136
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:38,279
not tied to that you know some people think that the

137
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:43,800
way to get through forgiveness towards someone that has offended you is to do

138
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:51,000
meta practice and it's it's useful to do meta practice you know wishing people well because it softens your heart or

139
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:57,319
tends to soften Your Heart Makes Your Heart more resilient more willing to

140
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,079
open but there's a tendency to think that if

141
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:09,680
you've harmed me I'm just going to wish you well and you know then everything will be great but what if you don't wish

142
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,959
them well what if you just want to

143
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:21,079
break the connection that keeps you tied to them in any

144
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:26,639
way what if you just wish you could wish them well that's pretty

145
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,519
good I wish I could wish you will because I don't want to be tied to

146
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:40,120
thinking ill of you anymore and that's what I'm giving

147
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:47,399
up that's what I'm letting go of I'm letting go of the desire to harm

148
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:55,440
you in return I'm saying no to

149
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:02,000
that I'm living in the now and not in the memory of what

150
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:12,038
happened this is possible this is

151
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:21,000
possible it's possible to forgive ourselves now how how often if you said

152
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:30,200
to yourself why did I do that why did I stay there why did I do this

153
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:36,039
and ring our hands

154
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:41,440
regretting there's nothing wrong with regret and

155
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,840
remorse but then we let go of

156
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:56,039
it guilt is not useful it just builds up the story about

157
00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:00,399
what a crummy person I am

158
00:18:01,159 --> 00:18:08,799
rather I want to live in a world where happiness is possible I regret that and I'm not going

159
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:17,159
to do that again I regret that and now I'm I'm

160
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:22,320
severing that relationship so I don't have to do that

161
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:32,760
anymore you know in the when I was talking about non-h

162
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:38,559
hatred I read from the the beginning of the dapada

163
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:45,440
right that that talked about the importance of keeping up a free and open

164
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,880
heart all experience is preceded by mind led by mind made by mind speak or act

165
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:57,039
with a corrupted mind and suffering follows like the wheels of a cart behind

166
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,799
the hose of the ox all experiences preceded by mind led by

167
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:09,919
mind made by mind speak or act with a peaceful mind and happiness follows like

168
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:16,440
a never departing Shadow I find that just gloriously

169
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:23,480
hopeful yes that's where I want to live right there and what comes

170
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:29,760
immediately after that is

171
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,880
he abused me attacked me defeated me robbed me for those carrying on like

172
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:42,400
this hatred does not end she abused me attacked me defeated

173
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,759
me robbed me for those not carrying on like this hatred

174
00:19:50,000 --> 00:20:00,240
ends this sounds like the way I look at forgiveness letting go of resentment

175
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:09,080
removing myself from harm but letting go of the need for

176
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:15,280
Retribution to write old wrongs stepping away from the connection that is tying

177
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:22,679
me down to a constant retelling of the

178
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:30,159
story constant retelling of the story

179
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,720
the Buddhist says speak not harshly to anyone for those spoken to might retort

180
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,360
indeed angry speech hurts and retaliation May overtake

181
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,360
you you know as we as we hit back the next thing that happens is they hit back

182
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,760
at us and then we hit back at them and then they hit back with us does this sound like any conversations you've

183
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:25,960
[Music] had and on and on and on it

184
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:34,159
goes he who checks Rising anger as a

185
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,880
charioteer checks a rolling Chariot Chariot him I call a true

186
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:46,440
charioteer others only hold the reins another quote from the

187
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:53,159
Buddha he's saying that controlling one's anger controlling one's need to

188
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:58,720
strike back puts you in control

189
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:06,480
it really puts you in the place where the suffering only occurs if you allow it

190
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:29,960
to it's not as if it happens overnight you know you just decide okay I'm not going to let it bother me anymore really

191
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:36,880
I'm talking about years of practicing this to see any

192
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:44,000
change but it's the small things that make a difference I was looking here I'm

193
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,120
going to read you something here from uh Jane

194
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:56,960
hfield see this this

195
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:04,440
poem is called changing everything changing everything I was walking again in the

196
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:13,520
woods a yellow light was sifting all I saw willfully with a cold heart I took a

197
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:21,960
stick lifted it to the opposite side of the path there I said to myself that's done

198
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:29,880
now brushing one hand against the other to clean them of the tiny fragments of bark

199
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:38,279
a tiny thing lifting a stick and moving it to the other side of the

200
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:44,919
path taking one action and saying I'm not going to do

201
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:50,720
that I'm going to drop that I'm not going to pick up

202
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,720
that

203
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:04,559
insult and then you go oh you know that wasn't so bad that that actually

204
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:11,600
oh it changes everything it changes

205
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:20,120
everything now the Buddha did actually talk about forgiveness and he had a word

206
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:29,799
there's a word in poly called comma k h m a it means the Earth

207
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:35,399
what does that have to do with forgiveness and it it is the patient

208
00:24:35,399 --> 00:24:42,840
forgiving tolerant enduring bearing harded hardened

209
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,880
to it's the sense of uh continuation

210
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,039
steadiness kind of steadiness of mind and he referred to it when he talked

211
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:00,520
about the difference of when he talked about conflict between his monks and he

212
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,640
said okay conflict will arise and so

213
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:14,120
what he did not want to have happen was for people to endure continuing conflict so there was

214
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:21,520
he set out a number of rules for how they should resolve conflict among the groups and it involved people getting

215
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:29,799
together and the the wrongdoer the wrongdoer should admit his

216
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:37,679
transgression and the person the other person should accept that

217
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:44,080
apology and then they should agree to go forward under certain rules but but you

218
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:53,240
have to agree that you on what's right and what's wrong at the outset and if you can't then you cannot

219
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:58,679
reconcile so there's a difference between forgiveness and Reconciliation

220
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:03,840
so there is someone that I've been talking to for quite a long time who who really wants to

221
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,679
reconcile with a family member and can't seem to make it

222
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:19,799
happen but sometimes you have to learn to accept that it's a two-way street and

223
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:29,600
you have to give up expecting what is not offered what is not on offer

224
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:39,399
and not continue your own suffering by trying to write a wrong that requires something of someone

225
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:46,399
who is unwilling to go there reconciliation is not the same

226
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:54,159
thing as finding forgiveness and letting go of ill will they're different functions

227
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,600
entirely different features

228
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,640
so I have this this quote from uh TANF when you forgive me for harming you you

229
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:12,039
decide not to retaliate to seek no Revenge you don't have to like me you

230
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:18,880
simply unburden yourself of the weight of resentment and cut the cycle of

231
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:25,200
Retribution that would otherwise keep us in snarled in an ugly samsaric wrestling

232
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:32,080
match this is a gift you give us both totally on your own without my having to

233
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,520
know or understand what you've done you see forgiveness doesn't require

234
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,440
the other person to know that you've forgiven

235
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:49,360
them you're totally free of the other person all you have to do is let go of

236
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:55,200
it you don't have to tell them you don't have to explain it to

237
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,518
them you don't have to justify

238
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,720
it you just

239
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:21,679
stop what we want to do is live more in the world of response rather than

240
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:28,159
reactivity you can respond to what is harmful reactivity is more of a an

241
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,880
automatic response where you you not paying any attention to what's going on and you tend to get things that are not

242
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:42,120
very skillful as a consequence of that but with a steady mind we can see

243
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:47,440
what's happening we can see an offense happening and we can say this is very

244
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:55,159
familiar I think I'll pause here I don't have to go into

245
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:03,039
this I think I said a couple of weeks ago

246
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:09,039
that I was very happy when I watched uh a recent TV show and found found myself

247
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:14,159
not reacting to something that's a a typical trigger for me and I oh my

248
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,919
goodness look at that I didn't react it was very

249
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:30,559
exciting there's a a famous Tibetan story about a couple of monks that had been uh imprisoned and afterward one's

250
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:38,399
saying to the other well you know do you think you can ever forgive him and he said never never I'll never forgive them

251
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:45,159
and he said oh too bad you're still imprisoned and that's the way it is if

252
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:52,279
you can never forgive someone you are the person who is imprisoned by

253
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:59,279
that and that's what you need to let go of that's what we need to let go

254
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,360
of first free ourselves free

255
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:11,880
ourselves we have to see what we're holding in our hearts and that's where we want to put our

256
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:21,679
energy what am I holding in my heart how can I how can I see that in a

257
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:32,200
way so that's going to give me another opportunity to read a poem to

258
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:37,840
you this is about not having any

259
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:45,679
practice so this is by uh wava sorka who's a a Polish poet uh Nobel

260
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:53,159
laurate life while you wait performance without

261
00:30:53,159 --> 00:31:00,519
rehearsal body without alterations head without premeditation I know nothing of the role

262
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:08,120
I play I only know it's mine I can't exchange it I have to guess on the spot

263
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:14,519
just what this play is all about ill prepared for the privilege of living I can barely keep up with the

264
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:20,519
pace that the action demands I improvise although I hate improvisation I trip at

265
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:25,960
every step over my own ignorance I can't conceal my hasted

266
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,720
manners my instincts are for hamy histrionics stage fright makes excuses

267
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:38,039
for me which humiliates me more extenuating circumstances strike me as

268
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:45,000
cruel words and impulses you can't take back Stars you'll never get counted your

269
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,240
character like a raincoat you button on the run the pitiful results of all this

270
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:59,080
unexpectedness if I could just rehearse one Wednesday in advance or repeat a single Thursday that

271
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:05,480
has passed but here comes Friday with a script I haven't seen is it fair I ask

272
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:12,440
my voice a little horse since I couldn't even Clear My Throat off stage you'd be wrong to think it's just a slap Dash

273
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:18,200
quiz taken in makeshift accommodations oh no I'm standing on the set and I see

274
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:25,679
how strong it is the props are surprisingly precise the machine rotating the stage

275
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:31,440
has been around even longer longer the farthest Galaxies have been turned on oh

276
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:38,200
no there's no question this must be the premiere and whatever I do will become

277
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:45,000
forever what I've done whatever I do will become forever

278
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:52,200
what I've done so hold in your

279
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:59,039
heart who you want to be how you want to be

280
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:08,720
don't give anyone else the power to decide that it's hard enough to decide for

281
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,559
yourself the practices that we typically use for forgiveness fat practice are

282
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:28,039
very simple for any harm that I may have caused myself knowing or unknowingly

283
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:34,720
through my thoughts words or actions I offer myself forgiveness as best I

284
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,039
can everything else is a variation of

285
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:47,399
that for any harm you may have caused me knowingly or unknowingly through

286
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:53,919
thoughts words or actions I offer my forgiveness as best I

287
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:59,360
can for any harm I have done you through thoughts words or

288
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:05,600
actions knowingly or unknowingly I ask your

289
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,200
forgiveness as best you can that's

290
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,599
it those phrases you repeat

291
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:23,839
them and see what arises in your heart see what comes

292
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:33,480
up it doesn't say shame on you shame on me it says may I let go of any

293
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:42,838
resentment I have toward myself for any actions I may have taken knowingly or

294
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:50,800
unknowingly through thought word or deed as best I can I mean there are all

295
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:57,040
kinds of little slippery places there it's not harsh it's not intended

296
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:05,760
to be harsh it's intended to be free and open so that you can be free and open so

297
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,440
that I can be free and

298
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:25,440
open the word forgiveness is not an eraser it's really a letting

299
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,800
go

300
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:42,440
it's it's taking the tension between you and some previous event and saying I

301
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:49,160
don't have to hold on to this it says absolutely nothing about

302
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:55,119
whether you continue to fight against a cause stand up for a cause reject

303
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:02,720
Behavior form opin opinions about behaviors it only says I'm letting go of

304
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,960
the

305
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,680
resentment I had a I had I was uh active in a particular

306
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:21,040
environmental issue at one time and there was a person who was sort of the

307
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,400
head of the other side and every time I would head to town

308
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,599
that guy's name would come in my mind and I would just become agitated as I

309
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:37,640
was driving to town this is when I lived out in the country and I could feel that agitation and my stomach would get tense

310
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:43,839
and and then I thought about that and I thought you know this person does not

311
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:50,079
even know I exist this person that I'm giving this

312
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:55,680
power to create this turmoil in my stomach doesn't

313
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:04,280
know my resentment this is all mine all mine

314
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:11,480
whatever else is true whether I continue to fight against what he is trying to do to the

315
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:18,400
environment and he continues to do whatever he's doing to the environment has nothing to do with my getting all

316
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:25,599
roiled up and upset on the way to town and when you see that

317
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,640
clearly it becomes very easy to let go of

318
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:38,000
it wait a minute what's what am I getting upset about this

319
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:46,599
is it's right here all I have to do is stop doing that all I have to do is say

320
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:52,359
okay this isn't useful i' got to go do something useful now to to get rid of

321
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:58,920
the extra stuff that we imbue the extra

322
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:05,680
importance taking the weight of resentment off our

323
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,480
plates that's forgiveness so those are my thoughts I

324
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,040
hope that's helpful thank

325
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:25,520
you so any comments questions I do accept

326
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,520
criticism

327
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:40,200
would you please use the the microphone because we're recording this okay just hold it uh I just write things down I

328
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:46,200
just have on my phone we all have notes right and I just write down the thought

329
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:52,680
and often I don't go back and read it again and it seems to relieve if you know what I'm saying

330
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:58,520
uhhuh uhuh

331
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,838
the practice of not letting something

332
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:08,720
Fester not having to retell the

333
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:26,680
story that poem you read about the stage who wrote that and what was it name that

334
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:33,838
was awesome it's a woman wava sorka oh lovely I won't remember that

335
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:41,960
one uh polish she's um It's s z ym b o r

336
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:48,280
s k a i think I'll come up afterwards in I w't remember that but that was just

337
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:53,960
like oh yeah that's that's my life yeah I love that one

338
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,400
yeah

339
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,520
I guess for me um uh a thought of

340
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:17,280
forgiveness brings with it sort of a fear that if the person that I'm

341
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,000
forgiving um has done something wrong and and I forgive them then maybe

342
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:28,359
they're going to do it again um

343
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:39,440
and yeah I don't know how to deal with that yeah yeah that that's that's a a

344
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:45,480
um that's a very valid concern and um

345
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:52,440
and it is not Inc included in caring resentment so if I fear someone's going

346
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:59,760
to do it again whatever it is then I feel feel that I have a responsibility

347
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:06,319
to uh either not put myself in the way of that happening again

348
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:12,920
or somehow trying to prevent it to happen from happening to others so an example

349
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:19,960
of that might be uh uh any kind of racial

350
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:28,920
discrimination or uh uh uh being in an abusive

351
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,680
household it it's not okay I might let go of my resentment but that has to stop

352
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:39,920
whatever that that behavior is abuse of other people harming of other people

353
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,880
this that has to that has to be stopped and so uh the forgiveness is not saying

354
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:51,720
that's okay now if it's a if if the forgiveness

355
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:58,160
is within an ongoing relationship then there is a need for the the process of

356
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:06,520
reconciliation where where there is an agreement on what is right or wrong or there has to be some some

357
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:13,838
break so uh I don't want to imply that it should it should be allowed to happen

358
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:20,920
again also kind of tied in with that is uh when

359
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:27,480
one remains in a relationship where it is repeated

360
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:34,520
then uh there's a possibility for self criticism from that as well and so

361
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:40,559
coming to terms with why one is choosing to stay in that relationship is very

362
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:48,240
important thank you I'm I don't know if I addressed your particular issue but

363
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,839
that's um I I think it's extremely important

364
00:42:53,839 --> 00:43:01,400
that forgiveness does not include it's okay okay that this happens again it can't happen you can't if if

365
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:07,240
it's harmful it should not happen there's uh there's a wonderful quote

366
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:12,720
unfortunately I cannot remember the Korean Zen master's name but he had this

367
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,000
this wonderful phrase he said there is no right and no wrong but

368
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,240
right is right and wrong is wrong and when when you think about that it's you

369
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:28,599
know you may think this is right and I may think that is right and they won't

370
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:38,760
agree but killing someone is wrong so so in that regard you know you

371
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:45,559
can if if you hear that in your head and you listen to that I may not agree with

372
00:43:45,559 --> 00:43:50,280
you but this Behavior I will not

373
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:59,559
tolerate but I don't have to tie myself to the bird burden of resentment as a

374
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:09,680
consequence that space I have to navigate that's that's on me the the burden of ill will and and

375
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:17,119
resentment

376
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:27,680
okay okay be safe everyone

377
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:33,680
