1
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:11,160
so I'd like to uh offer some thoughts Reflections on the topic of agency it's

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:18,320
a topic that for another program that I'm thinking about these days so and then agency in a spiritual

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,640
life agency and particularly for a Dharma life how did these come

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,960
together and um and one of the reasons for this is that sometimes in doing Med

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,840
meditation practice doing a Buddhist practice spiritual life people don't

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,800
feel they have the ability to do it so in that sense uh they feel that there's no

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:48,079
agency and if they sometimes they do feel they have the ability to do it and and maybe they don't think they have

8
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,719
agency but in a way they they do they they can sit down to meditate they can

9
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:59,440
go in Retreats they can spend time maybe reading spiritual books and it's very

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,080
meaningful part of their life so to introduce this topic some

11
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:12,479
more um in the very important uh uh

12
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,640
teaching in in Insight work in mindfulness practice Buddhist mindfulness practice

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:26,720
is a teaching that uh whatever experience you're directly having in the present moment so you have to really

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,000
clear like whatever you're feeling sensing experience in the present can be

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,079
um distinguished or divided or distinguished as having three tones

16
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:48,000
three feeling tones it can be pleasant unpleasant or neither Pleasant nor

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,840
unpleasant and now for some people they find it phenomenally fascinating and helpful to just see that recognize that

18
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:03,520
that's the case because something can be amazingly complex and like some kind of

19
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,759
social drama that you're involved in maybe you know at a holiday party and

20
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:15,519
boy lot going on here and it's difficult and and social dynamics are a ancient

21
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:22,680
and difficult and you know and then in the middle of that well Buddha said there's a feeling tone to

22
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,800
experience so what's the feeling tone of this holiday

23
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,840
event it's unpleasant

24
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:38,480
and suddenly the whole complexity of it has been simplified enough that then you

25
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,920
say oh I know how to be with things that are unpleasant I'll breathe I'll slow

26
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,840
down I'll be mindful of the unpleasant and find find my stability my grounding

27
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,879
again so it's a way of kind of finding yourself stable again or finding some kind of stabil you know some kind of

28
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,239
context for how to be by just kind of seeing this is part of it and I can just

29
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:10,280
if I don't see it's unpleasant then I'm kind of reacting to it perhaps because sometimes our inner life is reacting to

30
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:17,480
um you know aaik to our experience it isn't necessarily that we're reacting to

31
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:24,200
all the things we have opinions about in the room in this holiday event but uh something about just it's

32
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,760
just unpleasant for us how we experience it and that's what we don't like and so

33
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,680
as soon as you say it's unpleasant it changes the orientation how we understand it how we see it and it might

34
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:42,360
be much more easy to then engage wisely in the event that you're a part of so

35
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,720
this thing I do dividing things into these three feeling tones can be very

36
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,920
helpful but in this uh mindfulness tradition there's a a second distinction

37
00:03:52,920 --> 00:04:00,319
that's made within the category of feeling tones there are two general

38
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:06,200
areas of feeling tones that we can have one is in relationship to the outer

39
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,400
world and the other is to the inner world and that's kind of my language

40
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:19,000
it's it's it's uh it not doesn't quite work out in a in all ordinary ways of saying inner

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,840
and outer and um but for now you know so outer certainly is that uh you know

42
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:33,240
there's the feeling tone of um of uh being so

43
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:40,759
delighted that I won the lottery or delighted that it's um you

44
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:46,840
know that it's sunny outside or you know happy

45
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:54,280
that you know that um I was praised wow that was pretty good that I like that

46
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:00,320
that feels Pleasant or and then we get criticized and that's unpleasant and you know and

47
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,440
that's affects us and changes our mood quite quickly and so things can happen

48
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,960
in the outer world that we take in and somehow register in ways that uh are

49
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,520
Pleasant unpleasant or neither and um and then there's the

50
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:23,280
inner world and these are things that can Bubble Up from the inside that really in and know themselves have

51
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,039
nothing to do with the outside world um so and this is why uh it's

52
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,880
where the the sharp line doesn't quite work out because uh

53
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:43,280
if you're spending uh your inner world is waiting for the lottery to be run for

54
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,800
the lottery ticket and you're sure you're going to win and you're already

55
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,479
planning your vacations and your mansions and your all the kind of you

56
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:03,680
know recreational activities you'll be doing and you're just so delighted and happy um that's you in in in an ordinary

57
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:10,560
sense that's coming from the inside your thoughts and ideas and all that but it still belongs to the operating system

58
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,919
that's oriented to the world around us we have a different operating system

59
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:22,960
within that is really deep inside and um and uh I like to call it

60
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,639
the dhic operating system someone else might call it a spiritual operating

61
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:35,039
system uh someone else might call it the heart you know or some people might call

62
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:41,639
it the soul some people might call it the inner Spirit you know there's all these kind of languages with something

63
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,120
inside maybe that um that uh belongs to

64
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,240
a different operating system than our desires and aversions to what's happening in the world and what could

65
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:01,520
happen in the world and what we can get from the world or not get from the world that can exist there independent

66
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,879
of what's happening in the world you go to that H holiday party that's so

67
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:12,240
complicated and kind of unpleasant on that surface level but you've had this

68
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:19,560
really good meditation before you went and it's like you know you know you've never been so centered and equanimous

69
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,720
and calm and you're like it's like you're like feeling like in this happy

70
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:32,319
way kind of like you're inside the car going through the car

71
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,919
wash and going to the holiday party you know like wow wow look at all this

72
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:44,120
craziness here wow you know but you feel like you're not getting wet you know he

73
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:51,199
not not touching you because you're have this deeper Wellspring of something another source where you're living

74
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:59,759
in and then U maybe at this haray party they serve really lot of really good ch

75
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:06,800
cake and coffee and you have you know a lot of it and pretty soon that deeper spiritual

76
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,800
operating system no longer is operating and it's been taken over by a

77
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:21,360
whole other kind of way of being and that's now is kind of like completely interacting or buffeted

78
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:29,759
around by what's happening at the party so you can lose it and uh so but there's a steep ER

79
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:37,039
operating system and I call it the dharmic operating system and um and that can feel very

80
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:44,000
wholesome it can feel very uh uh integral to who we really want to be it

81
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,080
can feel like now we're really centered on ourself in a deep peaceful way it's a

82
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,839
place of inner peace inner well-being inner authenticity inner Integrity inner

83
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:03,360
wholeness that we can we can experience and so um and so the Buddha when he

84
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:10,200
talked about this kind of dharmic operating system inside it can be pleasant unpleasant or

85
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:18,800
neither Pleasant or unpleasant so how does that work it can be pleasant if we're really

86
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:26,680
having the inner the wholesomeness and the goodness and the joy and the happiness of that inner dharmic

87
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,959
operating system flowing through us it can be

88
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:40,720
unpleasant when it's not and we don't have the agency to do

89
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:48,360
the practice so this inner operating system is practice dependent initially as we're

90
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:54,200
kind of finding our way with it in in Buddhism and so it might be the only way

91
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,440
a person has access to it is to meditate

92
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:08,640
or maybe they can tap into it by going for a long long hike in a nature preserve and be

93
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:16,519
quiet for a while and then they feel like they touch into something but somehow their life doesn't allow

94
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:22,360
them to do it either maybe uh they which I knew very

95
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,920
well maybe um they they have young kids at

96
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,360
home and um and I found it hard to meditate when my kids were really babies

97
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,959
and quite young at home and luckily I had to meditate for

98
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:49,680
work so so that was helpful or maybe uh you're caring for a

99
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,000
family member or parent or someone who's quite sick and elderly and I know I had

100
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,399
my mother live with us for a while when she had uh dementia and that took a lot of time and effort and there wasn't much

101
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:08,120
time for other things take and um or there's responsibility of work

102
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:14,279
there's responsibility of all kinds of things that we might have or uh uh there

103
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:20,680
can be so these worldly responsibilities we have might keep us from touching into

104
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:27,560
something that's valuable for us and so there's a sense of lack there's something unpleasant there in it in it

105
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:33,760
in this deeper operating system it feels like a deeper place of of um sometimes

106
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:41,519
they call it the most extreme versions of it they call it Dark Knight of the Soul uh I had that uh period short

107
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,800
period because I I my whole life when I was young at some certain point was uh

108
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:54,600
became really important to be able to go on a long Meditation Retreat I'd come to a point in my life kind of a dead end

109
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,680
all the different ways i' gone that was the only way forward that I knew and and

110
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:06,360
um and the ability to do that was being frustrated and so I kind of like you

111
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:13,120
know something inside of me really felt this like oh I don't have I can't follow through on what's most important for me

112
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:21,279
in a sense I had no agency to do what was most important the circumstances around me that got in the

113
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:28,160
way and um so this inner operating system can be

114
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:35,600
inspiring and it can be discouraging or depressing or deflating if we can't have

115
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:43,320
access to it and practice with it and um and there's a a at some point

116
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,760
have people been introduced to Buddhist practice and meditation um there can there can be

117
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:56,320
inside a uh to use a maybe a kind of Christian term a call to do more of it

118
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,880
in Buddhism we call it an onward leading uh feeling that oh there's a there's a

119
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:07,920
there's a pull or a slide I'm on and I just want to take that slide and keep

120
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,519
going I there's a doors opening up and I want to keep doing it there's um there's

121
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,440
an inspiration there's a flow that wants to happen here and I have to make room

122
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:26,720
for that flow to keep grow or is the inner growth that's happening and I want to let that growth happen but uh in

123
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,920
order to do that all I know how to do is to meditate or maybe you do some

124
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:40,800
meditation and at some point you feel uh wonderful thing moment in meditation is

125
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:47,519
um is not uh is when you keep doing it and at some point you feel that inner

126
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:54,279
operating system say uh I really want to do this like there's a there's an inner

127
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:59,880
call or an inner momentum this is what I want to do

128
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:08,040
uh you know now you know this is the most valuable this is what's important as opposed to you know I should meditate

129
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:14,639
I'm supposed to meditate I want to meditate I know it's good for me and I just can't get to it and at some point

130
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,800
something shifts and it's more like you

131
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,519
know I know I know I'm supposed to vacuum the living room

132
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,320
rug but I'm meditating I want to meditate I know I'm supposed

133
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,199
to you know do some things but this is what something this is what the pull is

134
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:43,600
it's and um you know it's kind of like this may be a very unfortunate example

135
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,440
but you have to forgive me and also to reword it for yourself it's kind of like

136
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,959
you know at some point you have to go pee and it just like this is what has to

137
00:14:54,959 --> 00:15:00,120
happen at some point there going to be that feeling like now I have to meditate

138
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:08,480
like oh this is what should happen this is the most meaningful thing I can do and so in that regard at some point

139
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:16,120
people can have a feeling that uh I want to go on Retreat then I had that when I was young

140
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:22,639
I was meditating for a while for a couple of years and at some point and I think I was meditating daily for about a

141
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:29,079
year and I decided that I should I wanted to go and Retreat there was a call something about meditation felt

142
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:35,480
good and right and just felt good to kind of follow through on it and and see what a week on week of meditation would

143
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:41,240
do in terms of allowing this nice opening that was happening to have a

144
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,639
fuller chance to keep opening so I signed up for a

145
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,959
retreat and um week-long Retreat and then about a couple of weeks before the

146
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:58,360
retreat started I called The Retreat Center and said something has come up

147
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,680
and I can't go and they said okay we'll just take you off that was easy I

148
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:11,199
thought what had come up Was Fear so the thing that was interfering

149
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:19,360
with my desire my inner impulse to kind of follow through and this what was happening on on the inside was myself it

150
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:26,800
wasn't responsibilities out in the world it was actually I was afraid and so sometimes what interferes

151
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,959
with our agency is not responsibilities and circumstances around us but rather

152
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:39,279
it's uh what's inside of us and uh so we might be afraid we might

153
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:46,560
be um afraid of what's going to happen to us we might be afraid it's going to change our life too much we might be

154
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:53,360
afraid of what we're going to have to face and see if I slow down and really look at myself and that's that you know

155
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:01,190
so anyway so I chickened out of my first retreat and my karma of that is

156
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:08,880
[Laughter] that I have to be a Dharma

157
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:18,678
teacher and uh so um so then at some point um then uh about a probably about

158
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:25,000
a year later a year later I ended up going on a week long retreat and I

159
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,880
thought that was really great to do it it was really it was a life changing for me to be there but by the time it was

160
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:37,280
over after the week it was okay that was great but I'm not doing this again for a

161
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,200
while it just I felt you know just required so much energy and intensity or

162
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:51,280
something of me and um and so then gradually uh over the next months after

163
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:57,039
six months there came the call something inside of me said okay now I'm ready I

164
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:03,280
want to do this again and uh I did it and when I finished that week it was

165
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,600
good but no more not for a while and and I would just I continued my daily

166
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:16,720
meditation practice and then about about six months later the call came again I felt now I'm ready to go and luckily for

167
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:24,400
me at that point I didn't have the inner inhibition I didn't have the fear anymore and now I was able to follow

168
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:32,520
through and at some point uh following through meant to go further into the into Buddhism and then further into it

169
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:40,960
and so I went to live at aen Center I went to live at the aen monastery and and then as I went along

170
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:48,760
uh this inner call of this of this you know spiritual operating system uh just

171
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:57,000
kind of became the primary organizing principle for how to live my life it took me to Asia it took me to become a

172
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,919
monk in Burma you know and and eventually brought me here to do this what I'm doing

173
00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:10,080
now as a life and um and so this inner call now

174
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:18,120
it's easy for people to hear my story and be my my ability to be able to at a

175
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:24,120
young as a young person to you know just keep answering that call and you know go

176
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:30,400
to a retreat go to live at a center go to a monastery go to a Asia you know

177
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:37,960
some people you know can't do that it's inconceivable that they're going to do that um as a young person because maybe

178
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:45,080
now you're no longer young and um and so now I can't do that that's not available to

179
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:51,919
me and um but luckily the um it's not necessary to do

180
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:57,640
that for this practice um uh the primary orientation

181
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,919
that Buddha gave for finding her way with this dharmic operating system the

182
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:10,240
to find the the pleasure of it the Delight the with satisfaction of it where we can find our

183
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,120
agency is um in being able to recognize what is

184
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,440
wholesome and what is UNH wholesome that's and the wholesome here

185
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:28,679
means that which really speaks to and awakens or nourishes this inner

186
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:35,960
operating system the inner goodness the inner sense of wholeness or Integrity or

187
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:43,240
peace or sense of of the spirit or the soul it's it's not exactly so clear

188
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:50,960
exactly how to name it or describe it this thing that's deeper except that it's something which is not dependent on

189
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:57,760
what's happening in the world it's not dependent on the lottery or praise or or

190
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:06,200
criticism it's not dependent on whether you're living at in a in um endless

191
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:12,679
holiday party you know that just goes on forever and ever you know it doesn't you know

192
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:18,880
that you can find your peace in whatever difficulty situation you have it's

193
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,600
difficult to do that it takes time and effort and practice but it is possible

194
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:31,400
to find the wholesome within you even if the world outside of you is mostly UNH

195
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:39,760
wholesome and so and so the Buddha said um you

196
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:46,440
can practice the wholesome if I didn't think you could if

197
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:54,240
I didn't think you could do it I wouldn't tell you to you can avoid the UNH wholesome if I

198
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,320
didn't think you could you you could do it I wouldn't tell you to avoid the UNH

199
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:06,159
wholesome so that's what the whole all of what he has to teach is reduced to

200
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:13,279
that statement that he believes in that we have agency he believes that we have the

201
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:21,799
capacity to act and do what we need to do for this purpose

202
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:27,120
and maybe not go off to Asia to practice and be a monastic maybe not do long

203
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:35,880
Retreats maybe not do any retreat treats maybe you can't even meditate because of the circumstances you have but even so

204
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,440
you can do the wholesome you can avoid the UNH

205
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,520
wholesome you you you once you start getting the hang or some sense that

206
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:54,440
there is an inner life there is a life of the heart there is a life of the

207
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:02,200
of in some some Buddhist circles Buddhist uh they wouldn't refer to the heart as being this the Locust for this

208
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:09,440
they would say it was in the belly uh which is maybe some people find that kind of odd but it's even deeper

209
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:15,600
than it's even deeper in us than than um than what we call the heart maybe in

210
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:22,640
Modern English and so this deep Source within and how do we find

211
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,520
it uh we can find it and the sense of agency that it's up to us is

212
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:36,600
encapsulated in this very very powerful poem uh in the dapada I think it's

213
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:43,880
powerful that uh this just paraphrase it um it says something like the

214
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,919
Buddha merely points the

215
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:56,480
way it's up to you to walk it the Buddha just explains what you can

216
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,480
do but he can't do it for you someone can tell you where the

217
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:10,919
bathroom is but you know what you have to do only

218
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:19,480
you you know for yourself can can go to it go find it right so um so the the

219
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:26,440
Buddhas only point the way it's for you to practice it and so the Buddha

220
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:32,480
believes that we have agency he believes there's a reference point within us that

221
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:40,520
we can follow it's not about reading books it's not about listening to Dharma talks but

222
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:47,679
little bit it's okay and U and it's not about um um it's

223
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,799
not and in some ways it's not even about what you

224
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:59,200
do which is a little odd since that's what the topic of the talk is

225
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:06,200
but what you but really it's a what you do with this inner life do you pause enough do you pay

226
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:13,440
attention enough to uh notice what what's the quality of your

227
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:20,440
inner life what are the characteristics what does it feel like inside or are you too distracted to

228
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:27,240
notice or is your mind spinning with thoughts and you would say well I'm mostly just agitated and spinning in my

229
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:32,919
thoughts yes that's might be true but if you identify that as a center of your life

230
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:39,000
you get one answer but if you can go underneath those spinning thoughts and the churning

231
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,120
and Fantasies and ideas and judgments and commentary and really drop down

232
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,480
deep what do you find there and what we find there is not

233
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,559
always good what we find there is not always Pleasant it's not always so easy

234
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:04,200
to be there because it can be very uncomfortable able but that is where we can start

235
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,840
finding what is wholesome now that I feel how I am the

236
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:16,640
quality of my inner life how can I meet that in a Wholesome Way how can I relate

237
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:23,159
to it how can almost like how can I be my own friend how can I have compassion for

238
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:30,720
that how can I have care for that and that is beginning to to act

239
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:37,240
engage in the wholesome life you have to have some

240
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:42,279
agency when you touch into the difficulty within you have to call on

241
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:48,159
agency call on your ability to offer something to it that is wholesome that

242
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:54,880
it's healthy that's good that's compassionate that's caring and as you do that then that's

243
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:02,480
also Awakening this new operating system this deeper one and so if

244
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:09,799
you're home caring for people and cannot even meditate perhaps you can

245
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:15,919
breathe breathe with what you're doing when you're changing the

246
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,799
diapers at 3:00 a.m. in the morning

247
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,559
breathe breathe and harmonize your activity of changing diapers with the

248
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:34,000
breathing that you're doing and see if the breathing can help you tap into something deeper going on here the

249
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,640
breathing can give you a little pause as you're taking care of a parent who has

250
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:48,559
dementia can you find some way to find some kind of stability some kind

251
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:53,919
of spirituality in what you're doing as you

252
00:27:53,919 --> 00:28:02,559
do it you don't have to go off on Street you don't have to go to Asia you can do

253
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:11,720
it in your ordinary life and um and you and and sooner or

254
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:19,559
later that's what I had to do and one of the things that happened for me because of the way I my my my

255
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:25,039
route through all this was that um I didn't really start

256
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:31,039
learning how to bring it into my daily life until I had children it was a whole

257
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:36,240
different thing I done all this monastic life but the the challenges of that life

258
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:42,440
were were so different that I had to kind of now now I have to do it

259
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:48,159
here so but you don't have to wait you know you can if your life

260
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,919
doesn't allow you to meditate you can still practice you can still find your

261
00:28:53,919 --> 00:29:00,840
way but it requires you to have agency it requires you to make a choice to act

262
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:06,919
in a c certain way to call upon what's wholesome to recognize what is good in

263
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:15,159
you and try the best you can to live with it and you probably fail a

264
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:24,360
lot and um but you know failing is not bad failing

265
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:29,559
is how we grow it's it's like you know a child

266
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:35,880
learning to walk the kid falls so many

267
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:44,480
times the parents don't go oh my God my kid's a failure you know he doesn't know how to

268
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,919
walk and this is the end and I I just I'll

269
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:57,600
give I'll give up I'll give up on this kid no you say great you have to you

270
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:04,480
have to f fail a lot of times to finally learn how to walk you to keep falling spiritual life is that way too

271
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,279
you you start again start again start again we have

272
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:15,799
agency and the question is to use it to use it to let this deeper operating

273
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:22,039
system begin having a chance to operate in your life and it doesn't require you

274
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:29,960
to go off runway into but what might happen is that as

275
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:36,720
this inner operating system begins to come stronger for you it's it's Beautiful Moments will

276
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,919
happen where you feel the onward nature of it you feel that it has you your has

277
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:49,279
your back you feel that it wants to grow in you it it wants to support you

278
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:55,799
there's something here that is really here to serve you that is not the usual

279
00:30:55,799 --> 00:31:01,960
self that you identify yourself with there's something marvelous within you

280
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:08,720
that is not yourself that's here to support you and be with you and help you kind of Find

281
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,360
Your Way onward and grow in this uh with this

282
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:22,480
inner goodness this dhic um place within that um that we all

283
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:28,760
have we all can do so agency

284
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:34,639
people who have no agency it can be very very hard they

285
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:39,760
feel like they have no capacity to do anything to grow or do anything for

286
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,240
themselves or be safe or take care of their family it's a really hard

287
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:52,320
thing agent being able to have the freedom to do things and feel like you can make a

288
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,760
difference is crucial to a healthy human life and when we we come into this

289
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:05,480
practice that we talk about here at IMC that agency is applied to this

290
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:13,880
inner spiritual or inner operating system that uh we want to bring forth

291
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:21,799
and use as a reference point and let that have a chance to grow and be the source of how

292
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:29,840
we live our life and um and we start

293
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:36,159
over again over and over again every time we fail but we have to

294
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,360
start if you don't exercise your agency it won't

295
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:49,080
happen so I'll end with a little saying I do that maybe irritate some

296
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:55,440
people so I say it this way it's a little bit of theater goes into saying this so I

297
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:02,390
say mindfulness does not work unless you do

298
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:08,880
[Laughter] it

299
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,360
so so now it's your turn if you have any questions

300
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,480
protests that you would like to offer or testimonials or anything anything you'd

301
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:28,159
like to do say ask Gail I loved your example about the child learning to walk

302
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:35,120
very humorous and and a perfect example great thank

303
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,320
you is there mic over in the back I Martha's coming

304
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,360
with thank you um Gil I noticed in your description of your

305
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:03,399
um Retreat desire that you didn't use the word desire or wanting or tanha or

306
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:10,158
thirst yet I could imagine somebody with um probably honic addictions having that

307
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,878
same sort of feeling feeling tone that would be underneath that desire sure can

308
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:23,240
you maybe talk about the difference between those two like I guess it's healthy desire and not healthy desire or

309
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:30,520
I'm not sure yeah well if um yes I really want to go on a

310
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:36,158
retreat because I've noticed that the people who really uh get a lot of praise

311
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:42,480
and spiritual Circle circles are the ones who go and Retreats there something about Retreats and I'm going to go and

312
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,679
not only going to retreat I'm I'm build up a resume of all the Retreats I've done

313
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:54,118
with all the great teachers and if I can have that resume I'll be a really hot shot guy and it'll be exciting to be you

314
00:34:54,119 --> 00:35:01,079
know praised and delighted and Everywhere I Go people will see me as as if I'm walking on clouds and they'll bow

315
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:08,960
to me and boy that'll be a great life so that is a lot of T that's a lot of

316
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:15,960
that's a desire which can bring me a sense of delight when the in the imagination imagination of it but it's

317
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:22,920
going to be a dead end and it's going to feel like if I really pay attention really mindful I'll

318
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:30,280
feel the stress of that I'll feel the pressure I feel the unsatisfactory nature of that desire I feel how easy it

319
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:37,240
is to have it uh to uh be be U pulled around by the nose and a in a certain

320
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:42,480
kind of way the loss of agency I think that I'm acting on you

321
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:49,480
know my free will but it's not exactly free will when these addictive compulsive thoughts grab us by the nose

322
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:55,560
and pull us along so I think you can feel the difference and uh and for me I

323
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:03,599
think of it you know there's really two different operating systems and you can feel that one has a a sense of if you

324
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:10,560
really drop in has a feeling of rightness and the other you can see has you can pay

325
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:17,640
attention you see it's mostly to do with the external world uh it's a desire having to do with what the praise I'll

326
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:23,440
get as opposed to its satisfying in and of itself so that was my effort my my

327
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,119
attempt to offer you something is that you feel like it answered your

328
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,119
question

329
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:48,400
great you talked about um something coming up for you the first time you wanted to go to a weekl long retreat and

330
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:59,519
that that was fear and then you ended up going on a retreat a year later could you talk about how the fear went away oh

331
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:04,680
you know I I you know I know it was fear but I don't think I was so self-aware

332
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,920
back in those days to know what I was afraid of I just knew I was

333
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:18,839
afraid and um and I think the reason I was easier uh to to do go

334
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:26,720
back I think it was no it was more than it was almost two years before I went to the SEC I went back to do it again and

335
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,319
uh by that time I had moved to San Francisco and started uh uh I Liv in

336
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:39,400
there San Francisco Zen Center in an apartment and I started going and sitting every day with this Z Center and

337
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,880
uh in their meditation Hall and I started doing dayong retweets they did

338
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,280
and so uh 3ars of a year of doing that living in that close to that Zen Center

339
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:56,200
and in that environment and sitting every day with them I think that prepared me so I I don't think I had I

340
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:02,119
think I I didn't have fear I might have had some fear I don't remember but I didn't have the uh Fe

341
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:08,040
fear that um prevented me to go I think because I'd been I had become

342
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:14,960
familiar with that whole process I'd done enough meditation it just feel felt like a cont cont every day I sat you

343
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:22,480
know for I think we sat two hours you know two 2 40 minute periods every morning and and so I was I felt like I

344
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,640
it was just like a continuation rather than a big jump

345
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:35,200
and so for those of you who are interested in going on on a retreat some some people do really well being with beginner's luck they just jump right in

346
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,280
without knowing anything but I think for most people it's good to kind of build

347
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:46,680
up for it to it and um and so here at IMC we have what we call them we call

348
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:54,720
them half day Retreats um uh I told that to a monastic once and and he he was

349
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,440
like looked at me like what our Wednesday mornings here we have two

350
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:06,720
two sittings and we call it a retreat and um but we have these you

351
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:13,880
know these mornings to do practice here and then we have day longs on Saturday and so kind of to build

352
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:19,359
up thank you

353
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:28,040
can oh there hi Gil um so to

354
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:33,400
part of your talk about having a calling or feeling this calling uh it made me

355
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:40,160
think about how sometimes um you have more than one calling or things that um

356
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,359
really activate some energy and also maybe think about the fear around

357
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:51,560
callings and I'm just thinking I'm just wondering if you could speak about uh um

358
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:57,160
how practice can kind of help you navigate the complexity of life in that

359
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:03,839
way yeah uh maybe it

360
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,720
can't they uh you have to something something else

361
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:17,040
will have to operate to help you find your way um I think uh a wise life it's

362
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:26,359
there's so many callings so many great things to do in life and there's a kind of kind of uh in the kind of modern

363
00:40:26,359 --> 00:40:33,040
world there's so many options so many calls so many things that we we can do and think

364
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,599
we should do in a way that's never happened in human history before and so

365
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:44,240
uh people want everything um so a wise life especially

366
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:51,599
a spiritual life or dharmic life uh uh does require making

367
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:57,480
choices and and they have to figure out what the choices are and occasionally you can do two things or three things

368
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:03,240
and manag to balance them but uh uh sometimes you have to

369
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:09,240
choose and sometimes it's very hard to choose um but I I've been up against

370
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:15,520
that in my own life a number of times and um and sometimes I spent I me I've

371
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:22,319
spent at least a year uh gwing and struggling over this

372
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:27,760
question what should I do what path should I take here and um

373
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:34,040
and every time the gnawing the think i' go for walks I would think I would reflect spend a lot of time thinking and

374
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:39,280
wondering and it turned out that thinking uh was valuable I believe it

375
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:45,880
kind of was it was kind of like composting what was something inside so something can grow but the answer never

376
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:51,880
came from my thinking for me it just something inside suddenly new was always a sudden thing

377
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:58,400
now I knew what to do what I had to do so that was my way um um sometimes if

378
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:05,400
you don't know what to do you might just flip a coin and sometimes flipping a coin

379
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,000
whatever the result is you oh oh

380
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:15,720
no and and you know that that reveals something much more

381
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:22,200
clearly and the other thing is um I can offer is that uh I don't know what your

382
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:28,720
you know what the options are for you but sometimes um uh doing one thing

383
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:35,760
really well opens amazing doors so that uh maybe what the other

384
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:42,240
thing is can come and join it later or you find a way to do it later it just

385
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,400
right now I'm going to do this really well and create a foundation and and then something else can happen so I feel

386
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:54,079
least that's happened to me because um I don't know if I do it really well but I give my life to this kind of practice

387
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,960
here uh slowly over the decades all these do doors started opening up um in

388
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:05,559
society and in the Dharma and doors to do things so things that I wanted to do

389
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:11,400
when I was young U now I can do them in a whole different way I was for example

390
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:17,040
I was a Environmental Studies major in college I was I wanted to work with

391
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:23,040
ecology and and the environmental issues and now as a Buddhist teacher many years

392
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:30,319
later I started a Buddhist Eco chapy program and I taught uh uh nature Dharma

393
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:37,440
teacher training to support people to be able to teach this kind of practice in the wilderness and I feel like oh it

394
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:44,079
came back you know by doing this well enough that I could be train people to be teachers I got to train people to be

395
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:49,720
teachers in the wilderness so so anyway so just do one thing well and see what

396
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:56,839
comes out afterwards okay well thank you very much

397
00:43:56,839 --> 00:44:01,920
and we do have the tea today so it' be nice if you just turn towards someone

398
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:09,000
