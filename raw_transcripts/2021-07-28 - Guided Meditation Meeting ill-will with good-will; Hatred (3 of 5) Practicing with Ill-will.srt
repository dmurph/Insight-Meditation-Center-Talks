1
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:19,759
so good day everyone and welcome

2
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,680
so the topic overall for this week is to take a good look and at

3
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:41,040
dosa dosa a pali word that i think today i'll translate a little

4
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,519
differently than hatred or hostility but as ill will

5
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,160
and it uh that translation works well as a contrast or as a partner in a sense

6
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:01,440
through good will and it's easy to set up these in opposition to each other

7
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,560
and to feel like it should be either one or the other and but one of the wonderful things about

8
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,240
practice is the way we can bring things together and nothing's excluded everything has a

9
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,680
certain kind of place in the field of awareness and learning what that place is

10
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,720
is uh part of the art of mindfulness

11
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,759
of practice and one of the ways of holding these together is when there is ill-will

12
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:38,960
whether it's to another person or to oneself or some particular aspect of our experience even in meditation

13
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:46,240
some ill will to the medic meditation cushion we're sitting on because it's too hard or

14
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:54,399
or too anything that uh to bring it together like

15
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:01,439
you know left and a right hand coming together to hold each other bring them together of goodwill together

16
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,759
with ill will meet the ill will with goodwill

17
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,760
to sit in a field of certain generosity of heart

18
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:21,680
that is willing to gaze upon all things kindly including our unkindness

19
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,520
including the ways in which we might have an ill will

20
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,720
cynicism maybe even or snideness or or a certain kind of judgmentalism which

21
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,480
is kind of like stabbing at people or ourselves

22
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:48,000
but instead to meet ill will with good will it doesn't mean condoning it it doesn't

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,760
mean you know encouraging it to continue and do what it wants to do

24
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,319
but it is a way of not being in opposition with it that allows the ill will that we carry

25
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,720
to be held in a in a field in a embrace

26
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:14,959
that allows something in the ill will to relax ill will hostility hatred does represent

27
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:22,800
tension contraction tightness a certain kind of forcefulness

28
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:30,400
sometimes a certain kind of assertion of power

29
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,519
and good will is a different kind of power that's never assertive but

30
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,040
many people say that love was always more powerful than hate

31
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,319
and so as we sit here today you might consider what it'd be like to be mindful to be

32
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,080
present for your breathing for your body for your experience for your emotions

33
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:02,720
and whatever ill will might arise would it be like if it's met or held or

34
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:10,640
gazed upon with good will with kindness or friendliness or

35
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,959
a generosity of heart that doesn't condem but also doesn't

36
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,600
condone and but allow something deep

37
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,960
over time something deep inside to relax that would be good to relax

38
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,840
so assuming a meditation posture

39
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,040
and perhaps for this sitting maybe some care could be given to a

40
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,840
posture that expresses a good will to your body

41
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,840
that's caring for your body

42
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:07,280
adjusting your legs your arms your torso your head

43
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:15,039
just kind of all the little subtle and big ways in which you can kind of care for it and put it into a

44
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:22,400
posture that is is supportive and helpful for you

45
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,080
to meditate with goodwill

46
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,240
some people when they want to evoke goodwill will put their hand over their hearts

47
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,560
somehow the human touch contact and to feel the warmth that comes in

48
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,000
that space of contact and if there is warmth there to allow it

49
00:05:52,000 --> 00:06:00,160
to kind of settle in be received by the heart area

50
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,840
and to gently close your eyes

51
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:16,160
into maybe ever so slightly just to write for you take some

52
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:22,240
deeper breaths that express goodwill to yourself

53
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:29,600
care so this life-giving air that you take in

54
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:48,880
is done in a way that feels caring or nourishing

55
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:58,159
in a way of caring for yourself as you exhale to relax in your body

56
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,400
soften settling in and grounding here

57
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:17,840
in this body

58
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,840
and letting your breathing return to normal

59
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:54,400
is it possible to establish an attitude of goodwill of kindness

60
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,240
metta as the attitude of it carries or

61
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,840
supports the meditation today

62
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,919
perhaps it's experienced as a kind of tenderness a warmth

63
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:40,240
a caring a well-wishing

64
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,959
and to have with that attitude to settle into the experience of the

65
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,000
body breathing

66
00:08:53,279 --> 00:09:09,839
relaxing and softening

67
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:20,399
and if as you're sitting with your breathing something that arises that's challenging

68
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,000
for you or difficult see if you can

69
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,399
meet it or be aware of it with good will

70
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,959
maybe with the idea that this is difficult

71
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:51,839
and i wish this part of me i wish this whatever it is i do wish it to be well

72
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:05,839
i do wish that it knows that it's cared for and

73
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:20,160
in a world where ill will is so common good will can be revolutionary

74
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,240
it even changes the paradigm

75
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:35,200
and perhaps as we sit here now to let the paradigm be a simple

76
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,240
gentle goodwill

77
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:48,560
breathing in and breathing out settling into your breathing to the

78
00:10:48,560 --> 00:11:01,839
present moment

79
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,920
you

80
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,919
you

81
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,360
if you are wondering often thought is there something underneath or part of

82
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:29,919
the thinking that you can touch with kindness

83
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:49,840
with good will then relax let go of your thinking

84
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,919
you

85
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,919
you

86
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,880
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

87
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:06,559
we do a very variation of a common buddhist practice

88
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,600
which is to dedicate the merit of our practice

89
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:19,039
dedicate the benefits that we've had for practicing for the welfare of others

90
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:25,360
and there's a kind of a wonderful dynamic with dedication of

91
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:31,519
merit is to offer up the benefits we receive

92
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:40,320
for others for the whole world creates more merit we benefit from doing so

93
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:48,480
if we dedicate our practice for the welfare and happiness of others

94
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:56,240
and appreciate that the deepest or the fullest welfare and happiness that people can experience

95
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:03,840
is a freedom from attachments freedom from greed hatred and delusion

96
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:11,840
and so when we wish even difficult people in our lives that they be happy and safe and

97
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:18,639
peaceful and free if that actually is the case

98
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:30,720
we benefit because they'll be in the world without great hatred and delusion

99
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:38,880
it's this wonderful chemistry or dynamic of goodwill generosity

100
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,240
it's healthy for all of us in all directions

101
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:54,799
to practice lots of it so now as we end the sitting

102
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:01,039
may whatever benefit that has come from this practice today

103
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:08,799
may we find ways in which to enact it

104
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:16,320
to express it for the happiness of others

105
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,840
for the safety of others for the peace of others and for their

106
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:31,679
freedom may all beings be happy

107
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:41,840
may all beings be free

108
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:51,429
[Music]

109
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,919
you

110
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:50,640
i'm sorry about that that i kept the mic on while i was drinking and you had to hear the swallowing

111
00:30:50,640 --> 00:31:05,840
so um

112
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,640
so so the topic this week is a dosa

113
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:30,840
that i've been translating as hatred or hostility it's also translated as ill will

114
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:37,039
which has the benefit of being feeling like it can include a wider range

115
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:42,240
including um things that are even very mild and

116
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:48,799
there can be feeling there's a little bit of ill will in it and um and that you might not identify as

117
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:55,919
having hatred or hostility so it might be as simple as um you know

118
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,760
someone uh this crowds you a little bit too much in

119
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:09,200
the supermarket line uh maybe instead of six feet away they stand four feet away in

120
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:16,399
and you know and far enough you don't feel like you can say something but you really don't like it and and there's

121
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:23,120
so you feel this kind of little ill will like a little to that person

122
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,720
is that you know but is that necessary to have the ill will and

123
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:36,240
not hatred it's not hostility but it is kind of kind of an unkind attitude

124
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:45,440
so we will uh so today the topic is how to practice with ill will

125
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:52,480
and uh and this is a big topic practicing with it and uh and i want to kind of maybe try

126
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,519
to do it from the kind of a wide perspective first and then

127
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:04,640
bring it in closer and closer to the mindfulness practice with it and a wider perspective of it is that if

128
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,399
you want to practice with the ill will if you want to get a handle on ill will that you have and become wise

129
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:16,320
about it and even become free um

130
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:24,159
of it from it even if it's remains it's the kind of freedom you can find around it so you're not caught in its grip

131
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,200
one of the things to do is to live to is to reflect on it for a while think about it

132
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:36,559
contemplate uh talk to friends about it and to see if you can begin understanding what your relationship to

133
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:43,440
it is what attitude do you have towards ill will it do you have ill will towards it ill

134
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:51,120
will do you tend to regularly justify it and uh and hold on to it and

135
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:59,039
do you tend to feel shame because you have it do you tend to ignore it

136
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:05,919
and deny it and push it away all those are kind of common enough attitudes that people can have towards

137
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:11,358
ill will that they have and there's lots of other things but what is that relationship you have

138
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:17,839
what's the attitude and what are your beliefs about it do you believe that it's always wrong do

139
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:24,320
you believe it's always for you it's always justified and that's a tricky one because in some

140
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,760
ways maybe it is justified given how difficult

141
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:36,878
the experiences are that are happening to you and what people are doing but maybe it's easy to justify but

142
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:43,440
it's not really still the most strategic way of living your life

143
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:50,079
in the face of challenges maybe there are better ways and so anyway to look at the attitude we

144
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:56,398
have and the relationship and then to consider also

145
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:02,320
if you act on the ill will what happens what's the consequences of

146
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,760
that uh are the consequences in the world really beneficial or not

147
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,520
and um and maybe you sometimes expressing strong ill will to someone

148
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,640
you you it can be strategic in the moment to get what you want

149
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,320
but it maybe it doesn't really set up conditions for the long term that are very healthy or useful

150
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:30,000
and and so what are the dangers associated with the ill will

151
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,079
and um and then what happened what's it like for you when you walk around with ill will and

152
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,680
uh what are what are the what are the things that come with it um so anyway so there's all these

153
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,720
questions and to relive a reflective contemplative life and and to kind of question it

154
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:53,760
and consider it it's often helpful to do that with a friend a wise friend and even sometimes to engage your friend and

155
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,440
say you know can you ask i'd like to explore ill will and my relationship to it would you be willing to just kind of be

156
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:06,720
with me as i explore it maybe ask me questions and help out the benefit of that kind of reflection

157
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,000
is when you sit down to meditate you're wiser about the ill will you can recognize

158
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,800
some of the attitudes that come up some of the common strategies you have in relationship beliefs you have in relationship to ill

159
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:24,560
will that interfere with the ability to really be present for it

160
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,760
another thing that can be helpful before even before you meditate or during meditation

161
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:37,440
is to have some familiarity with metta some familiarity with some of the uh

162
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:44,240
emotions of kindness and compassion and care that we that can live inside of us and to

163
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,839
consider and this can be reflective also maybe conversation with friends what is the

164
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:56,320
relationship with ill good will to ill will and how is it how is there appropriate ways to bring

165
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:03,680
good will to ill will and have good will meet the ill will and or to touch ill will and i use those

166
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,040
words carefully meet and touch ill will because it's different than fixing and getting rid of

167
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:14,320
and i've had you know ill will and tried to use my practice to kind of blast it out

168
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:22,160
of existence it was kind of an ill will to ill will and but a touch touch it and so to

169
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:29,760
kind of begin exploring this world of ours in relationship to our to to goodwill and how do we what is

170
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:36,320
goodwill and where does that live in our lives and and um and uh so this is a reflective life a

171
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:43,280
contemplative life that lets things deepen and fill out for us so when we come to meditate for example

172
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:50,880
that's in the background that's there's a foundation that's a support for the mindfulness practice itself so

173
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:58,240
in mindfulness practice whether it's on the cushion it's meditation or in regular life mindfulness practice

174
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,520
entails in a sense stopping and looking

175
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:11,119
so we have ill will we want to stop and take a good look and the stopping is um means we don't

176
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:17,040
just barrel ahead be busy in our life but if the situation allows it

177
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:23,760
to uh maybe even pause and um and so that you really reckon oh this

178
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:30,880
is what's happening now sometimes there can be a kind of a general simple understanding that there's ill will

179
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,640
there but um and then we kind of may some people might be content well that's kind of mindfulness

180
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,000
but it's not really stopping and pausing and really taking an honest good look and seeing

181
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,480
this is what's happening there's ill will here and then having stopped to take a really look at

182
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:55,040
it take the time to familiarize yourself with it to be in the present moment with the experience

183
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:02,079
which is what the seeing is and and begin seeing it more fully with eyes

184
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:07,280
that maybe have a little good will or eyes that are not inten

185
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:13,760
not caring with it all our attitudes that we have about it that make it so much complicated but to

186
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,359
see to stop and look at the ill will

187
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:26,480
with eyes that are simple present without hostility without condoning it

188
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,839
without justifying it without feeling shame about it or critical about it

189
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:39,680
just to kind of look at it just for itself for what it is as if ill will

190
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,520
it there is a rightness appropriateness to really stop and take a look at the

191
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:51,920
experience of ill will in and of itself as if it has permission to be there

192
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:56,960
but because you've stopped there's no danger that you're going to act on it in

193
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,960
harmful ways you're just going to look at it and really get to know it and one

194
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:10,000
of the ways with many things in meditation expressed is to feel it in your body what's how is it

195
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,160
experienced where is the center of it where is it expressed most in the body where is the tension where is the heat

196
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:22,079
where's the pressure uh where's the place that wants to do something and act

197
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,920
and to feel it in the body and one of the advantages of really feeling

198
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,599
it in the body is the body is not a story and one of the things that fuels ill

199
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,960
will is a story making mind she said he said they said

200
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,560
and and so instead of kind of continuing with the stories and

201
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:51,760
the conversations we're kind of dropping in and letting the body be the place that

202
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:58,319
we feel what's actually happening there's something very significant about the feeling ill will in the body

203
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:03,920
is that the body has an ability to process difficult emotions that's a very

204
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:10,079
different way than the con the cognitive mind the mind that thinks about things and

205
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:17,760
analyzes things and um imagines things the body has a tremendous healing power

206
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,920
and to drop down and feel the body is part part of this healing potential

207
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:30,319
we have and one way that healing happens is that just as soon as you're feeling in your

208
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:36,800
body you can feel the tensions and those tensions can begin to melt away

209
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:44,240
and that changes the whole relationship to ill will because some of the fuel power that ill will has comes from the

210
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:50,000
tension we hold in our body or in our mind in our hearts and so

211
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,040
um it might also be useful to notice what other emotions come along with ill

212
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:01,680
will there might be underlying emotions that are really the ill will it's just a symptom of deeper

213
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:07,359
emotions there might be fear there might be hurt there might also be

214
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:12,960
deep inside a sense of conceit a sense of self that we're contracted around

215
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,119
and to drop in and start feeling carefully those underlying attitudes feelings

216
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:26,319
emotions contractions sense of self sometimes is much more useful than just paying attention to the ill will

217
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:33,040
and i find it very helpful sometimes to think of ill will it's just a si messenger don't kill the messenger

218
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:39,520
what's the message what's what's going on more deeply and then to feel and be mindful of that

219
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:46,960
it's not an analysis but it's feeling our way into what's deeper what's really going on here

220
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:55,040
and and then sometimes with ill will there is a mindfulness of the stories we do the beliefs we have

221
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:01,280
and the fascinating thing there is to see them just as thoughts to be able to be quiet still

222
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,280
enough to have stopped enough just to observe a belief come up a thought there

223
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,640
without believing it without picking it up or being involved and like almost

224
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:18,560
like you step back and you know you watch

225
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:25,119
you know you could maybe if you could watch a thought bubble rise up above the head of a friend

226
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:31,839
maybe you know it's like a little bit or a stranger you're a little bit detached you're a little bit removed you're not entangled

227
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:37,119
with it um so sometimes we kind of step back and watch the thoughts the story of making

228
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:43,838
mind that sometimes is so important for perpetuating the ill will

229
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:52,079
and um and then uh always finding some way to uh maybe relax to find the places

230
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:58,240
where there's tension and if it's easy enough to relax it and settle

231
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:05,280
so to practice with it to be present for it to be mindful of it

232
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:13,119
and and uh and all along if you have some interest and and value

233
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:19,599
in goodwill to do this whole practice of practicing with ill will with an

234
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:24,640
attitude of goodwill that you're doing this even though it's difficult you're doing it for your own

235
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:30,160
welfare and happiness for the long term happiness it might be difficult in the moment

236
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:35,760
but the more familiarity and the more wisdom and the more capacity we have to be mindful and

237
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:42,800
present with ill will the more that will slowly begin to build and create

238
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:51,280
a more and more a greater and greater wise way of living with it until ill will you'll discover one day

239
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:58,800
has less and less hold on you with less and less power over you it might still arise but instead of

240
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:05,440
being alarmed or going along with it you say oh there's my old friend ill will it's okay

241
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:11,040
you can kind of just stay there and i'm not going to get involved with that and later we'll practice with you or

242
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:18,880
we'll sit down so um in these few minutes that i have

243
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:23,920
that's what i have to say about practicing with ill will and

244
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:30,319
um it's a well worthwhile i think it's part of a responsible life

245
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:37,680
is to um is to really learn the art the ability to be mindful of ill

246
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:44,480
will so that it doesn't get the upper hand and so we don't cause harm in this world

247
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:50,960
so thank you and um and so one of the things you might think of doing in practicing with

248
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:57,599
ill will even the slightest for this next day is to maybe see in what way does ill

249
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:03,280
will contract you into yourself so that the sense of self or conceit or something is

250
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:10,319
there is highlighted or if to what what degree does ill will

251
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:17,680
create an unhealthy separation from other people and both directions are possible

252
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:23,359
you see the the difficulty in yourself to have ill will and you see the difficulty it creates

253
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:29,839
socially so you might see how that operates

254
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:36,000
thank you very much
