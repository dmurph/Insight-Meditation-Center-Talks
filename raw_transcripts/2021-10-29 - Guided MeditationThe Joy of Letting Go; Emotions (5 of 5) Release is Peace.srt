1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,040
so

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,598
hello everyone thank you for being here

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,480
and

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:26,400
today the theme is release in relationship to emotions

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,880
now this uh process of being with emotions

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,280
to do so in a healthy mindful way

7
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,680
uh increases our capacity to feel wholesome emotions

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:53,360
and one of those is joy delight kind of happiness

9
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,840
and it's useful when engaged in mindfulness to

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,719
remember to allow for joy

11
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:12,720
it's maybe easy to overlook easy to think other things are more important

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:20,240
but some degree of joy supports the process of waking up here in the present moment

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,200
and we might think about that to release letting go

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,479
is really works really is significant or

15
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:38,720
appropriate when there is something in the family of joy in the process of letting go of

16
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:45,680
releasing it feels good it feels right and

17
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,560
so in these five kind of kind of kind of underlying themes threads

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,200
for each of these weeks it's relaxation recognition

19
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,119
respect restoration and release

20
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:11,920
each of those steps has a little bit of release in it each of the first four

21
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,520
and each of the first four and having a little bit of release it might be possible to look for

22
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,879
a peaceful joy a peaceful delight or well-being appreciation

23
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:31,040
that maybe is not evaluative it just kind of feels like it's part of it

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,480
so with relaxation it's one thing to relax and appreciate

25
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,360
and feel that feel the good of it but maybe it's possible to also appreciate a little little joy or

26
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,680
delight that oh this is good this is a good fortune to be able to let

27
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,640
go to release all that recognition is also a kind of release

28
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:04,319
because when we learn the simplicity of recognition really simply just knowing something in and of itself

29
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,760
and then for that moment at least we've stepped away from being entangled

30
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:17,200
with it judging it uh identifying with it it's just recognizing oh that's that

31
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,879
so if there is pain someplace in the body it's difficult to be with pain i don't

32
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:29,120
want to belittle or minimize the difficulty but in the moment of recognition

33
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,799
there is a kind of freedom there's a kind of letting go and it may be less just a fleeting moment of the

34
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:41,120
recognition but to learn to recognize the letting go the release that happens in their

35
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,840
recognition and there's that potential in recognition

36
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,680
to respect what's happening is also a letting go of our disrespect our entanglement our cotness

37
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,159
and um and there too there's a kind of releasing of something that made the relationship maybe more

38
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:10,400
complicated need to be and i think of deep respect to reality to ourselves to others

39
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,079
that there's a release that is joyful there rather than being subservient to offer

40
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,160
respect to someone it's actually a freeing of ourselves

41
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,560
restoration to feel to allow for the movement of energy in the body

42
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,880
the healing the processing the the unfolding of of our life to trust it

43
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:42,479
and open to it and feel the goodness of how that unfolds is also a kind of release getting out of

44
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:48,320
the way and all this kind of sets the stage for

45
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:55,440
appreciating the the joy the value the wonderfulness of really being free

46
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,199
and which is release so i'm going to guide you in this today

47
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,440
a little bit more of an exercise perhaps in two rounds of release

48
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,560
of going through this process of uh these four or five processes with

49
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,320
idea that each time there's a kind of release and once just kind of do to settle in

50
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,160
and once in relationship to emotions

51
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,639
so um and i apologize to those of you who want more silence for this and hopefully

52
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,160
you'll get it another time meditating on your own so

53
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,759
to us to assume your meditation pro

54
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:46,400
posture and

55
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:56,320
lower your gaze and lowering your gaze can you relax your eyes

56
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:07,240
and with your eyes relaxed if it feels appropriate to close your eyes

57
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,720
and with your eyes closed can you relax your gaze some more

58
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,120
letting your eyes rest in the eye sockets

59
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,639
and to make smoke with the eyes closed maybe you can be a tune and tune into

60
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:40,680
your body a little bit more make small adjustments in your posture

61
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,400
and then as you take two or three four deep inhales

62
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:01,120
let the exhale be a release of letting go a long sustained

63
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,440
gentle letting go as you exhale

64
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,280
and then letting your breathing return to normal

65
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,599
and to go through the body to relax it some more as you breathe normally

66
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,039
but as you relax if it's possible to relax these parts of the body

67
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:51,120
see if you can have some enjoyment of that or some joy or appreciation delight

68
00:07:51,120 --> 00:08:00,160
it could be very very faint but see if you can recognize the goodness of letting go of relaxing

69
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,280
so softening relaxing the muscles of your face

70
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,639
softening relaxing the shoulders

71
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,120
as you exhale relaxing the chest

72
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:49,240
and as you exhale relaxing the belly

73
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:07,320
and as you exhale a global relaxation throughout the body

74
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:25,040
and then to recognize

75
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:31,760
as simple and relaxed uncomplicated way that you can

76
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:39,279
recognize how you are in the simplest way

77
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:49,040
and it is such a way that there's a little bit of letting go in their recognition

78
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,760
letting go of our judgments and entanglements

79
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,160
letting go of being foreign against

80
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,319
recognition that's a kind of opening to experience

81
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:19,079
that has some modicum of a joy

82
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:25,760
good feeling to let go of the entanglement and just

83
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:32,200
recognize just let things be as they are and recognize them

84
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:47,399
and however you are right now can you respect it

85
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:01,160
letting go of anything that could be that gets in the way of respect

86
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:09,120
let's let's letting go of anything that

87
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,880
doesn't honor

88
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,440
whatever experience you have at this moment of being alive

89
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,720
any judgments or stories you have about who you are and what's

90
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:37,440
happening it doesn't respect the

91
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,519
aliveness of the moment

92
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,040
and then to allow the restoration

93
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,600
to trust that there's something here within you

94
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:10,800
that if allowed to process will heal and repair and

95
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,920
cultivate develop unfold healthy way

96
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:25,079
to let go of being the engineer of our experience let go of

97
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:34,399
more judgments of it or resistance to it and feel the goodness the joy of

98
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:41,040
allowing this our system

99
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,920
to find its way

100
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:08,959
and then we come to release and with every exhale

101
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:15,279
let go let go of thoughts let go of

102
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:21,839
preoccupations let go of preferences

103
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:32,800
and in the letting go can you recognize

104
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,959
some degree of joy or goodness in doing so

105
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,639
and then ever so gently

106
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,240
see if you can make a very small smile with your lips

107
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,600
smile of joy and see if turning up the corners of

108
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,240
your mouth produces any pleasant feelings for you

109
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,199
however subtle

110
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:17,040
and if there is any pleasant feeling or any joy

111
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,680
relax into that keep the half smile

112
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:31,199
but relax into the pleasure of it the joy of

113
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,480
it recognize the joy the pleasure

114
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,480
in the smile or in just being alive breathing down

115
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:03,079
and in recognizing it staying simple with it letting go of

116
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:09,560
complications and doubts and protests

117
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:30,079
respecting your embodied capacity

118
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:37,160
to feel joy well-being happiness

119
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,880
breathe with it

120
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:14,640
and allow for restoration healing allow for some kind of

121
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,760
whatever wants to happen as this simple joy

122
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:30,519
calm quiet joy or well-being is given space to be here

123
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,160
and then release any grasping or holding

124
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:09,120
release any resistance or any stressful feelings related to

125
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:18,240
how you are and maybe feel the quiet joy

126
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,760
of release

127
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:06,440
and then in the middle of it all centering yourself on the breathing

128
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,240
and the more you give yourself over to breathing

129
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,200
the more all five of these processes the five hours

130
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:41,520
have a chance to grow and unfold trusting yourself with the breathing

131
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:52,200
letting there be a joy and breathing in and breathing out

132
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,919
you

133
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:18,039
and then as we come to the end of the sitting there's a letting go

134
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:24,880
releasing that allows us to turn our hearts out to

135
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:31,720
the world not as a duty or an obligation

136
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,200
but that the alternative is to stay closed or stay

137
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,080
limited and to allow our freedom

138
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:51,200
our liberation or release have a chance to become full

139
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:56,399
we also want to allow our capacity to feel

140
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:01,519
to know to empathize

141
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:07,679
to be open to the world around us to the people we know our neighbors our friends

142
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,640
strangers people in our community

143
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:20,240
and what is it to let go and so that we can capacity to

144
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,440
empathize to feel to know to connect

145
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,679
can grow

146
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,440
so they can be a channel for our good will

147
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:43,279
our care for the world and to turn our attention to

148
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:50,960
offering care to the world at the end of a sitting is a way of

149
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,559
supporting protecting even our freedom

150
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,679
may it be that through our care

151
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:14,240
that we promote the happiness of others

152
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:22,320
may it be through our care that we support the safety of others

153
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:30,399
may it be through our presence that we offer

154
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:39,279
a peacefulness to others and may it be through our own freedom

155
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:46,879
that we help spread a spiritual freedom in this world

156
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,480
may all beings everywhere be happy

157
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:15,839
so here on the fifth talk on mindfulness of emotions

158
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:22,079
where we've talked about release release in relationship to emotions

159
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:28,240
i think i said this at the beginning as well that um some emotions

160
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:35,839
are a product or arise together with stress with tension

161
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,079
and in some emotions a flow with the lack of tension the lack of

162
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:48,800
stress and generally the unwholesome emotions the ones that are

163
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:56,480
afflictive that are painful to have or which motivate kind of harmful activity in the world

164
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,960
that those come with stress and so as we release the stress release

165
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:08,960
the tension the tightness uh those afflictive unwholesome emotions

166
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:16,280
tend to have less energy less juice less nourishment to keep going

167
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,280
the emotions the sense of well-being that we can have when there's no stress

168
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:31,119
no tension that then that tends to support to make room for the wholesome movements

169
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,160
and so the absence of stress tends not to

170
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,200
result in more afflictive emotions but rather the beneficial emotions the

171
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:48,320
supportive emotions and nourishing emotions love joy delight happiness

172
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,599
care compassion contentment

173
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,359
gladness tranquility and calm and

174
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:05,359
a whole slew of things like this and

175
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:11,280
the um so this release to really learn how to release and let go

176
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,520
it doesn't leave us kind of emotionally neutral kind of like a blank

177
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,920
what it does it might be initially that way for a little while uh as a transition because if we're really used

178
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:31,200
to swirling and fear anxiety swirling and anger resentments swirling and desires

179
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:37,440
and ambition that we're comfortable some people are comfortable with that

180
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,680
and so when they let go of that there's the energy the motivation this the charge that they've been living their

181
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,760
life on is lacking and nothing has replaced it yet and can feel blank for a while

182
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:56,800
but it's kind of like you know giving up coffee and having spent three days adjusting to that until

183
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:03,280
kind of a natural vitality comes back same thing with as we switch from spending a lot of time with afflictive

184
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,400
difficult emotions it may be a lifetime there's a

185
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:16,000
transition but as that transition unfolds and the the lack of tension and stress is there

186
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,119
that makes room for these beneficial emotions and um and uh

187
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,560
and then they uh i know so i think that's kind of i find it kind of humorous or delightful

188
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:35,760
that as these beneficial emotions arise any movement to cling to them to resist

189
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,960
them or want to hold on to them is stress

190
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:47,359
and is the very opposite moves us in the opposite direction from

191
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:53,599
what they're all about so it's kind of like uh you know uh

192
00:37:53,599 --> 00:38:00,079
you know rubbing a cat putting a cat against the against the

193
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:07,599
the hair or the way the hair lays down and all the hair gets kind of bunched up and rised up rather than flat down

194
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:13,599
or going against the grain of the wood uh to cling to these emotionally good

195
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:20,160
emotions so it's kind of like a tendency to want to hold on to them or do do do with them it's there but at the

196
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,200
same time you know you can't do it it doesn't make sense to do it it's not appropriate to do it it's actually

197
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:31,040
and so it's kind of i find it kind of humorous to be in that in that middle spot there and

198
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,480
and uh and you know and then just you know just delight and just that oh i can't do anything with it i

199
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:43,040
can't hold on to it i have to let go i can't make it mine i can't you know be in charge of it in a certain

200
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:49,760
way or claim it and it's a there's that there's freedom in relationship to them

201
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,760
so but some people don't understand or haven't been told or learned

202
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:03,359
that as we practice those matures and as it letting go deepens

203
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:10,079
the connection to our inner life deepens to life deepens that there's also joy and well-being and

204
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:15,119
happiness it doesn't have to be dramatic sometimes has a quiet feeling to it

205
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:21,760
but to avail ourselves that to make room for that release is not only about what we let go

206
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,200
of it's also what we make room for and

207
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:32,400
and in that making a room for there's a lot of peace and i think the two words two concepts

208
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,320
of the buddha most commonly uh used to describe how someone is when

209
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:45,520
there's been a deep letting go deep release is peace and happiness

210
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,640
and peaceful happiness happy peace peace and happiness

211
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:56,480
and i don't think we can go too wrong with those in the forefront especially

212
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:02,320
when those are the very conditions that allow for our deepest

213
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:08,480
or fullest forms of care for the world to operate as well because there's nothing it interferes

214
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:14,000
with it there's no blocks to it so to let go deeply

215
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,040
and uh in relationship to emotions uh to let go of the stories we have

216
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:24,800
about it to like go over the preferences we have about the our emotional life to be able

217
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,960
to tease apart all the different component parts of what's happening when we have emotions and find the place of

218
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,880
holding and sometimes the clinging and the holding is not in the emotion itself

219
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:43,920
but in the in the way in which we relate to the emotion the knowing the directedness of

220
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:50,160
attention the uh the attitude we have about it the ways we're

221
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,520
thinking about it and so sometimes we have to kind of turn away from the emotion per se

222
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:01,280
and look more at the attitude more at the the directedness of mind or the

223
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:09,119
the engagement of the mind in the emotion to find a place where something can let go and relax

224
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,960
and um and to let go to relax to

225
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:20,400
release and to appreciate every moment of release

226
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,160
so it becomes that's kind of a positive reinforcement for release we start recognizing that

227
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:33,119
release letting go is a healthy thing a good thing to learn to let go enough so we learn

228
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:39,280
the skill of letting go we learn when it's appropriate to let go to learn we learned how to let go

229
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:45,119
appropriately one of the things i had to learn was if i let go

230
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:50,720
but there was i was kind and i was kind of emotionally neutral he would come back and bite me i didn't

231
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,079
really hadn't really let go to really have let go in a healthy way that

232
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,599
there had to be some modicum some degree of joy or lightness

233
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,880
that came in the wake of it so to release

234
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:13,040
let go and you might try it you might try when you have emotions of

235
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,240
all kinds especially when you're in the grip of them are strong

236
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:24,400
maybe you have to kind of pull yourself away from the situation you're in go for a walk or sit down or something

237
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:29,520
and and just kind of maybe go through these you know just

238
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:35,280
letting go in a deep way maybe go through these five hours um and some people really like going

239
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,359
through a systematic process that keeps them engaged and focused and so

240
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:49,359
to relax recognize respect restore and then release but all those

241
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:56,240
are a form of letting go and um and uh or involve some degree of letting

242
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:01,920
go release so

243
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,880
thank you for this in my experience my practice life

244
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:17,280
one of the byproducts of release letting go of releasing releasing the stress

245
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:23,599
is a profound gratitude it's a tremendous feeling of gratitude and and now it's one of the i think i've

246
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:31,920
been one of the great gifts of this practice and it's a gratitude which

247
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,000
often i haven't sometimes i feel grateful for particular things the practice the buddha the

248
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,319
community i'm practicing with many things but the one that kind of gratitude that

249
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:50,319
i've i find the most i don't know somehow meaningful or satisfying or

250
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:56,160
profound or something joyful is the gratitude that it's just grateful

251
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,520
for no reason just grateful and just just a feeling of gratitude

252
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,040
gratefulness and um so emotions

253
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,079
done a week on emotions and i hope that this has given you a new

254
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:18,000
perspective on how to live with emotions practice with emotions appreciate emotions

255
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,200
and and that it supports you and brings you a greater

256
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:29,280
sense of well-being and maybe even some gratitude for this life of ours

257
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:33,560
so thank you all very much
