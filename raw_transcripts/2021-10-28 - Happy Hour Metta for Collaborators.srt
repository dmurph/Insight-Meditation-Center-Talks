1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:05,918
so hello and welcome to

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,679
this edition of happy hour practicing

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:18,560
mata and the brahmavihara is together [Music]

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:27,039
so so for our practice today

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,439
i'd like to invite us to um

6
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,239
to break to our mind and hearts today in our practice um

7
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:46,239
meta for our collaborators our collaborators past present

8
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,680
and future our co-creators people with whom

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:59,120
or beings with whom we have collaborated in the past personal projects

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,520
um work projects um

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,119
volunteer work because

12
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:19,040
none of us is an island and the work that we dedicate ourselves

13
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,040
to whatever it might be it's always a collaboration the

14
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,720
co-creation of some kind of some kind sometimes it's more

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,000
apparent more easily noted that it's supported by the work of others

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,200
sometimes it's it's a brainstorm and working together creating

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,680
so [Music] so

18
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,159
there are one reason why it's helpful it's important perhaps to practice with in this way you

19
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,560
know with with let's say with practice of meta kindness

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,800
good will we do this practice in concentric

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,800
circles as you know right we start with ourselves and go to benefactors and

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,280
friends neutral beings um and then to those we have difficulty

23
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,520
with and all beings and when we get to the all beings category all beings

24
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,959
one way that traditionally all beings practice is

25
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:40,000
taught because if you just think of all beings in a way the mind kind of goes a little numb like all beings it's

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,480
kind of hard to imagine all beings we divide it into lots of different

27
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,760
categories different you know categories of beings that are like this or beings that

28
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:00,239
are like that so just so that the mind can kind of grasp oh yeah these beings oh yeah then these beings so that

29
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:07,040
there's a sense of relatability right so one way to think of this practice as i'm introducing tonight for us to

30
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:14,319
consider people we've collaborated with or collab will collaborate with or just collaborators as a category is both as a

31
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:21,120
way to think of it oh yes as this unique category we usually don't think about of all beings so that we can kind of rock

32
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,879
it connect with this category and also it's a category that's kind of

33
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,640
spread perhaps over some of the other categories right amongst the collaborators could be

34
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,319
people that um are our benefactors our work are what we contribute to the world

35
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:45,120
really depends on their work depends on their goodness on their gifts to us some of them might be dear friends so

36
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,799
the category of dear friends like oh yeah we really like these collaborators they're just good friends

37
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,239
some of them might be in the category of neutral like we don't quite know them yet maybe we'll just we're thrown into a

38
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,510
project to work together in the past or present or future some of them might be in the category of

39
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:08,239
[Music] guess what those we have challenges with

40
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:16,239
that wonderful category of people who are our best teachers and really seeing

41
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,160
the areas of um of entanglement in our heart where our

42
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:28,720
heart has entanglement so so this category there's a has a lot

43
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,919
going for it has a lot going for it this collaborator category so i'm just

44
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,919
bringing this to life and again right now may not you know you may not be working you

45
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:47,280
might be retired but i trust you've had collaborators in your past the past again either work or family

46
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,639
groups maybe you've hosted a party together or you know a reunion and

47
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:58,080
you've had collaborators so just people you have co-created with so

48
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,199
that you're not alone you're not an island we're not an island and also in this way

49
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,400
humility comes in we don't do things on our own so many

50
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:17,600
causes and conditions and people [Music] support us and we support them to

51
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,720
co-create what is what is here in this world so it also brings up a sense of humility to not just all me me me we

52
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,960
come together so so i hope i have convinced you

53
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,960
that this is a juicy category um that has a lot of implications

54
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,560
and and uh and also to to invite you to be creative with it and don't say oh i'm

55
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,440
retired am i working right now but just be creative with this who are your collaborators now who have

56
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,440
been maybe in the past who knows what the future might bring so have fun with this see how you can

57
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,160
um inhabit uh fill in this category with all the gifts that it has with humility and

58
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,840
co-creation and seeing our parts and other people's parts and all of that so

59
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,160
it has a lot going for it there's a lot of good threads here so okay

60
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,280

in our body with our breath

66
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,919

within this body alone appreciating all this

79
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,959
orchestration coordination

80
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,399
where we seemingly don't have to do anything about it

81
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,480
or the beneficiary

82
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,360
uh

83
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,440
receiving the breath

84
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,160
in the abdomen

85
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:39,320

and first i'd like to invite us as we continue to stay embodied with this

89
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,959
theme of collaboration [Music] to bring to bring to your heart to

90
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:19,800
yourself this being who is you

91
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,519
as a partner as a collaborator

92
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:41,040
in your projects in your life and this collaborator who's you

93
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:47,040
sometimes a benefactor

94

supports you loves you is caring is generous

95
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:04,399
supportive

96
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,560
some time

97
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:24,160
they serve but they show up as a dear friend as a good friend

98
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,839
patient

99
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,040
appreciating [Music] your good qualities as you

100
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,880
appreciate theirs what they bring to this collaboration sometimes

101
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:49,519
you show up for yourself as the person you're having challenges with

102
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,360
having patience gosh why couldn't this person do it do

103
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:02,320
it this better as part of this project i have some humor about this

104
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:09,279
invitation i'm bringing in seeing all the ways in which we our own our own collaborators and this

105
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:15,000
categories these categories show up for us

106
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:44,079
you can see if you can appreciate all these different ways that you show up for yourself

107
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:51,320
this collaboration that is your life your projects your work

108
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,000
the sense of humor appreciating the gifts

109
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,800
the goodness the talents

110
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:15,120
the idiosyncrasies the challenges the shortcomings

111
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:21,399
with humor with warm-heartedness

112
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:59,279
see if there can be some tenderness towards these very variations

113
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,199
especially towards the collaborator you're having challenges with now then

114
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,640
they're doing the best they can

115

hmm

190
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,240
acknowledging that your collaboration with

191
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,119
these collaborators is impermanent it has arisen

192
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:41,359
and it will come to an end at some point if it already hasn't it's

193
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,640
all impermanent it's all impermanent and what is more

194
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,838
important to you in collaboration if it's ongoing right now

195
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:59,640
fostering goodwill care generosity

196
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,920
service

197
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:39,000

203
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,480

204
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:41,280
what did you notice what was it like for you what did you discover

205
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,560
barbara please

206
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,480
oops you're still muted

207
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,720
oops still muted let's try that one more time

208
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:11,200
down here yes can hear you now uh as i was thinking over

209
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:18,079
my uh sort of a life time a career of working in different

210
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,359
ways with different people the

211
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:31,240
so many collaborators and i must say now that i'm retired my very best friends are former

212
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:36,720
collaborators from different jobs you know decades ago

213
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,640
and that the bonds formed by someone who's really a good collaborator

214
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:47,920
is just worth their weight in gold

215
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:55,599
yay that's a beautiful reflection yeah that there's so many friendships

216
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:01,440
have come from deep engagement beautiful engagement together yeah

217
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,560
very sweet thank you for sharing that

218
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:14,000
abraham please oops where did abraham go

219
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,560
uh oh there you are there we go hi hi

220
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:27,359
so um two thoughts one was that uh maybe because i'm a very opinionated

221
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,400
human being i there's a lot of collaborators that i have in my life

222
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,760
that we didn't necessarily call ourselves collaborators

223
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,440
more like competitive but you know that's that's the whetstone that

224
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:51,040
sharpens the knife you know the people that you rub up against really hard they teach you so much or they

225
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,640
i got learned a lot the other thing because i am older maybe or maybe a

226
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:02,480
young person would do this too but i have such a lifetime of people

227
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,400
uh it just was flooding me at times it was like as i was doing meta for this

228
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,480
one it would trigger me to go here and trigger me to go there it was it was quite uh

229
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:20,480
quite a flow of of ideas so i'm just interested in how that happened for

230
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:26,960
other people thank you abraham yeah

231
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:35,280
thanks for that share and also the invitation if others want to share and for me i'll share from my practice i

232
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:43,440
think for me what what called to me most today was to um have meta for for one project that

233
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:51,040
i'm currently working on with some collaborators just they lit up they really lit up just i just stayed with

234
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:58,640
them it was so yeah just their presence i appreciated their contribution their good will

235
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:04,240
their talents their skills and just taking their perspective it was just

236
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:11,359
so hard opening and brought in more humility and and appreciation for for

237
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:18,240
their being their roles all of that all of us together again as i was saying the streams coming together

238
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,079
so much bigger than any of us alone so that's that's the way it showed up for me neil

239
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,119
i see your hand please so

240
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:36,240
so i mean i i you know i found myself thinking about the people who come and pick up my trash

241
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:42,480
you know i mean you know that's not like a direct collaboration perhaps but but gosh they sure make my

242
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:47,760
life easier and you know i mean right and who who who who made

243
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:55,200
that truck that they pick it up in and mind thee or i mean you know right i mean you know i found

244
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:01,520
myself thinking about lots of people you know and who made the discoveries right i mean it went back you know it

245
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,760
went far back in time and wide across lots of areas you know

246
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,440
certainly you know my parents who gave me their dna um you know i mean

247
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,880
you know i mean i had reasonably competent parents but even if i had terrible ones they're still the ones who

248
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:24,400
gave me their dna um you know i mean you know even if even if that was the

249
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:30,400
end of their goodness i mean that was like a good deal um it was a pretty big collaboration for

250
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,440
to make a meal happen

251
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:42,079
maybe regrettable but i mean you know i just i mean there were just so many people who seemed involved

252
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:47,599
you know right right right you know the people who keep the lights on i mean

253
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:53,440
yeah lovely thank you neil i'm just delighted

254
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:59,440
hearing the way it showed up for you all the all the

255
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:06,240
millions i don't know how many uncountably many uncountably many collaborators through

256
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:12,240
your life and that's how this practice showed up for you tonight which is beautiful it makes me happy to know and

257
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,680
and to hear that just the variety the way he showed up for abraham and for me and for you just it's all different all

258
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:24,800
good whatever is needed whatever the heart is calling it's all beautiful these beautiful reflections there's no

259
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:31,680
right way to practice this these are just invitations so yay

260
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:37,280
delighted so speaking of that we will now

261
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:44,480
the invitation now is for us to engage in a collaboration a small collaboration of

262
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,920
a group of roughly three together collaborating in a small sangha

263
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:55,680
co-creating with each other and hearing as abraham invited like i wonder

264
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:01,839
what else showed up for people how did it show up for them you get the chance to hear and share with each other

265
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:07,440
so i will create the breakout rooms and again let's start with maybe 10-15

266
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,560
seconds of silent meta

267
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:18,160
and wishing each other well and then share as little or as much as you wish

268
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:23,520
by your practice have fun with your collaborators your co-creators

269
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:29,920
here you go okay welcome back everyone welcome back

270
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:36,240
the rooms are closed and we've got a couple minutes for any reflections questions

271
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:41,440
oh as you're coming out of rooms i heard folks say deep bows and hugs oh that

272
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:48,000
just warmed my heart that was so sweet to hear it was so sweet to hear so please don't

273
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,119
be shy especially if you haven't shared today in a while love to hear from you

274
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,960
what did you discover with this practice what did you discover

275
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:05,119
sharing your insights your wisdom your question your confusion for the benefit of all beings

276
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,760
it's all good

277
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:19,599
especially if you're shy you're invited you're hesitating like oh i don't know about this talking in public thing lisa

278
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:25,760
please hi thank you nikki this talking group

279
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:31,760
helped me remember so i had a class that i've been in for four months and today

280
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,200
and it was such a wonderfully supportive group with

281
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:43,040
the teachers and other students like definitely a collaboration and i was feeling really sad

282
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:48,400
like about the impermanence and then hearing my two

283
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:54,400
group mates like talk about other phases of the journey where they are in that process like of

284
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:59,599
starting a collaboration and what comes up with that or like being past one years later

285
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:07,200
and reflecting back and it just helped me remember and not be so stuck and focused on the

286
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:13,599
ending because i was really going down into that like pulled into that understandably but

287
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:19,280
so yeah so the dovetailing with the impermanence and like just being able to

288
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,640
see being reminded of like the fuller cycle yeah

289
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:30,160
so thank you to everyone thank you lisa yeah thank you for for

290
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:35,920
sharing that that's beautiful i love the juxtaposition of his appreciation and the sadness for this ending is like oh

291
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:41,839
yes it is impermanent and the cycle in the ear from all of that yeah beautiful thanks for

292
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:48,760
sharing that that's lovely katie i think it's katie

295
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:17,520

296
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:24,720
that on all the color collaborations i've had throughout my life and the culmination is the color advocacy

that i have now um

298
