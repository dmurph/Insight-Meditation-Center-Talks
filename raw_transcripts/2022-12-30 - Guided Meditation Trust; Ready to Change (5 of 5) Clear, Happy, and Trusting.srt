1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,400
hello everyone

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,779
that this last meditation of the Year thank you for all of you

3
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:26,660
being part of it however long you have and um

4
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,660
so to just jump right into the meditation

5
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,899
one of the interesting perspectives

6
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:50,879
of for meditation is to consider what you trust and what you

7
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,340
don't trust and certainly there are where is your

8
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,879
mind involved in what are your thoughts do their thoughts your preoccupations of the Mind what you're involved with with

9
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:11,360
your mind is it some is it based on trust or is it based on some mistrust

10
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:18,240
and of course there might be something in between who are neutral where you're thinking about things that

11
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,820
you can either trust or don't trust it's not an issue

12
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:30,320
but for meditation you want to stay in that side of trust

13
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,820
and um for this uh the minutes of the meditation

14
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:41,579
trust being present trust mindfulness

15
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:47,280
trust the meditation and be sensitive that when you are not

16
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,899
in the present moment is it because you're mistrusting something

17
00:01:53,899 --> 00:02:01,880
in the kind of the broader senses of a term that there's some kind of mistrust

18
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:08,039
and uh or nothing at all no trust involved

19
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,739
and if so a better place to be is with your trust

20
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:21,300
the trust that helps you feel the goodness the rightness of being

21
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:30,660
awake of being aware being here the trust of being mindful of breathing

22
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:38,099
where the operating word is mindfulness mindful of the breeding breathing aware of the breathing trusting being

23
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:43,379
aware of it and maybe you have some maybe it's not a

24
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:50,760
strong Trust but maybe what takes you away from it all

25
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:57,440
what has what is stronger for you could be understood as being mistrusting

26
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,180
or are you putting trust in the wrong places

27
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:09,620
maybe you trust planning

28
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,879
but maybe planning is based on fear which is mistrust

29
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,980
maybe you put your trust in Remembering something ruminating over something that happened

30
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:33,840
maybe it's nice to remember but maybe also it's driven by

31
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,440
the kind of betrayal or loss of trust

32
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,500
that happened

33
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,819
maybe you don't trust the present moment maybe you don't trust being aware of the

34
00:03:53,819 --> 00:04:01,099
present stay close to that

35
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,659
so that you can see through the other side of it where there's Trust

36
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:13,080
for the present moment trust for mindfulness awareness

37
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:20,660
stay close to trust and maybe after this week of

38
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:30,120
considering the Readiness of mind the malleability of Mind mind free of

39
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:37,340
the hindrances a inspired mind

40
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,000
maybe today stay close to trust

41
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:51,479
and so without taking a posture maybe a posture that

42
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:54,919
for you represents

43
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:05,300
a strong trust a trust which has strength to it

44
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,280
a confidence

45
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:19,400
have faith a certainty

46
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:25,340
gently closing your eyes

47
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:42,539
and gently become aware of the body breathing with no special breathing just notice be

48
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:45,800
aware of your body breathing

49
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:59,160
most of the time for most of us we have an implicit trust that will keep

50
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,580
breathing

51
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:10,280
except for maybe when we bring our attention to it

52
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:23,639
but maybe there's the body's Trust kind of willingness and ability for the

53
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,960
body just to breathe

54
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,440
that's been going on for a long time

55
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:54,919
let allowing the body to be receptive to the experience of breathing

56
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,819
and awareness riding on the body's receptivity

57
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:11,660
a second level of receptivity and being aware through the body

58
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,840
and whatever attention preoccupations you might have body and

59
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:38,520
mind let it be okay to be that way

60
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,759
trust it's okay as long as you're aware of it

61
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:49,220
aware with it breathing with it

62
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:22,800
trusting being aware of the presence

63
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,120
for these minutes trusting it is the central place to be

64
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,459
trusting it with a receptivity

65
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,779
has softness

66
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,800
his simple awareness that's free of the hindrances

67
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,100
a kind of simple inspiration

68
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,579
here now aware

69
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:30,740
trusting awareness so you linger with it

70
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,800
a kind of resting inexperience

71
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:51,740
because you trust being present for whatever your experience is

72
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:57,560
breathing with it all in and out

73
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:55,519
whatever you're involved in is there trust what are you trusting

74
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:04,680
are you trusting something unwholesome

75
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:13,040
or something wholesome are you trusting mistrust

76
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:28,440
stay close to trusting the present moment interesting being aware

77
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,220
here

78
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,340
experience

79
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,580
foreign

80
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:40,020
trusting the present moment that allows us to be close to

81
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:45,620
the coming and going of all things in the moment

82
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:53,480
when we're in our thoughts the thinking kind of lingers

83
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,419
with things to make them more permanent more outlasting as if they're

84
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:08,900
takes us out of the the river of constant change

85
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,220
trust the present and after rest in the river of things

86
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:26,899
coming and going trust without clinging to anything

87
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,940
receptive trusting

88
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:41,900
non-clinging to the comings and goings of the present moment

89
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:09,299
whatever is part of the world of suffering your

90
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:17,658
suffering the experience of suffering

91
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:24,919
has a nature of appearing and disappearing coming and going

92
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:31,400
the direct experience of suffering is part of the river of change

93
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,400
Trust floating on that River

94
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:45,380
not holding on to any of it

95
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:58,200
stay close to being aware of the changing nature

96
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,278
of the present

97
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:24,299
and to be close to the changing nature of reality

98
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:30,080
how things change through the day through the hours through the minutes

99
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:39,740
and to have a receptive mind a ready mind for whatever change might come

100
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:49,940
to have a soft mind soft heart for whatever change is coming

101
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,820
to be free of hindrances

102
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:06,299
to be inspired by the value of staying present receptive soft free of

103
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:14,299
hindrances to trust

104
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:26,600
being receptive and soft free of hindrances and inspired

105
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:34,980
so that when people come into your awareness

106
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:41,820
people do the surprising unexpected things that people

107
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:49,260
do that you receive them in this

108
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:56,179
field of awareness field of softness

109
00:28:56,179 --> 00:29:00,179
non-resistance non-clinging

110
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:09,799
to be able to see and know others in a deeper way than if we react

111
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:18,380
though with greater wisdom and clarity know ourselves better

112
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:28,380
and so be able to remember

113
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,559
kindness friendliness

114
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:42,620
basic human care of others good will

115
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,980
wishing

116
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:56,640
may it be that in the freedom of our hearts

117
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,899
that we can meet everyone

118
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,820
with good will

119
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:15,260
May those people that I encounter may I wish them well

120
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:25,220
may I wish them to be happy may I wish them to be safe

121
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:31,639
may I wish them to be peaceful

122
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,980
may I wish them to be free

123
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:46,580
and with those wishes may I be friendly

124
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:55,220
kind supportive of others

125
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,398
May the practice that we do for all of us as a community

126
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:07,980
may it be a phenomenal contribution to the welfare and happiness of this

127
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:16,100
world may it spread from each of us and collectively

128
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:21,919
we will make a difference for this world

129
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:28,049
[Music]

130
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:52,919
thank you so so we come to the last of the talks

131
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:59,100
that are titled um ready ready to change

132
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:05,820
it could also be titled ready for change but I think that um first we want to

133
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:12,059
think about it for ourselves ready to be to be ready to change ready to

134
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:17,640
um be changed for the better and as we that happens to us then we're

135
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,740
more ready for change in the world we're able to receive and be part of

136
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:28,380
that change without unhealthy resistance and unhealthy fear

137
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:35,480
and projections and desires and Despair and and

138
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:42,179
you know the all kinds of things that contribute to our our sense of

139
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:47,880
discomfort in this world they contribute to a deep distrust in this world

140
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:56,399
that those things have to be different things shouldn't be this way and maybe trusting anger trusting greed

141
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:01,679
trusting fear trusting mistrust

142
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:09,419
so the Buddha when he was teaching was orienting his teachings towards

143
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:17,039
um cultivating these really wholesome states of Mind in people so they'd be ready to hear profound

144
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,620
teachings that could liberate them or what the language of it was it opened their

145
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:28,620
Dharma eye that they would see in a new way and that's a powerful teaching the idea

146
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:34,080
that we're not looking for a new experience like a better experience

147
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:41,539
we're looking to see our experience in a new way that's liberating

148
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:48,299
and some people are so focused on change making some change fixing something solving something

149
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:53,519
but rather to open and see it in a new way so

150
00:33:53,519 --> 00:34:01,679
um if um so that Buddha would be giving these

151
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:07,380
talks that would inspire people and in that inspiration he would their minds

152
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:12,839
would become receptive ready to hear something deep

153
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:17,878
their minds would become malleable and soft their resistance for example and

154
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:25,320
their stubbornness and their you know laziness and their greed and whatever it

155
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:31,260
was would soften would would settle and they'd be really right there and so there's kind of softness and willingness

156
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:36,358
to hear and take it in and kind of lower their guard in a

157
00:34:36,359 --> 00:34:42,898
healthy way appropriate way perhaps and then their minds would be free of hindrances for the time the giving those

158
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:48,839
talks they'd be so connected to it that they wouldn't be caught up in greed and anger and

159
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:54,480
delusion they would be inspired

160
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:01,200
and they were the last thing that would happen passana was a Pali word

161
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,599
and this is a wonderful word that we don't have a particular

162
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:12,839
meaning in English for it and the the different meanings of it that we can

163
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:18,240
make out of it is a range that we have different very different English words for it

164
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:24,060
and so the I think the delightful task is to consider how they all are one

165
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:29,700
thing that somehow in that ancient Indian World they saw this as it's kind of like

166
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:36,180
made its own thing maybe like they had a different emotion um than we have because they divide up

167
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:41,220
The Human Experience in a different way or hold it together in a different way than we do in English

168
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:47,160
so you have to use your imagination a little bit to hold these different meanings together into one

169
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:53,700
maybe you'll come up with a you know I've been thinking about an English word that might hold them all but so far

170
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:59,940
haven't maybe some of you will um or maybe in a non-english language

171
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:07,020
so the um the first meaning is clear or bright

172
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:12,119
so Luminosity a Clarity like the you turn on the light and there's this

173
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:17,220
wonderful Clarity the fog as the smog is cleared and it's clear

174
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:25,260
and it's there's a brightness and Clarity to the mind to the heart the second meeting is that it's a heart

175
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:33,060
that is happy uh has uh just delighted and happy

176
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:41,940
and the third meaning is that it's a mind that has trust in it that is reconciled with all things that

177
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:48,780
is um pleased or satisfied with what's here here but that it word trust is one

178
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:57,780
that's what people often fall fall on or confidence so Clarity happiness and Trust

179
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:06,300
is there a single English word that captures all three of those or can you somehow fold them in to

180
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:12,180
somehow recognize maybe all of them I mean they are you know a sense

181
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:18,960
if we have different qualities at the same time are they different qualities or is there

182
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:26,280
a gestalta hold that they're part of in the present so this idea of receptivity readiness

183
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:33,420
softness malleability free of hindrances inspired elated

184
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,640
um clear happy trusting and for now I'll settle in the word

185
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:46,380
trust and um it's a fascinating kind of concept to or state to kind of Orient to

186
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:52,380
ourselves kind of the exercise of uh what is my mind doing right now

187
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:59,700
does it express some kind of trust or mistrust if it's trust what am I trusting

188
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:06,300
am I trusting anger am I trusting fear by trusting mistrust where do I put my

189
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:12,780
trust in a sense whatever the mind is doing most there is a kind of trust there and sometimes what we're trusting

190
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:18,660
is not healthy for us to trust something healthy to trust the

191
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:25,380
wholesome not the unwholesome to trust trust more than mistrust

192
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:31,260
to trust really being here fine and what does that do for us to

193
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:37,680
settle us relax us the confidence of Faith something about really being here

194
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:45,119
so the Buddha prepared people with a mind like that and then he would offer his deepest

195
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:51,540
teachings and it would open people's Dharma eye and it said that when people's Dharma

196
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:59,640
eye opened they would exclaim they would say a particular thing

197
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:07,020
they would say whatever and it might not seem very interesting or very profound just

198
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:12,780
hearing it but it's really a significant you know this is this comes with an

199
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:20,520
experience of Awakening so it's not to be treated lightly and dismissed because it sounds like that's not much

200
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:26,400
uh hit the Buddha which the people would say oh

201
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:33,960
whatever has the nature of arising has the nature of seizing ending

202
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,680
they would say something the Dharma eye would show them something very profound

203
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,300
about the comings and goings the arising and passing of phenomena

204
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:50,880
and that and what's it possible when we see that what's possible is to see how

205
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,579
much the mind doesn't allow us to stay and be there because we climb on WE grab

206
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:02,099
we hold on we have thoughts and so when the Buddha was very specific

207
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:07,200
when he gave his profound teaching he was saying that suffering has the

208
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,980
nature of arising and passing and to understand that we have to understand that it's the experience of

209
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:19,980
suffering so if we've had a profound loss the loss is not

210
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:26,280
coming and going it's it's it's permanent now or if we have some kind of permanent

211
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:31,859
medical condition that debilitates us um that's there or you know that's not

212
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:38,160
going to change what do they mean right coming and going it's the psychological experience of

213
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,980
suffering that of how we relate to that has a nature of coming and going it's

214
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:49,440
not permanent it's not solid it's not and if we trust the present moment

215
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,880
enough trust is being present for the river of comings and goings we discovered that place where all our

216
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,220
psychological suffering belongs to that River belongs to the

217
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:07,260
comings and goings of phenomena and when we see that when we wake up to

218
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:13,500
that then we realize it's possible to let it just be the river of change

219
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:19,859
we don't have to cling to it and hold on to it whatever has a nature to appear

220
00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:26,220
has the nature of disappearing let's allow it to come and go let's not

221
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:31,560
stop the disappearing let's not lob onto it cutting it let's not think about it

222
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:37,980
in such a way that it becomes kind of continuous just let the thoughts arise and go

223
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:45,119
it's like someone might protest and say what do you mean my body is not coming and going my body's just here

224
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,480
the body is constantly coming and going the experience of it the psychological

225
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,700
experience of the body the thoughts the concepts the feelings Sensations

226
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:03,060
the body doesn't come and go but it's a general thing when we're into the direct experience is what we're talking about

227
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:09,180
here that's where the Dharma eye opens to the direct experience Here and Now

228
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:16,500
and here our suffering comes and goes psychological suffering

229
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:21,839
so this idea of you know the Buddha has of teaching people to create the context

230
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:27,480
of a heart and mind that's ready for teaching is not to kind of

231
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:35,520
be pollyanish about life and to just make it all kind of nice and sweet it's really to prepare us for the

232
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,800
existential difficulties of this life of ours the places of suffering and stress and

233
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,260
challenges that we have and what a wonderful thing what a

234
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:53,220
wonderful thing to cultivate the wholesome to cultivate these wonderful capacities of our mind for wholesome

235
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:58,260
States not to be blind to what's going on in

236
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:06,740
this world but to be able to see it and be present for present for it in a way that uh

237
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:14,040
we are able to bring the best of ourselves out we're able to stay awake and present and non-reactive

238
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:20,640
so that the best of us can meet and respond to the world and I hope that this practice we've done

239
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:25,760
over this last year that it really does make us

240
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:31,740
better able to contribute to the welfare and happiness of this world

241
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:39,180
may we really do this practice not only for our own sake but even more than for our own sake let's do it for the sake of

242
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:46,079
the world after all um as we settle

243
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:54,000
and have this open attention this ability to be free and aware that in that openness and awareness

244
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,800
maybe it doesn't matter so much

245
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:06,660
you yourself and Me Myself and mine what's important is what that awareness

246
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:11,819
beats and encounters and how we care for it

247
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:17,880
may we care for this world and let's care for it better

248
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:25,940
because we've gotten to the bottom of our suffering and learn not to cling to anything

249
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:32,940
so thank you all for this year for this week for this day
