1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,680
welcome to our meditation and um

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:18,240
one of the closer one of the faculties or

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:26,880
capacities we have that's closely related to mindfulness is truthfulness

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,160
that in a sense [Music]

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,879
being honest out loud it's just mindfulness out loud in a

6
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,200
sense practicing mindfulness is being honest to oneself

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:52,960
is to really recognize what's happening for us and perhaps

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:01:00,160
with a an honesty or a clarity or a

9
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:06,159
that maybe is not often done in daily life not because we're necessarily dishonest

10
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,320
but rather we don't acknowledge fully what is here

11
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,439
and so closely related to mindfulness is truthfulness

12
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:24,880
and our honesty and also to truth in the sense that we

13
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,560
are aiming in mindfulness to sit in the truth

14
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:37,439
or to become the truth the word dharma could sometimes be

15
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,200
translated as truth and to sit in the dharma to sit with what is true

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,560
what is most true and and the path of vipassana the path of

17
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,880
mindfulness is the path of discovering what is really true here

18
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,920
and sometimes it's useful to put a question mark behind what we're

19
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:12,160
understanding about ourselves or experience and say is this really true is it is this an interpretation

20
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,040
that i'm doing is this a projection of my own ideas

21
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,959
what if i get really quiet what if there's no projections no

22
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,920
bias no even no memory really to influence how we experience the

23
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,080
moment what's most true about now

24
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:45,680
and then to find our ability to be at ease in that truth to find a way of being at peace

25
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:53,760
to find a way to wake up and find have no conflict

26
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,040
no struggle with what is most true about life

27
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,959
in fact find the opposite find that it frees us

28
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:19,120
so to sit up or to assume a meditation posture

29
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:26,480
that may be a posture you would assume if someone came along and was sat you

30
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,879
down to really tell you the truth what's really true

31
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,480
someone who's kind compassionate is concerned with your welfare and

32
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,760
well-being and gently lovingly wants to tell you about this

33
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:52,159
life of ours and tell you what's really true it's really valuable

34
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:58,840
and you sit down and maybe sit up straight maybe you're

35
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,040
attentive you're really present like this and you get quiet

36
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,439
to really hear what this person has to say

37
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,799
and surprisingly the person says the first thing the person points to

38
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:24,960
about what's true is that is your very attentiveness

39
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:32,400
that the search for truth maybe begins in seeing the truth the value the

40
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,400
freedom in a certain kind of attentiveness

41
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,840
to the present moment

42
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:57,600
and if we don't have this attentiveness to the present moment then we're in our thoughts wandering off

43
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,039
in the past and the future telling stories

44
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,560
reacting to what's happening

45
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,479
but to really discover the truth

46
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,080
we first discover the truthfulness the truth of

47
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,840
attention attentiveness

48
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:37,360
and with your attentiveness really attentive really care for caringly attentive

49
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:45,600
to yourself to your experience to take a few long slow deep breaths

50
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:56,960
breathing in deeply and lovingly for yourself exhaling

51
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:09,039
maybe with care for yourself to inhale

52
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,840
and letting your breathing return to normal

53
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:26,800
attentively this wonderful capacity for attention

54
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,120
there is no spiritual life without attention

55
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,120
attentiveness

56
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,520
becoming attentive to your breathing to your body breathing

57
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:03,840
an attentiveness that is is also embodied awareness

58
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:17,840
the awareness that the body has of the body breathing

59
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,680
and as you exhale to release the body relax

60
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,240
the body

61
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:51,120
as you exhale to let go into the pull of gravity

62
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,919
so the whole body settles a bit

63
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:13,840
settles into the place of contact against your seat your bed the floor

64
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:27,840
and then gathering yourself around your breathing this simple breathing

65
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,599
in in the dedication to truth to truthfulness

66
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:46,480
it doesn't have to be complicated or elaborate it can begin by the simple truth

67
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:55,839
of the body breathing

68
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:09,839
and the truth of our attentiveness our attention to the breathing

69
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:25,440
and the attentiveness we're looking for is one that is quiet

70
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:36,160
this has a stillness to it that maybe is a little bit like the

71
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,080
quiet still surface of a very calm

72
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,880
mountain lake

73
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,839
unruffled

74
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:34,560
with attention resting in the experience of breathing

75
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,240
with attention riding

76
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,399
on the experience of breathing in and breathing out

77
00:10:50,800 --> 00:11:01,839
here now with the truth of breathing

78
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
uh

79
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
so

80
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
so

81
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
so

82
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,840
so

83
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
foreign

84
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,240
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

85
00:28:51,679 --> 00:29:00,480
we sit we sit and meditate so that our thinking our feelings

86
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:08,480
our actions our body have no clinging as part of them

87
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,520
that we don't grasp or close down or

88
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:20,080
turn off from the world without clinging without grasping

89
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:26,559
without resistance with the strength of the truth

90
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:35,679
as our foundation we can become aware of the profound

91
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:44,158
heart connection we can feel or have with other people and other beings

92
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:53,520
and one of the times to feel that is the end of a meditation session when perhaps a lot of

93
00:29:53,520 --> 00:30:00,080
the dust and clouds of the mind are settled and we can see in a different way

94
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:06,159
different eyes and to see look upon the other world

95
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,919
with kind eyes caring eyes

96
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:21,039
and perhaps discover we have within us a capacity for well wishing

97
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:28,799
for others capacity to care for the welfare and happiness of others

98
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:35,760
a simple care and so at the end of a sitting it's a

99
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:42,799
profound thing to give voice to our care for the world

100
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:50,399
may all beings be happy

101
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,720
may all beings be safe

102
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,440
may all beings be peaceful

103
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,398
may all beings be free

104
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,480
and may we in however small ways we can or big ways

105
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:19,840
may we contribute to this

106
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:31,200
[Music]

107
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:43,760
continuing to share the stories

108
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:51,120
that exist in the ancient discourses and one of the more famous stories that

109
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:57,279
involves the buddha is the buddha's encounter with anguli mala

110
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:04,799
and gulimala is a was a mass murderer at the time of the buddha

111
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:12,720
and this encounter [Music] raises all kinds of important questions

112
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:18,080
about karma and retribution and

113
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:25,518
punishment and the possibility for reform kind of people can be reformed

114
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:32,720
um how much people can leave their past behind and their terrible

115
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:38,320
actions behind and start life new in a new way

116
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,840
uh how much can people be transformed and changed

117
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,799
and so the story of angulimala

118
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:57,760
begins with a description of him that he was

119
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:04,399
a murderous bloody man who took to blows

120
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:11,760
and striking people and killing people and that he would kill you know whole

121
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,840
villages and devastate whole territories

122
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,840
10 20 40 men would go out after him and he would slaughter them all he was

123
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,440
amazing surprisingly strong and athletic and

124
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:35,039
fast and

125
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:44,880
so one day uh the buddha went into town for his arms to receive food for the day

126
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,880
he finished and had his meal and put everything away and then he

127
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,840
started going into the forest where angulimala was

128
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,640
and and villagers the people in the road said no

129
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,919
don't go in there there's a terrible murderer on gulimala

130
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:14,960
don't go in there he'll kill you and the buddha

131
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:21,040
said nothing was silent but just kept walking three times people said that no no don't

132
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:28,960
go in there angulimal was there and the buddha silently continued walking into the forest where angulimala was

133
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:36,480
the word angulimala is a nickname and anguli means finger

134
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,480
and mala is a kind of like a necklace like a rosary kind of thing a necklace

135
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,520
and he was called that because he had a necklace made of the fingers of his victims

136
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:56,079
and so the buddha goes into the forest and he's walking along the road and

137
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,359
angulimala sees the buddha and he says wow

138
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:07,599
i am you know really strong and murderous and capable and no matter how many men they send

139
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,800
after me i kill them all and here comes a solitary

140
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:18,240
monk he doesn't recognize the monk as the buddha he just recognized solitary

141
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:25,520
monk with no weapon and walking undefended and all this is going to be easy for me

142
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:32,240
and so he goes after the buddha to kill him and um and now the buddha just continues

143
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,920
to walk calmly down the road and aniga limala can't catch up to him

144
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:45,200
okay mala starts to run while the buddha just calmly walks slow

145
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,880
meditative way perhaps and anika mala who says he can you know he can

146
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,839
run faster than any chariot and horse and elephants and jesus you know very

147
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:03,200
athletic and he just can't catch up to the buddha just walking quietly it's kind of like a little bit of a

148
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,440
supernatural event so angulimala finally yells out stop

149
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,079
stop to the buddha the buddha

150
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:23,839
keeps walking but the buddha replies to angulimala

151
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:28,960
you should stop i have already stopped

152
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:36,480
and and angalimala says these recluses these monks they never

153
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,000
lie they always speak the truth so what does he mean and he says i have

154
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,400
stopped you should stop and and so he said he asked the buddha what

155
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,520
do you mean by this and the buddha says i have stopped

156
00:36:53,520 --> 00:37:01,680
fully harming any living being but you have no restraint and you go on

157
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:08,560
just killing and this simple statement by the buddha

158
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:17,280
in the context of this little supernatural thing that's going on that he can't catch the buddha

159
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:24,000
he understands that the buddha is talking figuratively then the buddha has is not you know talking

160
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,119
about literally stopping that he stopped walking he stopped the killing of

161
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:35,839
the harming and um and this gets the attention of angulimala this sees maybe the light

162
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:42,240
he sees a different way he realizes maybe that he that the life he's been living is a life

163
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:49,680
that is not worth living anymore something happens to him and so

164
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:56,480
he requests from the buddha he renounces his evil ways he throws away his weapons

165
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,000
and asks the buddha for ordination as a monk and back in those days it was quite

166
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:09,040
simple ordination just simply meant the way it was ordinary one was ordained then buddha simply said

167
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:16,400
um come monk you know so come now you're a monk so that's all

168
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,839
and um and uh and so anu limala became a monk and went to

169
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:29,119
live with the buddha in a little forest place where the buddha and the monks lived

170
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,680
and so that's nice so you know he's been converted so simply it's you know it's almost like a fairy tale

171
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,839
that it should be that simple someone who's so murderous but the story goes on

172
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:47,119
and um the story goes on and one of the next things that happens is that

173
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:54,720
now as a monk angulimala goes out for alms and he comes across a house where a

174
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,000
woman is giving birth but the birth is not coming the baby is breach or something

175
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,480
and he hears the screams and the struggles are going on and he goes back to the buddha and tells

176
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:14,000
him what he saw and the buddha said go back to the woman and make a statement of truth

177
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,200
and and the baby will be born and in ancient india in india there's

178
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,240
this idea that certain statements of truth have impact on the

179
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:31,200
on the natural world and they're so powerful saying the truth and so um

180
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,720
so buddha says go tell go tell this woman the truth and tell tell her give her a statement

181
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:43,040
of truth and say this never end of my life have i harmed anyone

182
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:50,880
and gullible are surprised by this and he says but i can't say that it's not true

183
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:57,280
and the buddha says no say it everest in your uh ever since you

184
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,760
entered your life were born in your life as a monastic you have not killed anyone so this kind

185
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,119
of radical change that is so radical that he can actually take a stand of truth

186
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:17,440
on the fact that now he doesn't harm anyone he hasn't harmed anyone in maybe just a few days and

187
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:25,839
and so he goes back and he makes a statement in the presence of the woman and the baby gets born and

188
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:31,440
and i lived on the farm in tennessee kind of

189
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:38,160
a large hippie commune that was famous for its midwives and they have a book called the spiritual midwifery and

190
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,400
so we got a lot of stories there from the midwives about the births they attended and sometimes

191
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:51,680
they would tell stories about how the baby wouldn't be born until the couple who had tension between them worked out

192
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:58,319
the tension between them they spoke the truth and cleared the air and then the baby could come so you know

193
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:04,640
so anyway so the story of angulimala making this true statement made a difference for the woman

194
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:11,280
but it's kind of a whole thing as kind of a fairy tale and it's a literary work and what's

195
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,440
happening here in a rhetorical way is that there's a contrast between

196
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:22,799
angulimala who kills people

197
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,960
and then angulimala who supports or helps the birth of a new life

198
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:37,119
and angular mala who kills um uh cannot stop

199
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:43,520
there's this idea of not not being able to stop the baby's birth is stopped

200
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:50,319
and anigurly mala in his new new life as a monastic he now

201
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:56,400
is able to support and help the birth of life so it's kind of this i think it's a

202
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,079
rhetorical play going on in the text this contrasting of these two things

203
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,839
um so the story goes on a little bit and uh at some point angoliamala goes

204
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:14,079
into the town a town where people knew about him and and maybe were even impacted by him

205
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:20,319
by his murders and family members and all that he goes in for alms as a monk and

206
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:25,760
understandably people are pretty angry with him upset and so they're throwing rocks at him and

207
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:32,079
uh yelling at him and and some of these rocks hit his head and he's gashed head and he's bleeding and

208
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:38,000
he comes back to the buddha and and buddha sees him bleeding and and the

209
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,640
buddha simply says to him you have to endure this this kind of uh

210
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:53,280
pain this kind of attack that you're receiving you have to just endure it bear it if it uh if you had not become a

211
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,880
monk and uh and changed your life radically in this way

212
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,800
your punishment would have been you would have ended up for eons and eons living in the worst of the possible

213
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,079
hills just a little uh cut in your head is not really such a

214
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:16,640
big deal and but you have to endure it you can't don't defend yourself don't justify

215
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:24,160
yourself this is just your karma in a sense for what all the things you've done and it this is and

216
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:29,520
this is a surprising teaching for people to hear this idea that there's no retribution and

217
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:34,800
he's not punished he doesn't go to jail uh the worst that can happen is he has some cuts on his

218
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:41,920
bloody head and uh is this really okay is this right and shouldn't there

219
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:49,040
be some kind of justice that requires more punishment or more impact on angulimalam

220
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,640
in any case at some point goes into the forest to engage on a retreat

221
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:00,960
and to practice meditation and and he becomes fully awakened

222
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:08,079
and and as he's fully awakened he he he gives a poem

223
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:15,760
his awakening poem and one of the interesting things about the poem is he mentions that before he got the

224
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,599
nickname angulimala his given name was ahimsa

225
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,800
means harmlessness non-violence

226
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:34,880
so uh he ended his life living up to his birth name so angulimala so it's a

227
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:41,200
story that's rich in associate interpretations rich in

228
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:46,960
challenges rich in in maybe as a mirror to look at our own

229
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,800
values and beliefs and our reactions to all these stories and you know this fairy tale story perhaps

230
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:58,079
but still and many many people study the story and write about it

231
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:04,319
interpret it and find it very very valuable story and in england there is or maybe it was

232
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:09,520
until rece a non-profit organization called angulimala

233
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:17,200
that was buddhist chaplains who'd go into the prisons to minister to people in prisons in england

234
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:23,920
i think the idea being that every human being has the capacity for to be reformed

235
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:32,079
every human being has capacity for a radical change of heart and and perhaps we can give them

236
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:39,280
the opportunity to do so so angulimalam ahimsam

237
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:46,800
finger necklace or non-harming may all of us

238
00:45:46,800 --> 00:46:00,480
find the tremendous truth and value and impact on the world that a life of non-harming has thank you
