00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:08,000
hello everyone welcome

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,840
and maybe you've had the occasion to

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,079
make a effort to listen to some faint sound

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,880
maybe there's a bird in the tree and you're trying to understand

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,200
what bird is that or where is that

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,440
singing saw a bird song coming from or perhaps

7
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,039
i recently was hiking in the mountains nearby here and

8
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,320
and we knew that we were getting close to our destination when we could hear the river

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,720
and so i would listen and and for that the faintest little hint of

10
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,840
that sound of the river to know that i was getting close

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,159
so this ability to kind of uh and and and for me with this kind of way of listening

12
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:24,000
the mind becomes quieter things become quiet and still in the mind so that there's no static

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,040
to try to hear the very faint sound so in the same way

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,720
in meditation there comes a time where it just

15
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,200
not that we're straining to to to pay attention but at some point

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,759
uh it's helpful to understand that we're letting the mind become quiet

17
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:58,320
so that we can hear or perceive or feel something really deep inside of us

18
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,399
something that when there's a lot of static a lot of thinking and concerns and preoccupation

19
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:12,000
it gets drowned out it gets covered over it's somehow we don't get to see it

20
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,280
and and so one of the things to listen for in meditation

21
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,360
is some of the deeper messages voices or thoughts

22
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,519
attitudes that underlie everything if we go deep enough down

23
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,680
we'll find sometimes some of the foundational

24
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,319
attitudes beliefs that kind of permeate everything else above the foundation

25
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,720
that we don't even know is there and some of those are

26
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:58,159
not helpful for us as we live our lives when i was a relatively new meditator

27
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:03,440
i discovered that underneath it all as i meditated

28
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:12,000
was this belief that if it was happening to me it was it is not the real thing

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,360
and so that's about the extent of how logical it was but so no matter what i

30
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,480
was experiencing meditation uh it was not really what you're supposed to be experiencing it wasn't

31
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:29,120
the right thing and there was something else that was the right thing but i didn't have any contact with it

32
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,400
and so that was a so that kind of attitude went was carried into everything that i did

33
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,760
in meditation and in my life as well and so i couldn't you know was always

34
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,159
then wrong it was always never could be never could do things adequately or never had the right

35
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,680
experience i was always wrong in some way so that was kind of eye-opening to see

36
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,000
that and the seeing of it was the beginning of healing from it and and then maybe being able to listen even

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,040
deeper to a voice where or to an attitude a belief

38
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,400
that didn't carry that along and uh

39
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,959
so um so what is uh so to allow yourself to become really quiet at some point during

40
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,519
this meditation to see if you can listen for the thoughts

41
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,120
that are there when there's nothing else

42
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,880
they might be not helpful for you they might be very helpful for you they might be nice thoughts

43
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,440
but uh to see them whether they're helpful or not helpful they have equal value

44
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,880
for the purposes of mindfulness there's nothing wrong with discovering you have unhelpful thoughts

45
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,120
it's actually the doorway to freedom it's it's not you know to celebrate that

46
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,960
you have great thoughts good thoughts that foundation those two are the doorway to freedom

47
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,720
but to listen what's there and um

48
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:08,880
and sometimes it begins not with a belief or

49
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,440
idea you can present but it's more of an emotion a feeling that's underneath it all

50
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,479
and at this deep level there might be this intimate connection between it being a kind of emotional

51
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:29,039
and a belief at the same time kind of and so some people the entry way is to listen to the deeper

52
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,160
emotion and then some eventually you can see what's the belief that goes along with

53
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,680
it and sometimes it's the other way you feel the deep belief no it's

54
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,560
recognize it and then you can feel how it carries with it a mood and emotion that maybe is there

55
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,680
kind of as a background influence on your life

56
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,199
so i'll i'll direct this a little bit and

57
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,319
so to begin as usual it's kind of nice i'm hoping it's nice that to have a kind of a ritual

58
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:11,600
beginning where it's more or less the same what we do each time so the familiarity allows your system and your

59
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,360
in your life kind of to kind of feel like it's entering into familiar

60
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:25,039
territory and settle more quickly so assume the meditation posture

61
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,479
and then gently close your eyes

62
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,520
with your eyes closed

63
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:46,560
gently settle on yourself

64
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:56,000
gently enter into your inner bodily experience from the inside out

65
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,599
and feeling if there's some ways you're going to adjust your posture now

66
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,720
so you're more comfortable more alert

67
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,039
and taking a few longer inhales

68
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:29,000
and longer exhales in which you relax settle in more

69
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:48,159
and then to let your breathing return to normal

70
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:02,240
and on the exhales relaxing the different parts of your body

71
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,759
or if they don't relax to soften them soften around them

72
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,839
and then to begin centering yourself on your breathing

73
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:02,480
and you might try to it with your breathing not to breathe deeply

74
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,360
but ever so slightly gently lovingly do breathe

75
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,640
in a little bit fuller just a teeny bit more than you would otherwise

76
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:25,760
a little bit more intentionally exhale as if you're relaxing or

77
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:33,480
as if you're saying ah on the exhale

78
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:45,920
the intention of exhale might be a little greater allowing of the exhale

79
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,480
and maybe a little bit more allowing of the inhale

80
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,519
and as you exhale to relax

81
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,480
in the thinking mind

82
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,920
to let the thinking become quieter

83
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,240
maybe a little slower

84
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,560
this

85
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:31,760
maybe imagining that every time you exhale

86
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,880
the exhale is carrying you a little bit deeper

87
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,360
into yourself

88
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:51,760
and so that every time you exhale you want to listen or

89
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:58,720
attend to that

90
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:07,519
for what is deepening attend and feel and sense

91
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,519
the places deep inside that the exhale is taking you

92
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,920
so

93
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,440
so

94
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
so

95
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,520
so

96
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,880
so

97
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,400
so

98
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,760
so

99
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:35,280
with the exhales letting the thinking mind become quieter

100
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:42,440
so that you can better listen better sense

101
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:50,080
what is deep inside of you underneath all your thoughts

102
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:58,000
usual thoughts your daily thoughts concerns ongoing concerns

103
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:08,600
and listen feel the beliefs that are there

104
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,440
the attitudes that are there

105
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:27,120
the feelings that are there maybe deep inside

106
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,760
and don't expect that you'll necessarily hear or listen

107
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:41,120
what's valuable is letting yourself become quiet

108
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:50,960
the quieter and and listen to become quieter on the exhale

109
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,799
and sense deeper

110
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:09,280
if nothing shows itself it's okay it might actually be quite good

111
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,799
to feel the quiet that's there

112
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:51,799
and if this makes sense to keep doing this continue on the exhale

113
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:59,600
to let go relax into the deeper places within

114
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,559
as if the exhale is holding your hand carrying you

115
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:13,520
deeper underneath the usual concerns

116
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:22,000
maybe a place in your body that's underneath it all

117
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:35,120
and i'll ask a question and see what responds inside of you to

118
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,520
the question maybe before you think about an answer

119
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:47,200
whatever responds spontaneously or close to that

120
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:54,080
it might not be in words it might be just a feeling or body sensation

121
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,360
or a place inside that your attention goes

122
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,720
relaxing with the exhale

123
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,360
letting things be quite quiet near the end of the exhale

124
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,679
for a moment

125
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:44,960
and that and then that deepest place that you can contact within

126
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:53,000
the question is if it could speak what would it say

127
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,720
so

128
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:25,840
and then bring your attention to the inhale

129
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:37,320
and feel the way that the body expands as you inhale

130
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,400
maybe the body lifts a little bit

131
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:53,400
and let that inhale carry some of your strength

132
00:26:53,600 --> 00:27:02,679
some of your confidence so that it spreads through your body

133
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,880
having the expanding of the inhib inhale

134
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,159
let it move through and with

135
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:36,399
any care love good will

136
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:41,760
compassion that's within you

137
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:48,679
that you can spread through the body through your heart through your mind

138
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:13,520
on that inhale letting whatever degree of confidence and

139
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,120
strength and love good will

140
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:26,399
grow and spread and expand maybe beyond the edges of your body

141
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:33,039
as if you can reach out and touch the whole world with kindness

142
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:41,480
just a gentle touch maybe at the top of the inhale

143
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,559
may our attention that spreads out into the world

144
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:04,640
may that attention carry with it

145
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,080
our care for the welfare and happiness of others

146
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:19,279
may our attention awareness of others carry with it

147
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,320
a wish for everyone's happiness

148
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,840
may everyone be happy

149
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,200
may everyone be safe

150
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,640
may everyone be peaceful

151
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,919
may everyone be free

152
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:12,640
[Music]

153
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,640
uh

154
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:33,039
so this relationship between thinking

155
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:39,840
and emotions emotions and thinking that we're talking about this week

156
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,360
and thinking has many layers many different within us

157
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:51,279
and some of the more surface layers are is called

158
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:57,360
discursive thinking thinking that involves having a conversation or

159
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,840
telling a story or imagining some scenario that

160
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:08,480
um uh you know sometimes it's almost like there's uh it's watching tv or

161
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,760
something and um this can have a powerful effect on our emotional life

162
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,120
and uh because sometimes you know we're humans are storytellers and stories have

163
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,720
a big impact and we have an ability to imagine stories as if they're real and they you

164
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:34,640
know feel them in our emotional life so we want to be careful with the stories we tell and the discursive mind

165
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,480
but then thinking can get quieter and it doesn't have to be discursive thinking

166
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:47,200
a story we tell but there might be some repeated attitude

167
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:54,640
judgment we carry with us and uh and that judgment might be one that uh undermines us or might point one

168
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:02,640
that inspires us or buoys us up as the mind gets quieter and quieter

169
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,919
then it doesn't mean that we stop thinking but the thinking becomes more subtle or

170
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:14,080
more foundational or more underlies everything else and sometimes and that's part of the

171
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,600
advantage of getting calm and subtle the meditation is that we can start hearing or seeing

172
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:26,799
or recognizing that deeper ways deeper currents of belief of thoughts of attitudes

173
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:33,120
that are in us that are often overlaid by discursive thinking or

174
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:39,760
judgmental thinking and and that deeper layer is

175
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:45,039
valuable to see sometimes it's even sometimes we don't even know that

176
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:51,360
it's there it's casting its influence and everything else it's kind of like the the root from which everything else kind

177
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,120
of grows or the root which kind of spreads some kind of

178
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,559
food into everything else in the plant but the food might be

179
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,760
you know might not be whatever it takes in from the soil it might not be healthy

180
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:14,080
or it might be healthy so this deeper attitude to start seeing what it is and is going on

181
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,399
and and to give you some examples of some of the some kind of maybe simple deeper

182
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:27,519
attitudes beliefs that might be there is um sometimes when people get really quiet

183
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:33,840
still and meditation is just really tracking the breathing people are really doing breath meditation

184
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:40,799
uh it's you can see that certain attitudes could appear for some people at a particular

185
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:47,760
point in the cycle of breathing so there are sometimes people if i see that oh i don't want to exhale

186
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,120
because i don't want to lose something i want to hold on and uh it's not safe to have to be safe

187
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,960
by holding on or the end of the exhale is a common place where some people get afraid

188
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,559
because sometimes there's a feeling the end of ex say and a loss of control there

189
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:09,599
or we're kind of everything's going away and i might disappear i might

190
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,878
die or something i won't exist the end of the the end of the exhale

191
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,240
or sometimes i've known people who have an attitude as they breathe in they

192
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:26,560
don't want to breathe in like leave me alone that's too much work it's like the world is imposing itself on me and so

193
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:33,280
there's a resistance kind of very subtle um and so these are kind of so these are kind

194
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,440
of symbolic it's kind of we discover that in relationship to breathing is a relationship that just plays itself

195
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:46,480
out in the rest of our life but it's so subtle and so quiet uh we might discover that there are very

196
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:52,560
quick foundational emotions that are there and those emotions give birth to a

197
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:59,040
way of thinking or to the discursive thoughts so to get quiet and quiet

198
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,880
so as i said earlier in the meditation one of the

199
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,560
attitudes that i had that in my early years of practice beliefs was that

200
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,720
if something's happening to me it's not the real thing not necessarily logical to have that

201
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,839
belief um but that's kind of i never thought about it i didn't think

202
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:27,040
it out i didn't even know i had that belief but there it was when i got quiet deep

203
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,160
down inside it was like that wasn't a policy that i had towards everything so

204
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,000
i could never you know do things right or never never felt satisfied or content or or

205
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,680
at home anywhere because it was always the wrong thing so

206
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,599
you might think then you might think then that we have to cultivate the opposite

207
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:54,720
and that everything i'm experiencing is the right thing is the real thing

208
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:01,359
and or for example if you've discovered deep inside that you feel that um

209
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:07,280
you are somehow um you know bad

210
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:14,079
then you might think that now you have to that's what the thoughts tell you that now you have to cultivate thoughts that you're good

211
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:20,079
and so there's a trap in recognizing what's deep inside some

212
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:26,000
belief we have and thinking the solution is to have the opposite belief the

213
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,599
positive version of it so if you're

214
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:37,359
you know if you have a belief that you're wrong or bad then you have to kind of find a way to

215
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:42,560
believe that you're right and good and but that's kind of a headache that's

216
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:48,160
work and how do you do that really and that becomes kind of a strain and a

217
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,200
expectation that we live by in a challenge

218
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:59,520
now the alternative is to recognize some of the deeper beliefs that we have some of the deeper

219
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:04,960
emotions we have that are difficult and not set up the idea we now have to

220
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,320
experience the opposite it's enough it's powerful and enough

221
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:16,720
just to stop thinking i'm wrong just to stop thinking that i'm bad

222
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:23,680
so rather than thinking you have to become now a good person you just stop believing you're bad

223
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,040
um instead of thinking that you're because you're you're afraid

224
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:35,040
now you have to develop bravery and courage um

225
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:43,760
it's a really enough just to learn how to settle and quiet and and uh and let go of the fear perhaps

226
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,119
you don't have to replace it with something else and um because if you replace it with

227
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:55,200
something else you tend to be in a pendulum that can swing too easily between these success extremes

228
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,440
and also the attempt to go into the positive sometimes it's wonderful to do and nice

229
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,480
to do i don't want to say never do it but it often carries with it

230
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,760
even deeper attitudes a deeper belief around self me myself and mine like i'm the agent

231
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,359
and then only then will people really love me and so

232
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:26,000
there's a deeper belief about what it takes to be loved for example or concerned for that

233
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,040
and so as we go deeper and deeper in in the practice what we learn is that it's it's powerful

234
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:38,240
it's wonderful uh simply to stop

235
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:43,920
the this way of thinking these beliefs that we have and not replace them

236
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:50,640
and they're in the depths of who we are maybe we'll discover that there's a kind of a peace

237
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:57,200
a kind of a kind of stillness or kind of spaciousness or a kind of

238
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:02,720
calm that has no opposite that there's a kind of joy and a

239
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:08,960
happiness that has no opposite and so then we're not swinging so much back

240
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:16,480
and forth and it just it can just be there and it comes without a belief

241
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:23,440
it doesn't have to have a self connected to it it doesn't have to have some idea of who we are and what

242
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:29,599
we have to accomplish and what we have to do in order to be a good person a successful person

243
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,960
and and we can just be we're allowed just to be at home in

244
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,839
ourselves we don't have to prove ourselves we don't have to defend ourselves we don't have to

245
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,880
ex have any particular experience that's the experience we have to have

246
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,720
that we're allowed just to be ourselves and then

247
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,880
sometimes there's the idea that we when you are yourself the dharma is the dharma

248
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:06,400
when you just allow yourself in this kind of way to live in that deep place where there

249
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:13,920
are not living in the opposites that we swing by it's just this deeper place that has no opposite

250
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:19,729
so um [Music]

251
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,520
so this idea that there is a deeper voice belief attitude mood that

252
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,440
underlies it all you might want to see today to let it be a quieter day and see if there's

253
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,760
something there for you you have to be very careful with this and very tender and compassionate and it

254
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:43,520
feels like this is too much for you or if the information you learned now is something you need to digest and work

255
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,960
with and get support for by all means do that don't stay don't stay kind of

256
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,480
right up against it all the time but you might also see if this can be a day

257
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:00,640
where of this deeper quieter listening and you might have a busy day but maybe

258
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:08,400
other little corners of the day where you can sit quietly and just kind of tap in what's deep inside

259
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,680
and if what's deep inside what does it want to say if he could speak

260
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:21,838
sometimes that reveals something that won't be get revealed if we're just kind of feeling or tending to it

261
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:30,720
so maybe you'll discover too

262
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:36,640
that in the depths of who you are that's where your wisdom resides

263
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,280
so thank you and we'll continue again tomorrow
