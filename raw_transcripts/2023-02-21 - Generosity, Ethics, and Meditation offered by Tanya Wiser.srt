1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,880
foreign bye bye

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,820
and hello everybody else welcome is there anybody here for their first

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,980
time oh welcome glad to have you here

4
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:32,119
um are you comfortable with my mask off great

5
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,120
so my name is Tanya Tanya Weiser nice to see some of you again I've seen

6
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,800
recently yep nice to see some I haven't

7
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,420
so I've been um of thinking about the asuta majma Nakaya

8
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:07,200
128. a lot and um

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,780
the things that I've really been struck by

10
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:20,420
as I've been kind of studying the suta is how much the suta is about generosity

11
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:28,619
ethical action and meditation and meditation in the broadest sense

12
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:35,960
from mindfulness practice meditation and daily life to concentration practice

13
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,040
and how supportive each of those things are

14
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,659
for supporting a clear mind

15
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:57,020
the it's said in the in the teachings that

16
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,180
the true nature of the mind is radiance

17
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:10,399
and as our mind is radiant our hearts is free to express

18
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:16,280
generosity kindness caring ethical action

19
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:28,020
so this particular suta and come back to the kind of

20
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,020
um well

21
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:40,500
it's named that suta is called Corruptions and it's um

22
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,840
in the translation by bikus Jato that I used so I don't read Paulie so I'm

23
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,360
reading the English and as it's interpreted

24
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,099
but you know and so the the um the Corruptions are really the things

25
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:02,099
that cloud that luminescent mind heart

26
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:09,480
and I'll talk about them more later but I kind of want to go through the suta a little bit and

27
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,519
really look at because these the qualities of generosity and ethical

28
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:20,819
action and meditation [Music]

29
00:03:20,819 --> 00:03:26,180
are demonstrated more than they're really spoken about

30
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:39,920
so the suta starts with the Buddha in a monastery

31
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:48,120
and at that time there was a group of mendicants who were arguing quarreling and disputing continually wounding each

32
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,760
other with barbed words and when the Buddha was in this

33
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,000
Monastery a mendicant came up to the Buddha about stood to one side

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,580
and told them what was happening with these mendicants who were arguing

35
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:11,700
disputing and he said please Gert please sir go to

36
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:20,540
these mendicants out of compassion and the Buddha consented in silence

37
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:26,699
so when I just look at this um I see

38
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:33,800
generosity on the part of the Buddha right to consent to leave a monastery

39
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:41,180
who is meditating and you know

40
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,979
it's very ethical to take our time to care for our minds

41
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:53,100
to take care of our body hearts and mind and meditation and practice

42
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,000
foreign

43
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:07,500
Buddha goes to um these you know mendicants who are

44
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:14,280
quarreling arguing hurting each other with words so all of those things are the opposite

45
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,759
of generosity ethical action and meditation there's no

46
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:27,120
none of those qualities present and so he the Buddha arrives and he says

47
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,198
enough men again stop arguing quarreling and disputing

48
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:40,919
he said it three times and each time the mendicant I'm assuming the one that went

49
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:46,020
to go get him said wait sir let the Buddha the lord of

50
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:51,479
the dhamma remain passive dwelling in Blissful meditation in the

51
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:57,360
present life so three times essentially the Buddha tried to get these arguing mendicans to

52
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,000
stop the talk to practice and they didn't listen so three times

53
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:10,080
the mendicant says to him take care of yourself Buddha they're not

54
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,560
listening

55
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:20,520
so the Buddha robed up in the morning and went out for alms

56
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:26,460
and came back God is lodging in order and took his bowl and robe and

57
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:32,000
um and then he recited a poem before he left sort of right there

58
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:40,880
and he said when many voices shout at once no one thinks that they're a fool

59
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,340
so right away when people are shouting at once there's right no generosity

60
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:52,440
everybody's trying to grab the space there's no right speech right they're

61
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:59,460
all shouting so there's not ethical action and they're certainly not paying attention to their mindfulness

62
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:07,440
so he said while the Sangha is being split none thought another to be better adults

63
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:14,240
pretending to be astute they talk their Words Right Out of Bounds

64
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:21,539
again out of ethical action they blab at will so no restraint right

65
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:28,139
their mouths a gape and no one knows what leads them on so they're just sort of

66
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:34,380
the energies of the hindrances right these Corruptions are what are driving

67
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,400
their behaviors

68
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:45,960
they abuse me they hit me they beat me they robbed me is what he's saying they say

69
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:52,099
and he says for those who bear such a grudge hatred never ends

70
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:00,660
for those who bear no grudge no such Grudge hatred does have an end for never

71
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,940
is hatred settled by hate it's only settled by love this is an

72
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:13,080
eternal truth and to settle a conflict we need generosity right

73
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:18,180
we need ethical action we need to speak with wisdom we need to act and behave

74
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:23,720
with wisdom and to be mindful

75
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:33,659
the Buddha goes on to say others don't understand that here we need to be restrained so these

76
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:39,060
these um these hindrances these things that

77
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:44,459
obstruct the clear mind their energies

78
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:51,540
they they're they're it's part of nature we all have them they've had we've had you know they've been in our culture for

79
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:56,820
eons in the world's cultures

80
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:03,300
and if you know if we don't restrain them they they just keep going and they

81
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,880
grow their habits that becomes much more than a habit

82
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,040
our conditioning our personalities

83
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,959
and he says but those who understand this this need to be restrained

84
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:28,800
being clever they settle their conflicts right

85
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,959
Breakers of Bones and takers of lives thieves of cattle horses and wealth

86
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:39,480
those who plunder the nation even they can come together so why on

87
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:46,320
Earth can't you and he says if you find an alert

88
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:52,560
companion a wise and virtuous friend then overcoming all adversities wander

89
00:09:52,560 --> 00:10:00,360
with them joyful and mindful if you find no alert companion

90
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:08,459
no wise and virtuous friend than like a king who flees his conquered realm wander alone like a tusker in the Wilds

91
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:17,060
a tusker is a male elephant with the tusks right large confident

92
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,459
he said it's better to wander alone there's no fellowship with fools

93
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:30,140
wander alone and do no wrong at ease like a tusker in the wild

94
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:38,880
so the Buddha says this and then he moves on and he goes to visit

95
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,459
um amendakin in another Village

96
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:50,279
and the mendicant was bagu and the bagu saw the Buddha coming off in a distance

97
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:55,519
so very much unlike the other group

98
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:01,740
when bagu saw the Buddha coming he spread out a seed

99
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:08,579
placed water for washing his feet and when the Buddha came the Buddha sat

100
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:15,779
on the seat and washed his feet and bagu bowed to the Buddha and sat down to one side

101
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:22,140
so we see the complete opposite expression of when someone's meeting the

102
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:28,680
Buddha here there's generosity ethical action and mindfulness

103
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:35,040
and the Buddha says to him I hope you're keeping well mendicant I hope you're all

104
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,519
right and I hope you're having no trouble getting alms food

105
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,820
and bagu says I'm keeping well sir I'm all right and I'm having no trouble getting alms food

106
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:53,519
and then as a you know response the Buddha educated encouraged fired up and

107
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:59,899
inspired bagu with the Dharma talk which is another you know set of

108
00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:07,279
generosity right ethical action and mindfulness or meditation

109
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:14,820
so there's no mention of the that in the suta there's no mention of the generosity the

110
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:21,839
kindness that they're showing the care and regard it's just telling you simply describing this right so if you're if

111
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:29,040
you're you know there's this way I think in which the Buddha taught so much by what he showed us

112
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,100
we often will read a suta and if you just read the sutta based on the content

113
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:40,860
it's the content is much more focused on you know

114
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,899
ill will and hatred and you know sort of

115
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:49,579
um conflict and

116
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:05,700
and then the Buddha again sort of to me it's like okay he's at a monastery he's practicing he's invited he's asked to

117
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:12,300
come and help and so he just gets up and goes you know just responds and then he

118
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:19,200
goes to the combosos and they're arguing and he's no use so he leaves there and

119
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,360
goes and helps bagu and then he gets up and goes again

120
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,820
and he goes this time to see three venerables who were staying in the

121
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:35,220
Eastern bamboo Park and as he approached the park the park keeper saw the Buddha

122
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:40,560
coming along and said to the Buddha he clearly doesn't know who the Buddha

123
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,720
is right and he says don't come into this park aesthetic

124
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:51,480
there are three gentlemen who love themselves staying here

125
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:56,880
what a way to describe the mendicant staying in that Park three

126
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:05,060
gentlemen who love themselves staying here do not disturb them

127
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:13,440
and anruda who's one of the mendicants there sees the Buddha and sees the park keeper and so you know says no no it's

128
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:19,800
okay you know and calls to his other Companions and says come forth venerables come forth

129
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:25,040
our teacher the blessed one has arrived

130
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:32,339
so we see in this progress progression now in the second progression bagu was

131
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:38,279
you know stood and prepared for the Buddha and but there was not not this

132
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:45,660
come forth come forth our teacher the blessed one has arrived so we're seeing another kind of layer of welcoming

133
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:52,560
another layer of generosity and you know kind speech in this

134
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:59,399
and then the three venerables came out to greet the Buddha and all three of them engaged in this greeting so one

135
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:06,660
received his bowl and his robe one spread out a seed and one set water

136
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:13,079
out for washing his feet and the Buddha sat on the seat spread

137
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:19,440
out and washed his feet and and then the venerables bowed and sat down to one side

138
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,339
and the Buddha starts the conversation in the same way he says I hope you're keeping well

139
00:15:26,339 --> 00:15:33,540
I hope you're all right I hope you're having no trouble getting alms food and anruda says we're keeping well sir

140
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:41,100
we're all right and we're having no trouble getting alms food so just taking a moment with this

141
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:48,180
keeping well you know that's a no it's important for us to keep well

142
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,880
right it's really meaningful to say I hope you're keeping well

143
00:15:53,880 --> 00:16:01,440
and getting alms food is incredibly important because that's the you know what we need to survive and a body right

144
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:08,880
we need food and um

145
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,779
and then the Buddha you know goes on and he says because he's found out yes you're getting your nourishment you're

146
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:22,019
keeping well and and he goes on to say I hope you're living in harmony

147
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:27,420
appreciating each other without quarreling blending like milk

148
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:34,260
and water and regarding each other with kindly eyes wow that's quite a description right

149
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:39,959
like quite quite a lot for the Buddha to be saying living in harmony

150
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:47,100
appreciating each other without quarreling blending like milk and water and regarding each other with kindly

151
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:54,360
eyes you can see if they're behaving this way why the park keeper would say there are

152
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:01,620
three people who are loving themselves right and on Ruda says indeed sir we're living

153
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,939
in harmony as you say

154
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,600
and then the Buddha asked something incredibly important

155
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,938
but how do you live this way

156
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:27,959
so I think this is incredibly important to ask this question

157
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,919
I think it's a question we don't ask enough of ourselves

158
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,720
says if you don't question and discover the factors that contribute to a

159
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:49,980
positive State of Mind the mind takes those States good States for granted

160
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,919
so when things are good and going well ask yourself questions like what is

161
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,919
happening now why are things going well what attitude is present

162
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:08,039
in this way you start to recognize to really see

163
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:13,140
what we're doing to support the arising of well-being

164
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:20,700
both in our own minds and in our interactions with others how do you live this way

165
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,919
not just you know I hope you're you know you're in harmony but do you know how

166
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,580
you're doing this is so important for our practice

167
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,900
on Ruda answers and he has an answer he can say and what he says is

168
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:43,620
in this case sir I think so he's saying I think to myself I'm

169
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:49,880
fortunate so very fortunate so he's expressing gratitude right appreciation

170
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,380
and that's a very powerful and supportive factor for helping us value

171
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:01,380
what we're doing really important for us to kind of take the time to appreciate

172
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,960
what we're doing that's supporting our well-being

173
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:11,820
and he thinks he's fortunate to live together with spiritual companions such as these

174
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:17,220
I feel fortunate to have this Sangha here this place to come to have people

175
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:23,340
here to practice with and he says I consistently treat these

176
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:28,799
venerables with kindness by way of body speech and mind in both public and

177
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:35,880
private so in public and private it's sort of like internally and externally so it's not just an external expression

178
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,580
that he's doing he's actually relating to them in those same ways inside of

179
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:47,640
himself yeah sometimes we act kindly on the outside but we don't feel so kindly on

180
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:53,940
the inside and he thinks to himself you know well

181
00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:01,620
I'm assuming like he has his own ideas come up right his own wishes his own things and so he says well why don't I

182
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:09,200
set aside my own ideas and just go along with these venerables ideas

183
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:15,980
and that's what I do though we're different in body sir we're one in mind it seems to me

184
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:23,780
and then the venerables his other companions they said likewise and they added that is how we live in harmony

185
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:30,299
appreciating each other without quarreling blending like milk and water and regarding each other with kindly

186
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:40,039
eyes so one of the things that um

187
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,679
the Buddha had said earlier was living in harmony right so you know this is

188
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:52,260
when we're interacting in a way that has a a pleasing effect

189
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:58,799
if it's music it's melodious but you know when you see people interacting together working together

190
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:04,320
if you've been on a retreat have any of you been on a retreat

191
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:10,080
yeah oh yeah well it's a beautiful place to see especially at the Insight Retreat

192
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:15,960
Center you know people are all in silence and then there's like

193
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,059
in particular I love the morning Sangha service at Insight Retreat Center

194
00:21:21,059 --> 00:21:27,179
after the first meditation everybody clean spends 20 minutes

195
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:33,600
cleaning and they're just sort of dancing and weaving and working around each other

196
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,419
and everybody has their jobs and and doing them with such care and it's very

197
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:45,840
melodious it's really beautiful the other thing that I want to emphasize

198
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,320
here is the Buddha said Mutual are you being is this Mutual and I think this is really important

199
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,200
because it's like the song of service everyone is engaged right everyone is

200
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:05,059
engaged shared reciprocated

201
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,700
so you know they say yes we're blending while we're regarding each other well

202
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:22,620
and the Buddha says good good you know sadhu sadhu I hope you're living diligently keen and

203
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:28,919
Resolute so now you know are you also kind of living in a way that shows

204
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:35,159
diligence keenness and resolution so you know this diligence is showing care and

205
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:40,740
Consciousness in one's work or duties right

206
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:46,740
Keen sort of like having some ardencies some energy

207
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:56,340
you know and Resolute sort of admirably and purposefully determined unwavering

208
00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:03,000
so are you living this way and he said and Ruda says yes indeed sir we live diligently and again this good question

209
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,780
is but how how do you live this way and on Ruda says in this case sir

210
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:17,280
whoever returns from alms round prepares the seats and puts out the drinking water and the rubbish bin if there's

211
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:23,340
anything left over whoever returns last eats if they like otherwise they throw it out where there

212
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:29,220
is and I love this little that grows so they're paying attention to where they're disposing of the food not just

213
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:36,419
to destroy plants that are growing or animals or they drop it into water that has no

214
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:42,419
living creatures again attending to the life that's there

215
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:49,679
and then they put away their seats drinking water and rubbish bin and sweep the refractory and if someone sees that

216
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:56,700
a pot of water for washing drinking or the toilet is empty so if you notice this they set it up

217
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:03,240
they're taking care of each other if someone sees that the um oh let's see

218
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:09,059
and if he can't do it he summons another with a wave of the hand and they set it up by lifting it with their hands

219
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:14,340
together but they don't break into speech for that reason

220
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:21,600
every five days we sit together for the whole night and discuss the teachings that's when they speak

221
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:28,200
and they talk about the Dharma and that is how they live diligently keen and resolute

222
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,019
and the Buddha says good good good

223
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,520
and then he says so he's going to move into a whole

224
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,559
nother realm with these mendicants that he didn't ever have a chance to even

225
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:53,640
begin with the first and wasn't kind of discussed or shared with the second

226
00:24:53,640 --> 00:25:00,840
so now he asks but as you live diligently like this have you achieved any superhuman

227
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,880
distinction and knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones a meditation at

228
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:12,080
ease so this is referencing deep concentration and insight

229
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:27,779
in general it's said that when people don't live in harmony with each other

230
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:35,460
they obstruct their access to the dhamma when we live in harmony access to the

231
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:43,020
dhamma appears this is probably why the Buddha is going further with these mendicants and his

232
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:48,480
teaching they're accessible and they're living in harmony so their access to the

233
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:55,140
dhamma should be available it should it should appear

234
00:25:55,140 --> 00:26:00,179
on Ruda says well sir

235
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:08,539
and this is this is actually a really great example of how to talk about your practice

236
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:15,240
well sir while editing meditating and he describes how diligent keen and alert

237
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:21,960
and resolute we perceive both light and vision of forms

238
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,480
but before long the light and vision of forms vanish and we haven't worked out the reason for

239
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:32,940
that so

240
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:40,620
you know when we go and we're sort of sharing our practice it's really helpful to sort of name how we're practicing

241
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:48,600
what arises what we're seeing and that's when they're referencing this light and in the forms so what do we notice and

242
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,640
then what happens from there and so essentially they're describing

243
00:26:53,640 --> 00:27:00,360
that they begin to get concentrated and then the concentration dissipates

244
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:06,240
and then he says and we haven't figured out why they don't they don't yet know why

245
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,380
that's happening

246
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:17,940
so the Buddha responds again with tremendous

247
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:24,299
generosity and um and he decides to tell them about his

248
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:30,480
own what he learned and his own practice and actually he shares about it from a

249
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,900
first person perspective and says this is what happened for me when that was going on

250
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:43,559
and we'll go through this but this is where the Buddha starts to talk about these hindrances

251
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:51,419
and how they arise in meditation practice and so he said before my Awakening

252
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:58,400
when I was still unawakened but intent on awakening

253
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:05,940
I too perceived both light and vision of forms but before long my light and vision of

254
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:12,000
forms vanished and so it occurred to me and this is so

255
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,700
important what is the cause what is the reason why my light and vision of forms

256
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:23,400
vanish and naruta was saying he hadn't figured that out but remember this is a

257
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:29,039
worthy question when you are meditating and things come up

258
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:36,480
and you notice them it's very worthwhile to reflect on what was going on what

259
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,640
changed what qualities were present and so the first thing that the Buddhist

260
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,679
shares that occurred to him was that doubt arose in me

261
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:52,820
and because of that my immersion fell away immersion is the concentration

262
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,740
when immersion Falls away the light and vision of forms vanish and then he says I'll make sure that

263
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:04,799
doubt will not arise in me again so doubt

264
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,679
I love in the suit that doubt is the first hindrance to be named

265
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:16,080
it is so common for us to have doubt

266
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:21,840
so common for us to question how we should practice right what is my

267
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:29,340
practice good enough am I good enough right what teacher should I listen to you know there's so much that we can

268
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:34,620
doubt and when we feel that doubt we we lack

269
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:42,659
conviction right we become indecisive or hesitant dubious suspicious confused

270
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:49,080
and those things really affect our ability to you know kind of be Ardent

271
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:56,220
right to be committed to be you know focused and energetic and committed to

272
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:01,980
our practice and there are many causes so the Buddha

273
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:09,120
actually doesn't explain what doubt is in the sutta I'm explaining it to you a little

274
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,760
bit and he doesn't say to them this is what

275
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:21,360
you'll feel when you notice doubt and you know he doesn't tell them what

276
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:28,860
the cause of Doubt is which in a way is also incredibly beautiful and generous because all of us

277
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:35,520
have our own experience of what doubt is and we all need to Discover it for

278
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:43,620
ourselves and know how it manifests in our practice and so he's saying look for doubt but

279
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:48,659
you've got to figure it out because we really all do we learn from

280
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:56,760
each other you know we we can read and but it's starting it's it's when we recognize it as it's arising in our own

281
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:04,919
mental space and our own hearts that's when we have the moments that wow

282
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:12,659
those are precious moments so these hindrances that arise are actually also the guides toward freedom

283
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:19,260
if we can recognize them and see them and meet them skillfully they're Treasures

284
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:24,779
they are part of practice they obscure the mind but they also when we work with them

285
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:30,980
dissolve at least temporarily

286
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:36,659
one one you know thing to think about um

287
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:42,899
in our modern society often a main source of Doubt is giving inappropriate

288
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:48,600
attention to thinking to speculating and analyzing to doing a

289
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:54,539
lot of thinking most of us have kind of a value of cleverness and thinking and

290
00:31:54,539 --> 00:32:01,440
wielding these answers and you know but the Buddha's teaching

291
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,539
says thinking is the cause of many many problems

292
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:12,299
so I'll just you know I'm just gonna point to one little thing there's so many kinds of Doubt so I'm just gonna

293
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:17,658
point to one little thing and you know

294
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:24,919
the other thing is that um

295
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,980
yeah well let's see so then they'll just go on so then the

296
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:37,020
Buddha says while meditating and so he brings back up diligent keen and

297
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:43,080
Resolute this is how he was meditating I perceived both light and vision of forms

298
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:49,620
but before long my light and vision of forms vanished it occurred to me what is the cause what's the reason why

299
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:55,080
my light and vision and form vanished so he's not

300
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:00,419
feeling sorry for himself he's not trying to make himself have a

301
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:07,260
different experience he simply recognizing something you know

302
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:14,100
was getting clear the mind was getting concentrated and then it vanished

303
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:19,320
okay what happened and we have to be pretty close to that

304
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:24,960
event to be able to say what happened often right so it's really when we have

305
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:34,640
an event in our meditation and we get caught in a hindrance right wow just like gold is right there

306
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:43,980
if we can really say oh I want to notice not damn I'm angry again

307
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:50,519
but rather oh oh this is nature this is a rising let me open up to this can I

308
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:57,720
reflect what happened here what generated the appearance of this

309
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:03,480
doubt or what generated the appearance and in this time the Buddha says it

310
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:09,480
occurred to me loss of focus arose in me and it was because of that that my

311
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:15,300
immersion fell away and so loss of focus is could be part of

312
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:21,240
sloth and torpor which is another one of the hindrances sort of the torpor is

313
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:29,339
um the Mind sags the mind is diffuse and not focused

314
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:34,378
kind of a little bit out of it

315
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:43,339
and so the the focus lack of focus right is going to affect a staying present

316
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:51,599
and the for me when I think about the a loss

317
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,060
of focus what I associate a lot of causes of that are actually a lack of

318
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:03,359
Interest are we are we interested in what's happening

319
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:08,700
like really seeing what's going on are we inspired

320
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:15,000
are we inspired by our practice by our teacher by the Sangha by the people around us

321
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:22,200
and do we have faith do we have faith in this practice in the Buddha the Dharma and the Sangha and

322
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:29,240
those things support Focus right and energy and interest

323
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:38,780
so next the Buddha goes on and he says while meditating dullness and drowsiness arose in me

324
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:44,520
and every time he says I'm going to make sure that neither nicked out nor loss of focus nor dullness and drowsiness and

325
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:52,578
all the other things He's listed before I'm going to make sure they will not you know arise in me again

326
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,040
so dullness and drowsiness might be the part of sloth and torpor which is the

327
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:04,280
sloth part which is the in the body usually energetically

328
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:13,020
so it's kind of a lack of energy and it can be due to a variety of causes we

329
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:18,599
need to kind of figure out what that is for ourselves sometimes it's very simple we ate too

330
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:24,540
much for dinner we didn't get enough sleep we didn't exercise

331
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:30,720
like not exercising can make us feel slothful we watch too much TV right but

332
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:38,119
again sort of if we find ourselves really drowsy in our meditation pay attention

333
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:46,220
right pay attention to like okay what why might I be feeling drowsy here

334
00:36:53,640 --> 00:37:00,440
the Buddha goes on to name a few other things um

335
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:07,560
but I kind of want to pause here because we're getting near the end and just see if anyone has any thoughts Reflections

336
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:13,440
questions I can go in any direction

337
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:21,260
um that you all are interested in if there is an interest

338
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,140
great

339
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,540
thanks Tonya uh I'm interested in this phrase light and vision of forms and I

340
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:39,420
wonder if you could say a bit about your interpretation of what that means yeah

341
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:45,240
um I mean I think that there's

342
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:51,960
one one interpretation of that could be that it's like the the nimita or the

343
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:58,440
beginning of going into a genre a concentrated state the light right so that's one

344
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,920
possibility um and it's also you know fairly common for

345
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:12,480
people again just as they start to concentration start to get concentrated their mind can be quite bright

346
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:19,260
um it also could just mean potentially that

347
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:25,859
there's something about the clarity of how one is seeing you know that they get the dark and

348
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:31,200
light sort of kind of implies there's something quite clear that's being seen

349
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:37,980
you're really aware of what's Happening so those are possible what do you think

350
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:46,338
of that yeah that sounds good thank you yeah yeah thanks for the question

351
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:52,220
I think you know I really want to emphasize how important it is to connect

352
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:59,359
our behavior in the world and how we live with what happens in meditation

353
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:06,599
and that when when we're in the world and we're enacting you know the hindrances of doubt

354
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:12,240
right classically they're listed desire sensual desires a wanting

355
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,180
pleasantness aversion or ill will

356
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:24,420
restlessness and worry which is oh well sloth and torpor and

357
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:31,320
doubt and so you can think about desire and aversion as

358
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:37,980
both energies moving in opposite directions desire is the one thing of something the

359
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:44,700
energy is a pulling and aversion is wanting to get rid of something but they're both focused on

360
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:51,359
a wanting more or not sloth and torpor and restlessness system

361
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:58,260
worry are kind of the opposite right sloth and torpor is a lack of energy a lack of you know a Clarity in the mind

362
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:04,020
and and um restlessness and worry is too much energy in the body

363
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:10,079
a mind that's too worried too frenetic and then doubt which we've talked about

364
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,960
right so these you can if you just think about them as energies

365
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:23,640
um you can see how they're you know like the Buddha will say that um both

366
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:30,420
both desire and ill will are there from the birth right there's just they're

367
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:37,859
they're like life energies we need to go for food and we need to get away from being hurt in the simplest form

368
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:43,920
and that so they're very innately you know there and

369
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:50,640
um the others kind of come along later right as we become more aware of

370
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:59,099
ourselves and you know sort of various other things but if we allow these energies to

371
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:06,900
continue to manifest in our lives without without discipline

372
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:13,079
they become habits and then they become

373
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:19,520
you know characteristics personality structures

374
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:27,859
so next month Diana Clyde Clark and I are going to teach a hindrances class

375
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,440
using The Wizard of Oz as a reference

376
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:42,000
it's such a great I'm so it's going to be really fun and such a great sort of example of

377
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,359
personalities that kind of created personalities out of the different hindrances with the characters in that

378
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:56,220
show and you know you might ask yourself of these hindrances which one what do I

379
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:01,500
have this personality type often you'll hear in Buddhism there's

380
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:08,339
three personality types agreed aversion and deluded but I actually I like this

381
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:16,140
idea of like the five personality types of the hindrances all five of them because that certainly seems relevant

382
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:22,200
um to me and if you come uh watch The Wizard of Oz with us we'll

383
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:29,099
show little clips so if you're interested I encourage you to watch the movie before you come but

384
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:36,079
um starting of the first Thursday in March

385
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:41,220
it's a 6 30 is the start time will end at eight

386
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:49,200
and so it'll be for five Thursdays in March yeah and uh so come ready to

387
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:55,920
have fun yeah so

388
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:01,740
it's really it's really really um I guess one final thing I'll say

389
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:05,060
is um

390
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:14,280
oh I like this I'll share this it's not what I was going to say but I looked up data corruption in Wikipedia as a

391
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:21,119
reference because they use this word Corruptions and I liked it so much better than many and so in Wikipedia it

392
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,300
says data corruption refers to errors and computer data that occur right right

393
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:33,960
occurred during writing reading storage transmission or processing right and it they introduce unintended

394
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:40,680
changes to the original data and that's a way to think about the hindrances they come in at some point and they make

395
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:46,500
unintended changes to what we're doing feeling saying and then it goes on in

396
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:52,020
general when data corruption occurs a file containing that data will produce unexpected results

397
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:57,900
yes well that certainly can happen when we get you know driven by the energies

398
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:03,839
of the hindrances and um you know the results can be very minor

399
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:10,619
too very major a system crash and then I love this too there are two types of data corruption associated with

400
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:17,640
computer systems undetected and detected that's so great that's so simple the

401
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:22,980
hindrances we either see them or they don't and what happens if we don't see them

402
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:29,940
right they just run rampant and so in the computer World undetected

403
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:36,119
data corruption also known as um silent data corruption results in the

404
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:41,819
most dangerous errors right detected data corruption

405
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:49,079
may be permanent with the loss of data or may be temporary when some part of the system is able to detect and correct

406
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:57,180
the error so May our systems detect data errors

407
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,859
thank you for your kind attention

408
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,510
[Applause]
