1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,359
so we're still

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,240
lingering in the 13th step

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,440
of mindfulness of breathing that of

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,960
observing in constancy

5
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,320
and that there's something about

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,640
inconstancy and observing it that leads

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,880
to the 14 step

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,400
which is usually translated

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,680
into english as dispassion

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,880
uh when we'll get to the meanings of it

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,800
maybe tomorrow but or soon

12
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,960
but there's something about seeing

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,800
impermanence

14
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,079
that is onward leading seeing in

15
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,680
constancy which

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,440
opens something up that allows something

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,760
to unfold and deepen or

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,960
move along and the very common

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,920
uh term in the buddhist scriptures is

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,520
the idea of

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,478
the dharma is onward leading and it's

22
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,240
armored onward leading to greater and

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,000
greater freedom

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,640
and one of the things that's very much

25
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,439
so a part of this onward leading nature

26
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,400
is this settling back resting in

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,479
awareness in a sense

28
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,000
and becoming more and more aware of the

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,640
transiency of experience the inconstancy

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,320
of experience

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,560
sometimes it's called impermanence but

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,680
as i've said

33
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,159
that's going to imply for some people

34
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:32,880
only means

35
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,720
that sooner or later something will no

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,079
longer exist it'll

37
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,920
die or be gone forever and well

38
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,000
there's wisdom to that understanding for

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,920
sure

40
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,600
and it could be freeing in itself in a

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,079
certain way the core insight of the

42
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,920
buddha has more to do

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,240
with the momentary and constancy of

44
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,040
things

45
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,119
that everything is kind of part of or

46
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,479
like it's

47
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,320
he didn't say this but it's like the

48
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,960
inconstant waves or ripples

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,719
on um on a river that flows by and the

50
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,960
little wave let's come in they go they

51
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,239
exist and don't exist

52
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,039
and and they're in constant they're

53
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,400
constantly being reborn

54
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,440
constantly passing away and

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,160
so many of our sensations are coming and

56
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:18,640
going

57
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,120
coming and going sometimes they stay

58
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,440
longer than we wish

59
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,000
but uh sooner or later they pass and

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,080
they maybe come back again

61
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,760
but to really settle in and really start

62
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,120
seeing more and more precisely or

63
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,840
intimately uh closely

64
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,239
how much of our experience is it's a

65
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,519
flowing experience

66
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,519
the changing sensations is a

67
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,000
things are peering and disappearing

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,480
sometimes in rapid succession or

69
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,160
sometimes it can just feel like um

70
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,080
everything is just flowing sand

71
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,080
and the reason for flowing sand rather

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,640
than water as some people say is that

73
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,680
sand is a little bit more like

74
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,400
particular so it's a little bit more the

75
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,519
particular sensations that have

76
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,239
some kind of clarity to them whereas

77
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,599
water flows

78
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,840
but there's no sense of a particularity

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,319
to each molecule of water

80
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,120
whereas then there's a particularity or

81
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,800
some people it feels like snow

82
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,959
just everything is just like snow you

83
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,519
know or raindrops

84
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,040
but the flowing sand and

85
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,280
everything and just really settling back

86
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,440
and getting very still

87
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,519
and then appreciating how everything is

88
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:38,480
arising and

89
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,000
passing this was a very significant

90
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,239
insight for the buddha it was like his

91
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,080
in the ways described in some texts is

92
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,959
like this was his big aha moment

93
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,120
this is what he in seeing this he

94
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,599
realized this is the path to liberation

95
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,840
with seeing this arising and passing the

96
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,040
inconstancy

97
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,080
um there was light there was wisdom

98
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
there was clarity there was um

99
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,239
the path opened for the buddha but in

100
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,280
particular

101
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
what was particularly both seeing

102
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,599
arising was very important for him

103
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,439
but seeing the passing was very

104
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,720
important as well

105
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,320
and it seems like the passing and the

106
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,000
ceasing of things was even more

107
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,040
important than seeing their arising

108
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,680
i know exactly you know i'm not sure but

109
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,400
one reason

110
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,840
is that when we know that things pass

111
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,240
even if they're in constantly come back

112
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,720
we know that they're not

113
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,600
permanent we know that it's not always

114
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,919
that way

115
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,120
and uh and uh and that frees us from the

116
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,080
mind that it's

117
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,759
that kind of unconsciously or

118
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,240
subconsciously we relate to things

119
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,720
as if they're always going to be there

120
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,520
and

121
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,360
as opposed to relating to them as being

122
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,360
oh this is just part of the flavor of

123
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,960
the moment this is what's coming here

124
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,360
now

125
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,720
and in due time it'll pass and in fact

126
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,600
if i replay

127
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,680
really careful attention to the

128
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,000
particularity of the moment it's already

129
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,919
passing and then arising passing and

130
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,600
arising

131
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,720
and so knowing that it's not constant so

132
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,160
that's very helpful

133
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,199
with things like suffering if we think

134
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,240
that suffering is

135
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,440
durable stuck solid

136
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,000
unchanging then it's very hard to get in

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,759
this like concrete it's very hard to get

138
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,000
in

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,880
there and try to do anything with it but

140
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,479
we see it as more as

141
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,240
flowing sand or flowing water

142
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,360
then you know you try to reach into

143
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,199
water and hold on to it

144
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,720
grab a fistful of it it just disappears

145
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,960
through your fingers very quickly

146
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,240
and and so we realized suffering doesn't

147
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,199
have that solidity we thought before

148
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,400
self all the things we think of as this

149
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,800
myself or we identify strongly as being

150
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,560
this is who i am

151
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,440
to to really see that it also has a

152
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,960
certain way

153
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,479
a certain way of inconstancy that

154
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,800
it comes and goes the sensations the

155
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,800
experience the thing the role

156
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,080
the ideas the feelings the intuitions

157
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,440
the

158
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,840
whatever it might be that we think is it

159
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,440
this is myself

160
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,520
we start seeing that too as part of this

161
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,440
flow and current of

162
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,479
a river and we can't quite

163
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,479
hold on to it and so there's these gaps

164
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,880
in the arising and passing there's this

165
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,720
moments of freedom

166
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,600
and the passing begins to teach us not

167
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,720
to cling

168
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,199
not to grasp and we start seeing it's

169
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,479
simply not worth

170
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,639
grasping um it's um

171
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,560
and this is a powerful insight that

172
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,319
comes

173
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,240
many many times in life all kinds of

174
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,440
ways but in

175
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,160
deeper and deeper meditation there's a

176
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
sense of well-being or freedom and

177
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,520
openness a

178
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,880
lack of clinging that's so palpable

179
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,960
that we begin feeling that any movement

180
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,160
to contract

181
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,120
any movement to resist any movement to

182
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,080
hold on tight

183
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,000
or to linger and be involved with

184
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,479
something that's going on

185
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,280
is a loss of some of the peace we're

186
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,479
actually better off

187
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,240
in the freedom we're better off in this

188
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,199
deep subtle quiet peacefulness

189
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,080
and in that we can learn it's not worth

190
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,599
clinging we lose something

191
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:32,319
in the contracting we lose something in

192
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:32,880
the

193
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,080
resisting and it isn't that we are told

194
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,560
you know

195
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,240
it's a good buddhist you should let go

196
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,680
of clinging

197
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,560
it's more like there's no admonition

198
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,280
like that

199
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,240
it's more like pay careful attention

200
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,720
become

201
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,560
quiet and when you notice for yourself

202
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,680
that you're worse off clinging then

203
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,800
don't cling and one of the lessons for

204
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,319
this that helps this

205
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,639
is when we realize in certain deep

206
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,400
states of meditation

207
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,280
that clinging doesn't work at all

208
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:05,840
because

209
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,400
whatever it is we're clinging to is also

210
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,919
constantly passing away

211
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,360
constantly passing away and whether

212
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,879
you don't have to be in that constant

213
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,280
passing away place in meditation

214
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,680
to begin appreciating how much does pass

215
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,800
away

216
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,919
and how in the passing away

217
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,960
it is possible to tune into a kind of

218
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,680
peacefulness a freedom a spaciousness an

219
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,800
openness

220
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,080
that that kind of allows or makes room

221
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,880
for

222
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,919
permits if we don't cling to the next

223
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,599
thing that comes up

224
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,959
kind of allow it to pass and in the

225
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,560
space that it leaves behind in a sense

226
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,560
just be open there be relaxed there

227
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,279
take that in the next thing will

228
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,080
something else will

229
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,360
arise but rather than being you know

230
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,240
preoccupied by it or caught by it or

231
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,320
analyzing it or reflecting on or doing

232
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,600
things with it

233
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,480
allow the next thing to arise to rise in

234
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,320
that space

235
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,120
and that openness in that field of

236
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,040
awareness that just lets it comes and

237
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,360
goes

238
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,560
and um and in the process of doing that

239
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,040
we learn

240
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,600
more and more about letting go

241
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,440
we learn more and more we're not holding

242
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,519
on to anything

243
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:36,800
and and

244
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,880
i need to charge my battery

245
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,560
and so because batteries also pass away

246
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,600
and it's probably good

247
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,839
for the next couple of minutes to keep

248
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,000
it going

249
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,600
um so

250
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,240
the

251
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,519
and so uh this teaching on not self

252
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,800
that is often perplexing for people is a

253
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,040
teaching that makes more and more sense

254
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
when we understand that nothing

255
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,320
qualifies

256
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,440
as an enduring self there's nothing that

257
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,079
we can find

258
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,079
inside of ourselves or in direct

259
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,440
experience

260
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,279
then we're really intimate and close to

261
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,560
direct experience

262
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,440
nothing that qualifies as oh that's

263
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,320
myself

264
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,040
because it passes as well and the idea

265
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,200
being that anything that passes

266
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,640
cannot be an enduring self and

267
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,839
any theory any um for the buddha's point

268
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:40,480
of view

269
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,720
any doctrine of self any theory about

270
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,440
what the self is

271
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,600
lends itself to a kind of reification a

272
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,320
kind of solidification on what to self

273
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,800
that's not possible when it's things are

274
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,480
constantly changing

275
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,120
it's kind of like uh there's no place to

276
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,399
hang your hat

277
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,920
there's no place to tack

278
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,440
with thumbtack no place to attack

279
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,560
any philosophy idea concept theory

280
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,279
about what the self is you know it's

281
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,720
like taking a thumbtack and

282
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,399
trying to stick it into a river and have

283
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,240
it gets you know stuck it doesn't stick

284
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,160
anywhere

285
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,959
so any theory about self just doesn't

286
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,120
quite stick doesn't quite work when this

287
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,200
constantly flowing and constant nature

288
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
of experience

289
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,160
that begins to open up in deep vipassana

290
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,320
practice

291
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,600
so this the core deepest kind of

292
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,440
important insight of inside meditation

293
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,079
is this inconstancy of phenomena the

294
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,600
changing nature

295
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,720
the current of phenomena as it flows

296
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,720
through and arises and passes

297
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,480
here in the present moment so to settle

298
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,800
back and observe that

299
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,600
on this 13th step is what's talked about

300
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,200
and as we do that

301
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,000
we begin feeling that the things that we

302
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,560
cling to

303
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,920
have passionate lust for passionate

304
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,279
hatred for

305
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,680
that all that kind of um

306
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,160
the ways in which we're driven or about

307
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,839
things passionate around our

308
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:26,240
attachments um

309
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,560
just doesn't make any sense as well and

310
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,959
it stops losing its allure

311
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,760
it stops losing its enchantment we start

312
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,480
stop falling under its spell

313
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,160
and then we begin observing that we're

314
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,279
less and less interested in clinging

315
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,320
less and less interested in lust and

316
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,519
hatred and

317
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,160
you know this driven driven attached

318
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
kind of passion that can happen like the

319
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,000
passion for money or the passion for

320
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,279
power or

321
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,440
kind of the negative understandings of

322
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,639
passion

323
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,600
and so then the 14th step is observing

324
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,240
dispassion

325
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,839
so um

326
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,360
so then it will end and this will pass

327
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,560
as well

328
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,560
and will make room for the next thing to

329
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,680
happen

330
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,959
and um and chances are

331
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,760
it's simply inconstant and we'll meet

332
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,040
again here tomorrow

333
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:31,360
at the same time thank you
