1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:07,480
hello everyone welcome and

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,240
uh the theme for this morning's meditation to go along with the

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:23,640
reflection afterwards or to cast a light on it is that uh something that I feel

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,560
is very precious about precious potential of mindfulness practice

5
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:35,200
awareness practice and that is uh a way of being

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,000
aware where there's no no outside or to say it

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,760
differently being aware where everything is allowed to appear in Awareness

8
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,239
equally there's no divisions in the mind between what is acceptable for awareness

9
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:02,280
and what is not acceptable for awareness there might be wisdom there might be other ways in which the mind um

10
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,320
differentiates between what's happening it might be some things are

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:15,880
seen as being useful healthy appropriate to do or to think some things are not uh

12
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:21,600
in the bigger picture scheme of things but while we're meditating especially in certain

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:29,159
circumstances um there's a there's also the operation of a form of awareness

14
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:37,680
that awareness is itself doesn't divide the world up and uh and so everything has a place

15
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,079
everything is included and um in

16
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:49,040
Awareness it doesn't mean that we are accepting it or condoning anything it

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:56,399
just means that in this world of awareness we're not struggling with anything we're not dividing wanting it

18
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,399
to be different trying to hold on to it uh that can all come later but if we can

19
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:11,480
learn to uh come to a place of of uh this undivided attention

20
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:19,160
meaning un uh divisive attention where there's no lines between

21
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,200
what is acceptable to be aware and unacceptable what we're willing to be aware of and what I'm not willing to be

22
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:30,400
aware of that um that gives us a vantage point to have much more wisdom about

23
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,640
what to do and how to see things but the beginning is this

24
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,120
open and so everything is included there's nothing outside and for me

25
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,000
that's one of the most sacred things is an awareness which uh includes everything there's nothing which is

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,920
unacceptable in it and uh and so one of the little

27
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,360
expressions for mindfulness practice uh that supports this is the the

28
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,920
expression this too whatever is happening this too is included in

29
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:18,319
awareness and um and so um but uh this movement of this to is

30
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,959
included in Awareness is not the same thing as going along with something it's

31
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:32,159
also not the same thing as pushing anything away it's it's

32
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:39,080
uh it's coming into a a clear seeing a

33
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:46,200
clear knowing a clear awareness that is independent of

34
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:53,360
our participation our engagement our for the ways we're for and

35
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,799
against and of course we will be for and against and then the attitude towards

36
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:07,000
that is this too is included we see that and that seeing is free the seeing is

37
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,360
where Freedom occurs freedom from being caught in anything being pushed around

38
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,359
by anything the uh free from uh being reactive to

39
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:24,800
anything and so this is a kind of a non-divided attention or a

40
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,720
non separating attention everything is included this too

41
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:38,360
so as we do this meditation uh after we kind of get settled a bit you might try using this

42
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:45,400
expression or just doesn't have to be a you don't have to say it in your mind but you can just

43
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,080
uh the attitude can be there that whatever is

44
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:58,400
occurring this too is included this too this

45
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,440
too and um and uh and then with that this too

46
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:12,360
it's almost like you're going to make now more room for the experience without being Tangled in it

47
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,000
just to see it just allow it to be there in its own

48
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,680
pristine uniqueness the own pristine uniqueness

49
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:31,600
free of our involvement with it this too this too

50
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,919
so uh assuming a meditation

51
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,360
posture

52
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:52,680
and maybe begin with lowering your gaze relaxing your

53
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,199
eyes and if your eyes are still open see if you

54
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:05,080
can soft soften the Gaze there's something very profound

55
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:11,960
about having soft eyes that are not fixated on

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:20,038
anything soft eyes that are just float in the eye

57
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,440
socket and then gently closing the

58
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:35,240
eyes and as if the inhale Flo Floats or

59
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,880
gently expands allow the inhale to be

60
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,120
more expansive Fuller than

61
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:59,960
usual and then allow yourself to relax on the exhale

62
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:19,280
maybe allowing your exhale to be longer by gently letting go near the end

63
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,800
of the exhale so letting go into the exhale

64
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,520
letting the breathing return to

65
00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:52,280
normal and as you inhale become aware of any tensions or Holdings in your body

66
00:07:52,280 --> 00:08:01,440
places that are tight and as you exhale

67
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,000
soften the

68
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,960
body relax the

69
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:27,440
muscles soften the edges of your body

70
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:46,440
as you breathe in and out become aware of how you are

71
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,279
emotionally your mood or attitude

72
00:08:51,880 --> 00:09:01,439
feelings feeling them as you inhale and soften them on the exhale

73
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:10,839
whatever you are feeling let it relax and settle with the

74
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:18,160
exhale maybe almost like a massage of your feelings breathing in and breathing

75
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,160
out

76
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
and then on the inhale feeling sensing

77
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:59,839
deeply your thinking mind the energy

78
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:07,519
activity the tension of thinking however

79
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:18,760
subtle and as you exhale to soften the thinking

80
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:31,279
mind as if the thinking mind is gently floating

81
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:37,800
on a comfortable body of water gently

82
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:45,199
rocked by The Gentle waves the thinking mind

83
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:54,079
rests and a soft surface of water floating

84
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,959
and then now centering yourself centering yourself more

85
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:41,560
fully and the movements in the body as you

86
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,519
breathe maybe those movements of expansion and contraction as you breathe

87
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:59,160
in in and out are like gentle waves

88
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,079
moving through your body

89
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:43,760
and if something else is occurring for you that you'll be mindful of as you sit here a sound a thought a feeling

90
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,320
sensation in your body an

91
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,839
Impulse be mindful it be know it be aware of it include it in awareness and

92
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:06,079
it clear distinct way with the attitude this too is

93
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,800
included this too you have space to know and be aware

94
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:17,199
of no need to be for or against or judge

95
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:23,639
it or resist it or hold on to it it's

96
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:31,120
enough just to know it's there this too is included

97
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,320
so that as you're aware the awareness becomes

98
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,759
softer awareness becomes looser lighter

99
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,320
more open

100
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,120
receptive maybe

101
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:27,480
spacious and then into then into that spacious awareness let the breathing return to it

102
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,040
let the breathing enter into the

103
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:39,120
space until there's something else to

104
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:46,160
include this too is included in

105
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
awareness

106
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

107
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

108
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

109
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

110
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

111
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

112
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

113
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

114
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

115
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

116
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

117
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,559
e e

118
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

119
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

120
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,480
e e

121
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:29,039
whatever is happening remember to include it with this too

122
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:38,520
you'll be aware of aware but not

123
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
participating

124
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

125
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

126
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
e e

127
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:28,159
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

128
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,960
to whatever degree you can get a feeling for the

129
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,519
specialness of no outside no divisions in

130
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:49,440
Awareness that awareness is open and available for everything

131
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:59,000
equally [Music] imagine in a safe social environment

132
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,200
that you are able to be aware of others in this

133
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:12,880
way this too this person too can be

134
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:19,080
known in Awareness simply

135
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:25,720
fully with no divisions no

136
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:30,120
separation no for or against

137
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:37,519
the unique expression of each person in that moment can just be

138
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,039
allowed to be in your

139
00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:59,159
awareness as an open field for a heart heart-to-heart

140
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:04,279
Connection open field for a full meeting

141
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:13,840
sensing of another human being breathing living thinking human

142
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,000
being and in that open

143
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:29,559
field to evoke your good will

144
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:35,279
your potential for kindness and generosity

145
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:41,880
friendliness and wish this other these other people

146
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,880
well thinking of some people in your life a single person or group of

147
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,360
people wish them well maybe repeating these words to yourself

148
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,039
silently may you be

149
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:07,398
happy may you be

150
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,279
safe may you be

151

peaceful may you be

152
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,880
free and may it be also that this wish of care and kindness of yours each of

153
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:33,039
you spreads out towards others throughout the

154
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:41,279
day a theme for the day may all beings be

155
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:46,919
happy may all beings be

156
00:30:46,919 --> 00:30:53,240
safe may all [Music] beings be

157
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,919
peaceful may all beings be free

158
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:12,880
[Music]

159
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:21,440
thank

160
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,880
you e

161
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,200
hello and welcome to this nth talk on the 10

162
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:13,320
Reflections and for today and tomorrow today the topic is reconciliation and

163
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:19,039
tomorrow it's healing and I associate these two with

164
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:24,120
becoming whole becoming whole

165
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:31,159
interpersonally or becoming and becoming whole for oneself h a holistic a

166
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:38,720
holism that uh we're not divided through fear or divided through greed or hatred

167
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,880
or they kind of a an inclus inclusion coming together a

168
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:52,080
meeting together I think that uh reconciliation comes from a root meaning in Latin to

169
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,880
come together to meet so um might be nice to go through

170
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,960
these 10 a little bit briefly the um I connect them all with a certain kind of

171
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,840
sequence a logic of how one follows the other and there's other ways in which

172
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:15,880
they can follow this is not required that they follow this sequence but uh I

173
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:21,960
kind of delight in this sequence and in uh the story that they kind of

174
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:29,159
tell that um uh if we find a sense if you find

175
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:37,200
meaning and purpose in this life then um that gives us a guide for

176
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,639
what we're going to do in this life of ours and so then uh it's important then

177
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:50,039
to be able to act so to have agency and uh agency a certain degree of

178
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:55,760
autonomy uh our agency are doing is not something that's permitted by others

179
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:01,240
only or enabled by other people we're not dependent in others but we have an

180
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:07,440
autonomy autonomous ability to live a life of meaning and

181
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,480
purpose as we do that as we act and as we act singularly for ourselves in a

182
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:20,839
certain way maybe together with others that um then uh uh we start to get to

183
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:26,320
know ourselves in relationship to what's important for us what drives us the the

184
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:33,800
purpose and and meaning and the actions we do and we can form a we can have a

185
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:40,760
clear sense of identity clear sense of who we are and that's very important if we're kind of lost to ourselves not sure

186
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:46,280
who we are um it can be source of all kinds of

187
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:52,200
challenges but uh in Buddhism uh our identity doesn't come from some inherent

188
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:57,880
essence of who we are how we're born but uh the essence that Buddhism bases our

189
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:04,480
lives on is the the um the identity of uh the shifting identities that based on

190
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:12,520
how we live what we do how we act and um and key to Buddhism is acting ethically

191
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:18,160
and so it's the ethics that we live by that uh virtues we live by that becomes

192
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:24,240
our primary identity and um and then from that can

193
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,400
we can have a sense of dignity the dignity the sense of personal value of

194
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:35,359
knowing that we're dedicated to not harming anyone in fact we might be dedicated to the opposite to benefiting

195
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:41,320
self anothers and so um and so with this

196
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,599
dedication towards uh action and action for the benefit of others and for

197
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:54,839
oneself um then we enter into the world of community and uh and just like identity

198
00:35:54,839 --> 00:36:00,880
is something that's shifting and changing Community is not something static and fixed Community is also

199
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:07,560
something that changes and morphs depending the people we're with and how we're relating to people and and we can

200
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:15,560
get a sense that our caner community is not it can be more more open more more inclusive of the the people we feel part

201
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:24,040
of um and our actions our ethics helps create a healthy sense of

202
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:29,319
community and uh and then with Community we can get to know people in a deeper

203
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:34,880
way and feel the kinship the common Humanity that we share that we all feel

204
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,800
like we're kin we're all family and uh and with that there can be

205
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:47,040
a dedication towards uh uh when there's fractured relationships conflict in

206
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,680
relationships and divisiveness in society then we have a huge need to come

207
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:59,040
back into Union back into Unity back into wholeness together and uh back into

208
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,760
a sense of community and kinship and so there's the work of

209
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:11,400
reconciliation and um and healing reconciliation has to do interpersonally

210
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,760
and the way I Define these terms um for this purpose here this these two weeks I

211
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:23,760
think of reconciliation being the interpersonal work and healing being of deep personal work that happens in

212
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:31,280
relationship to community and others and our relationships and so the work of some

213
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,960
people might you know not see these two as so separate these terms but so

214
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,079
reconciliation and this is a very Central uh movement in Buddhism maybe

215
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:48,200
without literally that word being used uh the Buddha put tremendous emphasis I

216
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,319
would say on um on the activity

217
00:37:54,319 --> 00:38:01,440
of um uh uh uniting the people who are

218
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,640
divided and supporting the unification of people who are

219
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:13,079
united wrong speech one of the definitions of wrong speech is to divide

220
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:21,040
the people who are united and keep divided the people who are

221
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:27,800
divisive and um so that built into the precepts and the faithful path and and

222
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:33,160
the whole kind of foundation of Buddhist practice is an orientation to live a

223
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:39,079
life that's focused and considered and concerned with the sense of unity that

224
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:47,839
we have with others um the sense of uh coming together in harmony and um in in the Buddha the

225
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:55,359
Buddha's clearest way of doing that was in his own Community the monastic community and uh finding a way for them

226
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:03,800
to live together in harmony and unity and not in division and um in fact people who

227
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:11,800
create uh a real Schism in the monastic Community uh receive the the most severe

228
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,440
I don't know what to call it consequence uh in monastic life is that

229
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:24,000
you're no longer allowed to be a monastic uh it's such an important thing to create that

230
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,800
unity and um so that takes work and I've been involved with uh conflict

231
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,839
resolution work I was a a chair I've been chair of a conflict uh uh committee

232
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:44,560
for some 15 years and was sitting as a mediator for lots of conflicts and um and I can tell you that

233
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:50,200
it's a lot of work but it's really worthwhile work because it's practice

234
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:56,599
work it's Buddhist practice to enter into this world of of our relationships

235
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:02,760
with others and really get to the bottom them and really understand ourselves well understand other people well find

236
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:10,440
Common Ground um uh work with our divisiveness our anger our resentment uh

237
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:18,160
find Common Ground um it takes a lot of time sometimes but um the

238
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:24,040
consequences um in the long term tend to be much better than remaining divisive

239
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:29,200
divisiveness anger sometimes can have immediate consequences pushing people

240
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:37,560
away for example but long-term negative consequences and um so it's better to uh

241
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:43,119
to spend the time to invest in the time Upfront for reconciliation and coming

242
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:50,400
together than it is to take this easy or the simple or short way um that of anger

243
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,119
and resentment and hostility that uh will have uh repercussion sometimes for

244
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:03,880
the rest of a lifetime for some people so um it is possible to reconcile

245
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:10,119
and in Buddhism a huge part of this process of reconciliation um is not looking for

246
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:17,200
forgiveness not looking for apology there's certainly a time and place for that but the Buddhist uh the emphasis in

247
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:25,440
Buddhism is first and foremost to be able to do this introspection to understand the pain and

248
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:31,079
the downside of the living with resentment living with anger and even

249
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:38,079
sometimes being attached to hurt attached to being a victim and um and so really want to look

250
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:44,599
and see and begin to dissolve in a healthy way appropriate way to dissolve

251
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:53,200
the anger we have to let go of the resentments we hold on to and then to cultivate a sincere and

252
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,680
and authentic kind of sense of Goodwill for others and this movement of letting

253
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:04,839
go of anger and cultivating Good Will can look a lot like forgiveness but in

254
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:14,160
some ways it's simpler because it doesn't require something from someone else it doesn't uh require a a um the

255
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:22,160
complexity of forgiveness that sometimes exists forgiveness is a form of generosity giving forgiving which I

256
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:28,040
think can be quite beautiful but the in the Buddhist kind of approach which there are other approaches

257
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:35,480
is um to do this work for yourself and then uh be in conversation with the with

258
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:42,720
others um in uh some of the places in the world where there's been reconcil political reconciliation

259
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,839
processes the word truth has been associated with that there has to be truth telling things have to be really

260
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:54,839
come out in the open um and really life to have reconciliation happen so once we

261
00:42:54,839 --> 00:43:00,559
kind of do our own work and no longer holding resentments and holding ourselves apart and being critical of

262
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:07,040
others and seeing them through Angry Eyes um then maybe we're ready to speak

263
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:14,280
the truth talk about what happened talk about the pain the hurt talk about the difficulties we've had but without

264
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:21,640
attacking people without poking them with kind of mean statements and it's profound work to

265
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:28,680
look for reconciliation it's not always possible because you know has to be two people in

266
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:36,280
the in the willing to be do part of the work but um uh it's certainly impossible

267
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:42,440
if both people don't want to do it if one person does the inner work and creates the conditions and the openness

268
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:50,520
and the kindness friendliness Goodwill uh then sometimes other people will come along in in time and sometimes

269
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:55,839
it takes a long time before people are ready for some kind of reconciliation

270
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:01,599
some kind of meeting to work things out um but then we prepare ourselves for

271
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:07,200
that and make sure that we're clean that we're not holding on to something that's going to make it difficult when the time

272
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,520
finally comes and um and part of the reason why

273
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:19,200
reconciliation is such an important thing for Dharma practitioners is that uh if we're

274
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:26,680
contributing to the divisiveness the divisions the separation uh that's a way of of of

275
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:33,599
dividing ourselves that's a way of shutting down part of ourselves that's a way of living in a way that we're not

276
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:39,359
complete we're not whole we're not kind of uh including all of ourselves in the

277
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:46,640
field of awareness so to become free to use mindfulness to become Freer and Freer we

278
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:52,280
have to really meet and confront and work with the places where we're divided

279
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:57,960
we're caught we're stuck and tight and uh it's part of the wonderful gift of

280
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:03,520
mindfulness practice that sooner or later uh as we do this practice we have

281
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:11,160
to meet these parts of ourselves that sometimes have been buried been closed unwilling to look at our hurt our anger

282
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:17,280
our resentments and our unwilling to kind of think about dissolving them or working through

283
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:25,960
them and it's a work of a lifetime sometimes but it's such a great thing to be part of uh reconciliation and and uh

284
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:32,640
healing that social healing so um so what is your experience

285
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:38,359
of conflict resentment Divi div divisions

286
00:45:38,359 --> 00:45:45,680
divisiveness divisive divisions that uh you've been part of and what is uh your interest in

287
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:52,680
reconciliation how can reconciliation and working on this divisiveness that exists in families and friends and

288
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:59,680
communities uh how is it really uh uh important for you personally how might

289
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:05,119
it be important how is it really part of a life effort that has tremendous

290
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:10,319
meaning and purpose to work through these things and now we're back at the

291
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:17,440
beginning of these 10 Reflections that uh the very thing of reconciliation itself is part of a very

292
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:23,640
meaningful life purposeful life so uh thank

293
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:29,240
you uh very much and uh then tomorrow tomorrow we'll do the last of these 10

294
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:35,520
Reflections and that of healing thank you
