1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:08,519
so welcome folks um yeah nice to be with

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,320
you okay let's uh let's

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
it

4
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,680
either easing your way

5
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,840
in or uh starting on a dime and

6
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,600
dropping

7
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,840
everything

8
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,440
sometimes we have to kind of tunnel our way into the present

9
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:28,760
moment sometimes it's uh right there waiting for us with one

10
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,760
breath

11
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,799
sometimes skillful to uh kind of palpate the psychospiritual

12
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:41,200
body you know where does it hurt what

13
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:50,040
needs are uh blessing love

14
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:07,439
awareness the Loops of thought that uh won't

15
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:24,000
unwind the heartaches

16
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
anxieties

17
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,520
we just do uh what we can

18
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,039
to give

19
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:51,919
um give our blessing to

20
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,720
uh the surges of of energy in body and

21
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,080
mind in this way our uh

22
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,080
heart becomes more and more

23
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:15,080
uh available to this

24
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
breath

25
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,160
we're practicing being uh

26
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,720
softened by all

27
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,360
phenomena by words and images what we call

28
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:23,240
Thinking by emotion and other

29
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
sensation

30
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,720
by the

31
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:06,079
breath it's all

32
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:17,079
phenomena treated like uh the the Buddha's

33
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
whisperings

34
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:13,680
and when the heart loses its suppleness as it does as it

35
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,959
will loses its suppleness when we become

36
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:33,160
identified when

37
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,079
imperfection feels like a problem to be

38
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:51,440
solved when it feels like uh we must Retreat to the headquarters of uh self

39
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,079
and rearrange

40
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
samsara

41
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:17,959
when we lose our softness we soften

42
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
again

43
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,840
we can actually uh feel something like this uh

44
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:23,840
softening this way that we trust our heart to uh meet the intensity of The

45
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:30,320
Human Condition

46
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:53,480
in the transition from uh the the uh clench to fist of

47
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:01,919
clinging to the release of letting go that

48
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:07,840
uh that movement is a kind of

49
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:22,200
softening doesn't mean we're free of discomfort then or that the

50
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,480
softening itself is totally

51
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,240
Pleasant but something about it

52
00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:49,720
is the kind of anxiety

53
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,919
agitation of attempting to control this

54
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,960
moment that melts

55
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:09,919
away and just that is a deep relief to something in our

56
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:26,480
heart and so maybe we're breathing feeling our body or hearing

57
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,400
sound practicing in whatever way we

58
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:39,080
practice then there's some

59
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,600
noticing of

60
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,799
brittleness we breathe and

61
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
soften

62
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:14,960
all phenomena mean the same

63
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,760
thing let

64
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
go

65
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:54,720
it's a a path to freedom but it's also

66
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,919
practicing freedom the way an

67
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:08,960
athlete practices a basketball shot free throw or

68
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,480
something we're

69
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:17,039
practicing

70
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:32,919
freedom doesn't mean

71
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:36,519
we make the

72
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:47,880
shot but we

73
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:02,158
practice doesn't mean we

74
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:11,840
pretend to like what we don't like or be okay with what doesn't feel

75
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:16,960
okay but we

76
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,120
practice we rehearse our own

77
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
freedom

78
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:21,519
okay folks that's good to sit with you

79
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,960
um so yesterday was um

80
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:33,799
effort and effortlessness and uh the effort the

81
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:40,080
effort that we make and and the the kind of momentum of

82
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:47,480
goodness I don't know whether it's momentum or inertia somebody once harass me about that I'm

83
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:53,480
not sure which kind of stand metaphorical

84
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:59,159
here uh but

85
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:07,440
today today uh disenchantment disenchantment with uh samsara and uh

86
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,559
the abiding care for the World

87
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:19,840
engagement and so the um the Buddhist path uh

88
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:25,200
really it begins with a recognition of the vulnerability of The Human Condition

89
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:32,159
aging sickness death they kind of like the dimension of human life that is sort

90
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:38,720
of defenseless and that's generally

91
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:44,919
construed as a problem to be solved a kind of condition to be

92
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:51,679
exited and it's probably underemphasized in a lot of modern articulations of

93
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:58,360
Dharma but a lot of the sutas the sense of of um something

94
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:07,360
like get me out of here is too much and it was and it is and

95
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:14,039
it's very understandable that uh one

96
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:22,919
might be dissatisfied with uh the intensity of of even a fortunate very

97
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:28,600
fortunate life um

98
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:36,039
so the the kind of instruction curiously is to stay very

99
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:42,240
deeply with sensory experience as I was instructing in the

100
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,360
The Meditation to stay deeply with sensory experience but that when we stay

101
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:54,399
that deeply it actually takes us out of the ordinary sensory

102
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,320
world famous from right

103
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,679
B uh when when uh in the scene is merely

104
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:15,279
the seen and and it goes on and the cognized Really the co is merely the cognized then you will not be with

105
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:23,919
that when you're not with that you will not be in that when Bia you are not in

106
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:33,720
that then bahah you will be NE Nei here nor Beyond nor in between the two just

107
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,000
this is the end of

108
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:48,279
suffering um a lot to say about that um but this

109
00:33:48,279 --> 00:33:54,960
this way in which our immersion into sensory experience uh gives us a kind of

110
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:01,880
foothold uh outside it that's one way of dealing with the

111
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,960
intensity the vulnerability of The Human Condition uh modern interpretations of

112
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:14,158
insight practice uh often celebrate

113
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,440
vulnerability and it's Associated duty to

114
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:29,440
care uh the way that just perceiving vulnerability opens our heart right it's

115
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:38,839
um uh yeah it's um takes a very Harden heart to see

116
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:44,638
vulnerability and exercise cruelty or something like

117
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:52,000
this so we're in the kind of like early phases really of extrapolating a lay

118
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,440
path from a monastic tradition so are we are we renouncing

119
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:03,839
samsara are we redeeming samsara are we doing

120
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:10,359
both can can uh a kind of

121
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:16,279
disenchantment and love of The Human Condition fit

122
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:23,160
together so on the disenchantment side we do have

123
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:30,359
this um this deep conditioning that there's something we could acquire something we could

124
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:35,480
acquire that might resolve all of our

125
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,880
longings the Buddha says

126
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:49,079
no no there's a way that um until we some

127
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:56,839
some part of us gives up on the world we're always um expecting more than the

128
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:03,440
the world can give us Oh's expecting the things of the world to

129
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:11,520
give us more than they can and we don't grow much on the path

130
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,640
unless there's some measure of renouncing the

131
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:25,800
world s Vega that kind of I spoke about this uh the the dayong at IRC couple

132
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:32,160
weeks ago um there are just too many kind of toys

133
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:39,839
and bells and promises and distractions for our spiritual practice

134
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:46,200
to take root unless there's some sense of just like my longings will not be

135
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:54,599
satiated by this world by sensory

136
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:03,000
experience so from Tanis biku uh s Vega was what the

137
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:08,319
Young Prince at artha felt on his first exposure to aging illness and death it's

138
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:15,240
a hard word to translate because it covers such a complex range at least three clusters of

139
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:21,240
feeling at once the oppressive sense of shock dismay and alienation that come

140
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:27,400
from realizing the futility and meaninglessness of life as it's normally lived

141
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:33,640
a chastening sense of our own complacency and foolishness in having let ourselves live so

142
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:39,839
unconsciously and an anxious sense of urgency in trying to find a way out of the meaningless

143
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:46,880
cycle Buddhism not only is not only confident that it can handle feelings of

144
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:52,760
svea but it's also one of the few religions that actually cultivates them to a radical

145
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:58,720
extent its solution to the problems of Life demands so so much dedicated effort

146
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,319
that only strong s Vega will keep the practicing Buddhist from slipping back

147
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:07,800
into their old

148
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,200
ways we can be

149
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:23,079
um completely mesmerized by Sam Sara's shell

150
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:28,119
game from Cradle to grave

151
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:33,119
just looking looking

152
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:38,119
looking where is it where's my

153
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:47,760
life we can be um perpetually enticed into just the fixing and achieving and

154
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:54,920
becoming acquiring owning and then it's time to

155
00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:02,119
die and everything broken it cannot be fixed and nothing is

156
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:11,280
owned aan suito said the hardest thing for a human being is what's

157
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,400
enough because you can always want

158
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:22,640
more and so there is this movement in spiritual practice this kind of Turning

159
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:28,880
Away the Dharma is not something for nothing it's

160
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:38,839
not and this is this is a measure of

161
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,400
disenchantment and yet the pivot here the yet

162
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,559
yet we only want to escape some

163
00:39:51,560 --> 00:40:01,200
sorrow because we care so much about suffering uing our own that of

164
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:07,680
others we care so much about it

165
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,680
and maybe the kind of movement of becoming disenchanted we turn away from

166
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:20,720
the world because well at least I can uh free my own heart that's maybe what I

167
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:27,119
can manage and that's true that's true 600

168
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:33,880
BC that's true now but times are different now it's not 600

169
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:40,599
BC and uh in a way

170
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:46,720
technology science has scaled our defilements but also our

171
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,720
parames it's made us obviously like profound existential threat to our own

172
00:40:53,720 --> 00:41:00,800
existence but it's also developed you know um our goodness in

173
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:07,839
amazing ways we have tremendous power to engage and help others we

174
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:15,680
understand uh our bodies in like incredibly nuanced ways right I was I

175
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:21,000
was at a um lecture conversation on on uh just a

176
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:27,720
couple days ago Monday night and uh like learning about kind of glob Health

177
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:33,960
conversation and um I I diarrhea is still like the cause

178
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:44,480
of death for several hundred, kids less than five you know and um oral oral

179
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:51,880
rehydration solution kits with with with zinc cost about $3 to deliver and you do

180
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:58,599
some math you do some kind of medical statistics and analysis and um if you

181
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:04,400
treat several hundred kids with severe diarrheal disease you'll save a life

182
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:12,078
yeah cost about $2,000 is the estimate yeah and

183
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:18,200
um so what am I supposed to do with that you

184
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:23,520
know renounce some Sara go back to

185
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:31,039
meditating fiddle with the OA cesas you

186
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:42,720
know the middle path uh the middle path between everything means everything and

187
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,440
nothing means anything

188
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:55,119
and as we actually loosen the grip on the world this actually dramatizes the

189
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:02,079
plight of humanity as we get Space through a measure of

190
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:10,720
disenchantment and letting go that space comes to be filled with

191
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:19,599
care and our gestures of love will not turn Sam Sora into a Utopia the first

192
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:25,559
Noble Truth will never be eradicated but yeah this little patch of

193
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:31,960
suffering I want to care for

194
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:43,160
that again uh this from Ria Kong uh when I think about the sadness of the world

195
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:49,920
their sadness becomes mine oh that my priest's robe were wide

196
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,079
enough to gather up all the suffering people in this floating

197
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:02,800
world and we know the robe will uh

198
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:07,920
never be wide enough but

199
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,599
uh that it were

200
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:19,200
so and so one foot out of this world and

201
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:25,000
one foot uh really really in

202
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
it

203
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:37,200
I offer this for your uh consideration and

204
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,800
uh we'll be back tomorrow

205
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:48,400
probably sorry for any confusion about the stream it keeps defaulting to to a

206
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:55,680
private stream so apologize if there's any confusion and uh May uh may we all

207
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:01,000
have uh um a good day of uh practice in the

208
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:08,480
broadest sense of that word okay
