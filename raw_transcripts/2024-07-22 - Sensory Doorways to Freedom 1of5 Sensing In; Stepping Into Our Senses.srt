14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,840

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:45,479
around notice where you are check out any objects in the

16
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,438
distance softening your

17
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,799
eyes and then whenever you're ready closing your

18
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:04,000
eyes perhaps imagining and being open and receptive as if

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:12,160
you're taking in a broad Vista a mountain range or

20
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:22,879
ocean and then allowing your face to relax maybe a

21
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:31,000
smile on your lips and noticing for a moment

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,020
moment hearing any ambient sounds in your room or the space that you're

23
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,099
[Music]

24
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:53,200
in taking a breath or two turning off any devices that might

25
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,760
want to distract you during this time as I just did

26
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,000
and then noticing too the weight of your body in the

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,280
cushion or chair or whatever surface you're resting

28
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:26,040
on grounding in the sensations of this body

29
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,000
grounding in a sense of

30
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:47,159
place noticing any warmth or cool moisture or

31
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:58,319
dryness maybe cloth on your skin

32
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,079
and then tuning into the internal

33
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,519
sensations of your

34
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,400
body allowing inviting whatever is there just

35
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,880
as it is this morning or this day this evening for you

36
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,800
can be helpful to intentionally invite in two or three

37
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,759
deeper slower longer

38
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:00,720
breaths and the tuning tuning into

39
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:07,400
the movement of the breath in the belly or the diaphragm the

40
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:22,520
chest a signal these deeper breaths that it's time to

41
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,759
practice and and allowing the breathing to be

42
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,160
natural however it is

43
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:56,960
today continuing to attune to the felt sensations of each

44
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,879
breath or rising of each sound each

45
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,199
sensation knowing an INB breath as an in

46
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:25,599
breath an out breath as an out breath

47
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,280
rather than it being a checklist of INB breath and out

48
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,638
breath abiding in resting on all of the

49
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:03,360
details the beginning middle and end of an

50
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,800
inhale then the

51
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,919
release at the

52
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,400
exhale notice sing a long breath as a long

53
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,360
breath a short breath as a short

54
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:54,560
breath staying in contact

55
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,280
staying close attentive to your experience

56
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:42,320
you find your attention called by a sensation a

57
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:49,560
sound thought emotion it's

58
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:57,600
fine attending to it as something emerging In This Moment

59
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:07,039
and then when it's not so predominant so [Music]

60
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,160
strong returning the attention to your primary anchor or

61
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:23,920
object breathing body this here now

62
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:41,480
allowing then and there to fade to the

63
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,680
periphery the background

64
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:25,680
we'll practice mosto in silence a few comments here and there

65
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,320
until 7:30 half after the hour

66

you find yourself distracted the invitation

70
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,480
is to appreciate the return of

71
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:55,000
awareness noticing distraction is a moment of

72
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:02,800
mindfulness returning the attention to the sensory

73
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,279

and in the final moment or two of this meditation

105
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,559
the invitation is to turn your attention to

106
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:07,880
your emotional Center your

107
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,240

them from that

114
00:28:52,120 --> 00:29:00,039
place holding any moments of challenge or difficulty with care

115
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,840
nothing left out everything

116
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:17,760
included and then turning your internal gaze

117
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,640
outwards to the others your life touches

118
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:33,880
and if it feels right forming the wish that they may benefit

119
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,440
too from this

120
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,039
practice may all beings everywhere

123
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,960
that's e

124
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:50,279
a warm welcome to those of you who tiptoed into the YouTube sit a little

125
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:58,639
bit late and a warm welcome to those of you who came early who've been here all along so

126
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:06,639
happy to be with you today for those of you who missed my brief introduction my name is Da Neil

127
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:13,399
and um from time to time I I help to cover this sit when Gil is away he's off

128
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:21,360
hiking with his wife this week so mudita for him and he will return next week so

129
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:26,840
um this week I'm going to introduce and

130
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:34,919
explore some teachings of the Buddha that are helpful both for total beginners experienced beginners and for

131
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:40,519
those with a lot of depth in meditation those who've thoroughly immersed

132
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:46,399
themselves in the Stream of the Dharma these practices are

133
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:53,080
simple and they work well in daily life and they work well in formal meditation

134
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:59,039
sting meditation so the invitation is to step

135
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:05,799
into your senses this week and hang out there they can be doorways to Greater

136
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:12,080
ease Clarity vibrancy Vitality Freedom

137
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,960
wisdom and I'd like to first introduce them with something we don't do very

138
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:25,919
often do occasionally in this 7 a.m. sit which is a bit of a guided visualization

139
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:32,240
and don't worry if you don't visualize just imagine that you do and kind of follow

140
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:37,639
along so you can close your eyes if you like

141
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:46,639
it's helpful and imagine that you're in a beautiful Forest on a warm comfortable

142
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:53,440
day safe and dry under an overhang on a hill bit of a

143
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:02,120
Vista and as you're there a rainstorm gentle rain starts to sweep

144
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:09,158
through the forest you can hear it off in the distance it comes

145
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:16,720
closer the moisture in the air changes notice what you

146
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:22,679
feel on your skin as the air is heavy with

147
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,358
moisture and water emerges

148
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:37,720
notice what is seen maybe the vibrancy of verdant

149
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:44,839
greens the movement of leaves the pureness of

150
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:58,040
water noticing not just hearing perhaps the wide swath of the rain coming in

151
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:07,680
how the individual drops might sound on leaf or ground or

152
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,440
Branch noticing any

153
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:26,040
smells and then stepping out if you wish from the

154
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:33,320
overhang to feel the gentle drops of rain on face maybe on

155
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:39,680
your [Music] tongue how it feels maybe

156
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:50,960
tastes noticing any emotions

157
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:56,160
present pleasantness or unpleasantness

158
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:05,520
and noticing the knowing the awareness of it

159
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:17,079
all so letting go of that coming back to the present

160
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:23,880
moment and noticing too that all of what just occurred

161
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,559
however it occurred for you happened in the mind

162
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:36,440
our phenomenal capacity to imagine to think to conceptualize

163
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:44,520
perhaps visualize so I mention this because the

164
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:50,920
Buddha found the mind so powerful in its influence on our experience that he

165
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:56,960
actually considered it a sense doorway a sense in its own

166
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:06,200
right in the Buddhist teachings there are six senses not five and the mind is the

167
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:12,880
Sixth and informs shapes often distracts from the other five the

168
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:20,279
classic ones we all know sight hearing smell taste and Body

169
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,920
Sensations collectively all six of these are known as the six sent doors or

170
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:32,280
doorways Gates bases Fields I'm using different

171
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:39,119
translations of the poly and they're all together part of mindfulness of the

172
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:45,920
body so rather than spending a day on each sense this week I'm going to offer

173
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:53,280
different access points through them to Greater presence ease

174
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,440
freedom and they are this is a simple practice

175
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,960
in fact at the moment you may be experiencing this sense of hearing the garbage truck in front of my

176
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:15,480
apartment noticing the effect of

177
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,760
sound through each sense

178
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:34,599
are kind of an access point or a portal

179
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:42,480
to a greater sense of being present being free from the habitual responses

180
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:49,839
stories chatter of our minds they portals away from the virtual

181
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:58,400
reality that so often happens within and ways of being in the world

182
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,440
inhabiting the world in a more profound simple

183
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,839
satisfying way neurologists call the ability to

184
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,440
step away from the mind

185
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:21,240
decentering decentering which means not being centered in our own

186
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:28,960
stories not being centered in the default Network that's often chatter and

187
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:37,200
self-judgment or other judgment stories that tend to take us away from being

188
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:45,440
happy simple content present so they're a powerful Ally in

189
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:51,520
mindfulness practice and in presence in life and today now that I've given this

190
00:39:51,520 --> 00:40:00,318
little overview I'd like to just talk about stepping into the senses is immersing

191
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:07,079
yourself which is as I said very simple it involves choosing to attend to to

192
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:13,440
ground in sensory experience one of their bodily

193
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,359
senses we'll start with seeing so if you have your eyes closed that's fine you can leave them

194
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:24,520
closed and notice the variation of light

195
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:31,400
and texture on your eyelids the darks and lights that are already

196
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:37,200
present there that already is shifting into the sense of seeing and

197
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:43,839
many of you have your eyes open can notice the environment perhaps the

198
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:50,000
screen but rather than tuning into the objects on the screen or in your

199
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:57,040
environment noticing color form shape

200
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:04,359
tuning into the texture of the moment artists visual creatives of all kinds do

201
00:41:04,359 --> 00:41:09,599
this all the time it doesn't have to be anything

202
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:17,280
special it's also possible to attend to What's called the visual field

203
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:23,520
itself the receptive way of seeing rather than looking

204
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:31,200
at and it's process of letting the world come to you I first noticed this many

205
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:39,240
years before I started meditating I was an avid scuba diver and snorkler and being in the water immersed in the water

206
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:45,440
there was something about that that felt almost like being in this

207
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:53,720
receptive broad way of seeing and allowed this vibrancy of

208
00:41:53,720 --> 00:42:01,079
color shape form this feeling of presence with the world to be

209
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:06,880
there but we can also be immersed in daily life walking around the block

210
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,160
taking a hike gardening whatever it is even

211
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:18,800
cleaning the house allowing the sense of sight to be receptive almost like we're

212
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:24,720
being a a submarine walking through life and there's a way of doing this I

213
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,960
learned many years ago in taii which is to invite this receptivity of

214
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:37,559
the visual field which is you can start with your hands together and you're look seeing your hands but seeing the area

215
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:43,440
around them I'm modeling this as best I can on the screen moving them apart and you can start wiggling your fingers a

216
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,800
little and go broader and broader and broader out back towards your

217
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:56,440
ears noticing where you're no longer able to see the movement in your

218
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:01,720
peripheral vision and then allowing the eyes to remain

219
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:07,280
soft like that rather than looking at any one

220
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:14,520
thing noticing seeing in a receptive Gentle

221
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:22,200
Way this can happen with hearing noticing hearing the sound of my voice or ambient

222
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:27,680
sounds smell or taste are not always accessible you may notice the the smell

223
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:35,359
of something baking or cooking or brewing in the distance and then there's B

224
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:42,319
sensation which many of the guided meditations in this now multi-year

225
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:47,440
series cover that all of these are

226
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:54,920
invitations to immersion in the moment so this

227
00:43:54,920 --> 00:44:00,240
week today grounding in your

228
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,760
senses and if you would like to do some homework between now and tomorrow

229
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:13,640
morning the invitation is to in your daily life take a few sensory immersion

230
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:22,720
breaks and just notice seeing hearing smelling tasting sensing as

231
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,880
such it's easy to do it's portable you can do it while walking around daily

232
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:35,079
life activities and if you like notice which senses

233
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:42,440
bring you here and present in an easeful way and which do you tend to

234
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:49,280
ignore so the invitation to sensory

235
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:57,240
emersion look forward to hearing what you notice tomorrow and we'll see you then

236
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:04,960
be well stay present and enjoy your practice
