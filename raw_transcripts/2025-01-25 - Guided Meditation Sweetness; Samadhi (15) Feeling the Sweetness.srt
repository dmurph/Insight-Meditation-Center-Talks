1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:09,840
hello and welcome to this Friday meditation session and

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,039
um to say a few words preparing us for the

3
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:22,000
meditation um the the phrase for today is that

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,599
samadi is sweetness that samadi has a kind of

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:34,600
sweet quality to it and maybe in case the word sweetness doesn't have such

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:42,760
positive associations with you as it does for me the uh there are other words that uh

7
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,559
speak to the goodness that comes with somebody it can be um there can be a

8
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:58,440
feeling of beauty and um feelings of beauty that come with it

9
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,799
more classically people talk about there being Joy

10
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:11,080
gladness um happiness sometimes Bliss a more simple and maybe a little

11
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:19,680
more humble way of saying the same words is there can be pleasure that somebody is uh involves

12
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,360
pleasure that something starts becoming very pleasant as the state of Som begins

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,479
to develop and at first it might be something very specific

14
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,640
like um uh there might be a a feeling of pleasure and that seems to radiate or

15
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,320
come with the experience of breathing sometimes the experience of breathing can feel like it's just

16
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,920
beautiful there's a beauty to it it could be that there's a tingling

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,520
and warmth and joy may be kind of similar to what happened if you uh had a

18
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,880
half smile and a little bit of you know turned up the corners of your

19
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:10,560
mouth there might be a little bit of H kind of delight that physical Delight that appears maybe in the eyes or

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,879
the the cheeks or someplace so this idea of I'm calling

21
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:21,959
its sweetness today and that sweetness can start to be pervasive and the

22
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:29,680
sweetness becomes a um feedback loop where we feel the sweetness of somadi

23
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,640
and and allowing yourself to feel that and we're allowed to feel it we're allowed to feel the pleasure the joy

24
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:43,920
that comes with somebody and we're allowed to feel it and uh and it becomes kind of a biof

25
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,680
feedback uh uh that goes on where we feel it and it going to be there to to

26
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,560
help us to stay focused keep doing what we're doing so we can keep growing and

27
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:02,800
developing uh the um and then the second thing to say we

28
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,400
start now in the Chinese when they when Buddhism arrived in China and they had

29
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:17,120
to translate indic Buddhist text into Chinese uh the way that they

30
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,640
translated uh uh samata vipasana samadi

31
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,959
vipasana is concentration the word they use the word stop and for vipasana

32
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:38,560
insight they use the word c so together the practice of samata vasana is to stop

33
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:46,280
and see so there's something about about samadi that does involve a kind of a

34
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:52,040
stopping and a stopping which is a relief a stopping which is Pleasant this

35
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,959
feels good oh I'm here I don't have to do anything anymore

36
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:05,079
I don't have to keep accomplishing or proving myself or I don't have to I don't have to finish my to-do list I

37
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:12,079
don't have to you know for these minutes of meditation of samadi it's a it's a

38
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,359
radically alternative way of being alive Fully Alive

39
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:23,160
here without needing to accomplish anything just to be here let everything

40
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,360
all the accomplishing doing activities stop so with

41
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,758
that to assume a meditation

42
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:42,560
posture that is in in a way the beginning of

43
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,639
stopping a clear sense that now we're not going to be doing the activities of

44
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:57,080
daily life it's a time for a sacred

45
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:04,960
pause for something that's more important invaluable and it's a maybe you can feel

46
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,360
the relief of stopping to just

47
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,038
be in this

48
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,600
posture and for these minutes in meditation the only person who is going

49
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,520
to be talking is me so there for all of

50
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:41,560
you you can you can stop the ordinary maybe activity of

51
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:48,000
talking and so something gets quiet maybe it feels like a

52
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,560
relief or maybe not

53
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,840
and there can be appreciating stopping of needing to think about things and solve

54
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:14,280
things and to feel the relief that now nothing needs to be

55
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,199
accomplished including accomplishing

56
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:30,039
meditation and to feel the relief the goodness of just being alive As You Are

57
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:39,440
and is there somewhere inside some sweetness some

58
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,759
goodness some maybe very subtle

59
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:50,199
pleasure somewhere for just simply being alive

60
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:53,759
and awake and

61
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,840
present and and

62
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:13,639
gently breathing in in a deeper way to feel your body more

63
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,080
fully and as you exhale to

64
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,560
relax relaxing the body

65
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,960
and relaxing is more a stopping of something than a

66
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,440
doing of something it's the stopping of being

67
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,639
tense of holding the muscles

68
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,080
tight and as you relax the

69
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,560
body if there's any kind of anything that approaches pleasure in that

70
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:10,360
relaxing in the midst of the relaxing feel that pleasure or feel that

71
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:26,960
goodness letting your breathing return to normal

72
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,959
and as you breathe in feel some place in your body that's

73
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:43,518
tight the muscles are tense little and gently on the

74
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:53,360
exhale soften relax if it doesn't relax soften around

75
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,600
it make space for it

76
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:09,160
and if there's any subtle pleasure in that or relief in that

77
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,759
just feel that

78
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:48,839
and if there is now any feeling of sweetness or goodness relief or

79
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,399
pleasure just sitting here without needing to accomplish

80
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,079
anything just being here

81
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,880
allow your breathing to be in the middle of that

82
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:14,000
sweetness breathing with it through it

83
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,040
and in a way that you stay with a natural enough enough

84
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:48,440
breathing if there's any small tiny ways you can adjust your

85
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:54,480
breathing so that it's more pleasant there's more pleasure in any part of the

86
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:01,839
breathing or if there's already some pleasure in

87
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,279
breathing feel

88
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:15,480
it some people will feel certain pleasure goodness or

89
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,120
relief during the

90
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:27,600
exhale some people in the inhale

91
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,680
some people in the pause if there is a pause

92
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,760
at the end of the exhale

93
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:11,639
as you breathe breathe with whatever pleasure

94
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:18,120
sweetness there might be here maybe one that's very

95
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:23,920
closely related to doing almost

96
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:30,000
nothing the relief the pleasure of just being

97
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:40,279
just being with something so simple and fundamental as breathing

98
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:12,880
for some people the pleasure might come from the gentle rhythm of breathing in

99
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:20,079
and breathing out maybe like being

100
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,920
comforted gently rocking in a rocking chair

101
00:13:52,160 --> 00:14:00,440
and sometimes the sweetness related to breathing

102
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:07,120
is just beyond the edges of the sensations of breathing so in the

103
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,399
body maybe almost like radiating from

104
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:20,680
breathing the influence that breathing has in the areas close in

105
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:25,920
around what is moving as you breathe

106
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,920
the area of space

107
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,880
spaciousness maybe the spaciousness that's

108
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:55,440
here as a kind of pleasure or relief has space for joy

109
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,759
and if you need to let go of your thinking and relax your thinking

110
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:24,800
mind let go so that awareness drops into the

111
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,880
sweetness in your body connected to

112
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,079
the

113
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:44,759
meditation Relax The Thinking mind to feel the

114
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,040
pleasure of

115
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:06,519
relaxing letting the thinking mind be quiet so that you can better

116
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:13,720
feel the sweetness of being present here and

117
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,319
now breathing one breath at a

118
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
time

119
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

120
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

121
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

122
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

123
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

124
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
for

125
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

126
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

127
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600

e e

129
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:23,480
and if there's anything that resembles sweetness

130
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:32,840
pleasure contentment as you're sitting Med as you're

131
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,080
meditating let that be an

132
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,440
encouragement for the mind to be

133
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:57,240
quieter and the body to be more open

134
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:07,120
to the experience of breathing and the experience of

135
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,480
sweetness however

136
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
subtle

137
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

138
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

139
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,360
e for

140
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:47,240
there's an art to feeling the sweetness the

141
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,039
goodness that's here and within

142
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:59,799
it allowing whatever is not sweet not pleasant

143
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:07,600
to float to be there in the background to

144
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:13,559
not zero in or fixate on what is

145
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:21,120
difficult but allow it to float in a wider

146
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:27,720
ocean of the sweetness of meditation

147
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:37,440
that's gently massaged or by the breathing

148
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,240
and then as we come to the end of the

149
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,320
sitting to you begin to feel

150
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,360
whatever sweetness goodness calm

151
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:40,360
relief pleasure contentment

152
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:47,880
wellbeing however small to sense and feel into how it is

153
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:54,360
right now for you and your body your heart your

154
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:03,919
mind maybe having some sense that it can radiate out into the spaciousness the

155
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:10,039
space around you even if it's just an inch beyond

156
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:12,320
your

157
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:23,799
body that somehow imagine that your goodness your

158
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:31,559
sweetness is something that you can transmit to

159
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:40,278
others not what you say not what you do but how you

160
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:50,399
are to share the sweet feelings you have letting it radiate out into the

161
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:57,518
world and imagine that's your gift today to the world

162
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:05,120
whatever goodness whatever pleasure

163
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:12,600
well-being that comes from meditation comes from being Mindful and

164
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:20,159
present may that be a gift that somehow is

165
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:25,760
transmitted [Music] somehow

166
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,640
radiated out into the world for the people that you'll

167
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,679
encounter may it be that how you are

[Music]

172
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:24,039
free thank you

173
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,960
e

174
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:41,960
so welcome to this 15th talk on samadi this ongoing

175
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,960
samadi series and uh one of the things that

176
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:54,679
this week perhaps you would have noticed is how seldom I use the word

177
00:31:54,679 --> 00:32:02,519
concentration and uh and in the kind of phrase that I use for each day this

178
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:10,799
week the quality that's being emphasized is not concentration so samadi

179
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:17,000
is uh Simplicity somebody is

180
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,000
subtleness somebody is steadiness sadii is

181
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,840
spaciousness and today samadi is sweet

182
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:36,279
and um and so maybe the closest thing to concentration in those five is

183
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:44,159
steadiness but you you know to be steady with your presence Be steady in your uh

184
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:52,880
in your awareness To Be steady here with the practice and these uh five

185
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:59,519
qualities uh don't have to be separate they can be part of the same state that

186
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:06,559
we're in we can be sitting in a state of Simplicity where meditation is not

187
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:14,000
something complicated it's not an engineering feat it's not a complicated thing to do it's uh almost like an

188
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,600
undoing a not doing more than it is a doing and that it is

189
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:28,440
um settling a settling into something and not a concentrating

190
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:34,480
on something and it might be that the consequence of settling is that we

191
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,480
settle so fully in a relaxed full way that the world around the place we

192
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,760
settle um kind of Falls away or recedes into the diff distance and it's almost

193
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:52,240
as if we're concentrating on the subtle place but rather than poking it with

194
00:33:52,240 --> 00:34:02,159
from the control tower it's more like we've settled into it like we would settle in into um you know a nice soft

195
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:08,638
mattress or on top of a mattress but it's a nice comforter that we lay down

196
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:14,638
in it just feels so good to settle into that and we're fully completely here in

197
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,240
that small little world where the body touches the comforter in the bed and the

198
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:26,800
rest of the world Falls away you could say we're concentrated there but um but

199
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:34,520
the to con concentrate on that experience for some people immediately gets us tense to strain or gets us in

200
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:40,079
the control tower but to settle into it becomes something that becomes embodied

201
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:48,240
something that's includes all the whole body it's the fullness of it this steadiness holding

202
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,560
steady um there's something in us that I think loves being steady it's kind of

203
00:34:53,560 --> 00:35:00,440
like a commitment or a devotion or a or Simplicity of being just

204
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:07,760
this because when we're steady something can relax into it settle into it um I

205
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:14,640
love to go hiking and there's H sometimes as we go hiking used to be this when I went run used to run if I

206
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:21,560
just keep walking steadily at some point um kind of something settles in me I I

207
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:29,720
arrive and I'm just there in the walking steady in the walking but I have to walk steadily for the Gathering of my all the

208
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:36,760
different parts of myself where the the distracted mind concerns of the day fall away and I'm just steady it's kind of

209
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:42,040
like the steadiness allows something to gather around

210
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:47,320
it spaciousness is such an important quality for somebody because to have a

211
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:55,680
sense of being spacious open lots of openness makes room for the sweetness

212
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:00,760
that can arise in somebody and maybe some of you don't care for the

213
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:08,560
word sweetness but in somadi they uh there is a pleasure there

214
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:14,119
is um uh there is a sense of

215
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:21,240
well-being there is uh for me one of the most wonderful words for the state of

216
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:26,880
Som is beauty there's a feeling of a beautiful state that kind of radiates

217
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:33,880
out or the breathing has gotten quite beautiful and it kind of radiates a sense of beauty into the

218
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:41,560
body um the most classic uh way of talking about it is uh there's joy and

219
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:48,640
happiness some people add the word gladness so it's kind of like each of those is a deeper and Fuller

220
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,359
experience uh that's more and more satisfying and some people use the word

221
00:36:54,359 --> 00:37:01,800
satisfy and there's a feeling of satisfaction at this it's really good here and um and some people may be like

222
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:07,480
the word goodness this feels good sometimes I've like the word

223
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:14,800
health because the settling into a good state of Sade feels like an embodiment

224
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:21,119
of Health even at times when I've been sick uh if I could settle into samadi

225
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,520
Sadi state it just feels like I'm there's this healing energy that courses

226
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:34,119
through the body just feel so good the healthiness the health of it so

227
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:39,640
um um so I'm not saying that this is easy

228
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:46,240
and I'm not saying that it should happen today or tomorrow but this is one of the characteristics of

229
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:53,040
samadi and so as we and so as we settle into it the practice it's good to start

230
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:59,200
becoming uh sensitive aware when some of these good feelings to be terrorise

231
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,280
these are these are good feelings which are symptoms of

232
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:12,359
samadi and um and one of the reason one of the interesting things in the teachings of the Buddha is that uh he

233
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:19,880
puts uh uh happiness as a precursor for

234
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:26,880
somebody and uh you know it's a little bit odd to say that because many people

235
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,119
are suffering a lot and they're meditating in order to not suffer so

236
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:40,960
much or to be free of their suffering to work through it and now to have somebody you have to be be happy to begin with um

237
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,480
but um we always have the mindfulness practice to fall back to and you know

238
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,440
for five years now on YouTube the primary practice I've been teaching is mindfulness so for those of you been

239
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:59,800
following you can always uh the recourse is to go back to just being mindful of the experience until something settles

240
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:07,960
and you feel like you're able to be present with what's happening in a simpler way and then you can develop uh

241
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:14,400
this quality of samadi this primary focus and a lot of sbody has to do with

242
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:20,720
having a primary focus of attention a primary place to

243
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:26,280
settle a primary place to um be uh at

244
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:33,960
home and to be to relax and to to um to um and and is

245
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,480
this kind of being being absorb the idea is moving into kind of to be absorbed in the

246
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:47,640
experience and maybe you could have as a reference point uh something you do in your life that you get absorbed enough

247
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:55,560
into that you feel a kind of well-being in doing it all the the difficult

248
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:02,839
thoughts and difficult feelings that in life have fallen away as we do this simple thing that we get absorbed in

249
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:08,359
doing for some people it's reading a book some people it's doing a craft or

250
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:13,400
playing an instrument some people it's feels really just going into a

251
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:19,119
shower um lets everything else fall away and just nice to be in the shower and

252
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,560
some people start singing in the shower uh it might be being with a

253
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:32,119
friend that uh does that and may walk in the park or um listening to music for

254
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:39,160
some people can do it so there's might be something that you already do that gives you a sense of what it's like to

255
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:45,480
have these uh qualities of this week of um Simplicity becoming simple just to

256
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:51,440
listen to the music just to do this one thing uh where there's a a subtleness in

257
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:58,680
it where're we're not preoccupied and agitated by other things just here with this where there's a steadiness and

258
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:04,560
absorption like this here and that uh there is a spaciousness

259
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:11,240
around it because we're not limited ourselves in kind a tight way but we're relaxing into think something something

260
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:18,119
opens as we get and sometimes with somebody things will get smaller and

261
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:24,920
more more narrow first before the spaciousness opens up so don't look for

262
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:32,040
spaciousness too early just when it starts becoming available and then um partly I'm

263
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:41,280
choosing the word sweetness because it has an s in it to be complete for the week I think that um if I wasn't for

264
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:49,720
the wanting to stay with 's uh I probably would have chosen Beauty for

265
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:55,240
myself so um

266
00:41:55,319 --> 00:42:00,960
um so uh these are some of the characteristics

267
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:08,000
of somadi and not necessarily easy to tap into or

268
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,040
touch into but they can be very subtle and if we have it already a disposition

269
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:21,160
in the mind to orient ourselves to what's difficult Orient ourselves around our problems Orient ourselves

270
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:27,440
around the the pain we have or something sometimes inadvertedly

271
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:35,200
that's actually where the samama is going that's where the concentration is going to those things and if we go

272
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:43,800
concentrate on things this way where there's a fear or aversion or um

273
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:49,520
something that is not so healthy um that focus on the problems actually can make

274
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:57,200
the difficulty feel worse not to ignore it but it's possible to with some to sh

275
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:05,119
shift the primary focus to breathing to the settling place to settle to keep

276
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,640
settling and until uh and knowing that you're not betraying the difficulties

277
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:17,400
you have but you're placing them in a different context and uh and it's a really a

278
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:24,119
delight to be able to sit in a state of some state of goodness state of health

279
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:30,880
where the difficulties we have might be just they're just like um um jellyfish

280
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:37,960
floating in the vast ocean they aren't the ocean and um and uh so they're there

281
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:44,200
and they're recognized but they're being held by the goodness of

282
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:52,119
somebody so uh so finally I'd like to say that um for next week I won't be

283
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:59,000
here and I think Kim Allen will come and uh and uh I think it's Kim will come and

284
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,880
um and teach for you we have these wonderful teachers at IMC that can be my

285
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:13,078
substitutes and um and uh the

286
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:22,280
um I should probably be sure about this so that uh just out of respect for my

287
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:28,839
co-teachers that I have it right here we go

288
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:45,400
um oh no no I'm sorry uh next week it's Liz Liz Powell and a wonderful teacher

289
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:53,599
it lives in Colorado now and delighted that she's going to be here with you all so

290
00:44:53,599 --> 00:45:01,079
um so in the meantime um if uh the beginning of the week I

291
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:06,359
encourage you to count your breathing because that supports that can support the

292
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:12,160
steadiness and it can support all these qualities provided you find a really

293
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:21,000
nice way for the mind to do the counting gentle soft beautiful settled spacious

294
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:27,720
see if you can find a way to count and um and there are different ways of counting as I describ

295
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:32,760
um but if you find yourself being able to settle into the counting you might

296
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:39,960
see if counting from 1 to 10 and then Starting Over Again begins to uh support

297
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:45,079
this settling in the steadiness um that really brings you

298
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:50,559
getting starting getting absorbed in this experience of um breathing of

299
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:56,680
sama and I'll be back the following week and um I look forward to this quite a

300
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:02,440
bit to continue this and um now those of you who would

301
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:10,680
like uh we're going to uh have a zoom meeting for the for our community and

302
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:16,800
um and what that means is that uh I'll put a zoom link into

303
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,520

[Music]

323
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:14,659
[Music]

324
00:50:18,839 --> 00:50:21,839
okay

325
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:47,160
okay so let me see can um there's a lot of people who

326
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:53,680
I so it's the best so can you hear

327
00:50:53,680 --> 00:51:00,839
me yes wonderful oh so

328
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:09,160
I'm oh I know what I have to do I the technology of all

329
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:21,040
this okay no that's not what I want to do and I want to go this okay

330
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:33,319
okay so so you can hear me

331
00:51:33,319 --> 00:51:41,000
again so I left the YouTube on and so on my computer so the YouTube channel

332
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:48,920
was volume was on so I was hearing myself and uh so now we're just regular

333
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:54,200
zoom and the people on who are stayed on YouTube should be able to hear and and

334
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:59,280
watch me at least so it's best I think given uh so many

335
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:06,480
people that we you keep your uh yourself muted unless you're going to speak and

336
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:12,000
um so I think what we'll do today is uh I'll take some questions hear from all

337
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,040
the some of you and uh we'll do a breakout group and at some point there

338
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:25,440
maybe be before we do the breakout group I have some announcements to be make to make and uh that's relevant for us and

339
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:31,200
then um then we'll do the breakout group and and maybe time for more

340
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:36,640
questions and the the function of the breakout groups is just uh for a chance

341
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:43,839
maybe somewhat random but the chance for some of you to meet each other and uh have some personal conversations uh some

342
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:49,599
of you have been chatting um daily sometimes with uh on YouTube and it's

343
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:56,720
been lovely to see the warmth and the friendship and the care that goes into some of those chats as you communicate

344
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:02,480
with each other so um happy to have you here all

345
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:09,880
of you and uh is anyone who'd like to ask a question or make a comment and

346
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:15,440
ideally they'd be somewhat brief and um so we can have more chance for more

347
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:21,079
people to speak and uh the easiest way to do this I think is if you if you could raise

348
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:28,400
your Zoom hand because there's more tiles I won't be able to see everyone's um physical hand going up but if you

349
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:34,680
could do your uh you know the uh raise your hand and if you don't

350
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:41,880
know how to do that um some some some Zoom uh uh accounts have a on the on the

351
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:50,160
menu at the bottom of it there says raise hand sometimes you have to go to the reaction bar and find it I think so

352
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:56,720
uh oh Captain how nice delighted to see you

353
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:06,599
so let's see uh I can't oh no I have to try saying it again um can you hear me

354
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:12,040
yes yes I well thank you to Kil to you and to

355
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:19,920
everybody else um I live in the middle of the woods so this is a very uh special Community uh for me to feel

356
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:28,280
connected um I will try to keep it brief uh when I first got got back into

357
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:34,760
meditating um like a year and a half or so ago um I often felt more relaxed and

358
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:42,599
calm by the end um which was a lovely feeling um and now I noticed that a lot

359
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:48,520
of the time first of all it's much harder for me to settle um but also by

360
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:55,000
the end of it I often find that I'm experiencing more of uh the hindrance of

361
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,640
restlessness and wor rather than less like it sort of amps up over the session

362
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,799
and I feel like there must be something that I'm doing to sort of engage it

363
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:11,559
during the sit but I haven't been able to figure out what so I was wondering

364
00:55:11,559 --> 00:55:17,040
just if you had any thoughts or any suggestions or anything like that yes

365
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:25,039
thank you Captain the the the the general way that I view these things is

366
00:55:25,039 --> 00:55:30,720
that uh many people when they start meditating uh there's often beginner's

367
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:38,000
luck there's a kind of excitement there's more Focus because it's new and exciting and

368
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:45,400
um and uh and so uh people will um

369
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:52,760
uh let me hang on here um people will will get uh um you know

370
00:55:52,760 --> 00:56:00,559
so people can get pulled in a little bit quickly the other thing that can happen is that uh we're practicing well enough

371
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:05,799
that we're dropping into a deeper layer level of the Mind in our psychology and

372
00:56:05,799 --> 00:56:11,680
now it's time that something has to be addressed uh the analogy I use is uh if

373
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:20,480
you go into you know you go you move into a house that people who lived there before you never cleaned for

374
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:27,000
decades and uh and so the first thing you do is you can manage to in order to get in there you have to clean the the

375
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:34,000
entry hallway and you have you get it really clean it's nice it's easy to walk through and say oh this is good and then

376
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,240
you open the door to the living room and oh my this is like oh this is I'm G to

377
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:46,599
this is terrible how could it be so much to to be done um but actually you're making progress you've taken care of one

378
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:52,480
thing now you have to take care of the next room and many of us have a number of rooms that have been unattended and a

379
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:58,680
little bit messy that as we settle we're coming to that next next so that maybe

380
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:04,720
makes it a little bit easier to have a more positive view of the challenge you have sooner or later everyone who

381
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:11,720
meditates will be up against some challenge where they think they're going backwards and um and it's not you never

382
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:18,599
be I like to think we never go backwards and then the question is how do you how do you address this and meet

383
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:25,160
this and one way is to uh not be so concerned about the issue you had the

384
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:33,440
way you described it but rather uh what is your relationship to the issue and that might be the key thing to

385
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:43,039
focus on uh that you know there's all kinds of secondary um uh arrows we add to it that

386
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:49,799
that's more important to look at than the actual issue itself and um and in and if the second

387
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:55,520
Arrow stop then it might be fine to sit there with the challenge you know not so

388
00:57:55,520 --> 00:58:01,400
troubled by it it um and then maybe you can see it more clearly the other thing

389
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:06,680
is you call it a hindrance and we have these five hindrances that uh we do and

390
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:12,440
so you might want to go through carefully the five hindrance and see which one of them seems to be operating

391
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:18,240
or which ones some people have multiple hindrance attacks so you might have to kind of see

392
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:24,200
the number of ones but the first thing that occurred to me as you described what you there might be some degree of

393
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:32,000
Doubt playing itself out and so doubt is one of the hindrances and um and so if you want to

394
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:39,039
learn more about the hindrances you know in my teachings I have this book called unhindered that goes through them and I

395
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:45,480
did do I think I did Doh five days a week on the hindrances in December and

396
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:50,599
maybe it was a preparation for this uh this uh series on

397
00:58:50,599 --> 00:58:57,680
somebody so is that okay for now Captain give you something yes yes thank you so much and actually I just got your book

398
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:06,279
uh for the holidays excited to read it thank you very much thank you and then

399
00:59:06,599 --> 00:59:14,079
feather hi can you hear me yes great thank you and it's so wonderful to see

400
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:20,680
all these faces around the world so um Gil I love how at the end of every

401
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:29,000
meditation you invite us um to send Goodwill to all people and all beings

402
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:34,480
and that no one is excluded and that really really helps me settle and I find

403
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:40,200
that in my loving kindness meta it's quite easy for me to do that when I'm

404
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:46,760
sitting to send care to everyone yet at the same time I'm finding it really

405
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:55,839
difficult these days to witness suffering um in humans and in animals

406
00:59:55,839 --> 01:00:01,480
when when what I perceive is Injustice and what's everything that's happening in

407
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:09,599
the world and I'm super sensitive and I get activated so easily by hurt and so

408
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:14,640
I'm finding myself asking friends to not talk to me about politics and to stay

409
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:20,280
away from news and TV and social media and basically just be with my horse and

410
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:25,559
be in this community and just shut it all out so I'm wondering if you can

411
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:34,599
maybe say a word or two about how to practice with that yeah with that sensitivity to the world thank you yeah

412
01:00:34,599 --> 01:00:41,039
thank you so um I think the first thing to do is

413
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:47,480
to be very caring and respectful for how you are with all this without starting

414
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:52,920
there it's there not going to be much and so you know the uh so what is it in

415
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:59,680
since you started with the way I do the dedication at the end of the sitting to say that

416
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:04,880
um um uh what is it that you given this challenge you're

417
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:10,799
describing uh what in you needs loving kindness and

418
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:15,880
compassion and um you know maybe it's premature to do it for all beings

419
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:21,880
something in you needs to be attended to First and the chances are there's

420
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:28,440
something unresolved in you that needs to be recog recognized met loved cared

421
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:36,359
for understood because what you're describing I I don't know you except for this description you gave but I've seen

422
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:41,920
very very many times that when people have this level of

423
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:48,640
difficulty this level of difficulty let me see um if someone if if people don't

424
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:54,279
have their uh their microphone on mute I put it on speaker speaker phone on

425
01:01:54,279 --> 01:02:02,359
speaker view when uh when someone's asking a question and then I lose them if someone has a the

426
01:02:02,359 --> 01:02:08,559
microphone on yeah so no okay so

427
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:15,119
um uh so this when UNR so someone has something unre unresolved deep inside

428
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:20,400
then the suffering of the world uh touches that unresolved

429
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:25,440
place and uh and it kind it's kind of like putting a magnifying glass on

430
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:32,520
something a magnifying glass on the suffering of the world or a magnifying glass on our own heart the unresolved

431
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:42,920
emotional issues that are there and so they need to be cared for loved attended to in a wise caring way and sometimes uh

432
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:50,200
just sitting in meditation and being really present for these unresolved places of suffering uh is a way forward

433
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:55,480
to kind of work with it but sometimes that's a slow process and maybe not

434
01:02:55,480 --> 01:03:00,920
what's needed is to get some kind of uh ongoing support from some a loving

435
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:06,599
caring person who can really attend and support you and accompany you into this

436
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:12,079
territory and generally in the modern world it would mean uh some some form of

437
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:17,160
therapy whether it's um you know a regular therapist I put a lot of value

438
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:23,720
on somatic therapy because us generally somatic therapy is a way that that use

439
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:31,440
the body to be present for the diff these unresolved things that um is very akin to what we do in in mindfulness

440
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:38,400
practice um and sometimes it's not necessarily a therapist it might be a pastoral counselor that uh maybe feels a

441
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:46,000
little bit more if you have a spiritual orientation kind of makes a different context for the work so those are my

442
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,640
thoughts does that uh you want to ask anything more or say more so that I can

443
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:58,480
I can understand better it's it's touching a deep place so I

444
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:04,240
appreciate that I mean I I I and I wonder if many people do do therapy I

445
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:09,880
just actually stopped because this format here is just touching me in such

446
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:18,039
a deeper way uh great so maybe lot maybe maybe stick stick to this process now

447
01:04:18,039 --> 01:04:23,880
and um maybe um uh you know give it a chance for a while and see how it

448
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:29,920
develops and uh and what I told Captain might be relevant for you too that uh

449
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:35,440
maybe there's something deep really deeper in you that you're going to be get in touch with that might be

450
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:42,000
difficult for you as you move into this new room that you haven't attended to and so the first thing you might to look

451
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:47,680
at in this practice mindfulness practice is not the difficulty there but rather

452
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:53,559
how you're relating to it do you recoil from it do you blame someone do you get

453
01:04:53,559 --> 01:04:59,279
afraid and closed down you know my my one of my uh kind of if I'm if I'm

454
01:04:59,279 --> 01:05:06,720
feeling one a interesting question is uh when you're tired hungry overwhelmed and

455
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:14,760
you have no wisdom how do you react to your challenges and uh so for me uh uh I

456
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:20,160
think my go-to kind of strategy and those kind of circumstance is the ostrich

457
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:28,240
approach I try I just like want to put my my head in the sand and just kind of pretend nothing is there for a while so

458
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:34,200
so what's yours you know how do you relate to it then so so this is super helpful and I'll just one last thing

459
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:40,240
I'll say is I one thing that's comforting is I don't maybe the way I react is different but I don't feel

460
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:48,480
alone in the world with the political situation all this that's going on around us that I'm struggling so that

461
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:54,039
feels good to feel belonging and not alone so thank you and at some point uh

462
01:05:54,039 --> 01:06:00,520
uh what we can develop and grow it in this practice here is um not a polanish

463
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:07,240
view of difficulties and Injustice we want to be able to address them and see them and feel them but we feel more

464
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:14,240
comfortable with feeling the discomfort of it all we're more at ease we find a certain freedom in being present to feel

465
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:20,920
it it doesn't have to uh it doesn't have to cause us distress it just has it just allows it

466
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:26,359
just breaks our hearts and motivates us but it doesn't have to be a problem

467
01:06:26,359 --> 01:06:31,480
for us personally and but it's also not denying it it's not you know it's not

468
01:06:31,480 --> 01:06:38,119
you know ignoring it and and but it's a way of being we're developing our capacity to be fully present for the

469
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:44,318
challenges in the world so we can make a difference uh without being

470
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:50,200
overwhelmed okay thank you so well there's two more people with their hands up we'll take those uh hear from those

471
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:58,480
two people and then we'll uh do a breakout group those who' like to do that so um

472
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:06,720
Wendy hi Gils thank you um I want to um

473
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:15,480
incorporate more forgiveness in my practice I heard um the Dharma talks on

474
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:23,799
forgiveness and I've done the Forgiveness meditations but what I'm looking for

475
01:07:23,799 --> 01:07:30,760
is Maybe more um or just other ways to forgive

476
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:36,000
others and myself and even those you

477
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,480
know who don't know that they've done something when you know and I'm holding

478
01:07:41,480 --> 01:07:49,559
a grudge uhuh what what to do maybe more um you know

479
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:58,279
um I guess what I'm looking for is more of a action related meditation you know

480
01:07:58,279 --> 01:08:05,319
like when I'm you know work you know when I'm watching my thoughts what to do great

481
01:08:05,319 --> 01:08:11,079
well you well this is a a it's a very welcome question you're asking I I I put

482
01:08:11,079 --> 01:08:17,880
a tremendous amount of appreciation value for this desire to address the

483
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:24,798
challenges of our life with forgiveness so I want to appreciate that first and

484
01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:31,080
I'd like to uh uh you know ra rather than answering your question directly

485
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:37,120
which maybe would be the thing to do I'd like to offer you the more classic

486
01:08:37,120 --> 01:08:42,758
Buddhist response to the same situation because generally in Buddhism in ear

487
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:50,400
Indian Buddhism the kind of Buddhism that I based my teachings on uh there's not really an emphasis on forgiveness

488
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:57,560
the way that it's understood in the in in the West in the western

489
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:03,520
culture where forgiveness is deeply embedded comes out of

490
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:10,400
uh theistic religions and relationships to God and religion and the need for

491
01:09:10,400 --> 01:09:15,798
forgiveness that uh Indian religion doesn't have the same world

492
01:09:15,799 --> 01:09:22,600
view so when the the challenges you're describing what what Buddhism offers

493
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:27,719
might look like forgiveness might have the same effect but it doesn't involve

494
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:35,758
forgiveness what it involves is um letting go of one's own

495
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:41,600
anger resentment that's one and the other is

496
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:48,758
to cultivate loving kindness Good Will and those two things have do almost

497
01:09:48,759 --> 01:09:57,320
the same thing as forgiveness except we're not actually um uh

498
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:03,920
forgiving condoning uh uh what someone has

499
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:09,760
done uh we let that be their karma and we're just telling them we're no longer

500
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:17,000
going to hold it against you with my anger resentment I'm going to meet you with Good Will and but you're

501
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:23,239
responsible for your actions and the consequences and I I'm just I'll hold you and support you or just be with you

502
01:10:23,239 --> 01:10:31,040
in a kind way but uh I I'm not here to say that what you did can be now that

503
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:36,480
you're exonerated from from The Challenge you did but I'm just simply

504
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:42,360
not going to hold it against you and I'll meet you with Good Will so that that's for some people that makes the

505
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:48,159
whole idea of forgiveness a lot easier uh to to switch the orientation

506
01:10:48,159 --> 01:10:53,520
so I don't know if this satisfy you since I'm not answering your question Wendy but um can that give you something

507
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:59,080
to think about that was perfect thank you great thank

508
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:05,800
you so then Charlie hi Gail thank you so much for

509
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:13,480
your um your online meditations they um help my life very much and um I hope to

510
01:11:13,480 --> 01:11:19,080
meet you someday I live in Colorado and I've been um trying to get to one of those Retreats they're kind of hard to

511
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:24,400
get to um my my question would be about somat

512
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:29,480
really appreciate the recent samati teachings and

513
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:35,880
um there's there's two things that I've learn to fold into my meditation over

514
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:42,719
the years that helped me to settle and expand my awareness and they're both not

515
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:49,440
the breathing um and so I just wonder about your comment on them

516
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:56,040
um one is that I I use sound what I

517
01:11:56,040 --> 01:12:02,920
he um it feel it feels like it's less in inside me and I'm more connected with

518
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:09,920
the world when I use sound as the object of meditation instead of the breathing and I'm i' I've I've been using the

519
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:16,560
breathing for a really long time and so that's there too just automatically um habitually it's part of

520
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:23,360
the meditation but I tend to um use sound as my as my focus and and that

521
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:30,000
sometimes can be distracting um I sit in my living room in front of a big picture window I looks out to the

522
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:36,600
street um and um but I find that that it helps me to

523
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:43,320
feel more present by being connected with the here and now when I'm um with

524
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:49,600
the sound and the other thing is meta over the uh o over the years I've realized that just being with the

525
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:56,960
breathing sometimes um I I just um

526
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:02,480
it's there's a boredom or like a lack of purpose or something um the me when when

527
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:09,320
I start meditation with meta or include an aspect of that just not necessarily

528
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:17,000
one of the contemplations but something really light just like connection the purpose My bodhak Vow and

529
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:23,239
and bring that into my meditation and use that to settle my mind um those two

530
01:13:23,239 --> 01:13:29,800
things I are or what I tend to do great and and so

531
01:13:29,800 --> 01:13:37,920
um I know it's kind sometimes it feels like there's I have all these options and I and I have and it's a little much

532
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:43,040
and I know the breath is so simple and sometimes I come back to just that okay

533
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:48,920
but um that's how I tend to settle and work with somebody and those two things seem to work better for me so I just

534
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:57,239
wonder about your your your guidance on on working with those things great thank you so first fir f first I'd like to say

535
01:13:57,239 --> 01:14:04,120
that um uh yes there are people for whom uh there are better uh objects or

536
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:09,159
focuses of meditation than breathing and especially if you've done one for a long

537
01:14:09,159 --> 01:14:14,440
time uh you're welcome to continue with that and as we go go further with the

538
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:22,080
zadi practice I'll keep referring to breathing but you could welcome to translate it into these other practices

539
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:29,280
you're doing I think that you can probably without much effort translated in you know every time I say breath say

540
01:14:29,280 --> 01:14:34,360
sound for example or meta and um and one

541
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:43,440
way to one way to uh uh one one one approaches is to uh do these means that

542
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:51,800
you have for de developing your concentration being settled and when you're feeling really settled then

543
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:57,480
switch don't start with the with breath but uh pick it up once you're really

544
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:04,040
settled and then you might find that it actually supports you to go further into the samade than what you're already

545
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:09,800
doing in the n in about 20 years ago or so there was a trend where Insight

546
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:16,320
Meditation teachers spend a lot would always begin when they they guided meditations on Retreats and stuff always

547
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:22,480
begin with doing listening meditation like you're doing and some people find it very helpful because you can't

548
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:28,199
interfere with the sound You Can't Make a Better Sound you can't react to it uh you can't you don't you don't get

549
01:15:28,199 --> 01:15:33,320
entangled with it in the way some people do with their breathing so it's a way of being

550
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:38,719
spacious and allowing just and uh and very open so it can be very nice there

551
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:45,600
was a time when we emphasize that a lot and meta is a classic one in our tradition for developing concentration

552
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:50,760
and and uh some people will start every meditation with 5 10 minutes of meta to

553
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:57,440
in order to get somewhat settled and concentrated and to create a good atmosphere in the mind good attitude for

554
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:04,960
doing the practice so um um but I I still have an Orient

555
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:14,239
myself into an orientation to something like breathing because some point or other uh uh the orientation to listen to

556
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:20,880
sounds um uh it the sounds begin receding away and you want to be able to

557
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:28,639
keep staying focused on something that's more basic and breathing in the body tends to remain as we go into samade

558
01:16:28,639 --> 01:16:34,800
sounds can usually disappear entirely at some point in deeper samade and meta

559
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:42,400
becomes you know depends how you're doing meta but certainly if you're using meta phrases um they become at some

560
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:47,480
point become a little bit too coarse and the phrases have to go away as well and

561
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:55,199
then you're dropping into the body to feel the radiance of the meta rather than the mental side of it so there is a

562
01:16:55,199 --> 01:17:02,120
there is a way of working with all of this so I hope my words kind of re uh address your

563
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:07,600
questions well enough yes great thank you so much

564
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:14,280
great thank you so so I'd like to make an announcement just because I think some of you won't stay for the breakout

565
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:20,560
groups and that is that um some of you might remember about two three years ago

566
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:28,320
at the at the beginning of the Ukraine War uh we we did a fundraising drive for

567
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:34,639
uh save the children uh one of the preeminent nonprofits doing humanitarian

568
01:17:34,639 --> 01:17:41,159
work that um in order to support their effort to work with the the children

569
01:17:41,159 --> 01:17:47,639
affected by the Ukrainian War at the beginning of that war and uh it was the main thing we had

570
01:17:47,639 --> 01:17:52,880
at IMC back then because it was during the pandemic was um the you you the

571
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:58,760
YouTube YouTube Community and it was very successful very inspiring we raised some like

572
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:05,560
$70,000 to give to uh to the save the children and now we would like to

573
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:12,159
um uh at the time I thought we should do this once a year for something but now we're i' like to be able to do it again

574
01:18:12,159 --> 01:18:17,280
for save the children and they have an emergency uh Children's Fund that goes

575
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:25,280
to places in the world with highest level of emergency for life and death issues um that uh I thought would be

576
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:33,120
really good to support and right now the two highest highest level places they're concerned about is now that um uh is

577
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:39,560
Gaza and uh and also uh Sudan and so we would I would like us to

578
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:45,520
I'd like to put open up another one IMC fundraising drive we what we do is we

579
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:52,120
spend a week where we try to encourage that and and so we're going to do that I think in the middle of October of

580
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:58,120
February in a couple of weeks and I'll say more but I wanted to just use this

581
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:04,840
community meeting as a chance to uh to um kind of talk a little bit about the

582
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:10,960
history of this how we've done this before the good effect it have had and and really speak well about save the

583
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:17,120
children there they're a non-political group they've been involved in the some of the greatest crisises in the world

584
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:24,239
for the last some like 70 years or more and um they know what they're doing and

585
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:29,960
and um and uh it's a I think it's a wonderful group to U support and we've been in

586
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:35,760
touch with them directly about this uh uh drive this idea so we you know we

587
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:41,080
talking to them on we've had phone calls with them about it about how we can participate and how to make sure that it

588
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:47,800
works well for our community that we feel good about so so little bit more information about that but I wanted to

589
01:19:47,800 --> 01:19:55,280
let you all know so what we're going to do is take um I I'll make groups of uh five

590
01:19:55,280 --> 01:20:00,840
and we'll take about uh maybe 12 minutes for those groups of five and um then we

591
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:05,920
come back here for a little bit more more and um and what I'd like to ask you

592
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:13,000
in as you go into your group is um uh maybe just talk a little bit about uh

593
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:18,120
what it's been like for you to participate in this

594
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:24,960
YouTube uh uh community and practice uh the time you have and maybe with a

595
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:31,520
little emphasis on what it's been like with now with this samade series but what I'd like to ask is you don't say

596
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:38,159
much make make one point um so that other people can speak

597
01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:44,360
and uh and the idea is there ideally um you're able to go around your group of

598
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:50,679
five kind of um multiple times so it becomes more of

599
01:20:50,679 --> 01:20:57,560
a listening exercise than a speaking exercise many people have a strong need to speak and want to say everything they

600
01:20:57,560 --> 01:21:04,199
could possibly say uh which there's that has a lot of value too an occasion but

601
01:21:04,199 --> 01:21:10,840
for this format I think what has the most value is to really have a chance to listen and hear and sense Everyone by

602
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:16,280
saying something relatively brief and then going around and one advantage of

603
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:24,080
these kinds of brief statements where it goes around and round is there's a mar can be a marvelous way where as we hear

604
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:31,280
other people statements it affects us and after a while we find ourselves we're Changed by it and new things come

605
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:37,000
out of us when we speak then we could never have imagined speaking if we just kind

606
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:43,880
of explained everything about ourselves that we already know so hopefully that uh works and if

607
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:50,159
you don't want to be in a breakout group um I would ask you to uh leave YouTube and if you want to come back in 12

608
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:55,280
minutes or 10 minutes or 5 minutes you're welcome to come back uh to the

609
01:21:55,280 --> 01:22:02,560
zoom room but to to leave the zoom now because the reason for that is that otherwise you get assigned to a room and

610
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:12,719
then the rooms get kind of skewed with how many people are there so um

611
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:30,198
okay so I'm going to make

612
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:36,000
um no that's not right that should

613
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:52,600
be okay so it'll probably be

614
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:05,760
okay so see how this goes

615
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:20,600
um okay so and the timing is 12 minutes and and here it goes

616
01:23:52,679 --> 01:23:55,679
this

617
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:10,280
so if any of you are there behind your tiles if you want me to help you to go to a group I I'll try to do that um but

618
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:14,320
um it looks like

619
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:23,880
um if you're if you want to try to go yes some of you going maybe and if you

620
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:30,120
go to the bottom menu and see breakout groups maybe you'll find an invitation there to

621
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:36,480
join and I'm going to go to YouTube

622
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:44,040
now to so there I am at YouTube so those of you is there anybody

623
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:51,119
on YouTube watching let me see we

624
01:24:51,679 --> 01:24:58,880
have 93 people watching now so so hello so we have about 12 minutes

625
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:06,440
so if uh if some of you would like to uh say something in the chat there's

626
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:13,880
about a 15 minute delay between um what happens here at IMC and and it appears

627
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:19,440
on on YouTube it's not instantaneous so if you put a chat and it'll take a few

628
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:24,960
seconds for me to see it um

629
01:25:25,239 --> 01:25:31,679
and um ni it's nice to see the names I see

630
01:25:31,679 --> 01:25:34,679
there

631
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:04,480
there we go okay so so I guess

632
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:30,920
so I've been wanting to inquire about any reference material that may be recommended to support samadi

633
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:38,800
practice Yeah a good question

634
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:45,480
um um there are books about samadi uh if you want a General survey of samadi in

635
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:50,560
in uh kind of our Buddhist tradition and some of the different uh ways it's

636
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:56,159
taught uh there's a book by Richard shankman called the experience of samat

637
01:26:56,159 --> 01:27:03,639
that there's a nice survey of it all how it is in the teachings of the Buddha and elsewhere and um so that might be you

638
01:27:03,639 --> 01:27:09,280
know kind of a nice General place to begin

639
01:27:13,159 --> 01:27:16,159
um

640
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:23,840
and so hello I don't know where the zoom link

641
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:28,440
is thank you for yeah so the zoom list

642
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:39,638
so so nice to see the names they're

643
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:48,520
there Kathy and Lorena Pat and Jean nice to see your

644
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:53,679
name Jean and your greeting

645
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:32,520
so we have five more minutes for the breakout

646
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:37,560
groups and

647
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:05,400
late

648
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:33,459
[Music]

649
01:29:39,119 --> 01:29:47,560
so so those of you on YouTube um then I think let's see there we go

650
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:55,960
can you talk about Flow versus samade a second

651
01:29:57,280 --> 01:30:05,280
flow is um can be part of samama and um and inly in Buddhism the

652
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:13,679
flow part of somebody is a relatively um um intermediate step of somebody

653
01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:19,360
where there's a strong sense of flow moving through us that classic metaphor

654
01:30:19,360 --> 01:30:24,960
the Buddha gives for that is a um Mountain Lake in which there's no water

655
01:30:24,960 --> 01:30:31,600
coming in from any River into it and there's no rain entering the but the water that comes into the lake is from

656
01:30:31,600 --> 01:30:36,840
an underground spring from deep in the lake and the and the water's flowing up

657
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:42,760
like a fountain that is spreading this refreshing water throughout the lake and

658
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:48,000
so it can that way there's no input from the five senses coming in from the world

659
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:54,560
around us but the whole sense of flow movement in meditation is well up from

660
01:30:54,560 --> 01:31:02,840
within of a nice flow of energy of joy of delight of well-being that moves but

661
01:31:02,840 --> 01:31:08,960
then as concentration gets stronger some gets deeper or Fuller then

662
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:14,639
it um it uh it um the sense of movement

663
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:19,679
stops itself is no longer there there's no sense of FL it's really really still

664
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:25,440
and um and uh so samade is a general term for the these States and within

665
01:31:25,440 --> 01:31:30,520
suat there's different stages or different uh ways and it's experience

666
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:35,560
and it tends to be a progressive a deepening of somadi and flow is there

667
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:40,239
first and then there's a deeper uh Stillness that

668
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:50,840
happens so let's see we have uh three minutes left

669
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:59,320
in with the you with the zoom room I'll come back now to

670
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:04,360
Great your comment about everyone feeling feeling as if they're going

671
01:32:04,360 --> 01:32:12,159
backwards at some point was very important to me because that's exactly how I was feeling thank you that's

672
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:19,760
nice yeah there I've learned uh that both from my own practice and being a teacher supporting many people in this

673
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:27,000
practice that um the key element is to is the sincerity of our practice trust

674
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:35,040
the practice and keep doing especially mindfulness practice just keep showing up for it keep practicing it and um and

675
01:32:35,040 --> 01:32:41,119
just trust the practice uh no matter what the ups and downs are and any

676
01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:47,639
spiritual practice that's uh worthwhile to do will have ups and downs and so the

677
01:32:47,639 --> 01:32:53,400
image I have for the ups and downs is it's a path that has um that has uh you

678
01:32:53,400 --> 01:32:58,600
know got up ups and down but you're still moving along the path um it's not

679
01:32:58,600 --> 01:33:07,080
that going you're going up a hill and then sliding down up a hill and sliding down you are moving ahead even if it

680
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:13,040
seems like you're going backwards but that's just natural part of it and the way to keep going is to trust the

681
01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:18,960
mindfulness trust the practice keep doing it um and if you're if you find

682
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:25,600
that something persists for a long time that really seems like a challenge then you should probably find a teacher to

683
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:31,760
ask questions of and help the teacher explore it help you know help the teacher help

684
01:33:31,760 --> 01:33:38,880
you explore it are there any plan changes the format

685
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:44,280
or teachers for the 7 a.m. sessions there's uh the only no there's no plan

686
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:49,600
for any change uh the only thing would be that when I'm not here then I have uh

687
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:56,440
substitute teachers who come and we have a big set of uh wonderful teach here at IMC so who will step in when they

688
01:33:56,440 --> 01:34:02,400
they're able to and um and the only only change might be if

689
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:10,239
for some reason I cannot come but cannot find a substitute uh one option would be to

690
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:15,600
like for one day if something happens and I can't come for for some reason I can

691
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:22,360
pre-record that day and and broadcast it which would allow it to continue another

692
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:28,239
would be that um um so may maybe some some I might on

693
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:33,840
short notice not be able to find a teacher substitute for me and and then

694
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:39,520
maybe the plan is to uh uh for the YouTube is to play an old recording kind

695
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:46,360
of do a rerun in a sense so with the time is this time is still happening and people can come and join and participate

696
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:55,639
but it won't be live but that's only in case there's an issue but otherwise they're planning to continue uh this

697
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:03,920
uh perhaps an odd question during practice earlier feeling rather embodied settled I shifted to sweetness and sense

698
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:09,679
this question where is sweetness or where is that feeling located seems like

699
01:35:09,679 --> 01:35:16,159
a good question I I wouldn't having the question is wonderful searching for the answer it

700
01:35:16,159 --> 01:35:21,280
might not be NE necessary sometimes it's just nice to have these Dharma questions

701
01:35:21,280 --> 01:35:26,560
arise and um and uh and it's part of the deeper

702
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:31,960
process of something unfolding to have the question there and just having the question might be enough for something

703
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:37,920
to appear or something to continue so I'm going to close the um

704
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:43,280
breakout groups they have 60 seconds in the zoom

705
01:35:45,080 --> 01:35:49,080
room and

706
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:07,159
let's see all

707
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:13,280
right so now they have 60

708
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:25,560
Seconds

709
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:56,560
for for

710
01:37:27,080 --> 01:37:33,960
so I think we're back everyone and

711
01:37:33,960 --> 01:37:41,199
um so so welcome back and uh hope that was

712
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:47,920
nice for you and so what uh else would anybody like to bring up any anything

713
01:37:47,920 --> 01:37:53,280
you'd like to discuss or anything questions or uh maybe mention how that

714
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:58,599
was was to be in the breakout group or the floor's open the idea is to continue

715
01:37:58,599 --> 01:38:04,760
until 8:45 so another 7 minutes or so so

716
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:10,880
Lou well yes hi Gil and thank you and we were all very grateful that you have

717
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:18,520
been online now for four or five years and available to us I just wanted to mention what we have formed here in

718
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:23,960
Nevada City Nevada um northern California that is there are about 10 of

719
01:38:23,960 --> 01:38:29,400
us locally who follow you and have been doing that for years uh and we have

720
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:36,199
formed our own s we meet weekly we discuss your teachings and it's provided

721
01:38:36,199 --> 01:38:42,360
an opportunity for us to share at a deeper level and also form a community

722
01:38:42,360 --> 01:38:48,880
that supports one another in times of need um and also just uh to provide a an

723
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:57,400
opportunity to listen and learn from one another and your teachings have been the basis for U our gathering and so thank

724
01:38:57,400 --> 01:39:03,679
you very much but also it's an example I think of what others could possibly do

725
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:09,560
at the local level given enough interest wow Lou thank you that was

726
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:16,599
wonderful to hear it's very gratifying to hear that kind of uh initiative getting together in benefit yes I know a

727
01:39:16,599 --> 01:39:22,800
few other people who meet together around these YouTubes and have discussions and and share it with each

728
01:39:22,800 --> 01:39:29,000
other so uh some people are lucky enough to be close by some people

729
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:36,080
um people who don't have anybody nearby uh we do have uh through IMC a Sunday uh

730
01:39:36,080 --> 01:39:42,760
after the Sunday morning talk there's a Sunday morning song of the meets on on zoom and so it's not the same as the

731
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:48,960
YouTube exactly but there's a lot of overlap and uh you could probably sign up you know I think it's the link is

732
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:54,159
there on the IMC calendar for the Sunday morning um group

733
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:59,520
that meets thank you so someone

734
01:40:00,360 --> 01:40:07,000
else anything else that uh yes yeah so Debbie it helps if you I

735
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:15,000
don't see all the all the tiles because there's three windows but I see Debbie so please G I just I you know how I feel

736
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:22,440
about this group and everything that you offer at IMC um after I fell last week this week

737
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:27,639
a friend said oh tant Tata what is

738
01:40:27,639 --> 01:40:33,480
that yeah it's a it's a word that sometimes translated as

739
01:40:33,480 --> 01:40:38,639
equinity but it it means more like balance it's like stand it literally

740
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:44,760
means something like in the middle of it all uh so it means some like standing in

741
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:50,719
the middle of it all and uh and be able to hold your balance in all the you know

742
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:56,599
the the difficult challenges of daily life and uh and so it's it's equinity has

743
01:40:56,599 --> 01:41:01,679
more to do with wisdom uh uh we see we see equinity

744
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:11,360
means to have an overview literally means to have an overview of the situation that's wise so we're not going to be reactive to it but and tatra Ma

745
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:16,719
Tata means more that we have an inner strength to be able to stand there be

746
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:22,239
present but we're not reactive because there's a strength of of like standing

747
01:41:22,239 --> 01:41:28,639
there like standing on a rocking boat and you have the strength to stay balanced you don't have any wisdom but

748
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:36,440
you have strength and balance yeah wow thank you thank you and love deep love

749
01:41:36,440 --> 01:41:42,239

01:41:42,239 --> 01:41:46,039
Debbie thank you and

751
01:41:48,679 --> 01:41:55,280
Karissa um first I just want to say thank you so so much Gil um that was

752
01:41:55,280 --> 01:42:02,280
really really beautiful and I saw in the chat um someone mentioning about doing it

753
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:08,560
once a month or something and I just that would I second that um but I just

754
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:14,239
wanted to share that um in our group to

755
01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:21,159
feel the common Humanity of the suffering that has brought us all here

756
01:42:21,159 --> 01:42:30,000
um was very beautiful um and I felt so connected and

757
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:35,320
um it felt like a it it felt like a place where all of our tiny little

758
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:42,639
squares like we all there's so much life in each one um

759
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:50,719
and this is just a I don't know a silly little example of something that I do um

760
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:55,800
to like feel common Humanity when I'm feeling like I'm really

761
01:42:55,800 --> 01:43:02,320
suffering um is that I imagine this person that I've named Lucy who lives in

762
01:43:02,320 --> 01:43:09,080
senagal um and when I'm hurting and when I'm feeling pain and when it becomes

763
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:14,800
suffering I imagine that she this imaginary person is feeling the exact

764
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:22,760
same way and for her own situation and that um we're both in this suffering

765
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:28,360
together and we realize that there's common Humanity with us and we both send our

766
01:43:28,360 --> 01:43:33,560
spirit energy our meta to each other and it kisses over the Atlantic it comes

767
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:39,520
back to us um and that's what I feel here like I feel that you know we're all

768
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:47,960
suffering and have we all have this pain in different ways and it may become suffering and as we connect and you know

769
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:55,800
then it can go back to each one of us because of this support in the S and so I just I really felt that in in the

770
01:43:55,800 --> 01:44:01,119
breakout rooms and I'm just I am really really grateful so thank you so so much

771
01:44:01,119 --> 01:44:09,520
Carissa that was wonderful to hear all of what you said it was very meaningful and and uh to hear it and know that this

772
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:16,000
orientation this understanding is happening here in this community and thank you very

773
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:21,239
much so thank you and this idea of doing it once a month I have this idea to do

774
01:44:21,239 --> 01:44:27,159
it more often and U my schedule is so full it's it's a little hard but I will

775
01:44:27,159 --> 01:44:34,920
um uh I've been thinking about it and just hearing the request gives me a little bit more momentum to to look for

776
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:40,920
when it it's possible to do it and um and the other thing I was

777
01:44:40,920 --> 01:44:46,719
thinking about this morning was um maybe for one week if I can find a time in my

778
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:52,440
schedule where my week allows for it and we're doing the samade uh series I think

779
01:44:52,440 --> 01:44:59,320
sitting twice a day as I've been encouraging you to do is really useful when the the focus is on somebody that I

780
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:06,199
thought that maybe we uh I I could host a um a YouTube sitting at uh in

781
01:45:06,199 --> 01:45:11,320
California at 4:30 in California time for half an hour for one week like five

782
01:45:11,320 --> 01:45:17,400
days and uh just have one week get the experience of coming together in community to do two sittings a

783
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:22,760
day so I'll look for my schedule and see if I can find that and um and hopefully

784
01:45:22,760 --> 01:45:30,119
dur during the series there'll be a time so thank you very very much uh yes

785
01:45:30,119 --> 01:45:36,119
Cindy yeah Gil I just wanted to say um when Matthew was teaching for a week um

786
01:45:36,119 --> 01:45:43,119
we had some uh a lot of discussion about grief and and loss um and so he did a

787
01:45:43,119 --> 01:45:52,080
zoom meeting for us which is really great and maybe some of the substitute teachers could you know do do a because

788
01:45:52,080 --> 01:45:59,119
I think this is that's really meaningful to this group to see each other and have the exchange that's a great idea I will

789
01:45:59,119 --> 01:46:04,360
