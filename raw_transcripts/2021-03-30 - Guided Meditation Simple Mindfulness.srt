00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,040
okay welcome to imc's monday night

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:17,920
sitting and uh dharma talk

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,840
all right i assume that things are going okay so um uh we're going to begin

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,000
this session with about half an hour of a guided

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,559
meditation and then i'll share some reflections

6
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:47,520
based on a topic and that i bring in today

7
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:59,840
so let's begin the sitting

8
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:17,040
maybe take a moment and to find a posture that's supportive of meditative practice

9
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:28,320
i'm aware that today is the first night right after the full moon

10
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,000
night since yesterday yesterday was a full moon night

11
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,680
and so in some sense this is kind of an auspicious auspicious night and so

12
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:49,360
um may we all have an excellent night or an auspicious night

13
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,840
sitting together practicing together

14
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:03,040
so maybe just take a few moments to settle in into wherever

15
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,840
you're meditating in

16
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:23,840
the first few moments just to allow the body and mind to arrive

17
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:37,840
arrive into here and now

18
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,640
it's often useful to begin by taking some long deep breath

19
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:05,840
as you breathe out just allow the body to relax

20
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,319
feeling the connection of your legs and feet

21
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:33,840
with the ground the floor and the chairs or the cushions

22
00:03:40,560 --> 00:04:01,840
having a sense of groundedness grounded on earth

23
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:15,840
as the lower half of the body began to settle and rest on earth

24
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,680
allow the upper half of the body

25
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:29,840
to rest and settle as well

26
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,080
can you feel the weight of the arms

27
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,638
hands

28
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:25,840
let the arms hang naturally

29
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:39,840
maybe the torso is upright

30
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,479
and neck is aligned

31
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:53,840
with the spine like an extension of the spine

32
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:21,840
allow the muscles on the face to soften

33
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,400
feel sensations on the top of the head

34
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:48,560
on the back of the head

35
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:55,840
just do a quick scan from the top of the head all the way down to

36
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:03,840
the bottom of your feet inviting ease

37
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,120
inviting relaxation

38
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,840
and softening

39
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:31,759
and then momentarily if you're ready

40
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,960
can turn our awareness

41
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:45,840
to the movements of our breathing

42
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,479
that maybe is rising and falling of the belly

43
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,840
or the expansion and contraction of the chest

44
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
foreign

45
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:43,518
resting your attention on the movements of a breathing

46
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,880
without trying too hard

47
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,519
simply resting like a putting a gentle [Music]

48
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,560
hand i'm petting the little baby

49
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,560
stroking the baby

50
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:37,839
soft gentle awareness on the breath

51
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,640
the concerns of the past and future

52
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:07,199
maybe can be faded into the background

53
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:19,839
allow the foreground to be filled with the experience that's happening

54
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:33,839
here and now in this body

55
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:46,320
maybe tinkling on the feet

56
00:10:46,320 --> 00:11:01,839
warmth in your palms

57
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:29,839
coolness of the breath

58
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:44,880
it's a secret life force unfolding right here

59
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:57,839
right now

60
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:41,680
now you can rest your attention your awareness

61
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,519
right here in the whole body

62
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,839
it's as if the awareness is

63
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,600
filled imbued in the body itself

64
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,120
there is nothing to do to be aware

65
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:20,800
simply receiving the experience of the body

66
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:35,839
and experience of the mind in the restful field of awareness

67
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:49,839
maybe the sound is known

68
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,240
sound of my voice

69
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,839
ambience sound

70
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:17,839
silence in between

71
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:32,240
vibrations in the belly

72
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,839
a thought

73
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,680
tightness on the forehead

74
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:17,199
everything everything that's happening

75
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:27,839
can simply be received and known

76
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:09,839
and pleasant experience

77
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:23,839
unpleasant experience

78
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,839
a moment of doubt

79
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:05,839
a moment of wanting grasping

80
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,080
everything can happen on their own terms

81
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:48,320
it's kind gentle awareness

82
00:17:51,360 --> 00:18:01,840
simply receiving

83
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:15,840
no need to fix

84
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:29,200
boundless allowing

85
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:43,840
some experience may be extremely challenging

86
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:57,840
getting to know this through the embodied experience

87
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,600
persistent swirling emotions

88
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,840
how does it feel in the body

89
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,840
are you aware

90
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:49,840
if the mind wandered away it's never too late to start again

91
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:58,400
right now this moment

92
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:13,840
mindfulness front and center right now

93
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:22,640

94
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:29,840
always has a door wide open for you

95
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,840

96
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:57,840
to enter and return to the temple of this body

97
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,840
in this last few moments of our sitting

98
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:14,720
i'm going to read this poem versus from a middle length discourses

99
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:22,559
the title of this poem is an auspicious day

100
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:31,840
maybe you can listen to those words while you're you sit

101
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:45,840
allow this words to drop into your awareness

102
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:52,158
however it might touch you connect with you

103
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:03,039
allow it to be received in the wide open field of awareness

104
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:13,840
and if something bubbles up receive that too

105
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:27,840
an auspicious night this is translated by gil fransto

106
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:36,320
the buddha said don't chase the past or long for the future

107
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:44,320
the past is left behind the future is not yet reached

108
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:53,360
right where it is have insight into whatever phenomena is present

109
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,640
not fattering and not agitated

110
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,720
by knowing it one develops the mind

111
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:14,399
ardently do what should be done today who knows death may come tomorrow

112
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:22,880
there is no bargaining with mortality and his great army

113
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:30,080
whoever dwells thus ardent active day and night

114
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:39,039
is says the peaceful sage one who has an auspicious day

115
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:52,480
and the other translation of the auspicious day is a single excellent

116
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,840
