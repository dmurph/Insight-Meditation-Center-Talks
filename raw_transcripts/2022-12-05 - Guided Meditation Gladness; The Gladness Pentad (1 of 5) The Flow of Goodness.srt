13
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:26,400
happy to be here and I want to use that as a jumping off for our meditation

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,680
that there is a role at times

15
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,460
for gladness for Delight for

16
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,720
and maybe as we settle into our meditation here

17
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:50,159
there's a variety of things that we can settle into or be inspired by or

18
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,939
kind of Welcome us kind of make a welcoming kind of place within

19
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:03,000
to be present that we want to be present to these good

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:11,340
feelings that can arise Maybe and there is a gladness maybe that comes

21
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,500
from simply sitting in this meditation

22
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:24,920
posture if you've been doing this for a long time it might be a kind of homecoming

23
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:31,319
fortunate to be able to have a posture to meditate in and to have that

24
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:36,900
and you can maybe be at a certain degree of gladness or Delight

25
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:43,739
that you have these minutes put aside where there's so much

26
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:51,480
of your life that you don't have to take care of at this moment or you've chosen not to take care of or be engaged in

27
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,540
and it's kind of a vacation a Sabbath stepping away

28
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:04,860
and maybe there's a gladness for this little bit of time and maybe a modicum of peace and subtleness

29
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:11,700
peace of not having to respond and react and do and accomplish and prove yourself

30
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:16,800
and just to be here

31
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,800
and maybe there's gladness and having a mindfulness practice

32
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:30,000
gladness in her practice where we with time can find our home here in this

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,280
body in this space that there's a kind of safety

34
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,940
that we find in being aware being attentive

35
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,640
so that our reactivity doesn't get the upper hand

36
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:54,780
just to be here breathing and so there is maybe a variety of

37
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,959
things you can be glad about happy about this opportunity to meditate

38
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,319
you might have a lot of challenges you might have physical pain you might have emotional

39
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:14,280
difficulties that are not very uncomfortable not to deny them or try to

40
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,060
override them but maybe

41
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:28,680
for these minutes here in the middle of them in this present moment

42
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:35,600
maybe there's a place where your heart can smile

43
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,320
maybe there's some some things that are

44
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,660
that allow your heart to have a smile and in that smile

45
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,419
to welcome you and to be here and present

46
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:07,740
so gently closing the eyes maybe closing the eyes so that

47
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:15,560
that part of you which has the smile or the gladness can be felt more

48
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:36,780
gently taking some long slow deep breaths gently

49
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:44,060
three quarters full inhale

50
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:53,100
and perhaps with the inhale and exhale breathing with

51
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,860
the smile breathing with the gladness

52
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,460
letting your breathing return to normal

53
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:28,100
and sometimes it's useful to notice the location in your body

54
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:37,639
from which you're aware from where you'd practice mindfulness

55
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:45,800
and the seat of awareness

56
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:54,680
can be changed is variable

57
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:04,940
without denying how you might be otherwise can you let your awareness

58
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:14,659
come from the place where you feel a delight or gladness or contentment

59
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,800
quiet well-being

60
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,380
like you're sitting into a nice comfortable easy chair

61
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,840
from which you can gaze upon the world

62
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:42,080
letting your awareness says take a seat

63
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,500
in the smile of your heart and from here

64
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,758
be aware of your breathing

65
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,500
be aware of your body

66
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:10,699
be aware of your experience remembering always to know it

67
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:24,080
in there from that seat Within where there is some well-being

68
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,319
resting there

69
00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:36,320
awareness resting so awareness does not work

70
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,700
foreign

71
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:08,240
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

72
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:19,740
to consider sitting here quietly

73
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:27,299
what you might be glad for grateful form

74
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:33,059
during this sitting perhaps the meditation has has its

75
00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:38,279
challenges for you maybe your body now is uncomfortable

76
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:45,620
from sitting this long but is there somewhere inside

77
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:53,279
something that you can are content or happy or grateful for

78
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,340
this chance to meditate to be together

79
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:11,720
is there some feeling of relief

80
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,320
or appreciation

81
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,658
a smile in the heart

82
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:39,500
and may whatever appreciation we have from this practice

83
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:50,000
be a source from which to who appreciate others

84
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:59,460
whatever ways that we have benefited from this meditation in ways that we know in ways that we

85
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:07,820
don't know may it translate me would Inspire us

86
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:15,299
to for greater care and respect for the people we encounter and relate to think

87
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:17,539
about

88
00:28:21,059 --> 00:28:26,480
may it be that sitting quietly in meditation

89
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,179
has value for how we live our life

90
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:43,799
may we contribute to the welfare and happiness of others

91
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:52,380
while doing so for ourselves may all beings be happy

92
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:57,779
may all beings be safe

93
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:06,600
may all beings be peaceful may all beings everywhere

94
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,380
be free

95
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,100
thank you

96
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,240
foreign

97
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:40,500
um hello everyone and here we are in

98
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:47,539
and new Monday a new week

99
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:53,279
happy to be with you and in a sense I bring with you a little

100
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:59,820
bit of The Last Retreat that I was teaching on that the inside Retreat

101
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:07,320
Center and ended yesterday and it was wonderful to be at the retreat center in person

102
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:14,220
and um even more more wonderful to be meditating there and kind of being in

103
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:21,299
the flow a very very relaxed flow of the practice of

104
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:26,120
the schedule of the whole life there at the retreat center

105
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:33,240
so I come here happy with this and also I come here with little bit the theme of

106
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:41,580
The Retreat and what I'm inspired to share with you this week is what has been come maybe locally been

107
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:47,460
come to be called the gladness pentad

108
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:55,559
and I probably thought about this before certainly parts of it and these are five

109
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,820
inner states qualities that can grow as

110
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:08,340
we develop practice and the way the Buddha presented these five

111
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:14,760
was not something that we generate or create or construct for ourselves make

112
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:24,720
happen like we're the in charge and we're going to make kind of pump this up but rather something that emerges

113
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,600
and uh and then begins to flow emerges and begins to flow into each other one

114
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:39,240
after the other and the role of the practitioner is to know it allow for it they groom for it

115
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:45,539
and not interfere with the process we interfere with it by getting lost in

116
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:51,539
thought part of the value of learning how not to be Wonder off in thought and be caught

117
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:56,580
up in preoccupations is that when we're really here that is

118
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:03,179
that those thoughts those preoccupations are a dampener they limit they close the doors through

119
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:10,799
something flowing and moving something can happen that when those are not there

120
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:17,539
it's kind of like you you know if you're on the on the radio

121
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:23,279
and you turn onto the channel of the news as horrible as the news might be

122
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:29,820
and you're going to look um you missed the you know you're tuned into a

123
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:36,919
different Channel and but you turn it back to the channel where maybe there's some really uh

124
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:44,220
inspiring music that really kind of touches you and opens you and delights you and and it helps you to be in the

125
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:50,340
present moment and so uh when we stop being distracted

126
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:55,559
and mindfulness has developed so we're really here it's a new channel and it's a new

127
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:01,799
something new can flow and move that can't move if we're distracted

128
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:08,358
and um and that's part of one of those descriptions of this is the gladness

129
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:14,040
pentatonin so this is gladness itself that's the first First Quality gives it

130
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:21,240
its name Joy Tranquility happiness and samadhi

131
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:27,358
concentration and and one of the Salient features of

132
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,780
some of the description of these is that it doesn't say that the meditator makes

133
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:40,320
these happen but they from one the other arises the other flows from one to the

134
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,020
other and this idea of flowing or arising flowing is kind of maybe the I think

135
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:52,800
maybe one of the preeminent ways in which the Buddha talks about the growth the expansion and movement of healthy

136
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,500
states of mind and uh the number of places he uses the

137
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,960
metaphor of uh of uh water flowing in a river

138
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:11,640
flowing in a stream and um or water flowing

139
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:17,700
um from an underwater spring into a large peaceful Lake the flow of that

140
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:24,780
water from the inside out um or really finding the current of the

141
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:31,560
river and then flowing in the current um or as the rivers go down the

142
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:38,640
Mountainside and combined they get bigger and bigger and bigger so as these good qualities kind of come together and

143
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,920
grow something within us gets bigger and bigger more expansive and this idea of

144
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,760
the of um of becoming expansive is uh part of what the Buddha talks

145
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:57,420
about as practice develops so instead of flowing the alternative to this

146
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:02,940
is uh uh is what uh we uh we could call

147
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:08,880
reactivity and the reactivity and the kind of in my

148
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,099
language but their activity and the kind of what the Buddha points to is very

149
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:19,560
different metaphors to describe it here Mr garbage it has fire that burns you he

150
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:27,000
describes that as a Barb a kind of an arrow that you know pierces you uh a sickness that comes from the

151
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,099
outside and maybe a virus that comes from outside that is not the alien

152
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:38,700
little bit to who you are but makes you sick um a a tumor

153
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:44,400
which is also kind of you know not you it's something that's extra uh sometimes

154
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,220
he calls it a burden so there's something outside that's weighing you down like a heavy thing you have to carry

155
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:55,380
and these are very different kind of uh two different ways in which we can go

156
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,599
through life one which is a burden which is we kind

157
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:06,300
of afflictive and the other which is uh we're being carried along something's

158
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:11,540
moving within us that we make space for and allow for this movement

159
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:16,740
towards freedom and so the way the Buddha describes this

160
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:22,619
gladness pentad it begins by something that inspires us

161
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:27,900
and uh sometimes it's the faith or the trust we have in the Dharma and the

162
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:34,320
practice sometimes that has to do with some experience of of Freedom that we've

163
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:40,800
experienced not necessarily the Big Bang Freedom that the Buddhism might be emphasizing

164
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:49,380
but it's just a small ways in which we learn to let go and experience ourselves independent of our reactivity our

165
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:57,119
preoccupations our our kind of ways in which our rumination is

166
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:03,780
self-afflicting we kind of repeat the same kind of self-critical kinds of thoughts over and over again and it is a

167
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:10,320
kind of a burning fire that singes us to have this over and over again

168
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:16,500
and so to have that stop or cease or quiet down enough that we have a

169
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,619
different experience of ourselves and we're inspired that it's possible

170
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:27,119
what's remarkable I think for many of us is how we can go through a life growing

171
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:35,760
up and good part of our life thinking that how the mind is our mind is operating is

172
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,700
normal that's the way it should be and if the mind is involved with reactivity

173
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:47,400
and what I mean by reactivity is that there's a habitual

174
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:55,380
uh mental emotional activity that gets triggered by some event outside or some

175
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:02,660
event inside so you know if I sit here quietly and think about

176
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:08,820
um you know that um

177
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:13,980
you know I I haven't had my car oil changed for a while now it's time to do

178
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:19,280
it and and so that's just realizing that

179
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:27,599
or there can be a reactivity to that inside like Gil I tell myself

180
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,660
um you're a really lousy terrible car owner you don't really take care of that

181
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:40,920
well this is a thing that should be cared for and respected and how could you and I get angry with myself and if

182
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:46,920
that that's an automatic pilot that kind of criticism and anger that's reactivity

183
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:54,960
and um and then that reactivity then can produce more reactivity so once I get

184
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,599
angry with myself so for being a a you know a lousy car owner who doesn't care

185
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:05,700
for his car then I remember then I start remembering

186
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:13,920
um you know that I'm supposed to be a mindfulness teacher who doesn't have reactivity perhaps you know and now I'm

187
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,920
really kind of a bad person because you know I'm at you know now I'm a lousy teacher in addition to it and now that

188
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:27,540
I'm a lousy teacher then um and talking about it to all of you that you know just I just get caught up

189
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:34,380
in my reactivity my embarrassment my conceit my ideas and it's possible that some people

190
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:40,320
that's all they're living in it's just reactivity triggering more reactivity triggering

191
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:46,020
more reactivity and just swirling around and it's so normal that the mind doesn't

192
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:51,240
think that anything of it in a sense this is what life is and the reactivity

193
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:56,280
has some truth to it the the messages from it

194
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:02,760
to have it all quiet down enough to experience ourselves without that

195
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:08,820
reactivity where one thing doesn't trigger another harmful thing another little

196
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:16,339
fire that singes us or a Barb that pokes us but we experience the mind the heart

197
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:22,800
unpoked unsinged kind of becoming relaxing softening

198
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:30,540
opening wow this is possible and that and for that to give rise for

199
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:36,180
the Buddha this this kind of experience gives one of the sources for gladness

200
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:42,119
for this kind of it's kind of an inspiration oh okay and whether the word is should

201
00:41:42,119 --> 00:41:49,619
be gladness it's the word is and um I kind of like the word delight

202
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:58,140
um I kind of but we can't say joy and happiness because those are coming maybe kind of a joy it's evaluative in nature

203
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:07,140
it's the kind of sense of joy that comes from evaluation a realization understanding oh this is a good thing

204
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:12,240
so it does require some engagement involvement to reflect on oh yes take

205
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:18,839
the time to reflect on to think about oh this is a good thing this is this I

206
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:25,380
appreciate this is valuable the nature of reactivity is that it goes

207
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:30,839
non it can go non-stop it never takes a vacation and so we just go from one thing to the

208
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:36,540
next to the next to the next and there's no room to pause and stop and just

209
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:41,880
appreciate the present moment appreciate what can live within us that is not

210
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,040
reactive and the non-reactive life

211
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:52,380
where something begins to flow has movements to flow is one of the things

212
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:58,500
that Dharma practice is moving us towards um where we get out of certain our

213
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:04,500
reactivity gets out of the way so that the current

214
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:12,060
of goodness that is a ve that lives within us as a potential can begin to flow

215
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:17,940
and to begin getting an inkling of this possibility and feel it within us

216
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:25,140
and take the time to appreciate that is allows us to begin feeling a gladness

217
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:30,540
and appreciation a certain kind of joy that's important because when that

218
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:36,000
becomes strong enough or present enough in this non-distracted state

219
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:43,140
of mindfulness that becomes the the seed bed or the the

220
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:50,819
the the river that grows into a stronger one bigger River and that's for that

221
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:57,180
grows into Joy from gladness there arises Joy says the

222
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:03,480
Buddha he doesn't say from gladness now make yourself joyful

223
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:10,260
The Joy just flows the current so um

224
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:16,260
so perhaps today you can take a little bit of extra time

225
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:21,660
here and there through the day to see what it's like to be undistracted

226
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:29,160
in the present moment to allow yourself to find a way to appreciate

227
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:35,579
just being present Here and Now and see that if in that kind of letting

228
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:43,380
go of reactivity and thoughts enough not that you have to stop thinking but enough that maybe you can find some

229
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:49,400
kind of bubbling up flowing up some little hints within

230
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:55,319
of of something that wants to flow radiate move

231
00:44:55,319 --> 00:45:01,640
that is good maybe a beginning of a smile

232
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:06,740
an inner Smile Smile of the hearts

233
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:13,319
so thank you and uh I'm very grateful to all of you that

234
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:18,780

235
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:26,299
