1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,160
welcome to everyone arriving nice to see you

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,080
so let's go ahead and start

3
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,320
so sometimes occasionally

4
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,399
you may experience uh a mind that has a lot of restlessness in it

5
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,120
and I'm saying that a little bit tongue and cheek because I think we all know that one

6
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,440
and other times the mind may seem to be kind of uninterested in meditation

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,120
so we may have restlessness or disinterest can't quite be there and

8
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,559
sometimes we take that to be that itself to be the problem and we try to change

9
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:10,080
how the mind is we think it should be some other way but sometimes when we do that all we're

10
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:17,759
doing is letting go at a surface level and it turns out there's actually something underneath that's driving all

11
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,040
those thoughts or all that resistance and so there can be times where we need

12
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,759
to see the that underlying issue before the mind can settle down so there's

13
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:36,880
restlessness and then sometimes a little investigation can help and sometimes there's some kind of emotion maybe some

14
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,320
kind of discontent or some kind of desire that's often what drives

15
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,920
restlessness so and if you're feeling very calm and

16
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,439
peaceful that's also great but with that little introduction let's

17
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:59,759
let's sit together and have a chance to look more carefully at our minds

18
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:07,759
so settling in now for a to a a posture where you can

19
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,640
stay sitting for half hour or so

20
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:22,080
just allowing the attention to come inward sensing the body

21
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:29,680
in whatever posture you're in knowing that you're moving into a

22
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,959
meditative mind space

23
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,800
in a natural simple way

24
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,720
and starting by feeling into the body

25
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,319
not what it looks like in the mirror but what it feels like right now to be in a

26
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,200
sense in the body

27
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,159
sometimes it's easy to connect first with the contact points

28
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:15,560
the place where you're sitting resting on just feeling your weight

29
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:28,439
the solidity and stability of sitting on a chair a cushion a bed

30
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,159
and allowing yourself to be supported

31
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:50,400
and sensing into the balance of the body sometimes I even rock back and forth

32
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:57,200
slightly or forward and back slightly just to sense that really that middle

33
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,760
balance point as well as possible and inviting the

34
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,000
body to settle There

35
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:29,840
inviting some softening in the face in the shoulders

36
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,680
in the belly arms and legs

37
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,440
and tuning into the sensations of the breath

38
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,560
which are certainly happening in the present moment

39
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:05,759
so this is a way of inviting the mind to connect with the present

40
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,919
the simple life force of the body

41
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,600
breathing in breathing out

42
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:51,639
it can be helpful to invite some further softening on the outreath

43
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:23,159
and bringing up consciously the quality of mindfulness

44
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,280
a simple present moment attention

45
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,880
that doesn't judge what's happening as good or bad right or wrong just sees

46
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,880
clearly

47
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,560
it's easy enough with the breath because there really isn't any right or wrong way to breathe

48
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,000
just notice how the breath is

49
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:50,800
And now noticing the energy in the mind

50
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:57,039
as we settle in we can just at a top level

51
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:03,120
check in is the mind more on the side of being a little

52
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,120
drowsy or dull

53
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,919
more on the side of being a little bit energized or

54
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,160
jumpy restless

55
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:34,519
it's as simple as you know taking the temperature of water putting our hand in is it a little cool a little warm

56
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,640
and just noticing that it's a natural quality of the mind that

57
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,800
the this kind of energy changes

58
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:02,120
throughout the day and even from minute to minute

59
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:43,800
so continuing to stay with the breath as the primary object

60
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:53,760
but in a sense also being aware of the tendency of the mind

61
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,079
toward being a little agitated or a little dull

62
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,920
or perhaps it's perfectly centered at this moment

63
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,720
that happens too

64
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,560
but just resting with the breath and having some curiosity about

65
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,320
the flow of the mind in addition

66
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:59,040
It may be that simply paying attention

67
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:05,880
to the energy level of the mind

68
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:12,360
helps it to find some balance balance

69
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:20,720
it's a little bit like the dynamic balance of riding a bicycle

70
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,560
you're never completely balanced on a bicycle but always making very slight

71
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:33,000
corrections back toward the center

72
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,720
it's possible for the for that to happen in meditation too

73
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,000
with the right balance of conditions we stay with the breath and

74
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,800
a little agitated but then that settles out a little dull but then

75
00:14:52,800 --> 00:15:01,000
that returns to balance

76
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:12,600
and sometimes not sometimes the mind is really determined

77
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:20,880
to not stay present and if that's the case

78
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,279
it can be helpful to notice next time it happens

79
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:32,399
what did it feel like what does it feel like when the mind is

80
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:37,440
continually moving away is there something else

81
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:44,440
there right before it goes off or it gets dull

82
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,680
continuing

83
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:13,798
to breathe along with the flow of the mind

84
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:41,679
and as we continue to bring mindfulness to the mind

85
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:48,799
the flow of the mind A gentle reminder that

86
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:55,520
mindfulness is not deciding what should and shouldn't happen

87
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:02,240
it simply is being with what is happening

88
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:09,360
so mindfulness has kind of an inherent aspect of contentment

89
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,120
being okay with what is actually happening in the

90
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,120
present

91
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:29,200
whereas the moment where the mind gets caught in a thought

92
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:37,679
or a desire is kind of a moment of discontent in the mind something else would be better than

93
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:46,840
this present moment seeing a contrast between

94
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,520
the discontent of restlessness and desire

95
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:00,559
the contentment of noticing and being with how things are

96
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,039
at this moment

97
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:59,799
can we be content with a mind that is sometimes restless

98
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,799
and sometimes not

99
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,159
once again we feel the ease and the safety

100
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:23,400
just being mindful

101
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:34,559
nothing is a problem if we're aware of it

102
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:28,200
and as we move toward the end of our formal sitting

103
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,879
beginning to have a sense of

104
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:42,720
what it means to be okay with things as they are

105
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,919
the dharmapata says contentment is the greatest wealth

106
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:57,640
it doesn't mean accepting terrible things

107
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:06,240
somehow validating things that we don't agree with but that very base level of yeah this is

108
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,240
how it is at this moment and when we do that with our mind which

109
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,880
is sometimes discontented restless restless or dull

110
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,279
we can then carry that into our day

111
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:33,799
as we move through tasks that we enjoy tasks that we don't enjoy so much

112
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:42,200
just managing the mind well through all of those changes

113
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:51,320
staying with things staying with interactions

114
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:59,039
that may not be to our liking but we can be content to know yes

115
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:08,120
I'm present i'm going through this it's such a gift to ourselves and to others

116
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,039
to have this gentle awareness of the mind

117
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:25,720
so wishing as we go through our day

118
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:34,520
may all beings find some degree of internal ease

119
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:43,080
may they learn to be with the ups and downs of the mind

120
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,279
and I will walk through the world in that way in order to support that

121
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:55,799
process for all

122
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:00,360
may it be so

123
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:11,669
[Music]

124
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:22,829
[Music]

125
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:36,229
[Music]

126
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,919
okay so this week we are exploring the

127
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:06,080
dharma through animal simileies as I mentioned yesterday

128
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:15,279
and they're designed to kind of move us along uh a path that the mind follows as it

129
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:21,120
progresses from you know being relatively unprotected to becoming

130
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:27,200
stronger and wiser same path that we walk as we walk this path of insight

131
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:34,000
during the insight practices that Gil has been emphasizing in his series

132
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,039
the Buddha often taught via simileies and they're they're very very rich and

133
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:47,760
they're not they're not only mental they're not meant to just be things that we think about but they can actually be

134
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,960
kind of visceral you know felt in the in the body so that's the invitation perhaps as we

135
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,640
go through the week is to feel how you can connect with what we're talking

136
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:08,799
about literally in your own body and your own experience so we started yesterday with the quail

137
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,720
and that was about how when we get caught up in the five senses we allow

138
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,880
mara the forces of distraction or difficulty to gain access and bring us

139
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:28,000
duca suffering stress whereas if we stay mindful which is our ancestral home as

140
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,760
it said in the four foundations of mindfulness that keeps us safe even if

141
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:40,880
we are in a minds you know relatively weak like the quail let's say

142
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,240
so today

143
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:53,039
we are moving on to the monkey that's the animal for today and interestingly

144
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,399
there is a nearly identical suta to the one about the quail that features a

145
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:03,919
monkey instead uh so it's kind of a nice transition and you know we won't read

146
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:09,279
the whole thing but it um it says the same kind of thing is that there are

147
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:14,399
places where neither monkeys nor humans can go and then there are places where

148
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:21,039
monkeys can go but not humans those are places that are safe for them and then there are places where both monkeys and

149
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:28,559
humans can go and there monkeys can get trapped apparently and so um one kind of

150
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:36,320
trap features a tar pit apparently and the monkey gets caught by grabbing he he

151
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:43,840
gets stuck in the tar with one paw and then trying to free himself from that he

152
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,880
grabs it with the other paw and then that one gets stuck so then he tries a foot and that gets stuck in the other

153
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:57,679
foot and finally the mouth and so in a sense um we again have these five right

154
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:04,720
five things getting stuck the five sense bases and um that happens because the

155
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:11,679
monkey doesn't realize he's attracted to this apparently there's something sweet in the tar and he doesn't realize that's

156
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,599
what's happening and so continues to stick and stick and stick in more places

157
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,280
and so this is um uh the emphasis is not so much on weakness or vulnerability

158
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,760
ability like the quail but kind of foolishness you know not realizing that

159
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:37,919
uh the monkey is catching himself so um so in these contexts the monkey

160
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:45,040
represents in a certain way the forces within us that attract us to what isn't helpful and how we get caught again in

161
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,960
that the quail was portrayed as weak and the monkey is really more portrayed as foolish

162
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:59,040
uh in allowing allowing himself to do that because monkeys are nominally intelligent right um but maybe not using

163
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,240
their full potential in those cases so there's more to this monkey simile if

164
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,680
we then look to other sutas we start to get a richer sense of what the Buddha is

165
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:16,160
suggesting here you may have heard the phrase monkey mind um often people use

166
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:22,560
this term for restlessness in meditation and there are two references to monkeys

167
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:28,480
as a simile for the mind in the sutas and they fill out this idea kind of nicely

168
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:35,440
so the first one is the monkey mind of consciousness uh leaping from object to

169
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:42,160
object and maybe that's kind of the the way we often imagine it it's really it's

170
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:48,480
not just restlessness there's a little bit more to it so this this foundation

171
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,960
of the foundation of restlessness as well as of things like desire and aversion the ways where the mind tends

172
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,160
to go off of staying calmly in the present moment the foundation is

173
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:06,160
discontent of not being okay with just this moment of needing to seek something

174
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:14,000
else and then going from thing to thing like a monkey swinging through the forest i have I feel like we can all

175
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,599
understand this image pretty well from our own mind so I wanted to say a little

176
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:26,320
bit about the actual teaching where it comes from um the monkey mind suta is in the samuta

177
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:33,680
nikaya and it says that it starts out saying that uh somebody might not have

178
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:40,320
any problem letting go of the body the idea of the body as a self um but it's

179
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:45,760
very difficult to let go of the mind or the intellect or consciousness buddha

180
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,520
uses all three terms and then now I'll quote from the suta uh why can't they

181
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:58,320
let go of that for what reason because for a long time this has been held to by

182
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:04,800
that person appropriated and grasped thus this is mine this I am this is

183
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:11,280
myself therefore the uninstructed person is unable to experience disenchantment

184
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,280
toward the mind unable to become dispassionate toward it and liberated from it

185
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:23,359
it would be better for such a person to take as the self the body composed of

186
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,119
the four great elements rather than the mind why is that because this body is

187
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:37,040
seen standing for 1 year 2 years 3 4 5 or 10 20 30 40 or 50 years even 100

188
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:44,240
years or longer but that which is called mind or mentality or consciousness

189
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,440
arises as one thing and ceases as another by day and by night and then

190
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,040
here's the image just as a monkey roaming through a forest grabs hold of

191
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:00,079
one branch lets that go and grabs another then lets that go and grabs

192
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,839
still another so too that which is called mind or consciousness arises as

193
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:11,280
one thing and ceases as another by day and by night

194
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:18,560
and then the teaching goes on to say that we can observe uh dependent arising we can observe that the the mind too is

195
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:25,440
impersonal and should not be identified with uh as a self because the way it

196
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,960
flow is is actually just conditioned it's not really about me and mine it's

197
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,240
that one thought triggers an association and that brings on an emotion and then

198
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:42,400
that emotion triggers a body sensation and then the body sensation is unpleasant and so we have another

199
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,480
thought about the unpleasantness of that etc etc etc there's this flow to the

200
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,400
mind the Buddha isn't really saying we should identify with the body as itself but he's saying it makes more sense

201
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,920
right the body is a little bit more stable more constant in some way than

202
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:06,240
the mind which is continually continually changing so now we're getting into more detail than we had

203
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:13,520
with the quail so monkey mind is not just a criticism of restlessness or

204
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:20,800
anxiety or you know mental movement it's actually an invitation to investigate

205
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,800
how the mind moves from one state to another continually the mind is leaping

206
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,400
about but it's not doing so randomly there's a flow of conditions and when we

207
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,240
see that it helps us not to not identify so much with the stream of thoughts or

208
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,400
emotions and that is the way to really let go of all that restlessness doesn't

209
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,839
mean it goes away necessarily but it allows us even in that moment just of

210
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:55,119
observing it we're stepping back from it and instead of being right in that

211
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:01,440
swinging monkey from branch to branch we step back and say "Wow look at all that

212
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:08,480
restlessness look at all that proliferation of thought." There's a dharmapata verse that says

213
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:15,520
people delight in proliferation of thought but Buddhas are free of proliferation so that's one of the

214
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,960
qualities of the Buddha is the mind doesn't go off and we start by just

215
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,880
stepping back and being able to see wow look at my mind going crazy at this

216
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,720
moment or really getting caught up it's fascinating to just watch that and have

217
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:40,240
you know have have some some ability to be aware of it and then the second monkey simile I said

218
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:46,240
there were two is also worth talking about it's along the same idea as this

219
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:52,800
momentto- moment flow of monkey mind but it's on a longer time scale so in a

220
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:59,839
different suta the Buddha comments on some practitioner's tendency to move

221
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:05,599
around from teacher to teacher from technique to technique from tradition to

222
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:13,040
tradition never settling in on one practice and really going deep so in

223
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:19,200
this case he says having let go of the last they lay hold of the next and the

224
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:26,079
implication there is the teacher having let go of the last teacher they lay hold of the next teacher following impulse

225
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:32,480
they don't get past the snare they grab on and let go like a monkey grabbing and

226
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,680
releasing a branch so it's this is a verse so it's a little

227
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:43,200
bit more poetic than the pros I was reading before but in this text the

228
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:51,119
Buddha is pointing out that there are people who engage in spiritual practice by looking externally this teacher's got

229
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:58,079
it no this teacher's got it oh no i'm not with them anymore or this practice oh this is it i finally found it no and

230
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,359
then 3 weeks later oh I'm on to the next practice um people are kind of looking

231
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:11,440
for a particular experience or a philosophy from the outside that they can hold on to and claim that now I've

232
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,040
got it now this is success now now my mind will is pure something like that

233
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,079
there's some idea or ideal that they're looking for and if if that's the

234
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,560
attitude in how we're seeking teachings and practices we're bound to be disappointed

235
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:36,000
and so hence uh the person goes and seeks the next thing the next thing like the monkey swinging on it's the same

236
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:41,920
idea can you see that it's the same idea as the mind in moment to moment like in

237
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:48,640
meditation thinking this thought then that thought this emotion getting caught up in this it's just on a longer time

238
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:55,520
scale so there's a way in which the Buddha says just look at this tendency that we

239
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:02,560
have to not be willing to be with one thing not be willing to just stay in the

240
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:08,960
present um so but instead to be able to watch oh why is the mind moving from

241
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,160
this to this to this is there something underneath where it's a little bit discontent

242
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,800
looking for an ideal looking for an experience this isn't it it must be somewhere else

243
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,079
so my my addition to the monkey simile I think you get the the idea now of what

244
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:33,760
this represents is that monkeys have large brains and a lot of potential capability but they don't always use it

245
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,280
well they have this slight foolishness sometimes about how it gets directed and

246
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:47,119
there are ways where that may be happening for us too we have great potential in our human mind but to open

247
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,160
this up we have to learn somehow to navigate our hindrances um the

248
00:43:52,160 --> 00:44:00,160
hindrances can be seen as ways that we hold ourselves back that we don't use our full potential and so we have this

249
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,680
very humble training of just watching the very first step is to be able to see

250
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:11,760
ah this is what the mind is doing flowing from this to this to this there's a discontentment there's a

251
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:18,480
grabbing there's a pushing away and daily life mindfulness having some continuity throughout the whole day

252
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:26,560
really helps us develop that even further than what we do in meditation so mindfulness practice is not always um

253
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:32,720
all that glamorous but it um it is something that we can stay with and if

254
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:39,520
we stay with it it continually goes deeper and deeper we don't need a lot of different techniques back to the four

255
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:46,560
foundations of mindfulness and continuing to stay with that looking inward looking inward continuing to

256
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:51,920
watch the flow of the mind we'll start to see the patterns and be able to

257
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:59,359
settle down and just see how the mind works and be content with uh the flow of

258
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:04,560
life as it is things do change by themselves we don't need to continually

259
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:10,560
keep seeking them so some of our early insights to tie into the insight theme

260
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,960
are insights into the hindrances and our tend tendencies toward certain kinds of

261
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:24,319
thought patterns and emotions not always fun to see that but really great um

262
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:33,040
self-nowledge is rarely good news is sometimes said but it's also said that when we are willing to see uh those we

263
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:41,440
can have a real sense of sorry if there's some background noise distortion in the zoom because of that um when

264
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:49,359
we're really able to see that then we're doing the practice you know then we're starting to settle out of the hindrances

265
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:55,760
and settle in to the four foundations of mindfulness our protection and our place

266
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:03,440
of refuge so the monkey as a a way an invitation to investigate and

267
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:09,599
see the flow of the mind then we'll move on to another animal tomorrow as we

268
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:16,440
continue our journey through insight thank you so much
