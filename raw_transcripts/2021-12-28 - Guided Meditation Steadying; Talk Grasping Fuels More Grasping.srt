1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,199
so good day everyone and

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:15,000
welcome and so meditation practice

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,840
the analogy that is coming back to my mind today about

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,359
sitting down to meditate is the idea of

5
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:37,200
not staying in the control tower but rather to uh be the airplane

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,399
that's coming in for a landing and i imagine that the pilot and if the

7
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,879
airplane was animated was a living being would be focused

8
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,879
for the landing would put aside

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:04,239
concerns and thoughts about the future in the past and they would really kind of enter into the

10
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:11,040
moment of landing and if the airplane was an animate being it

11
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,320
would stabilize itself it would enter into its very body its wings and really

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,479
become stable interesting stability to really be focused the way that some of you might be

13
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,680
focused if you're doing a craft or an art or something where

14
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,079
it takes a careful attention you have to give yourself completely over to the event and everything else kind of falls aside

15
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,720
and even there might be people around and you're going to do something careful and

16
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,920
and and so you kind of the sounds around you kind of fall away

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,240
you don't really listening to anyone anymore but you're just really kind of there for that experience

18
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,360
so to when we start the meditation practice to think of it this way that we're

19
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,439
somehow dropping out of the control tower in the head

20
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,039
into the body of this being that we are coming in for a

21
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,480
landing gathering ourselves together being centered

22
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,720
feeling ourselves here so then so assuming a posture

23
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,480
that would help you feel present in your body

24
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,800
as if your body your body and your posture

25
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:48,000
are the means of meditation so taking a posture that maybe is

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,879
upright if you're sitting upright a little bit straighter than usual

27
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,360
and then to gently close your eyes

28
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:11,400
as a way of beginning to turn your attention inward to your body

29
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:29,120
and to prepare yourself for [Music] so that you can give your attention over

30
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,440
to this body dropping out of the control tower

31
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,760
you might take a few long slow deep breaths

32
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,480
in a relaxed pace only as deep as is comfortable for you

33
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,560
then exhale fully

34
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,480
long exhale but not too long just long enough that

35
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,120
you have a sense that you're participating in the exhale

36
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,320
as if the exhale is the plane coming down for a landing

37
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,320
and then letting your breathing return to normal

38
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:59,280
and continuing with your breathing with the exhale

39
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,039
the relaxing of your body

40
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,160
is a gathering yourself together around your body so coming home centering in

41
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,440
the body it's more than just relaxing your face

42
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,639
or your shoulders or your belly

43
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,880
it's a remembering of yourself bring your members of your

44
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,280
body together

45
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,720
relaxing the shoulders

46
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,039
relaxing the hands

47
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,039
relaxing the thighs and the legs

48
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,840
relaxing the back ribcage

49
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:09,360
and relaxing the control tower relaxing the thinking muscle

50
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:15,240
tension tightening pressure to think

51
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,918
breathing in and breathing out

52
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,080
here

53
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,240
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

54
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:06,000
to once again on the exhale relax your body

55
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,799
if it feels okay just gently taking some deeper breaths again

56
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:18,960
very gently and then see if there's

57
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:27,520
further forms of releasing in your body you can do as you exhale

58
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,960
releasing the belly

59
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,399
relaxing in the chest

60
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,360
softening in the face

61
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:15,399
releasing tension or pressure in the thinking mind

62
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:40,240
and to feel yourself established present

63
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,880
here in your body and to consider that

64
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,720
our ability to offer embodied attention

65
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,639
our ability to be present for others

66
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,600
is the root the origin the support

67
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,279
for anything that follows for any compassion or kindness

68
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:18,880
friendliness and not to rush ahead to

69
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:27,039
be kind or friendly compassionate so that you leave behind your ability to

70
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:31,840
be rooted or centered here

71
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,000
in your ability to attend

72
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,799
sometimes what's profound with the profound offering to others is our

73
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:51,600
presence our attention our ability to accompany others

74
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:59,159
sometimes that's more important than our compassion our kindness our care

75
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:10,398
so staying rooted here in your relaxed attention

76
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:17,360
with that as a basis to dedicate the benefits from this

77
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,960
practice for the welfare and happiness of others

78
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:32,240
may all beings be happy may all beings

79
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,480
be safe may all beings

80
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:47,080
be peaceful and may all beings be free

81
00:29:50,710 --> 00:30:02,039
[Music]

82
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,840
thank you

83
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,720
so hello again everyone

84
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:30,640
what's on my mind this morning is the

85
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:39,679
interesting fact that the in the language of the buddha

86
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,919
the word for grasping sometimes is translated as clinging the

87
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:51,600
word for grasping is also the same word used for the fuel

88
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:57,600
for grasping so the word is

89
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,399
and it's um upa and a

90
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:09,519
and it's um it can mean the fuel for a fire

91
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:15,120
what on what fire burns and it could also mean grasping and clinging

92
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:21,120
and there's a way in which grasping something being clinging being attached

93
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:28,240
is the fuel for more grasping and so if i'm allowed to do this example

94
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,360
of you know if i keep my hand open

95
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:39,679
that's fine but if i make a loose fist with my hand

96
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:47,279
now something exists that didn't exist before when the hand was open now there exists a fist

97
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,799
and now it's possible to become attached to the fist and

98
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,480
and so i might hold on to it tighter clenched a little bit more tightly with my hand

99
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:06,480
and if i go around with my clenched hand for a long time the it starts to hurt and be uncomfortable

100
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:13,840
and one response i might have to that discomfort is to clench even more to tighten up oh

101
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:20,399
this is not field doesn't feel good and so there's a progressive way in which i start with something which

102
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:28,000
doesn't exist i create something which is new a grasping of the hand

103
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,919
that's uncomfortable or that's something that i'm attached to and progressively i

104
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,360
each step along the way i'm grasping to what is grasped

105
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:46,960
the very thing that i'm grasping to is the source for grasping even more

106
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:53,200
and so there's a cycle then of attachment if we see attachment

107
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:59,840
is the fuel for more attachment and that that cycle cannot be broken

108
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,279
if we keep doing more attachment to keep grasping even more

109
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:12,720
and so this uh you can see this sometimes in the thinking mind where there's a drive a push to think a

110
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:19,040
preoccupation a strength we could say an attachment to grasping to thoughts to ideas to trying to figure

111
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,800
things out to make plans to make ourselves safe you know just swirling around

112
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,919
reviewing the past what did it you know repeating the same conversation with someone over and over again

113
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:36,560
and there's a kind of a drive a pressure to think and that pressure

114
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,560
is the very source for having more pressure

115
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:49,440
grasping to certain ideas trying to accomplish something with our thoughts is on can become uncomfortable

116
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,040
that discomfort our system reacts to wants to find more comfort and

117
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,320
if it thinks that comfort is found through thinking then the very

118
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:07,280
this very the very thing that's causing the discomfort is what we'll give ourselves over to

119
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:14,240
more to try to figure out even more so it becomes a kind of cyclic cyclic

120
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,359
where uh we are attached to something we're cling to something we grasp at

121
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:25,280
something and um uh and

122
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:30,320
that sense of motion sits in motion or sets the ground the foundation for

123
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:37,599
doing more of the same and so this thing of doing more of the same that reinforces the same over and

124
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:42,839
over again uh when it when they were doing something which is unhealthy and

125
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:48,160
stressful for ourselves uh is not you know a sooner or later we

126
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:54,800
have to realize this is not working and for some people they don't discover that for decades

127
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:01,599
it's uh not an easy thing to discover that the very approach we have to help make

128
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,560
ourselves safe or get what we want or or

129
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:14,560
you know is not is the very source from which is making us unsafe making us stressful

130
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:20,960
and so grasping is the fuel for more grasping attachment

131
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,880
is the fuel for more attachment so the at some point we have to step out

132
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:34,079
of this cyclic movement we have to kind of be willing to somehow realize oh that's not the way anymore

133
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:39,119
and so in meditation at some point it becomes a

134
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:46,160
hopefully a clear idea a clearer sense you know and for me to continue thinking this way

135
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:52,480
it just doesn't work this this kind of thinking is i'm caught in a labyrinth a self-fulfilling

136
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:58,480
perpetual motion labyrinth that just keeps fueling itself

137
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,760
and um i'm going to stop investing in it i'm going to stop

138
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,040
giving myself over to it i think it's time to step away

139
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:15,359
and and we step away into awareness into the mindfulness that

140
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:20,480
the mindfulness is not the attachment the mindfulness of the attachment is a

141
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,599
way of stepping away we can step away into our body

142
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,920
and begin to relax our body the tension the stress of grasping

143
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,160
is often expressed or found in tension in our body and so if we can

144
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:43,520
relax the body reduce the tension of the body it goes a

145
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:49,520
long way in helping us relax the tension in the mind sometimes the tension we have in our

146
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:55,680
mind we don't have we can't find our way to see well where do i relax relax where do

147
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,800
i let go how do i stop this it's really hard sometimes when we see

148
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,320
it just as a mental thing beginning to relax the body quiet the

149
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:13,599
body and maybe use mindfulness or breathing or some kind of meditation to begin um

150
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:20,320
calming thinking mind and this progressive calming and quieting at the body of the mind

151
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,359
releasing attention at some point we get to the point where it seems oh you know

152
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:33,119
i can just not think anymore this way i don't have to be caught in this discursive thinking say okay enough

153
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:39,520
and then maybe for a few moments you can get quiet for a few moments you can have this mental peace and quiet and then you can

154
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:45,599
focus more on the breathing and then um and then so just as grasping

155
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:51,599
is a fuel for more grasping at some point the equation switches over

156
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:58,800
that that peace is the fuel for more peace

157
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:05,520
calm is the fuel for more calm clarity is the food for more clarity

158
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,880
and um and uh you can feel that so if i open my hand

159
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,760
and feel how nice it is to have an open hand it's relaxed and open and at ease

160
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:25,200
then that is feeling that ease is support for having more ease when i

161
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,560
do it i can find myself feel the ease of my hand i feel my shoulders release a little bit

162
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,960
and and i value that and so i stay close to that feeling of

163
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,440
ease and so the slightest little movement to tighten up i notice oh wait a minute

164
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,720
the peace that's there that's the way forward and so i relax my hand

165
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,720
so to begin understanding this principle can be very helpful

166
00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:01,280
um that to

167
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:11,720
to be willing to see that grasping is the fuel for more grasping

168
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,160
and letting go of that grasping is the way towards peace

169
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,920
but it's not as linear way to peace sometimes while we were grasping is to

170
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:30,000
protect ourselves or get away from or cope with difficulties in our life strong emotions

171
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,200
difficult emotions that we might have and and so

172
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:41,599
that we have to sometimes go through that and really feel what's going on so the example i gave of grasping the

173
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:48,319
hand if i do a light grasp clenching of the hand and then that feels uncomfortable i'm

174
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:55,839
trying to get away from that discomfort and i clench even more as i relax the hand i might feel that

175
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:02,079
initial layer where it was uncomfortable and it might feel very very uncomfortable i'm not i don't like being

176
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,839
there and and then i clench even more so we have to learn to be willing to go

177
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:13,520
through this feeling of discomfort as we do this layer releasing the layers of

178
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:18,560
grasping that we have until we come to the place where peace

179
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,400
is uh the fuel for more peace clarity is the full for

180
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,000
fuel for more clarity so thank you

181
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,480
for all very much for all this and um we'll continue tomorrow and um

182
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:43,280
maybe by tomorrow or next day we'll have a sense of the theme for the week um today i'm just kind of didn't didn't

183
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,480
come up with a feed theme for this week so i just uh kind of

184
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,800
coming along as we coming coming along as we go today this week next week

185
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:02,000
there will be a theme and uh and that will start the

186
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,160
the the series on the four foundations of mindfulness on the based on the sati patana sutra the

187
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,520
discourse on the on the on on mindfulness to the buddha taught

188
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:19,119
it'll be comparable to them how we did anapanasati at the beginning of last year the mindfulness of

189
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,640
breathing but it will go through it systematically over a few weeks

190
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:33,720
so so this week maybe no theme yet thank you all very much
