1
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:07,840
so good morning everyone or good day

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:15,480
and it's raining here which is quite lovely I'm very fond of the

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,519
rain though I think I'm fond of all the weather maybe because being in the

4
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,760
weather means being outdoors and it's just a

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,840
wonderful connection to uh feel the world through the outdoor atmosphere

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,559
air weather

7
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:46,280
ground I was happy coming down here today

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,280
so becoming wise about thinking is not only useful for

9
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,399
ourselves it's also useful for this world of ours and I'll talk more about

10
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:04,878
that later today but but one way of becoming wise about thinking is to have a clear sense

11
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,200
of the source of thinking where inside of us does

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:19,119
thinking begin what triggers it what energizes it what influences its

13
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,680
mood and and qual characteristics of the thinking that we

14
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:30,360
do before we start thinking before there's a thought

15
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:37,759
what is the environment in which thinking will occur what's the emotional state we have what are the beliefs we

16
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:44,399
have what are the fears or desires which are motivating or influencing how we

17
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:51,479
think and are we thinking and from where are we thinking from where do thoughts

18
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:57,759
arise many people if you say it's comment that someone seems stuck in

19
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,399
their thoughts they might point to their head they're all up in their head meaning they're just thinking a lot about

20
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:09,360
things and uh is in fact for you the

21
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,040
location for thinking in the head and might there be other locations from

22
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,200
which thinking might arise my teacher in Burma if you asked

23
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,959
him uh where thinking occurs he always would point to the

24
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:34,879
heart there are some people who would point to the belly and uh and for them thinking

25
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:44,120
arises from their relaxed belly soft peaceful kind of floating sense of

26
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,800
belless and it it it uh has a big impact on us where our thinking arises from so

27
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:58,239
in this meditation I want to I guide you through an exploration of

28
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,200
thinking and maybe that's it'll be more talking for me than usual but it's such

29
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,280
a phenomenally important skill and knowledge to

30
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:16,599
acquire this about thinking that it'll support all your future meditations and maybe your

31
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:21,360
life so to assume a meditation

32
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:31,000
posture with the taking your posture

33
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,920
is it when you already begin being mindful mindful of the sensations and

34
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:45,120
feelings of your body so that you line up the body in

35
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:52,239
such a way that the body Fe begins to feel harmonious or

36
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,480
aligned and you are attuned to your

37
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
body

38
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:20,919
gently taking some deeper breaths comfortably deeper

39
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:27,199
Fuller and as you exhale to relax into your

40
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
body

41
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:48,960
to relax down into your sitting bones if you're sitting

42
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,560
upright relax into your spine and hip

43
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,000
hips as you and your head all the bones that rest against a surface if you're

44
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
lying

45
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,479
down letting your breathing return to normal continue this process of

46
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,600
relaxing maybe with a notion of deep

47
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:41,440
relaxation the different parts of the body I'll point to maybe you can feel them

48
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:50,199
deeply the muscles of the face relax as you

49
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,360
exhale the

50
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,680
shoulders the rib C rib

51
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,800
cage and deep in your upper

52
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:49,360
torso and the belly releasing the belly to the pull of

53
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
gravity

54
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:18,400
centering yourself on your breathing breathing in an easy natural

55
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:25,800
way and if it's not that way don't be bothered by how you're

56
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:33,919
breathing instead accompany a breathing which feels strained or

57
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:40,479
constricted or just accompany it it's

58
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
okay

59
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:34,120
and then feel your way into your body feel your way to

60
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:41,360
where the location is for your thinking whether you think in words or

61
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:48,920
in images or whether you think in without words there's but there's a

62
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:55,200
cognitive knowing that maybe you feel is

63
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,200
wordless where is the center of cognition for you

64
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:09,720
is it in the center of the head behind the

65
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:17,160
eyes is it in the Torso or the

66
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:27,320
belly if it's in the head is in near the front of the head behind the

67
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:35,880
forehead or the back of the head if you see images do those images

68
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,920
appear in front of

69
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,320
you is there any sense of a

70
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,079
projector that's projecting the

71
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
images

72
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:17,279
a location for thinking may come with a sense

73
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,399
of pressure or

74
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,320
contraction feeling that this is a place where things are dense

75
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,760
or

76
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:46,560
tight there might be a directionality as if that location

77
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,680
is leaning forward or pulling

78
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:56,639
back sinking down

79
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,959
or ready to soar

80
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:17,720
upwards allow yourself to think if thinking wants to

81
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:25,839
happen but don't focus on the content of your thoughts see if you can

82
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,959
recognize the location we're thinking

83
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:43,519
occurs or if thinking occurs everywhere where's the center of

84
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:52,600
everywhere and what what Sensations come along with thinking the thinking

85
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
mind

86
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
e

87
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:47,480
independent of what you're thinking

88
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:56,240
about does your tendency to think come along with a wanting

89
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:04,120
something a general feeling not a thing but a general attitude of

90
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,360
wanting or an attitude of

91
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,800
aversion or an attitude of

92
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,839
fear or

93
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:33,319
confusion an attitude of

94
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:38,639
overwhelm

95
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:53,360
discouragement and if there is some attitude that is there and almost precedes your

96
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:04,759
thinking it's okay okay for now for it to be there but feel the location where that

97
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:11,079
occurs make room for it feel it know

98
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,480
it know the attitude more than knowing what you're

99
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,880
thinking

100
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:34,480
about breathe with

101
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
it

102
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
e

103
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:00,519
if you stand on your tippy toes reaching up as high as you can with

104
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:08,639
your hands into the air high up stretching yourself up and hold that for a

105
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,639
while your whole body will be tired

106
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:23,440
tense wobbly but then if you

107
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:31,319
relax feet firm on the ground maybe even sit down maybe even

108
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:39,959
lay down all the tension all the holding the body is no longer

109
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:48,360
needed and feeling the support of the floor something deep inside can relax

110
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,440
that can't relax stretching upwards on your

111
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,160
toes in the same way we can live live our lives and kind

112
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,039
of psychologically as if we're in our tippy

113
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:15,240
toes allow without changing your posture as you

114
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:23,918
exhale relax your whole body relax internally

115
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:29,480
externally as if your conscious mind

116
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,919
your awareness is has a chance to sit down

117
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:45,000
relax lay down deep to the deepest place of relaxation

118
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,200
within feeling your way into your depths to the place where things are

119
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,400
most peaceful and relaxed calm for

120
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
you

121
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,120
whatever degree of calm or relaxation that's available for

122
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:29,600
you that's calmer than you are otherwise relax and to that

123
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:39,679
place of calm or peace as if your mind can come to rest

124
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:48,480
there maybe with every exhale settling more into that place

125
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,080
deep inside of Peace

126
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
calm

127
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,919
gently breathing with the location in your

128
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:36,159
body that is calm or peaceful or at least calmer or more

129
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:43,720
peaceful you than your usual thinking mind almost as if you're going below

130
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:49,799
your usual thinking into a place that's more

131
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:57,240
intimate more [Music] safe more at ease than your thinking

132
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:02,440
mind with every

133
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,840
breath let

134
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
go

135
00:20:51,720 --> 00:21:00,120
and from this calmer depth within you listen carefully

136
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:09,559
carefully bring a careful attention and from

137
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:18,080
here are there is there a different form of thinking that arises for

138
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:26,080
you see if it can be a thinking that you don't latch on to you don't get involved

139
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:32,520
in you just allow it to appear like

140
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:39,400
a water flowing from a

141
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,600
deep into the surface from a deep underwater

142
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,000
spring what deep thoughts are

143
00:21:53,400 --> 00:22:00,880
there as you get out of the way to let them flow as they

144
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
wish

145
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:46,520
in the way that your usual thinking mind would get quiet if you were listening to

146
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:52,360
a very faint sound in the distance let the usual thinking mind

147
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:59,159
become quiet for a little bit so you can sense or listen

148
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:05,440
to some of the quietest the quietest source of thinking

149
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,640
within maybe not listening to the content of those

150
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:20,320
thoughts but what does it feel like what are the sensations and attitudes

151
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:27,960
and moods associated with thinking from the

152
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,120
the

153
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
depths

154
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:29,799
a profound

155
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,240
understanding is that no matter what you're

156
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:46,080
thinking thinking is not who you are really it's not who you

157
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,640
are who you

158
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:03,480
are is found in that within you that

159
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:09,320
awareness which is independent of your

160
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:19,840
thoughts in the way that if you're listening to someone speaking maybe listening to strangers

161
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,960
speak not to you but to each other you would clearly feel like you

162
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:31,000
were independent from what they're

163
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
saying

164
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,320
and then as we come to the end of the

165
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,799
sitting again on the exhale settle into the deepest place of

166
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:44,840
calm that's available to

167
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:54,679
you and from there think thoughts of good

168
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:59,600

free and may we remember to care for for

176
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,440
others from the soft depths within us

[Music]

178
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:55,559
thank [Music]

179
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
you

180
00:30:18,039 --> 00:30:25,039
so hello and welcome to this third talk on wise

181
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:32,159
thinking and one of the reasons why this topic of

182
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:40,240
mindfulness of thinking wise thinking is so important is that the way that

183
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,720
we relate to our thinking

184
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:53,279
is also related to how we it's also connected to how we relate to anything

185
00:30:53,279 --> 00:31:00,240
that comes from outside of us any information ideas content and specifically what's been on

186
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:10,240
my mind lately is the way that we relate to Media the way we relate to our

187
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,799
screens uh everything that comes through a screen one way or the other represents

188
00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:23,720
someone else's thinking someone has produced it designed it thought it

189
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,080
out and so in that sense we're we're constantly living in someone else's

190
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:34,360
content of their thoughts that they've created for us and in some sense maybe that was

191
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:43,000
clear as when we are reading something that someone has put their thoughts on paper but when we in uh watching screens

192
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,240
and videos and consuming news that we

193
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:55,559
have um you know how do we relate to it and I would like to propose it's an

194
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:00,799
unhealthy way of relating to it is how many people relate to their own

195
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:07,159
thinking where the consumers of information consumers of opinions even

196
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:13,120
if we don't like them or approve of them we take them in we react to them so

197
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:22,679
often as a society as a whole for many people their thoughts are the same way there's no sense of of um

198
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:28,320
of uh distance from their thoughts or sense of questioning their thoughts or

199
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,880
mindfulness of thinking what's really going on there there's a way which many people are just living in their thoughts

200
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:41,120
carried by their thoughts influenced by their thoughts uh un uh without any reflection without any awareness of how

201
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:49,600
much we're being influenced by them we have an opinion and or a bias or a um an

202
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,480
advertisement or a projection that we want to convey to the world and it's just second nature we don't even realize

203
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:00,799
we're doing it and uh we carry a lot of our thinking carries

204
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:07,480
ourselves uh our self-concept sometimes the way that we talk and think is kind of like an

205
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:13,799
advertisement for ourselves our desires what we want and it's strategizing we

206
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:19,639
have a whole you know marketing maybe uh Department in our mind that's trying to

207
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:25,600
figure out what we want and get so what we can learn by becoming

208
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:32,399
independent of our thinking see our thinking clearly what we can learn from thinking

209
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:39,039
learning how to think from a place of uh deep within us that has no attachment

210
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:44,120
that has no fears that the place of that's free of

211
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:50,679
stress the place that's free of wanting and not wanting the deepest

212
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:56,279
Wellspring of relaxed thinking that we can have where it's easy for us to be

213
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:03,000
independent of the content of what's being thought so we can be

214
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:10,800
independent of the unusually odd things that we might be thinking through the day and a few of us have odd things we

215
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,638
think but we don't think about that because we're living in it just so obvious and

216
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:24,480
um uh unhealthy things we don't think they're unhealthy because it's just second nature that we should be upset

217
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,638
with ourselves or feel shame about ourselves and have thought like that or that it's second nature to want to get

218
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,398
what we want um to have what we we want and so there's a lot of strategies about

219
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:42,158
you know of course I should think about and try to figure out how to get what I want because uh that's just natural

220
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:48,760
that's how it should be so we're not independent and so to learn how to step

221
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:56,560
back and be independent of our own thoughts so that when we do think we can

222
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:03,040
think more wisely more creatively more objectively more

223
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,800
connected to the deepest Wellsprings of compassion and care and

224
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:15,560
kindness if we learn to do it with ourselves and then we can apply that to

225
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:24,040
Media apply that to how we are we don't become consumers of news consumers of

226
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:31,359
what's on our screens but we become um in a sense we become independent of

227
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:37,200
it where we have a sense that we're not consumers taking things in we're more

228
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,760
The Producers we certainly hear and see what's being presented in the world and

229
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:49,800
what comes around us but we're rooted in deeper place where we're the producer we're the we're the we're in a deep

230
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:57,480
place of creativity and responsivity that can be free of

231
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:02,640
attachments free of fear free of

232
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,480
confusion so so the application of mindfulness of thinking into daily life

233
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:15,800
is huge for our society there are people who are uh spending billions of dollars to try to

234
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,680
take your attention hostage or to hijack it to keep it for themselves and keep

235
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:29,200
you engaged and and uh and engage from that um surface mind or some from the

236
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,640
mind of desires the mind of fear the mind of

237
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,920
aversion and keep that activated as we engage in this world out

238
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,200
there so to discover the source of

239
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,480
thinking with inside of us and there are two general sources there's that place

240
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:57,760
where we think location or attitude that with which we're

241
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,119
thinking that comes along with attachment of one form or other the

242
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:09,440
attachment to self very strong sense of Me Myself and mine in it my

243
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:15,400
needs my need to prove myself my need to get what I want my need to be safe of

244
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,480
course we should be safe but if we're caught up in the need for that then we

245
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,800
are thinking from a kind of I call it kind of a surface way of thinking it's

246
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:34,160
doesn't have access to the depths of who we are and so to um so that's one source

247
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,839
the source of thinking that I often point to my head for this uh swirling

248
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:46,160
idea of Concepts ideas things that come from how we put words together into

249
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:53,318
language and grammar and that build things all the way until they build to Wars between

250
00:37:54,040 --> 00:38:00,480
people the Second Source of thinking is a thinking that arises out of being

251
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,160
deeply relaxed deeply at ease with

252
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:11,800
ourselves this is the source of creativity if we're tense it's very hard

253
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:18,400
to be creative in creativity has to do with a holistic way of thinking a thinking that

254
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:23,839
somehow we're relaxed enough nothing is constricted nothing is narrowed down

255
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:30,680
that happens when we have any kind of tension or attention or attachment thinking that occurs when we're deeply

256
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:37,359
relaxed and open so that our senses are are are open and Avail available or

257
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:46,119
sensing to uh all the different capacities that we are open to a broad range in a relaxed

258
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:53,079
subtle way and I associate that with the belly and if not the belly then I

259
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:59,160
associate it with a wonderful feeling of warmth and and Delight in the chest

260
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,960
where thinking is just a pleasure to do and uh because of the creativity The

261
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:15,160
Joy the delight and just being alive and letting this Wellspring uh font of of um flow of you

262
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:21,119
know Pleasant creative uh unattached thoughts thoughts that are not in under

263
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,760
the influence of anger aversion reg not

264
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:32,359
influence of regrets and shame and despair

265
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:38,200
and thinking which is not under the influence of our desires and our wants

266
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:45,480
our conceits thinking which is not under the influence of being confused or or lost

267
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:52,720
in our life there's so many ways things that influence our thinking as we learn to be mindful of

268
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,680
thinking in a sense to step back and say oh that's I'm thinking

269
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:04,720
now clearly consciously with a Act of

270
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:11,680
awareness where we find ourselves independent of our thinking where the knowing that we're

271
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,720
thinking maybe it's a kind of a thought but it can be a thought that comes from that deep

272
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:23,240
Source oh boy am I thinking a lot now the

273
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:29,319
control tower is going wild people in the control tower are having a party and

274
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:36,359
they're not watching the planes landing there's going to be an accident

275
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:44,079
soon but to to have this thinking from the depths within or from the peace

276
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:51,680
within that recognizes the other place of thinking

277
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:59,079
non-judgmentally but non-judgmental does not mean without evaluation without

278
00:40:59,079 --> 00:41:05,599
assessment without understanding oh that is not a useful place to be

279
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:12,240
thinking to lose myself in this kind of surface mind that's caught up in

280
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,480
attachment I that's not useful to be able to see that and

281
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:26,359
evaluate that as wisdom the wise thinking to judge it means to say oh

282
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:32,720
what a terrible person I am or how terrible is what a bad thing that surface thinking

283
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:38,720
is chances are that kind of thinking where we're putting a value like that on

284
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:45,920
it that's just more of the surface thinking the thinking from the

285
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,440
depths can understand but has no

286
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:58,119
criticism and no attachment to anything that it sees it's it's phenomenal to

287
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:04,920
switch operating systems from the surface mind that's one

288
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:12,359
way the other is being driven by Something That We're attached to to the Deep Mind the deep

289
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:17,560
thinking which is free of of of uh any

290
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:24,599
kind of attachment or for many for or much Freer from

291
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:31,319
attachment so I hope that this uh contrast of this idea of finding the

292
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:37,319
location The Source from which you're thinking gives you access to a deeper

293
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:44,440
understanding of your thinking and how to be mindful of it and how to kind of step away and be independent of it and

294
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:50,119
this idea of then relaxing into the depth of your body and really being at

295
00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:57,040
ease so that the creative thinking the depth thinking thinking from the depths

296
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:03,800
which is so holistic can animate your life and help you with this task of

297
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:11,520
becoming independent of your thoughts and that's only a step away of

298
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:19,880
learning how to be independent of the news that you're reading the opinions that you're

299
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:25,319
hearing so you can be wise about what you're hearing what you're reading what

300
00:43:25,319 --> 00:43:30,599
you're seeing so thank

301
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:35,480
you very much and we'll continue

302
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,880
tomorrow
