1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:10,719
so good morning everyone good day hello everywhere

2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,719
and

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,800
i offer you my warm welcome and and i feel very warm

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,960
sitting here with you again after being away for a week and um

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,960
happy to be back so um

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,200
one of the interesting variations for doing mindfulness

7
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:52,399
practice is to keep a focus on the breathing

8
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,399
but whatever clearly takes your attention away from the breathing

9
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:05,198
or clearly makes it difficult to be with the breathing then

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,080
turn towards it and acknowledge it briefly maybe all it can be needs to be

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,119
is okay i see you or okay there it is

12
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,560
or maybe it's a particular name you know thinking

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:32,079
aching sound whatever it might be but does it do do a moment or two of acknowledgement

14
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:38,479
and don't rush off after that acknowledgment kind of like like the acknowledgement is like dropping a

15
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:46,079
pebble in a pond and just be there for a moment to watch the ripple out just be there for a moment and allow yourself to

16
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:53,439
register the experience more fully and then beginning going to begin again on the breathing

17
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:59,280
and it doesn't matter how often you acknowledge something different than the

18
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,320
breathing it only matters that you do it and then you begin again with your breathing just always begin again

19
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,599
and don't linger with anything and this exercise uh you might go back to it again and

20
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,160
again the same thing but don't linger don't like study it investigate it just acknowledge it

21
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,640
give it its time for a few moments and then begin again on the breathing begin again in the breathing always on the

22
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,840
breathing but without denying or pushing away or ignoring

23
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,200
what's making it difficult to be with the breath or what takes you away from breathing

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:40,879
acknowledge it and come back and one of the interesting things about this exercise

25
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:47,360
is you start getting a sense of what it is that takes you away from the breathing where does your mind go

26
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,959
what are the concerns and preoccupations and you don't have to think about it or do

27
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,319
anything about it in meditation but it's just interesting to see that and come back

28
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,480
and maybe it doesn't need any more attention than that it's enough just to come back to your breathing over and

29
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:12,080
over again so assuming a upright posture

30
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:19,120
either literally or metaphorically a posture in which it may be a little

31
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,159
bit easier for you to attend to your breathing

32
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,480
accompany your breathing the body breathing

33
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:39,120
sometimes it's a posture which is a little more open in the chest so there's more space in the chest to breathe

34
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:46,000
or a little bit more relaxed in the belly

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,599
so there's room in the belly to relax hang forward

36
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,560
and then lowering your gaze about 45 degrees to the floor

37
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,480
not looking at anything in particular and when you're ready

38
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,079
you can close your eyes

39
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,639
and then taking a few long slow deep breaths

40
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,960
breathing in and breathing out

41
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:57,919
re-familiarizing yourself with the experience of breathing deep deep breath

42
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,720
long exhale here now

43
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,360
and then letting your breathing return to normal

44
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,880
and on the exhale relax more

45
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,560
on the exhale relax the muscles of the face

46
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,400
release the shoulders

47
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,240
and soften the belly

48
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,080
on the inhale feel your body broadly globally

49
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,360
and on the exhale release your body globally

50
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,720
widely let go soften in your body

51
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:17,319
and then settling in to the body's experience of breathing

52
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,560
maybe like an airplane coming into land and

53
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,440
everything gets very

54
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:43,639
still and focused and quiet coming into land in your breathing

55
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:08,120
feeling the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

56
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:54,360
and letting breathing be the center of your world

57
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:03,600
but if anything takes you away from that center take a few moments to relaxedly clearly

58
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,040
acknowledge it it could be as simple as a

59
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,600
imaginary nod in the head or

60
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:24,480
i see you or okay and then begin again with your breathing

61
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,399
no need to linger with anything that takes you away from the breathing

62
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:39,680
just acknowledge it register it

63
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:46,360
and begin again with your breathing relaxing into your breathing

64
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,720
foreign

65
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,400
so

66
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,919
so

67
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,679
so

68
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:09,919
whatever takes you away from your breathing you can

69
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:18,480
acknowledge it kindly acknowledge it peacefully

70
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:30,760
even if it's a surprising new thing receive it peacefully

71
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,120
and they're learning the art

72
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,960
of turning the attention to what is happening so that

73
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:08,039
it's a peaceful meeting between our awareness and what's happening

74
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,398
in this way of meeting the world

75
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,799
allows for what's good in the world to show itself more clearly

76
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:34,080
and may it be that this meditation practice supports us

77
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:41,000
to see what is good in the world what is good in others

78
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:46,000
and may we value it and appreciate it

79
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:55,760
in this seeing the good in the world and appreciating it

80
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:01,440
is one of the ways of living for the welfare and happiness

81
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,919
of others

82
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:14,158
when what is good is appreciated it has a chance to grow it's not ignored

83
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:26,159
may this community of ours that meditates together these weekday mornings

84
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,679
may the benefit of our collective practice be for the welfare and happiness of the

85
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:39,840
world may it spread out from us with our ability to see and appreciate

86
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:48,799
what is good in others even when they can't see it may all beings be happy

87
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:54,960
may all beings be safe may all beings

88
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,399
be peaceful and may all beings everywhere

89
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:03,720
be free

90
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,840
so

91
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,600
so

92
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:22,399
so we have a guest on the altar for this week it's kuan yin kannon abu lokata

93
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:27,039
different names and um

94
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:34,799
and i left it there uh yesterday morning for the sunday morning talk because i wanted to give a talk for the new year

95
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:42,480
the coming new year and so i gave a talk i called it the calling this the year of care

96
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:49,840
and so talked about care and compassion so i wanted kuan yin to be there

97
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:57,039
and now she's there left her there and i thought of giving the same talk

98
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:04,399
spread it out over five days these mornings but this morning i woke up with a different idea

99
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,440
so um

100
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,559
it begins with a story in the monastery

101
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,960
there was a hallway and a door

102
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,399
that went outdoors into the garden and

103
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:40,240
but there are all kinds of other places that offshoots other passageways that went

104
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:47,919
off from that hallway but when you went straight down the hallway you came to the door big door big wooden door

105
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:54,399
but it was a kind of a special door maybe a magical door and

106
00:33:54,399 --> 00:34:01,360
the only way to visit this special garden was to go through that door and many of the monks and nuns the

107
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:07,360
monastics wanted to see this garden that heard rumors by how wonderful it was and peaceful it was

108
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:13,040
and they really wanted to see it and some of them were depressed or angry or upset somehow

109
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:20,800
disturbed and they wanted to go someplace away from everyone where they could be safe and that's what they really wanted to do and some just wanted

110
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,839
to see beauty and some wanted to get away from the work of the monastery

111
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:34,000
and many many of the monastics stood in front of that door and tried to open it and it wouldn't

112
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:40,158
open it wouldn't open and um this door only opened under very

113
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,760
particular circumstances for each for the monastics to discover how does it how to open this

114
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:52,480
door and and because they really wanted to go to see this garden or they want to get

115
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,240
away from what they were doing and how do you open this door

116
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,599
and and because the door didn't open some of them ended up going down the side

117
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:12,560
hallways and into the labyrinth of the different places in the large monastery and

118
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:18,960
some of them forgot about the door or took a long time before they came back to that door

119
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,000
but every once in a while some people would stand in front of the door long enough

120
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,800
that they would and try all the different things to open the door

121
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:37,280
that they would just stand there and and not have any more wish for the door to

122
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,079
open stand there without any desire

123
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,839
and when that happened then the door opens

124
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:54,800
the door only opens for people who have no craving no clinging

125
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,839
who are not caught in the grip of desire where

126
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:06,000
then the door opens so this little story is

127
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:13,119
you know represents a huge possibility for us that a door that's always standing in

128
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,240
front of us ready to be opened when we meet it

129
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:24,640
meet reality without projecting and asserting our desires

130
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:30,560
our craving the strongest desire that buddhism talks about is craving

131
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:37,359
and craving is a desire which has the better of us

132
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:42,400
kind of it it directs us it's it's compulsive

133
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,079
and we can't put it down easily some desires are a dime a dozen they come easily and

134
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,920
easily let go of there's no big deal but the cravings are the ones that we can't put down that kind of a force

135
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:00,720
within us like i have to have this and as long as that force is there

136
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:06,960
there's a door that won't open door to reality door to our heart door to our minds there's a

137
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:14,079
door that won't open then only opens when we put down our craving and we stop

138
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,119
desiring for a few moments at least

139
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,280
now it's a hard thing to do because desires are

140
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:33,359
some people identify with desires i desire therefore i am

141
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:40,079
desire is me if i have a desire it's my desire it's part of me it's an important part of me

142
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:47,920
and to deny my desires to deny myself in some way and of course there's some truth to that

143
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,960
not all desires are a problem but the desires of craving the desires of god

144
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:59,040
that are compulsive the desires that that uh have the best take the better of us

145
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,520
those are the desires buddhism is learning to we're learning to address and um

146
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,040
and when we identify them strongly and we follow them and go into them

147
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:18,160
and try to understand our life through them sometimes it's uh the metaphor for it is

148
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:24,720
that of a ball of a tang big tangled ball of string

149
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:31,680
and it's like where it's like more than it's a two-dimensional labyrinth or maze it's a three-dimensional maze

150
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,119
labyrinth that you know it's very hard to find find your way out once you go into the

151
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,240
world of desires and wants and not wants and cravings and aversions

152
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,800
and try to understand and find your way and navigate and understand it and find the right one and

153
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:55,200
it's kind of like can be a a labyrinth you never come out of all these side hallways and trips you take for a

154
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,240
long time and then there's the uh

155
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:08,560
the gordy and the sword that cuts through that that gordian knot the big knot of the entangled desires

156
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:16,240
and it's a very simple thing it's to put very very hard both to do

157
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,000
but maybe even harder to appreciate the value of it

158
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,960
and that is to crave nothing in a sense to be present

159
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:35,359
in a sense without any compulsive desire whatsoever maybe with no desire just here

160
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:40,720
just present when what opens then

161
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:46,400
and what then we just stand if the door opens we just stand there some people don't like to have no

162
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:53,440
desires because then they feel like they don't do anything but then there's a next instruction

163
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,359
and in the monastery if the door finally opens for you there's a rake

164
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:05,200
just the other side of the door and begin raking the garden

165
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:11,839
cleaning it it works to have no craving

166
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,520
if it doesn't work we have no craving if we're couch potatoes

167
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:23,359
but no craving no compulsion nothing

168
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:29,760
no desires driving us and then

169
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:37,119
take you know start raking sweep the kitchen floor

170
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:43,359
when's the last time you clean the shower clean the refrigerator

171
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,240
take out the trash

172
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,960
go say hello to the neighbors call a friend

173
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:04,000
start doing the simple things of life but the ones that are kind of in front

174
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,640
of you and obvious but don't do nothing have no craving

175
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,800
and start caring for this world in the simplest possible ways

176
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,400
and then that grows and develops and can become the whole world

177
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,640
the danger that challenges how to engage

178
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:35,599
with the raking the caring for the world without then succumbing back into the

179
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:41,839
world of craving into the world of desire and one of the ways to do that to avoid

180
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:48,720
that is to meditate every day to find a way to be present

181
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,760
that allows you to shed put down the

182
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,079
burdens of desire the weight of craving and aversion and

183
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,520
the force the contraction in meditation to discover

184
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,119
or get close to a way of being when you put down

185
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:17,680
desires put down craving even healthy ones and good ones that are good to pick up again after

186
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,680
meditation but to kind of come to a kind of place of

187
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:30,000
diminished quiet calm diminished desires and have that as a reference point then

188
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,040
to understand what are the healthy desires to act on

189
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:41,119
when we come out if we come out of the door if we stand in front of the

190
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:47,839
door and we have no desires and we just stand there

191
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:54,960
very quickly that becomes a desire it's a natural thing follow the natural

192
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,480
pull into the garden the rake is there starts raking the leaves

193
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,520
when i was um a zen monk i um

194
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:13,359
there's a very formal way of eating in the meditation hall um we have these three bowls they're

195
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:20,000
nestled inside each other one is you know so the big one middle one a small one and uh usually the rice will go in the

196
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,359
big one the soup would go in the middle wine and some salad or vegetables go in the small one

197
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:32,560
and um and i thought well i just eat the most efficient way there is i don't have any desires for anything i just i'll

198
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:38,560
just eat everything from the first bowl then everything in the second bowl everything in the third bowl and they'll

199
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:44,160
be done but i was eating in the meditation hall where we ate in silence

200
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:50,800
next to the abbot and at some point he saw what i was doing and he told me gil

201
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:58,079
just eat naturally uh and then i noticed that if i hadn't if i kind of stopped my kind of

202
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,599
drive to eat efficiently simply because i was not supposed to have any desires

203
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:09,920
i noticed that i would take a few bites of the rice i'd put it down i would naturally pick up the soup and perhaps i

204
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,200
would put it down you know i'd go back and forth and kind of you know and it was almost almost as

205
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:21,119
if there was no desire which is kind of this natural thing to do to go through and eat

206
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,359
at different from different bowls at different times

207
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:36,720
what is your natural inclination when you have no craving when you have

208
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,160
no desires and maybe it's to clean the kitchen

209
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:49,960
floor the refrigerator or the bathroom or go visit a neighbor or

210
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,200
it's all kinds of things this world calls us calls on us to do

211
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:01,359
and so to have no desires

212
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:07,599
that'll to be desirelessness desireless in a certain kind of way cravingless

213
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,640
in a way that allows us to care for the world

214
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:17,760
and then do please do engage but be careful you don't get

215
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:26,800
caught up then back in the world of craving so that's my thoughts for today and

216
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,920
thank you very much
