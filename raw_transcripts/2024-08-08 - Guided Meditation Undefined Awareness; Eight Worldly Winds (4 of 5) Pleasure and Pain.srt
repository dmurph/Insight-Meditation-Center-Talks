00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,720
warm greetings from Insight Meditation

2
00:00:06,919 --> 00:00:14,839
Center and um this week offering you some reference points

3
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:22,279
for doing mindfulness meditation and one um remarkable

4
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:29,279
reference point for it is that if you are at ease if you're

5
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,320
relaxed and and present if you're relaxed and

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:44,719
present if you're relaxed and just here you cannot not be

7
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:52,399
aware if you're relaxed and at ease here and you know you're

8
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:58,800
aware you're not able to turn off being aware unless you fall asleep or unless

9
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,080
you ract Yourself by something that absorbs your

10
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:11,759
attention and this idea that if you are at

11
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:20,000
ease you cannot not be aware what kind of awareness is

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,720
it that you can't turn off what is it that's here the simplest

13
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:35,680
thing and one answer to that question is that it's an awareness which is

14
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,920
undefined or to say it a little bit more provocatively uh rather than from the

15
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:50,000
point of view of awareness it's a way of being it's an awareness that does not

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
define who we are the undefined

17
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,960
self so we're not defined Ed by our

18
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,319
experiences whether we feel pleasure or pain there is a way of being aware of it

19
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:14,720
there's a way of being present where we do not Define

20
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,319
ourselves and where awareness is not shaped by the pleasure or the

21
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:29,319
pain if we have gain and loss success and failure praise and

22
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:35,720
blame Fame and disrepute these are experiences in the

23
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:42,000
world things are happening around us and experiences in the

24
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:48,680
mind we don't there can be awareness that is not defined by that or we do not

25
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,200
Define ourselves by those things and to be

26
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,680
undefined is to be deeply at ease as soon soon as we Define ourselves even if

27
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,120
it seems like it's completely accurate and reasonable definition we've added a mental activity

28
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,519
we've added a way of the mind is activated that contains within it a

29
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:21,920
degree of stress a degree of pressure a degree of of um narrowing ATT tension or

30
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:29,360
being a little bit caught in some way and to be uncaught

31
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,560
belongs to the realm of being undefined not undefined so that we're

32
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:44,280
unimportant or we don't count or but undefined because it's a symptom

33
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:51,840
of Freedom it's a symptom of not non stress

34
00:03:51,840 --> 00:04:00,480
non tension non anxiety so as we sit today

35
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,920
maybe you can keep as a reference point or as a

36
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:14,640
question when you're at ease and you cannot not be

37
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:23,880
aware can you allow yourself to be not defined by any experience that's

38
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,880
happening can you allow the awareness

39
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:39,800
to be not caught or contracted or defined by the experience it's

40
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,080
having so to assume a meditation

41
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,360
posture and no matter how what do the four main postures you're

42
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:05,440
in Walking standing sitting lying down can you arrange your

43
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:12,400
body so it has a balance between some feeling of

44
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,800
alertness in your body sometimes with some sense of

45
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:26,199
intentionality intentness in your body that's not tense

46
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,759
some slight engagement that requires attention here

47
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:45,520
in the body so the balance between being

48
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:52,919
alert and being relaxed to allow a posture that'll

49
00:05:52,919 --> 00:06:00,240
miraculously allows for both a certain degree of Vitality

50
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:08,599
in awareness and presence and the conditions for which

51
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:14,759
the tensions of the body can melt away Fall

52
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:24,199
Away gently lowering lowering your gaze or closing your

53
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,479
eyes and this combination of alertness and relaxation

54
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:37,319
can occur when you take a few long deep breaths at the beginning of

55
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:42,680
meditation your alertness maybe comes with breathing

56
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,759
in and relaxing the body on the exhale

57
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,440
on different exhales letting different parts of the body

58
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,440
soften settle

59
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:47,199
then to let your breathing return to normal and for a few more

60
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,240
breaths to feel

61
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,800
gentle sense of energy Vitality

62
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,198
alertness with breathing in

63
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,199
through maybe as the rib cage

64
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,599
expands and as you exhale continue the process of

65
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,000
relaxing in the body

66
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,560
and as you exhale also to relax the thinking

67
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
mind softening the mind

68
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:30,120
as you exhale relaxing the heart softening the heart

69
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,079
settling the

70
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:03,200
heart and then notice whatever degree however

71
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:12,360
small whatever degree of ease that you might be feeling

72
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:18,680
now could also be a sense of calm or a sense

73
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,120
of

74
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,519
peace and if there ways you feel uneasy or agitated that's

75
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,320
okay ease and unease can

76
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,160
coexist especially if you don't Define Yourself by the

77
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:53,760
unease by the tensions and issues problems there can be they can be

78
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:59,360
there and you can place your attention on whatever place in your body

79
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,639
Body Mind heart where there is some sense of

80
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,440
ease peace

81
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,720
calm and to be at ease to be

82
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,320
calm and to see feel feel how being aware of

83
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,360
that doesn't have to be something you're trying to

84
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,600
do that in the calm itself in the ease

85
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:49,920
itself there's an awareness that doesn't have to be

86
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,120
done there's a way of attending or being

87
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,320
present it's not something you're doing just just

88
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:05,399
there you can't turn it

89
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:29,839
off and to Define Yourself by the ease to Define Yourself by the

90
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:37,360
the simple awareness is to in small small way

91
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,560
to depart from the ease depart from the

92
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,160
awareness it's making something of it

93
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:09,560
allowing your body to breathe in and breathe out without being defined by how it

94
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:16,240
is without building up a self or ideas of Me Myself and

95
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,920
mine there's just the experience of

96
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:29,560
breathing known and awareness not making anything of it

97
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,880
allowing it to be what it

98
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
is

alone and not be defined by it not be

109

and as we come to the end of this

132
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:28,200
sitting more often than not when we're actively involved in Def

133
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,919
ining ourselves we are also limiting ourselves

134
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:41,960
by that and all too often defining

135
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,559
ourselves is itself an expression of some attachment

136
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:55,039
some holding on to something needing things to be a certain

137
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:01,600
way or some insistent that this is the way it

138
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:09,320
is and if we can be at ease without defining anything without

139
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,880
defining

140
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:21,440
ourselves the states within us which come from nonattachment non-

141
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,679
clinging have more room to flow

142
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:38,760
basic friendliness kindness love Compassion

Care

144
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:52,080
wisdom or what can flow in the undefined space of

145
00:28:53,279 --> 00:29:01,679
awareness and may it be that as we learn this practice of mindfulness

146
00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:05,840
of easeful

147
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:19,559
attention that we allow

148
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:25,240
ourselves to have a warm heart a kind

149
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:31,519
heart shining on this world to gaze upon

[Music]

156
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:18,000
free thank

157
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
you e

158
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:24,639
so now continuing with this fourth talk on the E worldly

159
00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:30,240
winds and the in the teachings of the Buddha

160
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:37,360
the fourth one is Pleasure and Pain I've noticed that in a lot of

161
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:46,080
popular teachings on the four Heavenly will winds uh uh Pleasure and Pain comfort

162
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:53,799
and discomfort is uh listed first so whether it should be listed

163
00:31:53,799 --> 00:32:00,600
first or not I don't know but um one way of interpreting that the Buddha puts at

164
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:08,320
last is that maybe it's the most important that um that uh and may be the

165
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:16,159
most difficult to because Pleasure and Pain is something very personal it's

166
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:23,639
something that we experience uh things like the the other uh six gain and

167
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:29,320
loss uh that can be someone personal we gain and lose our ability ities and

168
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:35,679
physical capacities but often it has to do with gaining and losing things in the

169
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:44,080
world and uh U but you know especially things like um Fame and

170
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:50,039
disrepute as deep as that can travel into our psyche into our hearts it's

171
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:57,880
still so having to do with world of ideas and the external world what people other people think praise and blame same

172
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:05,919
same thing but Pleasure and Pain is something that we experience intimately

173
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:12,519
closely uh physically with ourselves and so maybe it's easier

174
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:18,960
um oh so that I'm hearing seeing people say the sound is going in and

175
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,960
out me too so I don't know

176
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:32,279
uh fine for me so some people say it's fine yes comes and go no problem with

177
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:38,759
sound here yes

178
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:46,840
so it's possible that the problem is here at IMC but that maybe uh those of

179
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,840
you with different um

180
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:57,880
um devices have a different you know different effect

181
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:01,559
okay so some people you're probably seeing the

182
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:09,398
chats so yeah so if you're having problem uh yes refreshing the screen

183
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:14,638
helps fascinating that the number of people should have the same problem at the same

184
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,440
time maybe it's a a YouTube

185
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:28,919
problem so okay get lots of uh people saying now

186
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:34,720
that but some people are still finding it in and out so but repeatedly people are saying

187
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:40,000
that they close YouTube and then it gets better okay so we'll

188
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:47,960
continue so this idea that um Pleasure and Pain is uh part of the worldly

189
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:54,040
winds uh it's something that uh in the world people just really respond to

190
00:34:54,040 --> 00:35:03,240
react to some people are um Servants of Pleasure and Pain that uh

191
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:10,560
everything they do has to do with being comfortable or un avoiding discomfort uh becoming comfortable they Define

192
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,880
themselves by the Pleasure and Pain there's some people who feel like if things are un painful unpleasant

193
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:23,079
uncomfortable somehow that's a personal failure it's or it's a uh offense

194
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:29,480
offense that the universe is providing and it shouldn't be this way at all

195
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:34,520
uh and um the um

196
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:40,800
the and uh and then some people because of that when things are Pleasant are

197
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,839
really attached to it this is a sign of success this is a sign that the universe is in my favor that uh that there's I

198
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:55,359
don't have and you know this means that uh this is exactly how it should be and then there's attachment to it sometimes

199
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:02,200
Pleasure and Pain is experienced and we Define ourselves by it that uh somehow I

200
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:10,000
am wrong I am right I am great I'm lousy because there's pleasure or there's pain

201
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:18,280
and one of the phenomenal gifts that I've received from doing Buddhist practice is U being able to experience

202
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:24,839
Pleasure and Pain without being defined by it without being caught in it without

203
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:30,119
picking it up and having it affect the quality of my inner life and I remember

204
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:36,680
uh when I was young in Buddhist practice that um uh

205
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:42,560
somehow without somehow the the context of doing ongoing meditation ongoing

206
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:50,680
Buddhist practice at some point it just seemed second nature that when I was going about my day and remember uh I had

207
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:58,400
to lift something with someone else something very very heavy and carry at some distance and I remember uh how painful

208
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:05,960
it was in my hands to hold this thing digging into my hands I wasn't hurting harming myself but it was really painful

209
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:13,760
and it just seemed like the obvious thing to do second nature almost to do was um to be present for it and not

210
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,280
allow myself to be caught in it or reactive to it be agitated by it be

211
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:27,079
aversive to it and I had some semblance of of a of a sense of attention that was

212
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:35,200
at ease a mind that was untroubled that it felt like this is valuable to not sacrifice that

213
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:42,599
untroubled mind it's valuable to stay at ease uh with this intense pain in my

214
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:48,200
hands and so it became this kind of uh writing almost a Razor's Edge very

215
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:53,760
careful attention to watch that the mind didn't react just didn't pick it

216
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,800
up and um so no one told me to do that I didn't tell myself to do it it just

217
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,920
seemed like the obvious thing to do to ride that edge to explore that I think

218
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:10,280
that part of the idea was that I that I was better off uh it better for me not to get

219
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:15,400
caught in the reactivity around the pain so it wasn't automatic that pain meant

220
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:22,920
that I had to uh react contract feel sorry for myself feel upset feel blaming

221
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:30,280
something and it just was pain and um and then uh uh I was quite

222
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:36,760
surprised by being introduced to be PNA practice and terad and practice includes

223
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:42,319
uh clear recognition and encouragement at certain point in practice to allow

224
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:49,000
yourself to feel great pleasure joy and happiness and um and I was surprised but

225
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I didn't think that we were allowed to have those kinds of experiences I thought it was just uh just be present

226
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,800
and being present meant somehow some neutal Natural State and so but then so then the the

227
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:08,480
task was how to allow for the pleasure of meditation the happiness The Joy uh

228
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,599
uh without picking it up without congratulating myself without make building up itself look at me how great

229
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:22,359
I am I'm the one who's experiencing uh some pleasure in my meditation and so there too was this I'm

230
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:29,040
better off not being defined by it I'm better off not being CAU in it reactive

231
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,640
to it I'm better off just allowing it to be without making it a story making it a

232
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:43,400
expectation making it a requirement um letting the pleasure and the pain come and go and this is one of

233
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:50,319
the I feel one of the great also Gifts of a regular ongoing meditation practice

234
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:57,640
I found it invaluable to uh meditate every day more or less at the same time

235
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:04,079
and um day in and day out and um and then be present for

236
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:10,079
whatever life gives me because the consistency of it uh over time there are

237
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:16,680
times with pain times of pleasure times of uh being sad times of being happy but

238
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,800
the through line the thread running all through it all was U mindfulness was

239
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,640
attention was being really present for it and in doing so learning how how to

240
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:35,119
be nonreactive non-attached uh to whatever is happening to be present and balanced present and

241
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:42,000
not going along with the swings of ups and downs elated and depressed uh and just being

242
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,480
present and that is the art of working with the eighth worldly winds to be

243
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:54,839
present without being elated or depressed without being uh uh the

244
00:40:54,839 --> 00:41:00,400
certain agitation that comes with just being so happy and delighted and excited

245
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:05,680
that is a setup to crash and go the other direction to being so depressed

246
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:12,839
and upset that things are not going our way and that happens if we Define ourselves by our

247
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:19,119
experience and so as we practice to start discovering a certain degree of

248
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:25,000
freedom of in Awareness certain degree of being present without being defined

249
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,880
by anything and feeling at this is good this is a wonderful deep satisfying kind

250
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:39,880
of way of being and you can feel and sense that as soon as we start defining ourselves by it anything at all making a

251
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:45,200
self out of it or this is happening to me or this is that we're actually

252
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,760
diminishing ourselves we're actually uh making something smaller or tighter or

253
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:56,240
constricted and the idea that we would not Define ourselves have an undefined

254
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:02,599
awareness can feel frightening can feel what's the point the whole point is I'm

255
00:42:02,599 --> 00:42:10,000
whole lifetime I've been living with this idea that I am I am who I am and I have defining myself a certain way or or

256
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,160
defending or deflecting how you know the world is trying to Define me or or

257
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:23,000
hiding how I'm I really am because I don't want to Define myself to the world that way this whole social games that we

258
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:30,920
play around this idea of self and to find the Deep satisfaction of being putting that down letting it

259
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:40,720
rest and to have the undefined awareness or undefined self and then to encounter Pleasure and

260
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:47,000
Pain and realize that these two can be the Winds of the world that we don't

261
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,920
pick up on we don't let it push push us around we don't Define ourselves by it

262
00:42:52,920 --> 00:43:00,280
there's something better that we can experience than um than only focusing on the pleasure

263
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:06,400
and the pain and that that which is better is found in the awareness of the

264
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:12,800
Pleasure and Pain the awareness is not the pain the

265
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,520
attention the mindfulness The Knowing of it is not the pain not the pleasure but

266
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:23,640
there's a way of knowing there's a way of being at ease with awareness at ease

267
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:28,800
with knowing at peace with awareness at peace with

268
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:36,839
knowing that is better than what it is knowing

269
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:42,680
knows and that's the art and when we have some sense of this higher quality

270
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:49,440
knowing or higher quality inner life then it becomes hopefully second nature

271
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,160
not to get pushed around by Pleasure and Pain not to be defining our life or

272
00:43:55,160 --> 00:44:02,520
measuring our life or needing our life to be one way or the other based on whether there's Pleasure and Pain it

273
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:08,920
doesn't mean naive kind of just letting pain just persist uh because just that

274
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:14,000
is um it's like it's kind of a natural thing to take the thorn out of your foot

275
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,559
it's a natural thing to take the you know to to in healthy ways to avoid pain

276
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:26,720
and healthy ways of allowing yourself to feel pleasure but to do so with an inner

277
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:32,400
life which is not defined by it not dependent on it not conditioned by it

278
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,440
not pushed around by it this is the art of practicing with the eight worldly

279
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:44,119
winds so I hope that you've understood well enough now that the the the theme I

280
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:49,520
have around these eight worldly winds is that um to is that there's something

281
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:55,040
better than them going on as we develop this practice and so we know for

282
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:00,280
ourselves that these worldly winds are are just that winds of the world that we

283
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:07,079
don't have to uh pick up or get involved in and um and if we

284
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:12,359
do then that's also practice that's also we bring our

285
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:17,480
attention to and um don't let yourself be pushed around twice by the same

286
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:24,720
worldly wind one by having being caught in it and the other in being caught in

287
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:30,440
reactivity to it the reactivity to being

288
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:36,839
caught so uh thank you so we have one more day on this eight worldly wins and

289
00:45:36,839 --> 00:45:42,400
um even though we've done all eight now and uh I look forward to um offering you

290
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,920
the concluding talk thank you
