1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,240
good evening can we turn up the volume just a little bit so let's see I have to talk

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:13,440
now to here how the volume goes yeah is this okay can you hear okay in the

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,039
back so good evening and tonight I want to talk a

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:28,160
little bit about something that often we don't think about neither in our uh daily life nor

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,920
in relationship to our meditation practice and that is the attitude that

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,239
we're bringing and in particular I'm going to talk about attitude that we bring to our

7
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,320
meditation practice but it's not only about that I mean of course the attitude

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:51,199
that we bring has an impact but often it's uh subtle and

9
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:59,399
often we're not even aware of the attitude that we're bringing and what impact it can have and we're not even

10
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,960
aware like is there an alternative is so than the way than the attitude that we're

11
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,920
bringing so I'm going to Define attitude as the way in which we are relating to

12
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:18,000
our experience you know like do you have an attitude you you have a like a chip

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,079
on your shoulder right is a kind of like an attitude and which people might show

14
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:30,920
up and interact with people with this kind of chip on their shoulder in which they are know just uh wri ready to be

15
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:36,439
offended and ready to defend themselves or defend uh something that's important

16
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:45,560
to them so the attitude we might be the way in which we feel about or think about or

17
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,719
respond to our experiences because like for example

18
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:57,159
another example might be and I'm sure all of us have this example it's uh funny that we have this expression you

19
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:03,159
know to wake up on the wrong side of the bed and I know I I sometimes use this

20
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:09,759
example because uh well sometimes if you don't sleep well I mean it's obvious like all of us have this experience of

21
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:18,200
not sleeping well for whatever reason right there's a numberless number of reasons countless

22
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,680
number of reasons why we might do this and then when we uh don't sleep

23
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,239
well there's a certain like Outlook that we have there's a certain way in which

24
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:38,599
we like see things I mean literally and figuratively if we're feeling cranky or

25
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:44,879
grumpy maybe I'll just say for me I'm one of those people that when I first wake up I'm usually in an okay mood but

26
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:51,879
I don't want to talk to anybody I don't want to say words I just don't want to interact with anybody at all I just kind

27
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:57,800
of want to do my own thing and then my own thing includes a

28
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,400
cup of coffee I just uh love coffee I have uh for such

29
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,319
a long time and uh you know then later after I've been awake have my cup of coffee

30
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:14,920
been doing my thing then um I'm okay then I'm happy to interact with others

31
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:22,159
but uh first thing in the morning wake up and then having to interact with others I'm often a little cranky I don't know that's just kind of

32
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:28,239
the way it is you know I don't have to be but uh you know I can say you no no

33
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,400
no I'm going to not be cranky and you know meet this moment uh with some

34
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:39,280
kindness but uh sometimes I'm just cranky first thing in the morning I'm

35
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,959
like that's okay that's just how it is and so there's this way in which this

36
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,360
kind of like this crankiness or grumpiness uh affects uh our Outlook

37
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,840
which I'm saying as the way that we see things so see things both uh literally

38
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:06,959
and figuratively that is we might just if we have this cranky attitude we literally will see oh shoot yeah the

39
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,519
floor needs mopping and wow look at the spiderwebs in that part of the bookcase

40
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:18,040
you know there's these things that we notice that are you know just a little bit

41
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:23,400
uh they're not the bright cheerful things right there's this sense of oh

42
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,720
here's a things that's wrong and oh yeah here's this other thing that's wrong or something like this we're not noticing

43
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,039
noticing that the birds are chirping outside we're not noticing that oh at

44
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:42,120
least the sink isn't filled with dirty dishes or you know whatever it is we're not there's a selection bias that

45
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,560
happens that's due to the attitude that we're

46
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:53,680
bringing and maybe that's not so bad you would say okay that's just the way it is

47
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,280
but this has such a bigger impact than just the things that we see

48
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,320
because the things that we see the like the what we're choosing to really place

49
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,880
our attention on what we're choosing not intentionally choosing but what we're

50
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,440
noticing influences our interpretations like for example just

51
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,440
building on this example of seeing how the floor needs to be momed and there's not dirty dishes but there's all this

52
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,120
mess that needs to be put away or something like this then there might be like an interpretation like geee the

53
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:38,000
people I live with they don't take care I have to do it all myself or maybe like

54
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,680
oh I'm not a very good person to take care of my living space or you know there's this interpretation we can make

55
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,400
this the selection bias and what we're viewing then we make it mean

56
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,479
something and what we're making it mean always has something to do with

57
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:05,919
us if even if this example that I gave about well the people that I live with they don't take care of this place and

58
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:14,840
then there's always like the next beat and they expect me to do it because they don't respect me or and uh they're not

59
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:21,840
sensitive to the condition of our living space and they're not sensitive to me

60
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,160
either and they don't know how important it is to me for it to be clean or something like

61
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,479
this so then when we make it mean something when we interpret it and it's

62
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:39,520
always about something to do about us always if you look at this if you investigate you'll see that's kind of

63
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,599
like by definition what happens but then that would maybe you

64
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:52,440
know that's bad enough but then it doesn't stop there because then our Behavior changes if we find ourselves

65
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,479
stuck in like well you know they don't respect me they're not sensitive to

66
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:02,759
what's important to me they're not sensitive at all look how they're insensitive in all these different areas

67
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:09,280
and they don't even notice that the floors need to be mopped or whatever it might be then that interpretation

68
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,680
affects our Behavior then maybe we're not uh going

69
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,599
to be generous as we could be or as uh warm when we are greeting them instead

70
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:28,240
we're cranky we meet them with a crankiness or grumpiness so our Behavior gets uh

71
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,720
influenced by the interp interpretation that we made by what we saw by What attitude we

72
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,599
had and then we might say well as if that weren't bad enough right it just

73
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:47,039
keeps on going then the behavior like well then maybe we're not uh as generous

74
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:53,599
generous in the giving them the benefit of the doubt or generous in doing

75
00:07:53,599 --> 00:08:00,639
something like making a cup of tea for them or cup of coffee for them in the morning for example or doing something

76
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,840
nice for them that they you know to help them have a nice day and know that they're

77
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:12,479
appreciated instead then uh this our Behavior not

78
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:19,280
being generous kind of influences the experiences we have well if we're not generous to them then of course they

79
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,560
react to that and meet us and maybe in a way that increases our crankiness you

80
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,520
know maybe they're not warm and attentive to us are loving to us they

81
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,080
might be but they might not be too so this big whole Cascade of events

82
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:43,200
is just kind of like based on this attitude that we had but so often we

83
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,720
don't even notice attitude when it's you know extrem like crankiness first thing

84
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,920
in the morning and we know this is a pattern that we've had but so often

85
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,079
there are subtle attitudes that we have that are having a big impact on our life

86
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:06,160
and a big impact on our meditation practice and I want to talk a little bit about

87
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,440
that because I've been using this word uh outlook for attitude but there's a

88
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:19,440
way in which we might say we could summarize kind of like this part of this Cascade events I was talking about as

89
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,279
the lens through which we see everything or maybe we might even say the

90
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:32,000
prism that you know that through which we see things the way in which things are maybe being a little bit distorted

91
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:38,440
not maybe being a little bit distorted I would say all of us have our own ways

92
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,720
of distorting quote unquote what we see we know this right if you ask

93
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:50,640
eyewitnesses to what happened you'll get you know five different people you'll get five different little twists on what

94
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,120
happened like there's a way in which all of us are not seeing things exactly the

95
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:03,279
same so what are some of the ways what are

96
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,320
some attitudes that uh we could cultivate that can be a support for our

97
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:14,800
meditation practice which can be a support for having more ease and freedom in our

98
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,959
lives and first of all it's uh helpful to just notice like what are some ways

99
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:28,320
in which um yeah maybe I'll just resay this some attitudes we can bring to our practice

100
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,720
that can be a support because often we notice that we don't have these attitudes and then there's a

101
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,720
way in which of course it impacts our meditation practice which impacts the

102
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:49,760
this uh movement or this opening to greater and greater Peace and

103
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:58,399
Freedom so here's one attitude during mindfulness meditation

104
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:05,079
I'm going to particularly focus on mindfulness meditation during mindfulness meditation

105
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:10,720
which is what gets taught here at IMC and what we teach primarily at the

106
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:19,519
retreat center an attitude that is supportive is to recognize that it's

107
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,720
enough to clearly recognize what is

108
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,480
happening just clearly recognize what is happening my mindfulness meditation

109
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,680
that's all that is required is just to recognize what is

110
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:42,519
happening the sounds pretty straightforward but when we start to

111
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:49,560
look we start to notice how well actually we kind of want to have a

112
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:56,639
particular experiences so we're not just noticing what's happening we're trying

113
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:03,279
to be more relaxed or we're trying trying to have some more ease or we're trying to have some more happiness which

114
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:09,720
is all legitimate and valid and I'll talk about this Paradox in a moment but

115
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:17,279
for mindfulness meditation just this notion that it's the the activity the what's been

116
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,120
asked of us is maybe we might use this language is just to

117
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:29,959
receive the experience whatever the experience might be might be a sound might be the

118
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:36,160
pressure against the body what we're sitting on might be mental events it

119
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,920
might be the experience of breathing whatever the experience is it's

120
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:50,120
sufficient just to receive it and have clarity about it this is the pressure against the body

121
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:57,079
that the chair or the cushion is having this is the stretch that gets filled F

122
00:12:57,079 --> 00:13:05,880
felt in the Torso when there's a an inhale or this is a sound we don't need

123
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:11,279
to know what particular sound we just need to know that it's a

124
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,880
sound so what's implicit in this during mind mindfulness meditation there's

125
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,120
nothing that needs to be changed or

126
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:29,680
fixed instead there's just this moment we don't have

127
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:37,560
to resist anything we don't have to prove something there's nothing that has to be

128
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,760
changed there's nothing that we have to resist that we have to uh you know push

129
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:50,199
away or something like this so with mindfulness meditating we're not trying to create something we're not to trying

130
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:56,880
to create a special experience that maybe we've heard about or read about or that we've had in the past we're not

131
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,839
trying to make those happen instead by just like receiving

132
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:12,399
experiences and having clarity about them there's a way in which we're creating the conditions in which uh more

133
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,240
ease and relaxation can happen but we're not like making relaxation happen we're

134
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,920
not making anything happen we're just aligning with

135
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:31,480
experience we're aligning with reality we're looking clearly at what's

136
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,839
happening and of course What's Happening Here is here in the present not you know

137
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:47,399
lost in some fantasy or not something in the future or the past or something like this so we're honoring what is already

138
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,720
happening it seems so simple it turns out not to be so

139
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,759
easy because even if we are noticing what's actually happening in the present

140
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:07,880
moment so often there's like yeah but it's not what I want I want more of this

141
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:15,120
and less of that and I want what I had before or you know something like this there's it's not so easy to just have

142
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:22,320
this clean receiving the experience and allowing it to be as it

143
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,800
is because well there's all kinds of reasons why but one of them is we don't

144
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:34,639
like to be uncomfortable of course we don't like to be uncomfortable

145
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:41,279
but if we really pay attention to our life we'll notice how often do we shift

146
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,839
our posture just in daily life let alone you know meditate meditating you'll just

147
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:53,480
notice that all day long we're shifting our posture little bit of discomfort all day long we're having to go pee we're

148
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,279
having to drink water we're having to eat right there's this little bit of discomfort turning down the volume

149
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:06,720
turning up the volume or you know these types of things in which there's just a little bit of discomfort all the

150
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:12,720
time and so there's so many things in which we can adjust and we do

151
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:20,000
adjust but what what would it be like just to receive

152
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,759
experiences and part of this attitude of you that it's enough to clearly

153
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:32,399
recognize what is happening is recognizing in that every moment in

154
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:39,240
which we are aware what's actually happening is an opportunity to learn

155
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:46,880
something we learn about ourselves we learn like yeah I yeah this is uncomfortable and I have this this

156
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,160
urge to change it I have this urge to make it different or to distract myself

157
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:59,160
and you know go off into a fantasy or something like that or maybe we start to

158
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:04,959
learn like oh yeah I have this pattern of uh meeting things that I really like

159
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:10,959
of uh having a little bit of fear that they're going to go away in this little contraction even though it's Pleasant

160
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,319
I'm sting like oh oh I wish it would always

161
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:24,760
stay or we might notice that we have this pattern of if something is a little

162
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:30,919
bit uncomfortable we have this pattern of like getting IR irritated

163
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:38,039
internally if somebody's this is one thing that I notice is that pattern of mine is that when I'm driving this

164
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:43,760
happened yesterday and I'm on a road in which uh there's just one lane going each way and

165
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,720
you can't pass or anything like this and the person in front of you is going way

166
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,919
below the speed limit and there's a huge tons of cars behind right and this

167
00:17:54,919 --> 00:18:00,799
person you know there's nothing to be done you're just there and you're seeing the speed limit sign and you're looking

168
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:07,679
at your speedometer and going okay you know I'm noticing like there's some

169
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,280
irritation arising but what's fascinating is if we look at this

170
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:20,720
there's something inside of us that thinks if I have this internal

171
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,640
experience somehow it will change the external experience right there's some

172
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:34,360
crazy thinking that we're not even aware of that says something like my irritation is going to make my external

173
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,720
spe experience better I got irritated and the person in

174
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:45,400
front of me still dve drove exactly the same it doesn't work there's like this

175
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,200
getting irritated doesn't change anything except make ourselves irit

176
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:59,440
irritated and mean like often we don't even notice how we have this kind of crazy I'm using this word crazy

177
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:06,120
ideas because when we really think about it like that we start to say like wait is that is that right well why do we get

178
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:15,279
irritated what what's the function what's the purpose is it just a pattern it's just a pattern it's not

179
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:23,640
helpful so mindfulness is acknowledging and observing whatever happens but that

180
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:29,799
doesn't mean that we have to be passive in life

181
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:37,080
I would say mindfulness meditation is about receiving experience and there can be times in

182
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:43,600
which we want to do something with uh during meditation and especially if we're doing more like concentration

183
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:50,600
practice which we often do intentionally to kind like increase the stability and the

184
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:58,280
Stillness but there's this way in which maybe this is a a paradox or maybe it's

185
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:06,559
the pointing to the art of practice or some subtlety or Nuance to

186
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,520
practice is there a way that we [Music]

187
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:17,000
can be with our

188
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:24,280
experience and then maybe this flows into the next uh attitude or something

189
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,520
that we can bring and trust that wisdom

190
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:37,240
flows out of any sense of Stillness that's getting created if we can trust

191
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:44,200
what's the experiences if we can receive the experience even if it's exactly what we don't want in that

192
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:50,480
moment there's a certain amount of Stillness that gets created if we are putting down the pushing and pulling the

193
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,919
irritation I want more I want less if we're able to put that down then

194
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:02,159
there's a certain amount of non agitation there's a certain amount of Stillness

195
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:08,400
and out of that Stillness grows wisdom and we can trust that

196
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:16,080
wisdom we can trust that wisdom that flows out of this Stillness this non

197
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:23,679
agitation and then the nature of this wisdom that like arises out of that it

198
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:30,520
has this quality of clarity and certainty

199
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,400
it has if it's not clear then it's not wisdom it's a certain type of confusion

200
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,480
that you know maybe maybe Clarity maybe wisdom will arise maybe Clarity will

201
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:48,000
arise but if it's not Clarity it's not wisdom it's a certain amount of

202
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:56,799
confusion but when I'm saying Clarity it doesn't mean necessarily that we have a clear intellectual cognitive conceptual

203
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:07,360
understanding sometimes wisdom just shows up as a more of a felt experience

204
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:16,720
of maybe wisdom has a a bodily experience of nothing needs to

205
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:24,600
happen right now and it's just a sense of contentment

206
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:30,080
non- agitation non-resistance like yeah nothing needs to

207
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,679
happen maybe that's and it's just that feeling of steadiness of stability not

208
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:44,760
being pushed around or maybe wisdom has uh some real

209
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:54,559
conceptual cognitive idea maybe there's something that just bubbles up like oh I should uh ask for forgiveness

210
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:03,200
yeah I I I I uh did some harm there or something like this or I should uh

211
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,960
tell the truth about this I should tell the whole truth about something you know maybe wisdom just

212
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,960
bubbles up that way and you know even though it's exactly what you don't want to do you don't want to admit that you made a mistake or that you were

213
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:24,000
withholding the truth or something like that maybe sometimes it just bubbles up and you're like oh yeah I don't want to

214
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,200
it's but yeah I can it just becomes clear and then there's a certain amount

215
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:38,960
of certainty too there's a certain amount of uh certainty because it's not

216
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,320
it's uh the wisdom is not concerned about

217
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,919
outcomes it's not like this yeah I should uh tell the whole truth about

218
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:57,799
this so that dot dot dot it doesn't have the so that dot dot dot it has I should

219
00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:03,840
tell the whole truth about this because it's the right thing to do because it's

220
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,919
it's the next thing to do if we have this so that dot dot dot

221
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:14,600
so that they will like me more so that I'll feel more comfortable around them

222
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,880
so that uh I can get a promotion this person won't be irritated with me so

223
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:27,640
that you know all this then that so that that may be a smart and thing to do but

224
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:33,120
it's a little bit different than the wisdom that I'm talking about or pointing to the wisdom that comes out of

225
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,158
this Stillness that comes out of this non

226
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:45,600
agitation but I'm saying it has this uh Clarity and certainty but maybe there

227
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:52,200
isn't Clarity you can have clarity about their

228
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:57,880
not being Clarity there's confusion right now and

229
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:05,559
you can be clear that there's confusion and in that way right that's

230
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:11,720
Clarity and I'm a person that doesn't like to be confused much better now but

231
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:18,559
in the beginning like I had to like understand everything and know everything and I spend so much of my energy trying to understand

232
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:24,360
everything and this was like a game changer for me if you know that you're

233
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,880
confused you're not confused you know that you're confused

234
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:37,120
and then so I would just say oh confusion is here and then somehow that would just feel better and I didn't feel

235
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,520
this certain like oh okay I got to figure it out feeling just you know that just like oh no no no this is just what

236
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,200
confusion feels like this feels like fogginess or uncertainty or hesitation

237
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:53,320
it feels like restlessness agitation however it

238
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:58,559
feels so if there's some Stillness you can trust the wisdom that comes out of

239
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,919
it the wisdom has Clarity and certainty if there isn't Clarity you can have

240
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:10,960
clarity about not having Clarity and that can be a certain part of

241
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:17,240
wisdom there's this way that we might say you know wisdom knows what needs to be

242
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:24,000
done instead of saying when I have wisdom I know what needs to be done

243
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:32,399
that's conventional language and we can use that and but there's a way if we were you know just to tweak the language

244
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:39,799
wisdom knows what's to be done kind of like take out the part of like I when I'm wise knows what to do or my wisdom

245
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:44,840
knows just like wisdom knows what's to be done there's a way there can be a

246
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:51,120
certain kind of relaxation of you know trying to prove something to ourselves

247
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:58,398
or to somebody else and kind of like know just taking the me taking the ey out of it

248
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:07,000
so also there's this way in which this Stillness that can happen when there's this non- agitation that can happen when

249
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,799
we are bringing um this attitude that the only thing that needs to be brought

250
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:20,000
to meditation practice is just to receive experiences with Clarity know

251
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:28,679
them understand them as best we can there's also this sense of equinity

252
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:35,159
that's essentially kind of what it means right to receive experiences instead of just immediately running away from them

253
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:43,159
or trying to grab on to them so equinity has this sense of stability this sense

254
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:49,039
of unshake ability a sense of balance or

255
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:54,080
we might even say ballast you know like this way of uh you know on a sailboat

256
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,760
you might go over to the side but with some ballast You Know It uh writes

257
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:10,159
itself I like this that uh Pabo uh writes that a mind that does not have

258
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:18,039
equinity we might say one that is not just receiving experiences is like uh being a drunk

259
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:24,840
driver he says uh PAB body writes it's like trying to drive down the middle of the lane but

260
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:31,919
no matter how hard the driver tries to go straight in inevitably they swerve right and left

261
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:39,200
sometimes they get to close to the car in the next lane or sometimes they get too close to the uh uh the edge of the

262
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,200
lane the edge of the road so there's this way in which uh we

263
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:55,518
can notice how when we don't have this stability the mind is kind of like doing this trying to find just the perfect uh

264
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:03,559
experience so this idea of like to bring this attitude that mindfulness meditation is about receiving

265
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:10,960
experiences with clarity as opposed to trying to have a particular

266
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,720
experience in some ways as I was pointing to earlier is really different than what we might have thought about

267
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,880
you know mindfulness meditation to be sure a lot of people

268
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:28,840
come to meditation either indirectly or directly through mbsr mindfulness based stress reduction we just want to feel

269
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:33,720
more relaxed we want to have more

270
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:42,399
ease and it turns out that a way to have more relaxation and more ease is as best

271
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:47,440
we can to soften the amount of pushing and

272
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:54,600
pulling we're having on our experience soften the reactivity that we're

273
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,760
having but it's so you know we live in a societ soety of course that's really

274
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,120
promoting you know pleasure and you have to feel good all the time and this idea

275
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,880
that if you're aren't feeling good all the time then you know something is terribly

276
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,640
wrong but there's this way in which um maybe here's a third attitude that we

277
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:22,840
can bring to our meditation practice is

278
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:28,840
that our wellbeing is important

279
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:37,399
and then you might ask but wait di you're talking about we shouldn't be uh chasing pleasure it's so important to

280
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:44,559
make this distinction between well-being and pleasure often they get

281
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:50,279
conflated and I know that sometimes uh and when I've have like uh practice

282
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:57,159
discussions with individuals I'm thinking of one time in particular I had uh you know given the

283
00:30:57,159 --> 00:31:04,200
invitation or instruction or you know to pay attention to your well-being and you know be sensitive to when there's a

284
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:10,639
really high sense of wellbeing a good sense of wellbeing and then sometime later that

285
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:16,440
person came back to me and said well when you told me to do whatever makes me happy and to go after pleasure I should

286
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:21,760
do this no that's not actually what I said but you know of course we hear this

287
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:30,880
of course we hear it that way but there are times when our uh practice

288
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,000
when we're like meditating for example when there will be a sense of discomfort

289
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,080
either whether it's you know having the body be still or you know things are coming up that are

290
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:49,159
uncomfortable and I remember hearing a Gil say this a long time ago something

291
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:55,240
he said something about any spiritual practice worth its salt or will have

292
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,320
some time when you feel uncomfortable it's not just about you know having mean

293
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,639
pleasure all the time that's about Bliss that's probably involves intoxicants if

294
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:13,159
you want to be feeling pleasure all the time right but to notice if when you're

295
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:20,679
meditating if there's a certain amount of like you know feeling tired or like oh my gosh when is this going to end

296
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:26,279
type of feeling or like when the bell rings and there's a oh thank goodness

297
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:33,440
that kind of a Feeling then that can be an indicator that you're trying to have particular

298
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,080
experiences that you're Sly trying to push something away or sadly trying to

299
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:45,200
have something more and that undermines your sense

300
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:55,080
of well-being in the sense that wellbeing is this sense of uh maybe

301
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:04,080
a certain sense of stability a sense of okayness despite things being

302
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:10,120
uncomfortable despite things being you know really comfortable or something like this and this is a subtle thing

303
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:16,559
that I'm pointing to it turns out the greatest sense of

304
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:24,080
well-being is not chasing after experiences and not pushing them away

305
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,360
but instead to just be with what is

306
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:36,679
I've said this a number of times and I I like to say I'm going to say it again that often we have this sense of like oh

307
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:43,960
yeah but I want to be really uh um relaxed and happy and I want to not be

308
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:50,080
experiencing this thing that's agitating me or my life is a mess and falling apart and I want to have clarity about

309
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:56,200
that you know we want something that's not being experienced we want you know something out

310
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,399
there point B we're at Point a and whatever's

311
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:08,480
happening here isn't adequate we want you know this out there how do we get to this point B how

312
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:14,280
do we get to this place where what we want is going to be there when we when we're going to have

313
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:19,599
this sense of well-being and ease and Peace and Freedom and how do we get to

314
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,638
point B you get to point

315
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:31,000
B by being completely full fully at Point

316
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:40,919
a just being at Point a receiving the experience with with

317
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:47,960
Clarity that's how you get to point B and this is something that you can

318
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:56,000
hear somebody say this but it's not until you have experienced this you realize oh yeah

319
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:04,280
there's something about putting down the struggle there's something about putting down the um the

320
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:09,359
agitation and instead this incredible I'm using the word incredible

321
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:16,200
it is incredible but it's subtle this sense of wellbe that

322
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:22,720
arises even though we might be uncomfortable but we're no

323
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:29,560
longer just we're no longer wrestling with reality

324
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:35,839
it can be like yeah this sucks but it is

325
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:45,640
what it is and when we in those moments of non- agitation is when this wisdom can

326
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,920
arise so these are some attitudes that we can be to bring to

327
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:58,640
practice the attitude that you know mindfulness meditation is

328
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:06,640
about experiencing what is being AR what is happening as opposed to you

329
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,040
know having a particular experience that's one

330
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:18,119
attitude it's enough it's enough to just experience what's

331
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:25,240
happening a second attitude is you can trust the wisdom that flows out of that

332
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:33,319
Stillness and the third is your wellbeing is important pay attention to

333
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:41,359
the subtle sense of contentment ease Peace and Freedom these are

334
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:49,440
different than pleasure they're related to happiness they're in the neighborhood of Happiness

335
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,440
uh and happy yeah so if I but I maybe I want to

336
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,599
highlight is that it's different than pleasure so these three attitudes can make a real

337
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:07,200
big difference in your meditation experience as well as in your

338
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:13,839
life especially when we notice how often we don't have these attitudes that can

339
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:21,839
be really helpful too short little poem this poem is by Rosemary traumer of

340
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,960
course I love her poetry I'm often using her poems saying her poems so once a

341
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:33,079
really short it's called what took me so long I love her titles what took me so

342
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:41,599
long and here's this poem again it's by Rosemary traumer what took me so

343
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,599
long plain referee between the Sun and

344
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,560
clouds eventually I take off my stripes to be a spectator

345
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:59,440
instead how pleasant without all that

346
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:08,720
whistling plain referee between the Sun and

347
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:15,119
clouds eventually I take off my stripes to be a spectator

348
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,599
instead how pleasant without all that

349
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:28,680
whistling right the referees on the side are always whistling nope do this nope do that you know

350
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:37,119
and something that I love about this little poem she's playing referee between the Sun and

351
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:43,400
clouds sun and clouds this is nature they the clouds are

352
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:49,400
moving we don't control them just in the same way that uh there's so many things

353
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:56,520
that we don't control but we're trying to control but how helpful is it to see that oh yeah it's just the nature of

354
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:03,640
some experiences to be uncomfortable it's the nature that we don't get to control as many things as we think we

355
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,400
can or something like

356
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:15,160
this there's this way that when we stop being the referee stop whistling and you

357
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:22,640
know trying to make things go a certain way there's just kind of like a the

358
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:29,720
reactivity just uh settles down just through attrition or uh empath uh

359
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:35,640
entropy or there's this way in which the reactivity just starts to lose its

360
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:43,039
energy and and it's so much more pleasant so much more

361
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,760
well-being I think I'll end with that and I'll open it up to see if there are

362
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:58,359
some questions or comments we already have a question back here

363
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:16,359
it's been my experience that false beliefs can be really tricky and like I

364
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:23,079
have a lot of them about my spiritual practice it could be any number of things but how active do you have to be

365
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:28,440
in kind of like trying to see them and maybe say oh is that really

366
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:33,640
true yeah this is a great question so I was talking about like mindfulness

367
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:38,880
meditation in just terms of uh just like receiving experiences but there might be

368
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,640
a time in which you do a different type you know I'm maybe being technical here

369
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,079
uh during meditation it might be helpful to like stop doing being Mindful and

370
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,240
instead drop in a question and to say what is being believed

371
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:01,000
here and then you know just i' I've say this sometimes you like just

372
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,800
ask just asking the question and then something bubbles up so there's a way in

373
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:13,119
which we could be mindful mindful but we notice that we can't be mindful because there's this pressure to think or a lot

374
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:20,160
of uncomfortableness and we're just feeling stuck and we're just grinding our wheels or spinning our wheels or something like that then maybe it's

375
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:25,599
appropriate to put mindfulness aside and then to just drop in a question or something like

376
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,240
that thank you for that question

377
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,440
great yeah great talk thank you you're welcome um so the challenge I encounter

378
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,880
with respect to attitude or uh being uh the referee during my

379
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:50,560
practice is the apparent Paradox between accepting and allowing and

380
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:58,000
honoring and validating what is and wanting to cultivate compassion

381
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,319
find peace uh relax and I think the Paradox is very Salient in the example

382
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:12,240
of anger so when anger arises and I practice with it of course there's an

383
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:18,839
instinct to find compassion you know don't let the mind uh get lost in

384
00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:24,400
thought come back to the breath there's you know an effort to uh not let the

385
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:31,359
anger consume me but on the other hand uh honoring and validating the

386
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:38,920
anger that it's okay to be angry it's reasonable to be angry given the situation uh it's not wrong or shameful

387
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:44,160
to be angry uh is a tricky uh balance I

388
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,240
find because if anger is allowed to have

389
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:57,240
free reign and it is perfectly fine the way it is uh I suspect that's

390
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:02,599
not going to lead to more peace and compassion so I wonder how you balance

391
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:08,319
this uh amount of effort especially in the example of difficult emotions yeah

392
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:16,359
yeah so I would say in mindfulness meditation well like in like a formal meditation period I'll say the anger can

393
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:22,599
just allow it to build up up up up rage oh my gosh murderous rage and you're still like sitting here and it's like oh

394
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:29,760
my gosh this like it's big and just experience expc in like oh yep heat in

395
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:36,160
the face the arms and want to like punch or something that the legs want to run

396
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:42,160
or in the body maybe there's lump in the throat you like there's just agitation in the body and you're still sitting and

397
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:50,640
maybe there's even sweat coming you're like and still sitting then it's the nature for it to come up and then pass

398
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:56,240
away but it's can we do that can we allow it to catch really big and what

399
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:04,880
often happens I'd say most often happens and this is a part of the difficulty is it arises and then we get lost in

400
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:10,480
thought oh I shouldn't be angry I I or or yeah I can't believe they did that

401
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,240
and that reminds me this other time they did that and the next time this happens I'm going to do this and you know and then we're completely lost in thought

402
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:21,280
and we're no longer just being with the experience so one way to just be with

403
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:29,200
the experience and allow it to rise and pass away and it will pass away of course it will is um to translate anger

404
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:34,920
into a bodily somatic experience I described it you know heat in the face

405
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:40,400
or want to move wanting to move or whatever it might be so to use

406
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:47,079
adjectives or descriptions about bodily experiences because anger all of our

407
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:53,559
emotions have different uh elements they have both thoughts and uh uh Sensations

408
00:44:53,559 --> 00:45:01,599
in the body the sensations in the body are or what's happening in the present moment the thoughts aren't so let the thoughts

409
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:07,680
you don't have to get rid of them just let them be in the background and take care of themselves just like oh yeah

410
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:13,119
there's going to be all that story making there's going to be a lot of pressure and and then they're going to protest no no no this is really

411
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:21,160
important you have to think about this because other but as best you can just be with the bodily experience and then

412
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:27,240
that's then allow it whatever is going to arise next to arise yeah yeah very interesting so as I understand the

413
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:34,520
effort then is bringing the attention down and what I wonder then is what what

414
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:40,040
then arises with that effort is the resistance to

415
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:45,720
thought the resistance itself as an experience that recognizing that I am

416
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:50,760
lost in thought bringing the attention down being with what is here and

417
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:56,240
recognizing a strong resistance to new thoughts it's very interesting it's very

418
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:03,400
subtle resistance to those thoughts and the more that resistance builds and the more

419
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:10,480
I'm able to stay with the emotion of anger eventually that bottle is going to pop and the thoughts will come flooding

420
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:15,680
back even after long periods of Silence long periods of Stillness long periods

421
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:22,640
of being with the breath and the emotion the thoughts are not happy that I'm not giving them my

422
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:29,760
attention so can you be and shift the for example go away from anger and go towards

423
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:36,839
resistance oh yeah the experience of resistance is like this it's this feeling of whatever it is because that's

424
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:41,920
the next thing that's happening is the is resistance maybe that there's maybe

425
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:48,640
there's some residue of anger maybe some energy left or something but then to notice the resistance that's cool that's

426
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:57,000
perfect thank you you're welcome you're welcome okay so thank you all for your

427
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,160
kind attention and I'm wishing you a wonderful rest of the evening thank you
