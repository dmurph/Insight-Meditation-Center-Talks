1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,720
welcome a really warm welcome

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:14,920
for everybody welcome whoops here we go i have to get all my gizmos

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:23,840
straight so we'll start with a guided meditation

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,160
just a light guidance not a lot

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,160
to finish arriving

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:45,840
to our seat here

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,719
that is to sit either literally or figuratively

8
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:04,400
to sit and to know that you're sitting what does that mean

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:12,000
to know that you're sitting while you're sitting bringing the attention

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,200
bring in the awareness

11
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:27,840
to the experience of the moment in this moment we're sitting

12
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,840
part of noticing that we're sitting is noticing that that we're connected

13
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,560
we're grounded connected to the zafu we're sitting on

14
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,479
the cushion maybe a zabuton a mat

15
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,560
maybe a chair or a bench whatever it might be

16
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:16,879
it can be helpful to feel the contact of the body with what's supporting the

17
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,840
body

18
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:39,280
and then to rest the awareness on the sensations of breathing

19
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,239
feeling the movement of the chest or abdomen or feeling the air going

20
00:02:52,239 --> 00:03:05,840
in and out of the nose

21
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,720
and noticing in a way that's relaxed and yet

22
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,360
purposeful

23
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,799
finding the balance between the amount of effort

24
00:03:46,799 --> 00:04:01,840
we're applying

25
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,919
and when the mind wanders is it likely will we just very

26
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:44,160
simply gently begin again without making a problem out of it

27
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,960
without building stories around it we just begin again with the sensations

28
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,840
of breathing

29
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:53,280
sometimes when we come to meditate we find that

30
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:00,879
the energy is low when we feel kind of drowsy or drifty or

31
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,479
not really present

32
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,759
one thing we can do is put a little bit of attention on the

33
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:27,840
posture sitting up just a little bit straighter

34
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:41,839
letting that little extra effort with the body help energize the mind

35
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:19,360
something else we can do if you find yourself with low energy

36
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,160
is to bring a sense of curiosity to the experience

37
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,720
where does low energy show up in the

38
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:41,760
body maybe it's a heaviness in the shoulders

39
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,839
maybe it's a slouching posture

40
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:02,000
how do the thoughts feel if there's some drowsiness or

41
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,079
tiredness are the thoughts kind of wispy and

42
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:16,000
not clear dreamy maybe so just having a sense of curiosity kind

43
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:25,760
of investigating wow what does it feel like to not have a lot of energy

44
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:36,560
does that also mean there's low enthusiasm but just to bring the spirit of inquiry

45
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:47,839
can help raise the energy a little bit

46
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,399
if our energy is flagging

47
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:28,000
something else we might try or is just to reflect on what inspires us

48
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:35,839
about this practice

49
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,720
the potential for freedom

50
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:53,199
opportunity to and suffering for ourselves and others

51
00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:03,839
the buddha maybe we have a heartfelt connection to the buddha

52
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:17,839
sometimes it can be helpful to bring these to mind

53
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,640
sometimes when we meditate

54
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:51,039
the energies not available for us

55
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,200
maybe a number of reasons why

56
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,760
but we can use the body to bring in a little more

57
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,158
energy or bring some investigation or curiosity

58
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:21,840
or bring to mind something that's inspiring that why we're practicing

59
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,399
so that our practice those times when we're on the cushion

60
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:34,399
our practice can be fruitful or meaningful or

61
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:42,840
useful or not just sitting and whiling the time

62
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,159
away so that our practice can support us and

63
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:55,360
be a benefit for our life and so that we might have energy and

64
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,159
be able to support and be a benefit for others

65
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:11,120
so in this way may our practice be for the benefit of all beings

66
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,840
everywhere

67
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,790
[Music]

68
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:20,240
good evening welcome welcome wherever you might be and whenever it

69
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,640
might be a warm welcome

70
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:32,080
so today i'd like to continue on this series of the pyramids

71
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,520
first so maybe i'll say just a word about the parmes sometimes we translate them as

72
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:45,679
perfections these are qualities that can be a support for our life and

73
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:51,360
for our practice that's a list of ten the first one

74
00:30:51,360 --> 00:31:00,320
is generosity second is ethical behavior and then renunciation and then wisdom

75
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,840
and now we're tonight i'm gonna be talking about the fifth one energy

76
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,480
and energy is the translation of the word viria gets translated in all kinds of

77
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,960
different ways sometimes perseverance strength effort

78
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,240
courage vigor but for the most part i'll be using this

79
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,960
word energy and derma teachers kind of interpret

80
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:37,440
this fifth parame sometimes is along the lines of right effort and

81
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:43,360
sometimes more about energy and this is something that i appreciate so much about the dharma

82
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,640
that there are so many depths and sometimes like if you pull one little

83
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,880
thread you discover like oh this thread is connected to so many other things

84
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,640
and maybe what's interesting or inspiring today i want to be what's

85
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,159
interesting and inspiring you know for you for me next year next week

86
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,760
tomorrow so i i really appreciate kind of the richness

87
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:17,919
of this so i like it when there's this word viria that gets translated or

88
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,679
interpreted in a real breadth because i feel like sometimes maybe one

89
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:29,679
interpretation will be really helpful and supportive and maybe the others don't feel quite

90
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:35,518
relevant until they do maybe sometime later

91
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:43,200
so one way that we might understand this word viria gets translated as energy is the

92
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:51,600
willingness to stay with what is that is to not bounce off of those

93
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:57,760
things that are uncomfortable suffering for us to

94
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:06,159
learn about suffering take some viria to really understand it to really

95
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:14,000
find our way with suffering without running away or or turning away

96
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:24,320
but in some ways to engage with suffering in a way that brings freedom and awakening

97
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:32,240
so there's the um teachings of the pyramids are not from the earliest layer of the text that is

98
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:41,120
the buddha isn't he doesn't himself teach about the parmes but instead it was um sometime later

99
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:47,279
and this this is kind of what the tradition holds that there is the question of why did

100
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,480
the buddha become the buddha what what was uh so

101
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,799
exemplary about this individual that became a buddha and

102
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:07,840
one answer that came up was because he had perfected the parmes these ten qualities

103
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,878
but in that kind of that literature um describing uh the pyramids this is

104
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,129
um the pyramid of energy is this um

105
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:25,200
[Music] exaltation i'm not sure what the word is kind of

106
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,398
a divine i don't know it's not divine but an utterance

107
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:38,560
may i be filled within inexhaustible energy vigor and fortitude

108
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:45,520
and cultivating the path to enlightenment and in working for the benefit of others

109
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:52,960
so that's kind of how party of energy is described may i be filled with inexhaustible

110
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:59,359
energy vigor and fortitude in cultivating the path to enlightenment

111
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:05,760
and in working for the benefit of others for me personally i feel a little bit

112
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,800
overwhelmed like oh my goodness inexhaustible

113
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:18,319
energy vigor and fortitude it feels like a little bit

114
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:26,400
either i want to be kind of dismissive like oh that's just hyperbole that's just uh from the language of

115
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:33,440
thousands of years ago or i feel like wow who can do that you know somebody other

116
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:42,000
than me or somebody other than anybody i know can have inexhaustible energy vigor and fortitude

117
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:49,680
but then i felt like so if we and beaker body writes about this a little bit he's a well-known scholar and

118
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,880
translator he writes about as energy is needed

119
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,160
because our own natural tendency

120
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,280
is to either flow with the stream of desire

121
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,320
or to just drift along with whatever is the tendency of the mind

122
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,560
so flowing and drifting in some ways kind of being pushed around

123
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:23,520
but it takes energy to not be drifting to not be flowing

124
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:29,599
to either be going against this dream or even to just stop moving

125
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:37,520
so then when i consider this then it feels like it makes a little more sense that it takes this inexhaustible

126
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:43,200
energy vigor and fortitude is more about not just be drifting and

127
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,680
flowing all the time

128
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:56,079
i know that there certainly have been times in my life when i was just drifting feeling like kind of like going the path

129
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,119
of least resistance and i found myself and not happy with my

130
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:09,520
life it wasn't uh rewarding in the way that i was thinking or expecting it to be

131
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:16,880
it wasn't until that i really started to look at my life and to make some changes which was not

132
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:23,359
easy it certainly took effort to kind of go a different direction or to even look at things

133
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:30,560
more clearly more candidly so this idea of energy so that we're not

134
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:37,680
just flowing and drifting but it takes energy where sometimes we

135
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:42,880
just don't have this energy so where does it come from we're human beings

136
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:51,119
we have a limited amount of energy so what might we do to support our having energy

137
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:59,040
and the classical teachings in the tradition is some vega this is a poly word some

138
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,359
vega i like the way it sounds some vegan

139
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:13,280
and this is um a word that describes what gotama the person who was

140
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:20,320
going to become the buddha but before he became the buddha this is something that he experienced

141
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:26,640
the tradition holds that after he had seen them the mess and the heavenly messengers the

142
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,680
old age sickness death and a monastic then he

143
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:39,920
felt moved he felt compelled to go on this quest

144
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:46,880
so some vega is what he had this sense of urgency this sense of

145
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,960
this yes this is what i'm going to do i'm going this direction and there's a sense of

146
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,440
energy that's associated with that and so it's this comes along with a

147
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:07,200
sense of resolve a sense of dedication and might uh be a real support and a feel

148
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:14,320
for us as we kind of go through the vicissitudes of practice

149
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:21,599
in the teachings of the buddha we don't hear about him having doubt but do we hear about some of the

150
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:28,560
the tremendous effort and determination that was put forth and so

151
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:35,040
sam vega and teneth robico he i appreciate very much his way of

152
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,079
expressing this and he says that um

153
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,160
it's a difficult word to translate that there isn't exactly an english equivalent to it

154
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,760
because it has a complex range according to tinnisropico

155
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,280
and he says there's three different aspects to this idea of some vega

156
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:05,920
one is the oppressive sense of dismay terror and alienation that comes with

157
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:12,880
realizing the futility and meaningless of this life of just

158
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:19,440
going flowing or drifting so this first feeling of like oh what

159
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,960
have i been doing with my life this this isn't going the direction i wanted it to it

160
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:32,400
this just doesn't make sense i this feeling of dismay terror and alienation

161
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:39,200
these are powerful words so this recognition that just drifting

162
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,560
is not what we want to do and then the second aspect of san vegas

163
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:52,880
this chastening sense of our own complicity complacency and foolishness

164
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,838
and having let ourselves live this way

165
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:06,240
this sense of for me i had a little bit of anger to this anger of i thought that if i

166
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:14,560
you know kind of drifted in this direction everything was going to turn out fine and it wasn't turning out fine

167
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,680
so and also this sense of our complacency and foolishness like oh why

168
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:27,760
didn't i know better so these three things of the

169
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:34,560
this sense of dismay a chastening sense of her complicity

170
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:41,280
and this sense of the sense of urgency sorry that was the

171
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:48,800
third one i didn't say this the sense of urgency of trying to find a way out

172
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:56,720
so these three things together the sense of urgency sense of complicity and this dismay

173
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,000
really or can be the fuel for practice

174
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:09,920
and sometimes we only experience this after a grave difficulty after some tragedy in our lives

175
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,760
is when we have this real sense of urgency to practice as we're trying to find a solution and

176
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:22,079
trying to make sense out of things perhaps but we don't have to wait until there's

177
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:29,200
a tragedy in our lives for this some vega there can be this

178
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,800
recognition of the suffering and it doesn't have to be the most terrible suffering but there can be a

179
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,640
real wish to understand this suffering what is going on here

180
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:47,119
how did i get here so this wish to understand it

181
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:54,160
which is a lit which is stronger more powerful than the wish to avoid it so we're

182
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:00,000
willing to investigate and get curious about

183
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,599
our difficulties and then that brings us to another way in which we can increase

184
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:12,960
our energy so first with some vega this sense of urgency and second is

185
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:21,119
investigation to have some curiosity to have a

186
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,960
engagement with whatever it is that we're doing

187
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:33,359
whether it's meditation have a sense of curiosity of the breath or what the mind is doing

188
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:38,839
sense of curiosity about what's happening in our life the way that we're

189
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:45,920
behaving i think we've all have this um this uh

190
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:55,359
experience that there's we have a sense of energy when we're interested

191
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:01,520
like we can sit through like some a podcast for example that other people

192
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,440
might think like oh my gosh this is the most boring thing but because it interests us we have like

193
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:16,079
a sense of energy and are really engaged with it with hobbies with whatever it might be

194
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:22,640
and so we can bring that sense of curiosity or investigation to our

195
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:28,160
experience whatever our experience might be

196
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,400
that is um instead of like slapping a label on our experience

197
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:40,640
that's boring this is painful that's hard we could really tease apart what are all

198
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:47,200
the different elements and then this also ties in

199
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,440
with the fourth pyramid that is the one that precedes energy is wisdom

200
00:44:53,599 --> 00:45:00,240
and one way we can understand wisdom or part of wisdom is that it's a discernment or

201
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:07,760
distinguishing that is seen with some clarity with what really is

202
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:14,480
when i talked about wisdom i talked about the owls having big eyes that is seeing clearly and part of that

203
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:22,240
is to make the discrimination between this and that instead of just lumping

204
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:30,160
things together so one thing that of course is important

205
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,839
to investigate as part of our practice is this question is what is helpful and

206
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:40,960
what is unhelpful what is helpful to find more ease

207
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,720
more freedom what is on the path to awakening enlightenment

208
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,480
which is not on the path and maybe i'll say even asking that

209
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:59,440
question is on the path so to have this question what is helpful

210
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:07,040
what is skillful what is wholesome what is this we could even say

211
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:12,480
what is this kind of pointing to the self maybe as an investigation who is doing

212
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:18,800
the investigation it's more about the openness and the

213
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,800
questioning than than finding the answers it's more about

214
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:31,280
being receptive to learning something new rather than thinking that we have it all

215
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:37,599
figured out so our mindfulness practice of course

216
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:43,119
brings us face to face all the time with what with difficulties

217
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:48,560
as well as what leads to suffering and what doesn't lead to suffering

218
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:55,119
as well as the suffering that leads to the end of suffering

219
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:01,359
so part of wisdom part of investigation and something that can increase our energy increase our

220
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:09,119
engagement with what's happening is to have the asking these ques asking these

221
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:14,560
questions this leads to suffering but is this uncomfortableness is this suffering

222
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:22,480
lead to the end of suffering looking at my ethical behavior

223
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:30,000
maybe it's painful maybe we realize oh there were times in my life when my

224
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:37,440
ethical behavior wasn't so clean i told lies or i

225
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:43,920
took things that weren't freely offered whatever it might be it might be painful to recognize that in

226
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:50,319
ourselves but that can be part of the

227
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:56,480
building of our ethical behavior in the in the present as well as a

228
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:03,040
part of the diminishing or um putting it aside at

229
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:10,319
those things which might decrease our energy that is not being ethical really

230
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:16,000
dissipates and takes away our energy because there's always a part of the

231
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,838
mind and a part of the heart that is

232
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:29,680
busy busy with whatever it is that we did wrong i'm using this word wrong whichever was

233
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:35,838
unethical which wasn't helpful let's use that language

234
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:46,960
so some vega an investigation can increase energy so that we

235
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:53,119
might not just be drifting or flowing through our lives something else that can increase our

236
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:59,200
energy is joy joy and happiness

237
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:05,760
sometimes we might feel that our practice is drudgery it has fallen into the category

238
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:11,040
of being one more chore that we have to do

239
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:17,760
it's uh something we just have to squeeze into our day even though we don't really

240
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:23,839
have time for it and it starts to feel burdensome that's just you know one more thing we have to

241
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:28,960
do and maybe it's one more arena in which the inner critic

242
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:35,760
gets to play loudly and have a commentary about the quality of

243
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:44,000
the meditation or how long we're meditating or how often we're meditating

244
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,400
so this sense of kind of this drudgery of course there isn't going to be a lot of energy

245
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,440
there but can we connect with some of

246
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,559
in the beginning of the well while we were still in the honeymoon phase of practice

247
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:09,119
that is it used to be that we perhaps would like open up dharma books be feel inspired by them go to dharma

248
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:16,720
talks feel inspired by them can we touch into what is inspiring for

249
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:24,079
us maybe it is listening to dharma talks

250
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:30,880
maybe there's a devotional element of your practice maybe there's something about um

251
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:36,960
doing bowing or prostration that is nourishing and feeds the heart in the way that just hearing a dharma

252
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:44,480
talk doesn't maybe chanting for a lot of people chanting is a beautiful practice

253
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:50,640
maybe suit does studies for me there's something about this who does that i really love

254
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:57,520
i was um doing some suit to study with some friends recently and one person said it's kind of like a

255
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:02,559
puzzle and you know kind of like the how and what i was thinking like it's

256
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:09,119
interesting how in the newspaper we have sudoku and we have crossword puzzles but in some ways this

257
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:16,240
suit does just kind of that a joy of like engaging with them and like what is being pointed

258
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:23,040
to here and what is the context here and how do we understand this and how is

259
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:29,040
this relevant and applicable to our lives so for me i love doing this it's not for

260
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:35,520
everybody it doesn't have to be for everybody but what is it for you that brings

261
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:42,559
energy to the practice but it might be also that sometimes we

262
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:50,400
have this idea that well yeah but if i'm happy or having fun doing it or it's joyful then

263
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:59,040
it can't be spiritual it can't be proper if it feels good

264
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:04,800
so i would just invite you to investigate that belief

265
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:10,240
the you might recognize i've been i was talking about energy and then

266
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:18,000
investigation and i'm talking about joy these are three awakening factors that is these are

267
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:23,440
three energizing factors of awakening the buddha identified

268
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,720
these qualities it's a whole list of seven i'm only giving three out of the seven here

269
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:36,000
but these three are the ones that are uplifting and energizing and my point is that joy

270
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:42,160
is on this list so joy is energizing and supports our having

271
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:48,000
energy but it also is a factor of awakening

272
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:54,880
it's an element it's a necessary element to the practice so the encouragement is

273
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:00,000
to find your way with joy and happiness of course

274
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:07,520
in a way that's with kind of keeping with the ethical behavior and wholesome and helpful and skillful

275
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:15,760
but we need to stay connected with these areas these areas that really nourish and

276
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:22,400
fuel our practice so if we want to look at energy it's

277
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:27,760
also helpful to look at well what blocks energy or what dissipates

278
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:34,319
energy or what gets in the way i already talked about unethical

279
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:39,680
behavior really subtracts takes away from our energy

280
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:44,318
another one is just distractions

281
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:50,720
how many notifications is it possible for us to have we just heard one on my phone earlier my

282
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:57,359
apologies about that so just that we're often whether it's

283
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:03,359
our phones or our computers or something where often our attention is

284
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:09,200
being pulled in so many different ways maybe we're trying to multitask and

285
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,720
do a few things at once and so there's a way that kind of like

286
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:22,160
fragments our energy dissipates our energy to to always be multitasking

287
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:28,880
there's something a little bit more fulfilling and satisfying if we can

288
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:35,839
uni-task as best we can just to bring some focus and some

289
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:42,000
intentionality to our effort to whatever it is that we're doing as opposed to just drifting

290
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:49,519
or or flowing with it but to bring some intentions to it

291
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:56,319
of course this is obvious but something else that can takes our energy is just

292
00:54:56,319 --> 00:55:03,359
not getting enough sleep maybe that goes without saying but

293
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:10,000
i'll just share for me just noticing what a difference it makes when one has

294
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,599
a good amount of sleep this should be such a priority

295
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:21,838
and i'm happy that more and more these days people are talking about the importance of sleep

296
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:32,079
and so i talked about a little bit earlier about

297
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:39,440
being inspired this is also if we're not inspired if we don't have

298
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,720
a sense of a direction that we're going

299
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:52,160
sometimes in spiritual circles they don't like to talk about goals but maybe if we could talk about the

300
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:59,280
direction we're going i would say we can't talk about goals we can talk about awakening

301
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:05,839
or less suffering less stress but sometimes we shy away from having

302
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:10,960
goals because we have this feeling like well maybe other people can do that but i

303
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:17,920
can't somewhere there's this kind of lack of self-confidence that is prohibiting us

304
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:24,160
from dreaming big or even having an aspiration

305
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:31,040
and so sometimes not having that can cause there to not really

306
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:36,400
um give an occasion which the energy to coalesce around or the energy to come

307
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:43,440
together so not having a direction not having an aspiration not having a goal

308
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:51,359
using whatever language feels appropriate for you but what what is the purpose if we want

309
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:55,440
to use that language for your practice

310
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:03,520
and maybe sometimes that feels too heavy-handed and maybe sometimes it's really helpful

311
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:11,520
to connect with your aspiration so we can have some curiosity about that

312
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:15,119
bring some investigation to that

313
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:23,359
so i've been talking all this time about increasing energy so that we might with this pyramid of energy

314
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:28,880
have this inexhaustible energy fortitude and vigor

315
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:36,079
but of course we can have too much energy in terms of it spills over into restlessness

316
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:41,160
or doesn't allow the um if it's out of balance with

317
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:49,599
concentration then there can be uh then the mind can't quite settle if there's too much energy

318
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:57,040
and pointing to that is this simile of the goldsmith that's we find in the suit and

319
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:04,160
it goes like this suppose a goldsmith would prepare a hot furnace

320
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:11,440
heat up a receptacle take some gold using tongs and put the gold into the

321
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:17,520
receptacle so like this the gold is sitting in a crucible

322
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:23,680
and um it's getting heated while it's the crucible is in the furnace

323
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:31,440
and then from time to time the goldsmith would blow on it sprinkle water on it or just look on

324
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:37,599
as the gold was heating if the goldsmith were to only blow on it

325
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:42,558
it's possible that the gold would just burn up

326
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:50,559
if the goldsmith were to only sprinkle water over it it's possible the gold would cool down if

327
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:57,760
the goldsmith were to only just look on it's possible the gold would not reach the right consistency

328
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:05,520
but if the goldsmith would from time to time blow on it from time to time sprinkle

329
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:14,160
water on it and from time to time just look on the gold would become purified bright

330
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:21,119
unblemished rid of imperfection malleable wieldy steady

331
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:27,440
and attained to imperturbability then whatever ornament the goldsmith

332
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:33,200
wishes to make from it whether it's a bracelet earrings necklaces or a garland that can

333
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:38,559
be achieved this is significant because the way that

334
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:45,440
the buddha is describing the gold here when it has just enough heat by blowing on it or let just enough water by

335
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:52,880
cooling it he's describing the goldust purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection

336
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,559
malleable wieldy steady and attained to

337
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:06,640
imperturbability the buddha uses these exact words to describe his mind right before

338
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:14,559
awakening so he's describing not too much heat

339
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:21,359
vigor not too much coolness not too much standing back but from time

340
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:29,440
to time so to have a balance with our energy

341
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:37,040
probably many of us are familiar with this also another story but sona i'll just say

342
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:42,640
who was a loot player like a stringed instrument and the buddha teaching the strings

343
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:49,119
should not be too tight or too loose again pointing to the importance of balance

344
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:54,880
with our energy so may we use our energy in a way that

345
01:00:54,880 --> 01:01:00,640
helps us on their path to enlightenment and i'm let's see what that's i'm

346
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:06,078
looking for the definition here of uh how it's used in the

347
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:12,880
may i be filled with inexhaustible energy vigor and fortitude and cultivating the path to

348
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:19,760
enlightenment and in working for the benefit of others and working for the benefit of

349
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:25,839
others thank you
