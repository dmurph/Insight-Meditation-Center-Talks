so hello hello and welcome everyone to happy hour lovely to be with you and to

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:14,300
to feel your presence so

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:22,320
so for this week what I wanted to bring um for our consideration as we engage

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,420
with the practice is a quote that I ran into this week

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,940
and this quote is often uh in

6
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,219
um an inappropriately credited to to

7
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:45,899
um gyote if I'm saying his name right in German but actually is the person who wrote it

8
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,920
is not and I'll put a link to this later so that Neil can share it

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,199
with the with all of you but here actually you know what I can put the

10
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:05,040
put put it in chat right now because some of you are visual so you might want to actually see the quote sir while I

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,380
read it if you prefer you can also there it is so the quote is

12
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:17,220
I have come to the frightening conclusion that I am the decisive element

13
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:24,420
it is my personal approach that creates the climate it is my daily mood that makes the

14
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,979
weather I possess tremendous power to make life miserable or joyous

15
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:38,060
I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration

16
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:43,860
I can humiliate or humor hurt or heal

17
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:53,100
in all situations it is my response that decides whether a crisis is escalated or

18
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,680
de-escalated and the person is humanized or dehumanized

19
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,740
if we treat people as they are we make them worse

20
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:10,259
if we treat people as they ought to be we help them become what they are

21
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:18,239
capable of becoming wrote this in the book called teacher

22
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:26,400
and child a book for parents and teachers so now you get a sense of the orientation as a teacher

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:34,080
um I found I I was struck by this quote the power of this quote especially the way

24
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,239
it starts I have come to the frightening conclusion that I am the decisive

25
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,459
element and it is so true we we know this our

26
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:51,480
approach our um our attitude as as he says I ca I

27
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:58,560
possess tremendous power to make life miserable or joyous you know and happy hour we've talked in the past many many

28
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,800
times about this quote which is the name of a book happiness is a choice you make

29
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:11,940
is a choice you make so he continues I can humiliate or humor hurt or heal

30
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,580
in all situations it is my response that decides whether a crisis is escalated

31
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,959
the person is humanized dehumanized ETC so so

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,900
to realize really to realize the tremendous power

33
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:38,879
that we have in our choices that we have a choice we have a choice as to how we

34
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,599
respond to any moment to any situation

35
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,180
we we have we have choices we have a choice

36
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:57,900
and the more we practice the more we practice with cultivating with turning

37
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:03,840
our minds our hearts towards making a wise a kind a

38
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,239
humanizing a compassionate choice that choice becomes more readily

39
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:15,480
available to us in the moment it and you know this you know this from

40
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:21,239
your practice you know this that if your mind has been swimming in

41
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:29,300
thoughts of kindness generosity good will oh that becomes more available as a choice in real time

42
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,759
and if it's been swimming with rumination and and difficult thoughts of

43
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,800
anger and why me or whatever the the version might be for your makeup

44
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,419
for your thought patterns and the heart is less less primed less primed

45
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:54,180
to uh to that wise choice to to really taking our

46
00:04:54,180 --> 00:05:00,060
our seat of power to make to make wise compassionate choices so

47
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:07,500
so I wanted to seed our practice with that quote tonight and let's sit together we'll sit with a lot of Silence

48
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:14,880
tonight um with calming the mind with the breath I had some new invitations this past

49
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:23,520
week that you found very helpful I'm going to bring those back in to study the mind first with the breath the body

50
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:33,300
and then turning towards towards kindness towards Metta so so with that let's uh let's arrive

51
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:39,440
let's arrive together let's arrive in this body in this moment

52
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:04,139
and first let's turn to our breath in the body breath in the body

53
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:09,660
letting awareness relax letting the body relax first

54
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:17,400
relax relax relax to your body the more relaxed we are the easier

55
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,620
the practice becomes the more the Mind relaxes if the body is

56
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:29,460
relaxed and let's actually begin with

57
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:35,759
3D diaphragmatic breaths to arrive and settle

58
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:42,740
taking a deep breath topic it up a little more

59
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:49,139
holding the breath a little bit a few seconds and then Letting Go ah

60
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:56,400
a sound arriving in the body another breath then topping it up at the

61
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:04,100
end can be supportive holding

62
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:12,259
sailing third one

63
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:27,919
now let the breath be natural relax the body and receive the breath

64
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:35,160
making an intention a relaxed

65
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:43,699
the persistent intention to connect with just this in-breath the entirety of it

66
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:51,080
and now make an intention to connect with this out breath the entirety of it

67
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,840
renewing the intention to connect to receive to relax and receive this

68
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:05,520
in-breath again relax and receive this out breath

69
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,159
so every time we reconnect with the intention

70
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,680
relax and receive the breath

71
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,279
foreign

72
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:26,640
that the mind is wandering on and has gone off to a thought or plan or

73
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,860
whatever it's okay it's really okay

74
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:37,740
sort of self-flagellating and judging yourself for the time you've been gone

75
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:44,220
celebrate that now you're awake you have a choice 50 50.

76
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:51,060
instead of beating yourself up choose to celebrate yes this moment of awareness again reconnecting

77
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:57,959
with awareness with the breath and the more we celebrate we Delight

78
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:04,740
in the moments that we come back the more they happen and be more ease will enjoy as the

79
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:10,200
practice becomes instead of feeling like a failure

80
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:17,540
everybody's mind drifts it's okay celebrate the coming back

81
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:31,200
reconnecting with the intention to be with Justice in breath in that breath

82
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,180

83
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:08,579

has been wandering we have a choice it's not a frightening

93
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,320
conclusion but a joyous conclusion that we have a choice

94
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:59,639
can either berate yourself for having been distracted or you can celebrate

95
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:04,920
the light that the mind is now awake and aware

96
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,680
how wonderful to have a choice foreign

97

[Music]

135
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:23,760
thanks everyone thanks for your practice foreign

136
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,760
today

137
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:36,900
um it brought in a quote at the beginning which really talks about

138
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:43,820
our choice how much choice we have in every moment and choice and by actually

139
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:52,159
turning your mind towards wise choices in the moment we seed them

140
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:59,100
to arise in in challenging moments so that the wise and kind Choice can arise

141
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:05,659
so in the practice I invited us to to be with to First relax

142
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:11,640
receive three three diaphragmatic breaths just arrive and then we did

143
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,740
um being with the breath being with the breath the intention to be with the

144
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:23,279
entirety of the in-breath entirety of the out breath and then after settling for a while we

145
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:30,240
opened the sphere of awareness to include everything and may I meet whatever arises not just distractions

146
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:37,500
with kindness and the breath with kindness but whatever arises and then we expanded it further may I meet all

147
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,659
beings all all the world with kindness so

148
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:48,419
um that's what we did that's basic rundown so so now

149
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:54,360
um the invitation is to meet ourselves and each other and with

150
00:29:54,360 --> 00:30:00,419
kindness in small groups this is where the rubber meets the road it's lovely to

151
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:06,000
practice with our eyes closed and it's also lovely it's so insightful to meet

152
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,100
others again showing up with kindness with with patience for ourselves

153
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,380
speaking from our own experience only using I statements not commenting

154
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:22,260
comparing asking questions from others just showing up this is what I noticed

155
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:27,840
or we can also show up with silence perfectly fine not to speak just be kind

156
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:34,320
and share your compassionate presence with others and

157
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:42,240
the prompt for today is um with this practice did you notice a moment of choice did you throughout the

158
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:50,700
almost 30 minutes we practice together did you moment did you notice any moments of choice did you and by

159
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:56,220
actually saying them out loud letting yourself be held witness it can um

160
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:01,500
it's empowering to say yes I did notice I had a choice actually and I leaned

161
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:07,080
into actually in this moment I leaned into berating myself and then the next one I didn't or whatever it might be

162
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:13,919
um no right or wrong answers or you might say I was distracted the whole time didn't notice at all perfectly fine

163
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,200
nobody's judging you please don't judge yourself just showing up and sharing our

sweet to me and maybe uh in an interesting way just sort of a

179

celebration of myself and all of the work I've done

180
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:15,659
uh just sort of diving into challenges and not resisting reality and

181
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:23,100
I've been through um three and a half years of um there's more people in my family dying

182
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:29,820
where I was always the person uh that had to clean up the mess and I kept just

183
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:36,779
diving in and and um just being sweet to myself because

184
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:43,799

191
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:33,540
um celebrating your own generosity for yourself and your generosity for others

192
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:41,339
what you describe this sounds to me as as deep practice of

193
00:34:41,339 --> 00:34:46,919
generosity to others to step in

194
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:53,820
in when it's really hard as you said clean up the mess and when someone passes it just could be so much right

195
00:34:53,820 --> 00:35:01,080
emotionally and and stuff and family and friends for you to

196
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:07,080
be stepping into the fire is such an act of generosity over and over and over

197
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:13,020
again and and and and and now allowing that generosity also to be shared with

198
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:19,920
Nancy Nancy dear you've been generous yes this is so beautiful it just makes my

199
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:27,839

201
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:44,240
I'm so glad I came to tonight as well and I see not just you I'm so glad I came as well this made my day

202
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:57,260
not their reflections Amy I see your hand

203
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:04,859
uh so in the practice um when my mind would wander

204
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:13,200
um I would bring it back I would choose to bring it back and I was laughing with the group because recently I've been using the song Baby Come Back as a

205
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,240
anchor to bring me back to the breath because it seems so sweet and it's also

206
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:24,240
playful and light and it takes away the Judgment from it um and so that's one way I feel like

207
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,579
I've been skillful to like choose the response and then another is I'm seeing

208
00:36:29,579 --> 00:36:35,820
somebody who I feel like some can be a little negative sometimes and every time I feel like the critical part of

209
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:41,220
something coming out I just send him meta and like the situation meta and so

210
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:47,940
it's become a prompt of choice or I'm not I feel empathy but then I don't get lost in the critical I just said my time

211
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:54,839
wanting healing and stuff like that and that feels like a really healthy choice a more supportive generous Choice thank

212
00:36:54,839 --> 00:37:00,780
you oh beautiful thanks for sharing both of those Amy I love the the um the using

213
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:07,260
the song Baby Come Back because it is it is light-hearted right you're calling your mind baby like hey come back it's

214
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:12,720
just kind of sweet and playful and fun yay sort of Yankee gets back oh you are

215
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,720

216
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,420
sending the situation this entanglement sending the situation meta all all those

217
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:30,660

and uh uh

224
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:16,500
and I was able to just go get back to her with a positive message

225
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,720
you know and it was like a reflexive it was like

226
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:29,300
it was really wonderful that I was just able to not even think about it

227
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:35,099
that I could just get back to her with something loving

228
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:41,579

00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:03,540
your practice through your practice of meta and and you know you regularly come to happy hour so so as a regular happy

232
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:09,839
hour practitioner that this kindness this kindness has become love has become

233
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:17,700
a reflexive response oh my Heavens so powerful it gives me chills when that

234
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:23,220
when our community here does report these success moments of oh this was

235
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:30,780
really hard today just you know daggers came at me and then kindness naturally arose it's you know

236
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:35,820
it reminds me of there is a there is a story of of the

237
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:41,040
Buddha um at the night of his Enlightenment that Mara sent was was

238
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:47,880
throwing uh arrows throwing arrows and as the arrows came to

239
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:56,220
came near him they became flowers flower petals and they fell so that is really

240
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:02,940
and you know when people send you daggers through the power of of radiating meta kindness that reflexive

241
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:08,099
kindness it changes it shift to situation so and you're reporting that
