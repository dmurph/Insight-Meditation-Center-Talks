1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:03,860
so hello again

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,480
for some of us it's a morning for some

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,919
events it's evening

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,720
wherever we are in the world welcome

5
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,700
uh wonderful to be together

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,240
so continuing this discussion of

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,460
the five presets

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,019
keeping us safely on the path

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,640
our third day

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,140
and

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,840
so this morning I would like to I would

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,000
like to talk about the third lay precept

13
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:42,180
for the sake of our training together I

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:44,940
undertake the precept to abstain from

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,940
sexual misconduct

16
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:52,620
and to discuss that in in terms of a a

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,800
teaching that I often hear at IMC about

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,420
ethical sensitivity

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,739
ethical sensitivity

20
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:04,739
foreign

21
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,500
maybe for 1500 years or more

22
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,840
it's been very common very traditional

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,040
and

24
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,900
the teravatan Buddhist tradition and

25
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,479
other Buddhist Traditions to organize

26
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:24,240
the teachings into three trainings

27
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,100
and ordering them

28
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:29,820
as if first we develop Sila ethics

29
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,720
virtue precepts restraint

30
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,040
and then samadhi a second training

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,900
the training of the mind and heart and

32
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,020
collectiveness and concentration

33
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,780
and the third training of panya wisdom

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,438
discernment

35
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:51,180
very common to hear them hear them

36
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:53,159
developed in this order and what's

37
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:55,860
interesting is we as we watch the

38
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,240
development of

39
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,939
the Buddha Dharma

40
00:01:58,939 --> 00:02:01,799
in the United States certainly

41
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:04,680
many many many practitioners first

42
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,820
encounter

43
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,920
meditation

44
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,619
the first encounter the practices of

45
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:12,180
samadhi and maybe

46
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,900
of wisdom and discernment before

47
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,099
um

48
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,800
finding their way into Sila and one of

49
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,860
the ways this often happens by seed

50
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,860
is that through our mindfulness practice

51
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,780
to become more and more attuned to

52
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,060
what's happening right here what's

53
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,400
happening right here in the body

54
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,060
what's happening in terms of

55
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,560
emotion that's happening in terms of

56
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,080
thinking and all the more attentive to

57
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,120
our action and how we're influenced by

58
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,720
all of these

59
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,060
becoming more attuned to this it's quite

60
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,879
a natural movement very often to start

61
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,400
to develop what we're calling ethical

62
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,299
sensitivity

63
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,140
so in terms of the third precept

64
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,180
to abstain from sexual misconduct

65
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,200
the it's noteworthy that the Buddha did

66
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,680
a lot of his teaching to monastics

67
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,159
and that the monastic rules very clearly

68
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,560
State about their practice

69
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,340
from an Aztecs was celibacy it took this

70
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,060
very seriously

71
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,980
part of what this means for us probably

72
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,560
most all of us as lay practitioners is

73
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,300
that we have to

74
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,760
we have the task

75
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,980
if we want to live according to a

76
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:40,500
Buddhist interpretation of wise

77
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,840
sexuality or to abstain from sexual

78
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,180
misconduct it takes some interpretation

79
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,379
on our part

80
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:49,500
how to apply this in our lives

81
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,099
foreign

82
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,159
my inclination is is to

83
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,659
um

84
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,360
is to explore or to begin looking at a

85
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,060
wise sexuality through

86
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,900
um

87
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,340
through the principles we've been

88
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,159
looking at so far in the precepts

89
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,840
if you think back foot to the first day

90
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,480
and we have this teaching of the Buddha

91
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,540
teaching venerable rahula to discern or

92
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,359
reflect before during and after an

93
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,740
action

94
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,960
is this actually going to do harm is it

95
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,520
not going to do harm

96
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,100
is this action skillful

97
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,139
is it not skillful

98
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:33,600
and to apply those understandings apply

99
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,919
those principles to this very very

100
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:39,780
multifaceted sometimes quite complicated

101
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,160
world

102
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:45,620
of our romantic life our sexual life

103
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,660
with the understanding that

104
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,759
um

105
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,220
mindfulness practice is fit for every

106
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:55,820
area of Our Lives

107
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,440
and

108
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,780
maybe to State it most Softly

109
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,360
it sure can't hurt

110
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,460
to bring our mindfulness

111
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,979
into into this into this realm of our

112
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:09,120
life

113
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,020
sexuality

114
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,020
so I think it goes without saying many

115
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,960
of us are aware of all the many ways

116
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,120
that we get caught

117
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,699
in our sexuality and caught up caused

118
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,380
suffering for ourselves cause suffering

119
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:27,360
and stress for others

120
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,759
so I think we do well to examine am I

121
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,039
harming am I not am I skillful am I not

122
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,560
of the one of the close

123
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,940
principles to examine when we're looking

124
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,740
at our own sexuality

125
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,100
I think many of us can relate to is uh

126
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,020
the difference or the distinction the

127
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,139
discernment between

128
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:58,139
short-term pleasure

129
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,440
and our long-term happiness

130
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,600
part of what's so fascinating about the

131
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,759
influence of sexuality is the way that

132
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,210
it can stir up

133
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,600
[Music]

134
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,699
the the roots of uh delusion or kind of

135
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,020
blindness

136
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,840
or the passions can get can get so

137
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,820
activated

138
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,340
as to influence us to operate out of

139
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,120
greed or operate out of even ill will

140
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,280
so we see how sexuality can be very

141
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,740
closely tied to these three

142
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,080
delusion

143
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,960
greed ill will

144
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,720
and these in turn can grow into other

145
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,819
unwholesome conduct

146
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:44,840
harmful conduct

147
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:50,819
it may sound a little

148
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,979
a little I don't know how you'll receive

149
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,259
this idea

150
00:06:55,259 --> 00:06:56,039
um

151
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:57,900
but I

152
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,539
oh here we'll do it this way

153
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:04,340
can imagine imagine yourself

154
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,520
floating along in a river

155
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,620
in a river stream

156
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,720
floating along on your back just flowing

157
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,860
along

158
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,259
comfortable temperature of the water

159
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:18,419
carried along

160
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:20,400
and so long as you're floating

161
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,380
you don't notice

162
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,360
just how strong the flow of the river is

163
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,280
how strong the pull of the tide is

164
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,940
and then you decide as you're floating

165
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,620
there oh I'm gonna I'm gonna stand up

166
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:34,440
I'm gonna put my feet on the riverbed

167
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,900
and so you do you put your feet on the

168
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,280
riverbed and you decide oh I'm going to

169
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,259
be I'm going to stand still

170
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,199
here in the middle of the Stream

171
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,180
and when you plant your feet

172
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,199
only then do you see feel sense to the

173
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,120
utter power

174
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,280
of this River the outer power of this

175
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,380
stream the pushing the pushing of the

176
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,259
water and how much force it takes

177
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:01,020
to not be

178
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:04,759
um push Downstream

179
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,680
I think this can very closely be related

180
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,660
to the influence of sexuality on our

181
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,860
lives

182
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,979
or the the pulled toward how sexuality

183
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,080
can influence us

184
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,300
it's just amazing

185
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,960
that as uh as we float along in the

186
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,479
currents of say

187
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,280
um sexual impulse

188
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:30,300
or sexual behavior or romantic life if

189
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,880
we do it in an unreflective way

190
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,159
we can just be swept along

191
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,200
totally swept along

192
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
and not notice how powerful its

193
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,459
influence is

194
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:44,580
but if we if we take up a practice we

195
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,800
may plant our feet and finally see wow

196
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,899
look at look at all this look at all

197
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,019
this force and influence in power

198
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:54,000
that these impulses have on my heart and

199
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
my mind my activity

200
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,800
and one of the ways that we do this or

201
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,300
one of the traditional ways we do this

202
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:03,660
you might see it on retreat

203
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,180
say for a seven day retreat

204
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,279
we take up a practice for that set

205
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,480
period

206
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,620
to observe deliberate refraining from

207
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,899
any sexual expression at all

208
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:18,240
let me take a take a

209
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,519
we take up the practice for those seven

210
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,600
days

211
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,519
to take up celibacy

212
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,580
and to not ex not express

213
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:29,880
and sexuality it's not an evaluation of

214
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,580
sexual impulse or sexual behavior as

215
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,940
wrong or bad or somehow misguided

216
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,880
I think we can see in a Time such as

217
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,200
that

218
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,540
when you've made a decision a strong

219
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,720
resolve okay I won't be

220
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,480
taken away Swept Away

221
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,140
by sexuality for these seven days then

222
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:54,360
you can really see the currents then you

223
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,540
can really feel the pull on your life

224
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:59,660
and see it all the more clearly

225
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,399
and then as we see through mindfulness

226
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,260
practice

227
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,839
as we see more clearly

228
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,060
we have more opportunity to

229
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,640
decide to live in a wholesome

230
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,640
skillful

231
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,839
non-harming way

232
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,120
for our long-term benefit

233
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,640
for the long-term benefit of others for

234
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,160
the long-term benefit of the whole world

235
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,399
I think those are my Reflections on this

236
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,839
third precept

237
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,380
for the morning my sense now is why

238
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,180
don't we continue with our practice and

239
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:45,680
recite the five presets

240
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,500
uh and then we can even see what

241
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,600
Reflections or questions are coming up

242
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,420
in the in the YouTube chat so let me

243
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,220
share this and then we can chant

244
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,399
together

245
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,440
there we go

246
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,959
foreign

247
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,180
