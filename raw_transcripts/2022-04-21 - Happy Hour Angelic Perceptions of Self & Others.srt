1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:07,440
so hello hello and welcome dear sangha lovely to

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,120
be with you in if not in space but in time if not in

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,039
time if you're listening to this later um lovely to practice together however

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,920
it may be so so for the theme for uh tonight's happy

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,679
hour um [Music] i'd like to invite us to explore a

6
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,040
particular perspective um a perception

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,960
the way we see ourselves the way we see others and

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:51,520
to shift it a little bit to shift it um and then that shift from this shift

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,600
which i will name in a moment setting it up from this shift

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,239
and perception per perspective then from that then a sense of

11
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,360
meta kindness can feel different or a sense of compassion can feel different

12
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,360
from this shifted perspective so the shifted perspective that i'd like

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,758
to invite us to explore and i will guide us in the guided meditation

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,040
is this as opposed to how we often perhaps see

15
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:34,880
ourselves or see others perhaps we see ourselves as

16
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,040
or we lean into the way our minds perhaps focus on the negative

17
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,110
and what's challenging on the stukka and the suffering

18
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:55,520
[Music] so we have this narrative we have this narrative which is perfectly fine you

19
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,920
were human beings this is how we evolutionary we've come to be we have this narrative self-narrative and we

20
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,040
often in our self-narrative we see

21
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,879
you know narrating what we want to do and oh maybe this thing didn't get done

22
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,239
or what we did we go over it over and over again and maybe things that didn't

23
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,319
go well go well so there's often stickiness with

24
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,599
what's unpleasant what has been difficult and satisfying

25
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,120
um or maybe what i would call

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,440
our brokenness like oh yes our brokenness we often lean into that again

27
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,480
evolutionary er evolutionarily those uh ancestors who um

28
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,000
uh leaned into the pleasant they didn't live long enough to pass on their genes

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,879
but the ones who actually were more afraid um those were who had those were

30
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:07,120
the ones who lived long enough to pass on their genes so again evolutionary it all makes sense and yet in terms of our

31
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,519
personal experience we tend to see ourselves as these human beings that

32
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,280
are fallible and not perfect and we're working towards

33
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,360
goodness and we often forget our beauty our goodness

34
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,280
now balancing that perspective would i like to invite us to lean into tonight

35
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,319
to feel into is to see

36
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:44,799
our magnificence the inner goodness the

37
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:52,879
the brilliance not intelligence or smarts but just this brightness this brightness as if

38
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,640
as if we were an angel as if we were an angel

39
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,400
you can use the word or the concept angel if you like that or you can use as if we

40
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,879
were a buddha within there's the buddha within us you can use that language i want to be flexible with the language

41
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:18,000
and see what works for you or maybe there's a kuan yin within see what works for you

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,720
but maybe for this i use the word angel because there's something bright about again not making

43
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,000
any assertions about nature of reality but but this angelic

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,240
qualities of the inner angelic qualities of of goodness of service of brightness

45
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:45,040
of an open loving heart what if we saw ourself as an angel as

46
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,759
this angel who means who means well means to serve to love to

47
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,840
protect to be kind to guide what if we leaned into that vision how

48
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:03,840
would we see ourselves how would we behave how would we hold

49
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:12,400
ourselves our intentions our mistakes our aspirations our work our daily life our

50
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,919
interactions with others when we wake up in the morning okay i'm doing angels jobs okay this is my

51
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,759
work today this is as an angel this is what i do and then how would we see others in the

52
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,600
world other angels that they're here to serve to be kind to

53
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,039
to love to protect how would our relationship shift to our

54
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:44,320
minds to our hearts how would we show up it might be a corrective

55
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:52,320
this might be needed be a sorely needed corrective

56
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,680
compared to how we often go about [Music]

57
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:05,360
our days and our perspective the way we perceive ourselves so [Laughter]

58
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,120
that's cute oh on youtube pat says an entry level angel maybe that's fine

59
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:18,960
entry level is fine just whatever works [Laughter]

60
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,800
so dear angels let's let's practice together and and take on

61
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,840
these different perspectives and see how they might shift and guide our practice

62
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,160
of of love and kindness compassion etc from this perspective

63
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,280
hey perspectives are a dime a dozen we can choose our perspectives right let's

64
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,800
try this on and see what might shift maybe some habitual patterns of

65
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,560
self-judgment maybe they get loosened a little bit maybe we give ourselves a break

66
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,080
maybe love maybe we love ourselves and others a little more easily let's let's

67
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,000
try this on for size so so i'd like to invite you to sit

68
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,680
comfortably whether sitting or lying down

69
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,360
in a position where you can be for the next 30 minutes

70
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,319
with ease

71
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,639
allowing allowing the back to have a sense of integrity

72
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,960
to be straight but not over efforting as if it's being

73
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,360
pulled up there is a magnet on top of your head pulling up

74
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:58,240
your back vertebrae by vertebrae ah neck shoulders

75
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,400
they can relax they can completely relax

76
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:12,720
letting your feet your sit bones

77
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,000
letting them be connected to the earth

78
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:27,039
releasing releasing

79
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:33,120
the weight your earthly weight

80
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,079
your angelic weight onto this earth

81
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:53,680
as always we start by just grounding in the body grounding

82
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,399
in the body

83
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:11,680
each and every breath breathing in or rather being breathed and

84
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,040
let it be natural let it be received

85
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,560
the in-breath receive the out-breath released

86
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,080
as thoughts arise not a problem they will arise

87
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,720
it's okay

88
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,720
for the sake of this training together

89
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:15,680
smilingly smilingly tell them thank you thank you and not now

90
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:22,560
please come back later no need for self-judgment

91
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:31,240
let there be kindness let there be ease in your body in your heart

92
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,760
with yourself with the thoughts that arise

93
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,399
they're not adversaries just untimely right now

94
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:50,959
it's okay later later thank you

95
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,519
letting the breath in the body and the abdomen

96
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,839
let it be center stage

97
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,800
and breath readily received in the abdomen

98
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:30,560
not in the control tower of the head as if the body is an organ of perception

99
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,680
received received soothing calming the out breath

100
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:45,040
released ah landing

101
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,240

102
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,839

103
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,279
just simply here

104
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,199
let it be enjoyed let it be delicious

105
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,959
this moment of just sitting being breathed

106
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,560
let it be nourishing to your heart

107
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,880
gladdening your heart mind

108
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:14,240
now i'd like to invite you while we stay embodied

109
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,160
feeling the body the breath the body relaxed

110
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,920
to bring to your heart maybe a kind act

111
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,360
you offer to someone

112
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:44,319
the way you helped them supported them maybe a phone call with a friend

113
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,058
a patient ear [Music]

114
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,480
a gift

115
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:05,000
a donation to a cause you care about some act of kindness generosity patience

116
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:15,680
bring it to your heart your heart mind

117
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:24,399
and let it gladden let yourself relish the goodness

118
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,880
how it perhaps affected the other being or beings

119
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,279
and how it brings gladness to your heart

120
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,680
this release this generosity is giving away

121
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,839
letting yourself relax into feeling

122
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:14,640
this goodness it is wholesome to relish goodness

123
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:24,280
it expands our heart and more goodness more kindness more generosity

124
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:44,400
and let yourself for this moment can later go back to the other perception or the usual

125
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:52,080
perceptions but in this moment let it expand seeing yourself as kind

126
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:59,840
as generous these qualities let them be felt in your

127
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:06,960
brightly a slice out of time

128
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,320
seeing yourself as an angel

129
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,200
generous kind patient

130
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,840
the angelic qualities of service and care

131
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:53,039
and if your thoughts get in the way oh no i'm selfish and

132
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:58,400
not so good nothing angelic about me wait wait wait a minute

133
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:05,840
don't believe don't believe those thoughts don't believe

134
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:12,559
the self-judging thoughts let them go they're just thoughts don't have to

135
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,120
believe them

136
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:25,840
don't get in your own way don't let these thoughts get in your own way experiment

137
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:36,639
an angel serving helping supporting

138
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:45,600
other angels but first leaning into your own

139
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,240
in angelic job duty

140
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,240
nature

141
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:13,039
and to know that your growth as an angel

142
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,960
your freedom is not independent

143
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,840
of others

144
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,880
it's bound with others so you're giving your generosities not

145
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:37,120
just to help them is to free your own heart

146
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:45,799
is to bring more wings to give your wings more lift

147
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:57,080
is to uplift you as much as it is to uplift others

148
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,600
let yourself see yourself as kind

149
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:31,520
as generous in acts of service

150
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:38,000
not self-centered let yourself see yourself in this way

151
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,799
again we can always go back to the other way later the end of the hour but right now

152
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:52,159
experiment see what might open up in your heart and your mind

153
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,799
maybe there can be more freedom not being attached to fixed views of

154
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,840
yourself and others

155
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,039
play around with this image

156
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,799
of yourself

157
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:34,880
and maybe your daily tasks your work your cleaning [Music]

158
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:40,799
your dishwashing whatever it is you do [Music] it becomes angel's

159
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,480
work angel's job

160
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:59,679
your work isn't just a profession or a way to earn a livelihood but a way to serve

161
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,158
to grow to earn your wings

162
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,840
gives it more meaning and dimensionality

163
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:18,200
this angel doing angels work

164
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:23,440
angels like humans are impermanent have limited time to love to serve to

165
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,679
give to do this

166
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,559
angel's work

167
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:40,829
in this realm [Music]

168
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,840
on this earth

169
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,120
and this earth which is sacred

170
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,278
the only planet we have

171
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,960
to live on to love to grow

172
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,278
on

173
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,559
and seeing others seeing others as angels

174
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:48,400
their goodness their beauty their kindness

175
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:54,840
their freedom is bound up with yours

176
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:07,080
their angel wings their angel rank is bound up with yours

177
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:41,279
letting yourself receive graciously so others other angels can give and be

178
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,760
kind

179
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:52,440
earn their wings just as you

180
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,000
seeing your own goodness

181
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,919
goodness that is more magnificent

182
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,840
brighter than you can ever imagine give yourself credit for it

183
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,320
let it be expressed

184
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:35,120
notice from this perspective as we play around with perceptions

185
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,600
it becomes easier or if it shifts

186
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,799
how accessible kindness meta warmth is

187
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:56,919
for yourself appreciating your own goodness

188
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,559
does compassion become more accessible for this being

189
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:32,080
who is me who's yourself the ways that

190
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,679
you suffer things that are hard for you this angel

191
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,480
that's who's trying their best

192
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:52,799
and things can be hard in this body and this mind sometimes it's okay

193
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,840
it's okay dear

194
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:31,360
does it shift of this perspective how does it shift how does it change

195
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,240
kindness meta for others

196
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,840
if you see them as angels

197
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,200
see their goodness

198
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,159
their acts of service their kindness

199
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:03,120
but you can stay with this perspective or perception or you can release

200
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,279
and see what is here how the residue might have

201
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:18,519
shifted some things open things up for you perhaps in unexpected ways

202
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:07,240
can you accept the grace that is to be human

203
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,358
the grace

204
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,320
of living

205
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,919
having joy sorrows

206
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,240
being kind serving helping

207
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,720
or acting in ways that are far from your angelic nature

208
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:12,040
and learning from them returning learning growing

209
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:32,960
it's enough to be human it's actually quite profound to be human

210
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,480
how awesome

211
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,599
how amazing

212
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,920
may our practice may the wholesomeness the goodness of

213
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,960
our practice or cultivation

214
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,440
serve this angel this human who is me who is us

215
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:37,200
as well as all other angels other humans

216
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,040
and freedom in waking up

217
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:53,960
may all beings be free

218
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,280
hello angels welcome back

219
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,320
so we have some time for reflections

220
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:36,400
christine says every time a bell rings an angel gets its wings

221
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:43,359
it's great i'm gonna ring the bell a lot then so uh claire i see your hand is raised

222
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:49,520
please mine's all so short but all your references to angels made me immediately

223
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:57,760
think i do practice christianity and there's a hymn i love music and there's a hymn that i've always adored the main

224
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:04,560
i'm not going to sing this you wouldn't want to hear it but um the main lyric is this little light of mine like i'm gonna

225
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,680
let it shine and it's so sweet and but very much in the spirit of what you're

226
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,280
talking about yeah yeah yeah lovely exactly thank you for that

227
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,599

228
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:28,720
exactly this little light of mine or this big light of mine yeah thank you claire

229
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:33,760
bill says i found the angel idea hard to accept but then i thought assume

230
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:41,200
if richo if you have it or not after that it was easier beautiful assume a virtue

231
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:48,960
if you have it or not lovely that's lovely yeah beautiful

232
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,640
aaron says on youtube well as manifestations of the cosmos we

233
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:00,720
are sort of angels of love serve others yep

234
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:07,760
absolutely indeed indeed able to serve others in many ways exactly that's

235
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,040
absolutely right that's the spirit of of this practice and and the invitation

236
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:18,640
for us to see ourselves a little differently really see see ourselves in this

237
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,119
um service

238
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,119
oriented way yeah yeah oh cute

239
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,880
merry christine says oh um buddy's ears are my wings i love it i

241
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:46,320
yeah any other reflections in the other something that might have

242
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:52,800
come up for you did this open up this different perspective seeing yourself as an angel and others

243
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,839
did it shift something are open in your work in your meta and

244
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:03,760
your compassion for yourself for others any any aha moments

245
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,319
or questions or complaints everything is welcome

246
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:30,079
claire i see your hand but you've already spoken so i'm going to let other people speak

247
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:40,640
catherine please um

248
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:47,200
yeah it's so interesting since i was not raised like believing in angels but um

249
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:51,800
there's something about an embodied

250
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:57,359
cosmic experience that is

251
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:05,359
just feels really good like to to feel myself as like my body made of light and then

252
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:11,359
wings which just when i imagine i feel that in my body i my

253
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:19,440
chest opens and i feel this like you know my neck and shoulders are often so tight and sort of just like it's just

254
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,880
a gift to imagine and and not imagine but in my body

255
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:31,200
um that blessing so thank you that's lovely thank you so much for that

256
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:38,400
exactly it's just again my my intention and hope just as you said wasn't to appeal to any

257
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:45,680
religious views but just this different you know as humans we have this idea of angels these angelic great beings right

258
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:50,800
kind kind so it's just this yeah this physicality that you

259
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:58,240
you expressed and experienced just a different way of oh just uplifted shifted like feeling different

260
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,640
how how does that shift yeah beautiful thanks so much for sharing that i love that lovely

261
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:10,319
dave says thank you for this practice it really spoke to me i was washing windows yesterday and

262
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:16,240
thinking that i want people to know that i love washing windows so that they might feel

263
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:22,319
that love as they look through them oh that's lovely that is so beautiful

264
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:29,839
that is so beautiful yeah the sense of practice the service the service aspect

265
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:34,720
yeah yeah

266
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:39,920
so

267
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:50,720
yeah oh i hope you feel better dave yeah so how about we turn into our practice

268
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,319
um in small groups with other angels tonight just uh

269
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:02,800
um [Music] the rubber

270
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:09,200
meeting the road and just can we show up is just for a moment again we can go back

271
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,359
to our humanness just a sense of this goodness this beauty this expansiveness

272
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:21,920
and beat others in this small group for just few minutes six seven minutes or so

273
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,440
um and actually i think it'll be i've said it for seven or eight um

274
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:33,760
and and also see the goodness in others see the goodness in others hold them see them as angels see

275
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:40,880
how that perception might actually make how we serve how we relate different

276
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:47,040
so groups will be a size of three roughly and the invitation is to

277
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,480
speak from your own experience and

278
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:58,640
just one nugget just a minute and then next person will say a nugget or anyone

279
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,880
can say pass you can just hold silent space if you wish for others for other

280
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:11,839
angels to see what it's like to to engage engage in the space

281
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:17,440
of kindness together in this way so

282
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:22,960
um i'm going to create the breakout rooms and

283
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,160
again only speaking from your own experience not managing not

284
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:35,200
commenting um just staying close staying close to your own

285
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:41,839
experience so i'm about to open the rooms and take

286
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:48,960
care of yourself take care of each other in the rooms here we go

287
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:56,319
okay welcome back everyone the rooms are closed and we have a few minutes left for

288
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:04,319
any reflections and a couple of other reflections i wanted to share actually while you raise your hand um lisa on

289
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:11,680
youtube shared that in thinking of others as angels it broke down some black and white thinking

290
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:19,680
like their angelic qualities may exist do exist alongside the not as angelic

291
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:26,079
quality simultaneously not just at different times yes that makes sense thank you lisa

292
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:33,599
that's beautiful i love that thinking of others is angelic it breaks down the black and white quality

293
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:39,920
and syria was talking about how her body felt stress and discomfort at some point and

294
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:46,560
the idea of being angels was appealing but discomfort got in the way it's okay discomfort doesn't have to get in the

295
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:52,960
way it could be an angel that's having body aches it's not a problem so

296
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,000
can can it be can it be included can it be included

297
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,200
any other reflections maybe something that came up in the group if you haven't spoken for a while

298
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:10,640
i'd love to hear from you you can also type in chat um neil [Music]

299
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:18,400
so first of all i thought this was a lovely meditation um

300
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:23,599
so one thing that came up for me was right i thought of someone who i'm

301
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:30,960
having difficulty with at work um and gee it like this like didn't work for that right and

302
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:37,280
i i mean that was not the point of this meditation so i dumped him and just moved on right it wasn't like he like

303
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:44,240
tainted the whole meditation but someone else in my group mentioned talking about a situation that you know that they had

304
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,599
found you know an interaction with people they had found difficult so

305
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:57,440
yeah so i guess you know what do you do when you run into those when you're doing a meditation like this and you run into those sticky situations

306
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,359
yeah yeah good question um so so

307
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:09,680
sticky situation i mean there's a reason why these sticky situations come up right the mind is still

308
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:16,400
around you know grappling with just finding a way to find peace with this sticky

309
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:22,880
situation so so the invitation for example tonight would be is it possible and and you said in the case that you

310
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,240
tried it was impossible to see them as angelic but maybe what i

311
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:34,240
would do is maybe i would persist and i would try to see something kind they have done

312
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:41,440
in the past or they're doing not this sticky situation that kind of has is upsetting right now but maybe they've

313
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,559
been kind in the past maybe at work maybe there's something you did i don't know they gave you a compliment just

314
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:51,839
something kind or maybe to others maybe they've they're maybe they're on time

315
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:59,920
maybe that's one of their gifts one of the ways they serve like find something kind something good goodness about them

316
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:05,280
or maybe like they have family they love their family oh can you see them as an

317
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:10,480
angel loving their child or loving their elderly parent or something loving their

318
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,599
pet like maybe find a way in
