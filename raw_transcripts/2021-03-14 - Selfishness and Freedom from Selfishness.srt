2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,000

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,000

13
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,559
one-year anniversary of

14
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,760
sheltering in place where our life has

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,800
changed dramatically

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,399
a year ago and different places of

17
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,000
course went into shelter at different

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,719
times but at least here in california

19
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,800
to a year ago it's been a big year and

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,559
i almost was going to give a talk today

21
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,840
about grief

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,280
and maybe i'll do that in a couple of

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,760
weeks but

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,520
i wasn't quite ready for that

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,720
and um and then next week i won't be

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,280
here

27
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,680
next week a wonderful teacher uh

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,200
amanda johnson is going to speak she is

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,600
um

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,439
she graduated a year and a half ago from

31
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,119
the teacher training

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,840
for at spirit rock so she's a local

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,200
dharma teacher

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,040
and and very happy to have her come

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,840
and and spend sunday morning with you

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,280
some

37
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,840
so imagine

38
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,880
that uh you're in a beautiful place in

39
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,119
nature that maybe some place you've been

40
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:03,840
and

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,680
found inspiring and maybe far away from

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,879
buildings and roads and a lot of people

43
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,000
and it's just an expanse of

44
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,920
a natural setting beautiful comfortable

45
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,480
safe inspiring place to be

46
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,200
and maybe it's so inspiring maybe you

47
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,120
visit regularly to appreciate

48
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,360
and feel the freedom of just roaming

49
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,879
around and

50
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,319
the trees and the skies and

51
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,640
the hills and the rivers and the lakes

52
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,879
whatever it might be just a vast space

53
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,360
that's

54
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,239
wonderful to be in

55
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,840
and so after visiting many times you

56
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,519
think this is special and you want to

57
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:48,640
kind of

58
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,040
mark the specialness of some some nice

59
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,840
way and

60
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,440
creative way and so uh

61
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,800
you bring a um with you into the

62
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,080
wilderness

63
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,239
a glass door with a frame it's a

64
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,560
bit of an effort to bring it in there

65
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,280
and you

66
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,760
install that door right in the middle of

67
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,840
the wilderness this glass door

68
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,040
swings open very nicely at its frame and

69
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,760
and there it is this door middle of the

70
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,560
wilderness

71
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,080
some people might think it's an art

72
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,640
installation

73
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,560
and but it's your door and uh

74
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,560
kind of marks that this space this place

75
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,080
is so special for you it's kind of like

76
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,720
marking it

77
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,000
as being special and and that

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,080
you know symbolically it's a door into a

79
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,360
different landscape

80
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,920
and different place and but now when you

81
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,560
go visit

82
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,680
in this big vast open space

83
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,879
there in the middle there's a door

84
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,840
and and you put happen to put it right

85
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,680
in the middle of a trail

86
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,519
so that when you go in the trail you

87
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,799
have to open the door and step through

88
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,239
and so the door is there and

89
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,519
you like this door and sometimes it gets

90
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:05,040
locked by mistake and you have to go

91
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,239
home and get the key to unlock it and

92
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,000
sometimes it gets rusty being in the

93
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,680
weather and you have to oil it so that

94
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,879
it can open and close

95
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,280
and some being a glass door sometimes it

96
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,479
gets dirty and you

97
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,120
have to clean it and you care for the

98
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,320
store

99
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,240
and after a while you think of this door

100
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,160
as your door

101
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,560
and and you want to protect your door

102
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,759
and so

103
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,800
you because the door represents this

104
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,199
openness to into this wilderness and

105
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,440
this freedom that's there

106
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,040
and so you decide that the thing to do

107
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,639
is to put a fence around the door to

108
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,320
really protect it so the moose doesn't

109
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,120
come along and knock it down and

110
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,680
and break the glass so you put the fence

111
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,240
around it

112
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,919
and you come out there and you feel my

113
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,000
door is protected and

114
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,440
after a while the um you start peeling

115
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,800
you look around say well

116
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,960
this incl this place where i enclosed

117
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,639
the feds it's not really big enough for

118
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,360
me it's

119
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,520
it's you know really you know i'd like

120
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,479
more space to

121
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,280
be able to come in and and just kind of

122
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,440
be spacious and open and

123
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,120
and so you expand the fence make it

124
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
bigger and bigger

125
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,400
and after a while you don't want to

126
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,320
really see the fence you make the fence

127
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,120
really big

128
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,280
and goes around the hills and outside of

129
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,039
you and

130
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,039
so you go inside you know just you and

131
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,080
the door and

132
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,120
the doors kind of maybe sometimes gets

133
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,280
branches fall on it and break it and you

134
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,960
fix it and

135
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,400
all kinds of things happen to the door

136
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,199
and um eventually you'd wonder about the

137
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,600
door

138
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,160
and then you remove the door

139
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,039
and then there's vast open space again

140
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,120
then you remove the fence

141
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,919
and it's just like it was before it's

142
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:52,320
still

143
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,440
beautiful beautiful location inspiring

144
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,840
and peaceful wonder wonder wonderful to

145
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,880
roam around in and then you think what

146
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,479
was i doing with the door

147
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,880
what was i doing with a fence

148
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,919
so this may be a little silly story

149
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,039
uh is um introduction to the topic today

150
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,160
which is uh the buddha's teachings

151
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,360
on selfishness

152
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,680
the earliest teachings of the buddha as

153
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,360
best we know

154
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,080
he did not teach anything about not-self

155
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,199
this

156
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,240
you know famous teachings of

157
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,919
of the buddha it wasn't his focus but

158
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:36,639
rather he

159
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,600
was focused on

160
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,759
talking about the problems and the

161
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,080
suffering around being selfish

162
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,759
and how a wise person let go selfishness

163
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,039
and as he developed his teaching he

164
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,919
described three different ways of being

165
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,880
selfish or self-focused or

166
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,800
self-preoccupied in some way

167
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,000
and one was through craving

168
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,440
one was through conceit and the other is

169
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,759
through

170
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,720
metaphysical opinions and views beliefs

171
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,680
that we hold onto

172
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,240
so the craving uh idea of selfishness

173
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,319
he associates with possessiveness

174
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,639
possessing things these are mine this is

175
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,319
mine

176
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,520
the conceit

177
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,560
is associated with the idea of i am

178
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,479
um you know that i am something

179
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,759
that i am this i am that so it's a role

180
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,840
identities that we take on and hold on

181
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,199
to and

182
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,120
and the third is um

183
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,639
this is myself that this is the true

184
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,280
self

185
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,199
now i know what the self is and this is

186
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,759
what the self is what my true self is my

187
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,360
essence is

188
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,520
and in pali these little expressions

189
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,039
appear a lot in asus it's

190
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,480
[Music]

191
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
and it's kind of close to what we say in

192
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,400
english of me myself and mine mind

193
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,360
he kind of says it in reverse this is

194
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,960
mine

195
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,800
this i am and this is myself

196
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,240
this is the self so

197
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,760
um and the reason to

198
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,080
notice this and pay attention to it it's

199
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,959
the domain

200
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,600
that the qualities of selfishness are

201
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,040
being caught up in

202
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,360
excessive excessive preoccupation with

203
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,480
oneself

204
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,279
a strong attachment clinging

205
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,560
self-centeredness

206
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,760
that can happen and

207
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,839
and this movement towards selfing and

208
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,080
getting holding on to self

209
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,720
is uh is limits our freedom

210
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,279
it does something which is not really

211
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,320
necessary

212
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,880
to cling to the self that is a

213
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,040
comparable to this idea if you will if

214
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,440
you

215
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,080
allow me of putting this door right in

216
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,000
the middle of the wilderness

217
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,600
the wilderness was beautiful and

218
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,040
wonderful by itself

219
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,720
and it was a wonderful place to visit

220
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,800
and peaceful and relaxing

221
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,279
and it was so much more less complicated

222
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,160
to be there

223
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,600
when you didn't have to take care of the

224
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,800
door and protect the door and

225
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,760
repair the door and build fences around

226
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,760
the door

227
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,959
and so the same thing the natural

228
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,160
kind of a natural state of being

229
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,760
that can be quite open and peaceful

230
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,000
and inspiring to experience for oneself

231
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,080
that it doesn't require placing

232
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,959
something in the middle this is mine

233
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:03,360
this

234
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,040
is who i am this is myself

235
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,279
that movement is kind of an extra

236
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,880
movement that

237
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,279
that places something in the natural

238
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,160
setting

239
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,800
which more often than not does not need

240
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,399
it especially if what we're doing is

241
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,519
clinging

242
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,040
and holding on to uh to these things

243
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,360
so conventionally we might say things

244
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,800
are mine

245
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,880
and and you know it's a lot we say

246
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,760
it's you know things are mine things are

247
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,800
legally mined

248
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,320
there's ownership there's things which

249
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,279
we allow each other to have

250
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,920
but but the selfishness around that

251
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,079
is when we cling to mind we hold on to

252
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,000
it for dear life like it has to be this

253
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,200
way

254
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,360
and this movement towards possessiveness

255
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,600
and claiming things as mine

256
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,880
this belongs to me is a recipe for

257
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
suffering

258
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,079
the uh one famous kind of uh

259
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,880
origin story in buddhism that um the

260
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,839
beginning of the

261
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,680
one of the beginnings of the downturn of

262
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,760
the of society

263
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,320
was private property and then people

264
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,800
started

265
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,040
uh

266
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,560
hoarding in their private property and

267
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,720
stealing and things got out of hand in

268
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,680
this mythic story

269
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,320
so the idea of it's mine and holding

270
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,000
holding it tight

271
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,320
not realizing that possession

272
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,839
possessions of all kinds

273
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,959
anything we can say is mine is fragile

274
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,600
it's temporary is uh there's no

275
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,399
guarantee that it's going to stay around

276
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,120
that um i read recently about a

277
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,800
meteorite or asteroid that kind of

278
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,560
landed in the driveway of someone in i

279
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,560
think in scotland i think it was

280
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,240
or somewhere and the rare rare

281
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,440
mineral that came in this asteroid

282
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,519
and um but there's no you know guarantee

283
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,079
that lighting's not going to strike us

284
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,399
or strike our things like our car or

285
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,360
bicycle

286
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,880
and asteroid's not going to fall and

287
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,720
something we own

288
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,320
and then we don't own it anymore it's

289
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,480
gone you know it just becomes a squash

290
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,760
piece of

291
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,959
burnt stuff and

292
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,360
the idea that it is me myself and that

293
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,639
it's mine

294
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,600
has disappeared

295
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,639
the um you know i've

296
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,000
recently i broke a

297
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,880
bowl ceramic bowl that my son had made

298
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,639
and beautiful bowl and i broke it in the

299
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,440
kitchen and

300
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,920
it was ours belonged to our family but

301
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,519
soon as it was broken

302
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,120
i didn't really think about think of it

303
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,800
anymore as mine or

304
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,160
i didn't think of it as belonging to my

305
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,079
family i

306
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,399
rather unser ceremoniously just kind of

307
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,079
put it in the trash and

308
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:01,279
off it went and um

309
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,279
the the um

310
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,920
um so mine

311
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,399
as i love the story that's suzuki roshi

312
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,079
i've told it many times of

313
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,440
suzuki roshi is um

314
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,120
there's a photograph of him actually

315
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,200
saying this that taken just as he was

316
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,320
saying it so it's kind of

317
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,560
more poignant he was photographing him

318
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,639
holding up his glasses like this

319
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,480
and he says these are not my glasses

320
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,360
but you know about my old tired eyes so

321
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,200
you let me use them

322
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,800
so that's a very different relationship

323
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,199
to my glasses

324
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,720
and so

325
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,639
certainly it's convenient to have things

326
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,040
that we use and know they're there and

327
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,639
they're reliably going to be there next

328
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,240
day when we find them and so we're

329
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,760
seeing their mind

330
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,240
but you might reflect a little bit about

331
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,000
how much extra

332
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
attachment there might be possesses in

333
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,399
this fear fear of safety

334
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,399
fear of not being safe attachment to

335
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,360
to status attachment to all kinds of

336
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,639
things that come

337
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,519
we say something is mine it gets more

338
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,279
kind of interesting when you look at

339
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,120
that we take as mine of traits of our

340
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,800
personality or

341
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,959
qualities of our physique and our body

342
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,240
and

343
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,279
ways that we are in the world opinions

344
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,120
my opinions and

345
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,120
and if we hold on to those and cling to

346
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,120
those and think they're unchanging

347
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,000
will suffer so they're suffering of

348
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,800
taking things

349
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,839
as mine and for the buddha it's very

350
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,519
explicit even taking this body as mine

351
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,360
is a recipe for more suffering and

352
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,760
and so you know isn't it natural and

353
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,240
normal take this body as mine

354
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,920
i think it's a natural normal

355
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,399
conventionally to take it as mine my

356
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,519
body

357
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,279
but uh but to do so with an open hand

358
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:03,600
not

359
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,240
clinging to it just lightly

360
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,519
provisionally

361
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,480
but as soon as you say my body that i

362
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,360
you know them

363
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,760
then i have to be in charge of it and it

364
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,040
can't change and

365
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,320
it has to always stay the same

366
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,079
maybe the second uh form of selfishness

367
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:27,279
is conceit and um this is um

368
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,959
the idea of over evaluating oneself it

369
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:31,839
has to do with

370
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,639
how we value ourselves in relationship

371
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,600
to other people

372
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,680
and the common way in english the word

373
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,759
conceit refers to

374
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,839
thinking that we're somehow have a

375
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,279
higher value than others

376
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,759
we are better than others in some ways

377
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,959
and

378
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,720
and so it's a form of comparative

379
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,000
thinking

380
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,600
and as soon as we get involved in

381
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,680
comparative thinking with other people

382
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,959
this is really a amazing uh source of

383
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:58,480
suffering

384
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,600
comparative thinking um uh you know

385
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,120
things are constantly shifting in the

386
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,120
social world and between us and our

387
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,320
abilities and

388
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,959
other people's abilities and so um you

389
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,040
know if we expect to always

390
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,360
have a higher evaluation other people

391
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,800
will meet someone else who's going to be

392
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,320
better if

393
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,079
you know i'm pretty good at basketball

394
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,320
for someone who you know compared to

395
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,759
the six-year-old next door but

396
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,000
not compared to most adult men at this

397
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,120
point

398
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,079
and so do i hold on to that do i have a

399
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,040
conceit around

400
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,920
i'm a good basketball player better than

401
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,000
everyone else

402
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,600
you know i'll probably just suffer

403
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,160
around that kind of idea

404
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,079
and so this comparative thinking

405
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,279
is an unnecessary glass door

406
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,000
in the wilderness in the natural setting

407
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,800
it uh

408
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,839
it mars the situation it limits it it

409
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,279
becomes something then that we need to

410
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,360
protect we put fences around it

411
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,759
we want more and more fences and control

412
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,720
for it

413
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,240
and now it actually is a form of

414
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,038
of limiting ourselves rather than

415
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,720
freeing ourselves

416
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,640
there's a wonderful cartoon from calvin

417
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,640
and hobbes

418
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,918
where calvin is in the snow building a

419
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,038
fort

420
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,438
and to make him feel safe in this fort

421
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,360
and he's building up the wall so it just

422
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,199
goes above his head

423
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,520
and he's making it really tight and

424
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,959
compact and

425
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,960
and he surrounds himself with all the

426
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,320
snow to make a good

427
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,120
safe fort for himself but it's uh

428
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,240
basically he's

429
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,360
made a round little cone around himself

430
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,520
and once it's all finished he's trapped

431
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,559
inside

432
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,960
and he says help help because he can't

433
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,440
get out anymore

434
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,640
so um so this idea of conceit

435
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,880
is uh can become a trap we've kind of

436
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,799
protected too much and we kind of can't

437
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,320
breathe even

438
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,600
me myself and mine the conceit of being

439
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,200
better than

440
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,600
and in the ancient buddhist language

441
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,280
buddhist teachings

442
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,840
a word which was closely related to

443
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,679
mano mana the word for conceit

444
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,200
is the word mada and the

445
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,720
means to be intoxicated totally confused

446
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
and wrapped up in things

447
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,679
and sometimes it's translated as pride

448
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,520
but the english word pride maybe has a

449
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,200
variety of different

450
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,039
meanings these days and sometimes

451
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,559
they're positive

452
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,559
but since the original meaning of in

453
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,360
talks of this word mada is

454
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,640
pride is intoxication

455
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,440
one translation of ancient abhidhamma

456
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,240
text

457
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,280
is um to list all kinds of things people

458
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,240
are intoxicated

459
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,720
intoxicated by so in intoxicated by

460
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,840
their birth by their caste basically

461
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,840
intoxicated by their clan

462
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,760
intoxicated by their health

463
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,679
by youth intoxicated with life

464
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,799
itself intoxicated with gain

465
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,760
and acquisitions intoxicated with honor

466
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,799
with being respected with fame

467
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,240
with having followers with wealth

468
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,679
with skin color with learning with

469
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,120
intelligence

470
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,160
with not being despised

471
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,280
accomplishments popularity

472
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,720
with being ethical with meditation

473
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,000
attainments

474
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,799
and the list goes on and on but each of

475
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:39,200
these

476
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,960
is seen as a kind of pride they kind of

477
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,240
conceit

478
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,559
and conceit that we get intoxicated by

479
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,360
or get

480
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,760
caught by and it's so much easier

481
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,000
to be in life in the world without

482
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,480
getting caught by these comparative

483
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,520
thinking

484
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,919
with others one form of comparative

485
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:00,640
thinking that

486
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,360
in the buddhist idea of conceit is also

487
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,960
the idea of thinking that we're less

488
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,240
than other people

489
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,080
that we have less value than others in

490
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,280
some way

491
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,960
and that's also conceit because it's

492
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,760
also an attachment to an idea of self

493
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,520
attachment to a comparative way of

494
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,039
thinking

495
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,760
and and the solution is not to figure

496
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,000
out a better way to compare

497
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,600
um and even the idea of comparing

498
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,600
ourselves as equals to others

499
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,760
and buddhism is considered to be partly

500
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,320
still playing the comparison game

501
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,880
but rather freedom is found by not

502
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,960
comparing

503
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,679
by allowing ourselves and others to be

504
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,120
just as they are

505
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,000
and much more and so removing the door

506
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,360
and the fences in the middle of the

507
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,039
wilderness and letting that

508
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,720
natural setting be itself the third kind

509
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,640
of conceit

510
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,240
is um the conceit of views

511
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,480
of philosophical opinions beliefs about

512
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,760
what is the true self the essential self

513
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,919
and the buddha said there's he he knew

514
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,039
of his time

515
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,159
no belief in an essential self a true

516
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,120
self

517
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,840
that doesn't bring suffering and i don't

518
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,760
haven't done the analysis myself to see

519
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,440
if that's really the case

520
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,919
but it's certainly a provocative idea

521
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,280
that

522
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,280
and certainly we can say that anytime we

523
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,600
crave or cling to something

524
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,919
we will suffer and so if we're clinging

525
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:24,720
and claiming

526
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,840
craving clinging or craving to a view an

527
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,880
idea

528
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,440
my true self is my soul my true self is

529
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,240
my

530
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,120
is my you know inner goodness my true

531
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,720
self is my

532
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,840
is my um you know whatever it might be

533
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,760
my consciousness um

534
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,039
is that going to give birth to suffering

535
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,120
does it bring suffering when we're not

536
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,880
in touch with that true self when it's

537
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,360
not

538
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,159
evident and present does it just remain

539
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,600
an idea

540
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,159
that we have and so the idea needs to be

541
00:21:58,159 --> 00:21:59,039
reinforced

542
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,159
needs to be reasserted in order to keep

543
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,960
staying in touch with it because

544
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,440
maybe it can't be really feel and felt

545
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,120
and experienced

546
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,039
or what about deep meditation when

547
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,360
whatever we feel or experience as

548
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,799
the essence of who we are falls away

549
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,360
then some people get really frightened

550
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,720
by this

551
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,840
um because the deep deep piece of

552
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,679
meditation where things just let go we

553
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:27,679
let go of all clinging

554
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,799
it's remarkable how wonderful that

555
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:33,280
that piece is i want remarkable how

556
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,880
liberating it can be

557
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,760
and how ordinary reference points for

558
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,520
anything we have as we experience as

559
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,880
myself

560
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,440
dissolve you know and then if but some

561
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,880
people get really frightened because

562
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,480
that's who they think they are

563
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,240
i am this and i have to be this

564
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:55,840
so so selfishness

565
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,360
and the antidote

566
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,159
to selfishness in buddhism is certainly

567
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,200
is to see

568
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,919
the suffering of it and sometimes it's

569
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,720
only by seeing how painful it is and how

570
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,600
fragile it is and how much energy goes

571
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,280
into being selfish

572
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,919
that uh people begin to loosen up and

573
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,280
let go

574
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,240
but the other um the other antidote

575
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,000
is happiness is uh

576
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,720
to experience deep abiding sense of

577
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,240
happiness well-being

578
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,280
contentment that doesn't require

579
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,480
being selfish and so to

580
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,760
that's one of the functions of

581
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,240
meditation practice is not only to

582
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,200
become calm

583
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,240
not only be mindful but to acquire a

584
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:44,960
sense of

585
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,600
deeper contentment satisfaction ease

586
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,320
to be able to breathe easily freely

587
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,960
without

588
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,200
any clinging to selfishness any kind of

589
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,000
idea of me

590
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,559
myself and mine at least to give

591
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:01,760
ourselves a radical break from it

592
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,080
so we don't come into meditation and

593
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,400
hold on to these ideas of me myself and

594
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,679
mine

595
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,919
often the the the source the fuel

596
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,080
for a lot of our preoccupied thinking is

597
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,080
me myself and mine

598
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,720
and to let go of that so we can

599
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,760
experience something really wonderful

600
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,200
and to value this wonderful beautiful

601
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
natural setting that we have

602
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,080
the natural capacity for ease and

603
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,200
freedom and peace and to learn how to

604
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,640
wander freely openly in our own hearts

605
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,919
and our own minds and our own life

606
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,559
without the glass door in the middle of

607
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:43,600
it all

608
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,039
without the fences all around it

609
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,240
so it's unobstructed by it all

610
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,760
where we don't need to advertise

611
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,400
ourselves or promote ourselves or

612
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,400
deficit explain to people who we are and

613
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,840
and assert ourselves on people

614
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,120
as a form of clinging

615
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,559
and a sense of well-being

616
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,240
and one of the benefits of discovering

617
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,159
such kind of well-being and peace

618
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,039
and ease and letting go of all this is

619
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:19,440
that

620
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,559
then it also might be easier to

621
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,480
to stand up for oneself

622
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,000
when society around you

623
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,279
defines you when society around you says

624
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,159
you can't be that how you how you are

625
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,919
you have to be different or you are

626
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,360
in this kind of way if we don't get

627
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,080
if we have our own stability inside and

628
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,440
peace inside

629
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,400
that we know and we're not wrapped up

630
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,480
around our identity issues

631
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,960
and then in the way that this clinging

632
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,960
is involves clinging

633
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,080
then it can be quite powerful to stand

634
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,679
up for ourselves

635
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,559
and say no to people not not go along

636
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,159
with what people are how people are

637
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,760
defining us

638
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,000
how other peoples me myself and mine

639
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,640
you yourself and and yours

640
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,760
is really oppressive for many people

641
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,039
and and so the idea of

642
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,320
really looking deeply at selfishness

643
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,360
and how it works with me myself and mine

644
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,559
is also a gift so that we don't

645
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,679
project you yourself

646
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,440
and yours onto others in ways that makes

647
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,559
makes them oppressed

648
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,679
imagine if we can live in a world where

649
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,480
we don't put any fences around anyone

650
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,720
we don't put any glass doors that block

651
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,279
anyone's path

652
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,440
where we allow the the people to be how

653
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,320
they are

654
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:01,440
we allow the natural world to unfold in

655
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,960
a beautiful way

656
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:07,200
without the limitations

657
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,240
and the problems of our clinging

658
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,679
especially the clinging to selfishness

659
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,640
may it be that this meditation practice

660
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,720
shows us the limitations

661
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,240
shows us the suffering of our

662
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,159
selfishness

663
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,360
so that we become

664
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,240
more open more free more generous more

665
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,799
kind

666
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,679
more forgiving

667
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,320
and more

668
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,640
in a certain kind of way natural the

669
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,080
kind of naturalness is there when

670
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,799
there's no clinging

671
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,880
so i hope that gives you something to

672
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,240
think about and to reflect on and

673
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,080
and hopefully you're forgiving of

674
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,679
yourself if you

675
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,000
happen to have some conceit or some me

676
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,240
myself in mind

677
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,919
but you might want to take a deeper look

678
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,480
at this this topic and make it a study

679
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,159
for the week and

680
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,600
and it's this is uh this

681
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,679
list that i read from the ancient texts

682
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,360
about intoxicated

683
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,080
toxicated when i saw this list i was

684
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,320
kind of delighted

685
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,960
that they being intoxicated preoccupied

686
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,240
caught up in

687
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,440
things like health and youth and

688
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,720
gain honor being respected fame

689
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,799
having followers our learning

690
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,880
accomplishments popularity all kinds of

691
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,320
things

692
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
it's been going on for thousands of

693
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,480
years

694
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,120
this is kind of what humans tend to do

695
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,600
especially when they come together

696
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,279
so if you have if you're involved in

697
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,039
some of it as well

698
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,640
you have a lot of company and you have

699
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,840
the company

700
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,720
of the buddha the freedom you have the

701
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,559
company of yourself perhaps in

702
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,000
meditation

703
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,760
where you're beginning to loosen up and

704
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,520
unstick yourselves

705
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,000
from all forms of selfishness

706
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:10,000
may you be may you let go of selfishness

707
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,679
and find out how to be really happy

708
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:22,559
in this life thank you
