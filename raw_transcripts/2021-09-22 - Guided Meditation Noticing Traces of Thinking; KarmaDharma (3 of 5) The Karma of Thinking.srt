1
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:26,560
hello everyone thank you for coming to this gathering

2
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,078
of our extended meditation community to spend

3
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:40,879
this time meditating exploring the dharma it's a fantastic thing in life to

4
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,559
explore the dharma or explore this the delightful i like the word

5
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:52,559
dharma but at delightful profound significant

6
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:59,520
ways in which our mind works and how we interact with the world and

7
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,000
and how um how the dharma works through us

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,200
in the sense that how does uh the goodness

9
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,960
that is part of our psychophysical system how it can work really well when we're

10
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,200
able to get out of the way properly and allow for something to move through us

11
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,479
so um today i'd like to offer suggest a

12
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,960
little bit more of an exercise than meditation still meditate as usual but

13
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,840
a little emphasis on this exercise that's part of it and that is

14
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:52,159
become be a little bit more attentive to when the mind wanders off in thought

15
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:59,040
so uh just notice it this is to say don't think intentionally but to uh

16
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,240
do your meditation but when your mind wanders off in thought really notice that

17
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,160
that's what's happening and then see if you can notice

18
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,920
the impact that your thinking has on you

19
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,040
what uh what influence does that thinking have on your body on your emotions

20
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,360
uh what emotions uh uh what what is it what is it is it uh completely neutral what you're

21
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,720
thinking about or does it have an influence on you in some way does it any residual feelings

22
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,720
that come with it so for example if you're imagining

23
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,840
you're thinking frightening thoughts is there feelings of fear that come from

24
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,680
that if there are uh angry thoughts other feelings of

25
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,920
anger or if there are desire thoughts

26
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,360
does that stimulate something in your physiology that you feel in your body a little bit that

27
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,280
upwelling of energy of desire perhaps so what's the impact desires have uh

28
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,840
thinking has on on you often if we just notice thinking and

29
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,680
note it and let go of it we haven't noticed that it has left its traces in us

30
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,920
and the more powerful the thinking the stronger those traces are and so and so much so that if

31
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,080
they might remain somehow in terms of tension in the body contraction in the body or

32
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,200
certain mood in the body that might last quite a long time after

33
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,480
the thoughts are finished they've left their traces

34
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:52,879
and um so so that's the exercise so

35
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,280
assuming a meditation posture

36
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,920
and one of the possibilities with your posture

37
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,920
is to assume a posture that seems to have some strength to it or some

38
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,040
solidity to it sitting cross-legged on the floor or

39
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,840
sometimes likened to or compared to being like a mountain

40
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,960
so the tripod base provides a firm support

41
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,440
if you're sitting in a chair you know that um how can you sit in the chair so there's

42
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,440
a little bit more solidity or a sense of being established

43
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,280
here in this body so the body is not treated incidentally

44
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,680
or is a something to forget when you're meditating meditating

45
00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:01,039
but the body itself is put in a position where there's a sense of presence like it is here the body is

46
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,039
here with you

47
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,160
if you're not used to this uh it might seem a little bit awkward at

48
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:19,280
first but it's a wonderful support for meditation

49
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,960
to receive the body's help

50
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:32,479
in becoming established stable in the present moment here

51
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,840
and gently closing your eyes

52
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,240
relaxing the body

53
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:14,560
then in a leisurely way taking a fuller inhale than usual

54
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,400
as if you have all the time in the world

55
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,520
and a longer exhale

56
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:47,280
feeling the expansion of your chest all the way up to your shoulders

57
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,639
as you breathe in

58
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:06,080
maybe noticing a little bit the more subtle expansion of your back ribcage

59
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,638
and as you exhale relaxing at all

60
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,240
and letting your breathing return to normal

61
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,280
and on the exhale relaxing the muscles of the face

62
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,638
on the exhale softening the shoulders

63
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,919
and on the exhale softening

64
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,400
in the belly

65
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:37,760
and then establishing your attention on your breathing

66
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:46,440
wherever it's most comfortable to do it in the belly the chest the nose

67
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:07,880
and as you exhale to let go of your thoughts

68
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,240
and if you can't let go of them perhaps you can let them become quieter

69
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,240
calmer

70
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:49,519
and then receive the inhale letting go with the exhale

71
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,040
and if thoughts occur reappear during the inhale

72
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:01,360
recognize the thinking and notice

73
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:08,399
what influence they have on the rest of you do they come along with a mood or an

74
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,079
emotion or with any tension or pressure

75
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,800
what impact does that thinking have

76
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,640
and then on the exhale let go again

77
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:41,280
if you're thinking what impact does that have on your body

78
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,880
is there any tension or pressure anywhere contraction

79
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,480
does the energies in your body seemingly shift

80
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,840
depending what you're thinking about

81
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:58,760
and if you notice the influence thinking has on you

82
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,080
in your body and your

83
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:12,640
feelings mood in the mind itself

84
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,000
is there some way that that influence

85
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,799
encourages more thinking

86
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:32,159
some way that it has within it

87
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,000
an impetus to think more

88
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

89
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:53,600
to pick up your thoughts again more actively intentionally

90
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,799
and to think about the people of your lives people in your

91
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:05,440
communities locally and far away and around the world

92
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:15,520
into consider

93
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,600
thoughts with of goodwill to have thoughts of well-wishing and

94
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,840
care and appreciation of others

95
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:37,760
and perhaps after this meditation session

96
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:44,480
calmly openly generously you can think about other people

97
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,600
with appreciation

98
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,080
with care

99
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,720
and to dedicate these 30 minutes

100
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:07,279
dedicate the benefits from meditating here to dedicated to the welfare and

101
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:13,600
happiness of others may any ways that you have benefited

102
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,880
that we have benefited spread out from here into the world

103
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,080
to benefit others may all beings

104
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,880
be happy may all beings

105
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:41,200
be safe may all beings be peaceful

106
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,720
may all beings everywhere be free

107
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,470
[Music]

108
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:31,840
so continuing on this theme of

109
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,880
the karmic and the dharmic streams of our lives

110
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:43,360
and for most people the primary the one that's primary in their lives

111
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,720
the biggest role is the karmic stream and people don't understand what this is

112
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,880
and so they don't recognize it as such it's just business as usual

113
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,559
but the karmic stream is um i'm what we can experience directly for

114
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:07,840
ourselves and not the abstract ideas about it or ideas that what happens over lifetimes

115
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,519
and other grand ideas like that but to start becoming sensitive to how

116
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:19,039
it works moment by moment how it unfolds in our lives and um

117
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:25,919
and a couple of things about this karmic stream is that it uh is kind of a self-genera

118
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:32,480
perpetual motion machine it's kind of self-generating uh that um

119
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:40,480
it's uh it uh it creates the conditions that prompt more of the same

120
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,519
creates the conditions to create to have more karmic activities

121
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,960
and what makes something karmic is that it it

122
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:57,840
it conditions us it affects us in such a way that there's a continual motion

123
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,399
at one after the other kind of like there's no stop or or if there is stop it's ready to kind of

124
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:11,599
it's there in the background as an influence to rare up and and effect further

125
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:17,520
and um and one of the best places to see this uh is in our thinking because then we can

126
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,280
see it operating kind of really moment by moment or really up close

127
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,480
and you see it when uh one way to see it is when kind of then

128
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,919
is when thoughts are like monkeys

129
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:39,118
where the analogy that's classically used is a monkey is swinging in the

130
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:46,878
trees and the branches and as soon as it's grabbed one branch it's already moving to grab the next one

131
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:53,280
and um and so we're up with one thought and already there's a generation of the next one and

132
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,359
moving on to the next and the next and um and uh

133
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:05,119
and what we think oftentimes if it's karmic as a karmic way of thinking

134
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,720
that karmic way of thinking leaves traces has an effect

135
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:17,440
it it generates further thinking it generates a

136
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:24,240
disposition it creates a mood for thinking in the future

137
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,760
that thinking is very seldom just light empty

138
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:36,640
you know just a a whiff of thought that has no leaves no traces has no influence on us

139
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:43,520
uh oftentimes in daily life our thoughts do leave these traces leaves this influence on us but we don't

140
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:51,040
they sometimes are kind of subtle each individual thought but the accumulation of many thoughts over a day over months

141
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:57,040
can be huge and so it create it can create almost like a

142
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:05,039
disposition in a person or a mood in a person and sometimes these thoughts

143
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:12,000
the way that influence on us encourages more thinking another way as we did that exercise a

144
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,920
little while ago about noticing what influence thoughts have on you

145
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,440
um but you could also do it the other way you can say what is the mood

146
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,560
what's the uh the emotion that's present for you

147
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:36,079
and how's that influencing your thinking it goes both ways it's kind of a cyclical and this is kind of the often

148
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:41,920
the cycle of birth and death can be seen in these cycles of the birth and death of

149
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,280
thoughts that so when what comes first is it an

150
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,119
emotion or a mood that gives birth to thoughts or as thoughts

151
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,720
give birth to the mood or the emotional state and

152
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,800
and so it can be both and sometimes it's productive to look and see what is the influence that thinking has

153
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:11,599
on us and other times it's useful to look and see what is the influence of our mood into

154
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,960
the thinking and but if we start seeing this cycle we see

155
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,800
that thinking is not free thinking is not free of any impact there's a way in

156
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:29,359
which it generates the very mood which prompts more thinking or generates the kind of

157
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:35,200
physical tension that prompts more thinking and there's an analogy i like using

158
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:41,280
occasionally and maybe you've heard of if you take a a

159
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,040
tube of toothpaste and you keep squeezing it the paste will keep coming out and even

160
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:53,359
if you want to stop it coming out and you keep wiping it off the opening the wiping the paste away it

161
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:58,640
keeps coming out and and what you have to do is you have to stop squeezing

162
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,760
and then it might stop and so sometimes our thoughts are that way that if we're squeezing if there's

163
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,200
tension and tightness and pressure within us we can let go of thoughts forever but

164
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,800
the pressure to think will just generate more thoughts more thoughts

165
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:23,119
and so what creates that pressure it might be there was a thought a certain way of thinking

166
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,960
that uh frightened us and so that there's tension in the body from that fear or that anxiety

167
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:36,480
and that anxiety then gives birth to more so the um there's also positive karma

168
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,560
good karma beautiful karma that could be great and that is to um

169
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:49,760
if we have beautiful thoughts we have thoughts of generosity of love of appreciation of other people

170
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,960
if we have thoughts of wisdom and then

171
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:02,160
those thoughts have a different kind of impact on our body on our on our emotional life

172
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:08,079
and so to um and so sometimes you can feel

173
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:14,640
the impact that how it what's left behind and um sometimes it you know it has to be quite

174
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:20,079
strong the impact to really feel it if you're not really subtle and tuned in carefully

175
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:25,359
um if uh and sometimes it's really clear that the leftovers stay with us

176
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:32,800
if um you know if we really have a strong bout of resentment and um and the jaw clenches

177
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,320
and so there that clenching of the jaw is the influence that thinking has on us

178
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,880
if um uh i've had i've i've um

179
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,599
and sometimes i've had uh beautiful wonderful thoughts of appreciation of other people

180
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,960
and the love for them and i felt this warmth that kind of begins kind of traveling through me

181
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:03,680
that began with those thinking and imagining the people that i love and feeling the warmth that goes on here

182
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:09,520
and anyway so the good ones as well again both of them

183
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:16,079
and now one of the qualities of karma both good karma and uh

184
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:22,079
and so-called bad karma difficult karma this momentum is that um

185
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:28,000
there's there's there keeps being this momentum keeps being this kind of uh

186
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,079
uh something is operating that's pushing us along karma is kind of a

187
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:42,160
a momentum that keeps reappearing keeps reoccurring keeps surfacing in us

188
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:50,160
and uh and if that karmic stream is strong or if our thinking is strong and active and a lot of pressure to think

189
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,839
then um uh it limits the operation of the dharm extreme this

190
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:03,280
other whole side of who we are and so um and so to even even to have beautiful

191
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:09,520
karma and good karma operating kind of is a is operating a little bit

192
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:16,319
it's kind of filling the space that if we can create more space

193
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:23,119
then there's a whole other way that operates that um uh it comes from something i'd like to call it shire

194
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:31,359
inside of us something that's quiet or something that's easily eclipsed and this is the the the upwelling

195
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:38,079
of of our native goodness or upwelling of

196
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:45,200
the unfolding of the dharma within us and a lot of this has to do with um

197
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:52,079
you know there's a little bit you know this language of inner goodness and eight goodness is kind of you know some people raise their eyebrows around that

198
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:58,319
or this idea but uh it uh the karmic stream

199
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:04,720
that the dharma extreme has to do a lot what what gets left over when we stop

200
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,880
the karmic stream when it pauses the karma stream is little bit like sisyphus

201
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:17,520
pushing a boulder up the street up the mountain and it goes up and up and up and always

202
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:24,079
rolling it up the mountain and now the what the what the boulder wants to do is roll down to the bottom

203
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:31,040
and so when he gets it to the top it rolls down he has to push it up again and um and uh

204
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:38,000
so the karma stream is kind of the pushing of our boulders pushing over our desires our wants our concerns our

205
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:45,119
wishes uh moving ahead doing things with the mind the wanting mind that

206
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,319
desirous mind the a verse of mind and all these kinds of the things that are carrying the

207
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:57,760
thinking along uh and even even even uh the subtle or desires of love and generosity are

208
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,800
carrying it along and and so it creates a kind of

209
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,480
it's a work for the mind karma the karmic mind is always working

210
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:15,440
it's always constructing and so when the when the karmic uh work the

211
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,040
constructing mind stops and there's space for something else to happen

212
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:27,680
there starts to be an unwinding the boulder rolls downhill the tensions in the mind the tensions in

213
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,359
the body begin to dissolve and when all these tensions

214
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:39,760
are dissolved it allows for something else to arise and one of the things that can arise

215
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:45,839
is a great delight and joy at this relaxing at this kind of having

216
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:50,960
breathing room again having a sense of like space and allowing a deeper feeling

217
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:58,000
a felt sense connection to ourselves a discovery of kind of a feeling of wholeness that's very hard to

218
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,640
feel when karma is operating because it tends to karma always limits the buddhist

219
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:11,040
languages karma karma creates definition and limits to who we are what's going on

220
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:17,520
that doesn't allow us to see things as being whole and as we relax those limitations and

221
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:23,200
the feeling of wholeness feeling of freedom feeling of ease begins happening

222
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:29,119
and then the quality of the thinking changes and now sometimes thinking has a quality

223
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,480
of being more spontaneous in a certain way wiser

224
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:39,839
more intelligent thinking has a way of feeling that uh it's light

225
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:45,200
and it doesn't leave traces it doesn't it's not a self-genera

226
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:51,599
generation it's not like monkeys one after the other a thought arises and it's there

227
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:57,680
and and it's easy and light and um interesting

228
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,839
but it doesn't there's no pressure associated with it and

229
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:08,160
and uh the mind has a greater capacity for creativity and

230
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:14,800
wisdom and even things like kindness and love um but not the one that is grabbing from

231
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,319
one thing to the other so

232
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,000
um so this is my attempt to try to kind of

233
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:32,480
point you to some newer understanding of how the mind might work and how karma and

234
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:38,560
dharma might work and perhaps i don't have it exactly right for you and

235
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:44,720
but i'm hoping it's well enough that you can now investigate for yourself that you do the exercise the exploration

236
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:51,359
for yourself and see how what what is what is gil talking about here and what are these two streams

237
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:58,560
do you know anything about these two streams can you recognize something that's this self-j generating perpetual motion

238
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:04,240
machines of thoughts that are pushing and wanting and building and creating

239
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,520
and and this stream where that arises without desire without

240
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:15,599
pushing and pressure but as um his uh delightful

241
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:21,359
expression of freedom so um

242
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:27,799
thank you and um i look forward to continuing tomorrow
