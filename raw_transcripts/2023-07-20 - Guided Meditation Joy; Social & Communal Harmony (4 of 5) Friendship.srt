[Music]

83
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,580
foreign

84
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:10,260
hello again I don't know if this was happening for

85
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:17,100
you but I I noticed as we were doing sympathetic Joy meditation without my intending it I had this tiny

86
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:23,220
smile growing over one side of my face uh

87
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:29,600
wow such a such a way that giving Joy comes back

88
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:40,200
so this week we've been talking about social and communal Harmony the practice of it which um

89
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:46,440
begins with Right View which is then made real

90
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,480
through our effort we've been talking about this in terms of rahula's repeated

91
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:56,820
reflection and then as a sort of application

92
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:01,919
we yesterday we We examined uh working with anger

93
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:07,260
reflecting on its causes its effects um

94
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:14,640
and the encouragement to make the most wholesome contribution possible

95
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:20,460
whatever is available we've been we've been talking largely in

96
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:26,340
personal terms about the Buddhist teachings on social and communal Harmony and then

97
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:33,860
today I think we're going to move in a in a more communal social Direction

98
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,480
so again I'd like to begin with a story one you may have heard before the um

99
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:49,799
the details are a little fuzzy so we're just going to have to imagine and the the way that I the way that I

100
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:55,740
recall this story it's something like there's a there's a circle

101
00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:02,520
of I don't know maybe I don't know the number let's say 10. it's a Dharma

102
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:11,220
practitioners people who've been practicing on the path together for 30 40 50 years

103
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:17,279
and they're having a they're having um a time to share

104
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:23,640
and the topic comes up what are what are the difficulties that you're facing in

105
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:30,500
your practice and I hear this set up I get interested

106
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:36,480
um I wonder how a practitioner of 30 40 50 years relates to the difficulties in

107
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,880
their lives and then the first person the first person shares these things are going

108
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:47,100
well and you know I've got this thing going on I have um I'm still noticing

109
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:53,760
that this form of attachment is arising in me and isn't that something

110
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,039
and then the second the second person I'm gonna share and they talk about a

111
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:05,039
conflict that they're involved in you know someone they care about but there's a disharmony in the relationship

112
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:12,659
for now and one by one sort of discussing discussing some of their difficulties

113
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:19,140
what I remember the impression of this story was so interesting to me

114
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:24,740
was that the the the

115
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:30,600
SE practitioners that have matured over decades what we're seeing it's not

116
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:38,460
perfection it's not that there's no difficulty in their social lives

117
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:44,700
but what stands out is the the earnestness with which they engage and a

118
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:51,120
sort of levity a sort of like lightness oh look at this you know isn't that something I've still

119
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:58,799
got this I've still got this issue going on after all these years it's not a it's not a hurtful self-criticism

120
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:07,740
but a sort of lightness there's that sort of humor in a there's a there's a Zen story of uh the the

121
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:15,260
teacher saying something like oh even after all these years I still put on my robe with a flare

122
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:22,080
um so I have this wish for all of us that um

123
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:29,158
that we have a circle of support like this a circle of good Dharma friends that grows over the years that maybe we

124
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:36,540
find ourselves 30 40 50 years down the path that um we can sit in a circle and

125
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:41,878
share our our Treasures of practice that includes our

126
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:46,039
difficulties with this touch of levity

127
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:56,220
so in the teachings it's also there that something we all know pretty well the choice of our friends has a profound

128
00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:04,080
influence on our lives so maybe it may be useful to contrast

129
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:10,380
these two terms and the teachings one is kalyanamita good friendship admirable friendship

130
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:15,839
beautiful friendship and it's contrasted with this other word Papa Mita

131
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:20,880
Papa has a sort of dramatic translation in English usually it's translated as

132
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,820
evil looking into it it looks like the the word is associated with qualities like

133
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:32,400
unruliness stubbornness whereas kalyanamita good friendship is

134
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,180
associated with gentleness and being easy to correct I think of someone who's someone who's

135
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,859
open to good advice

136
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,940
in the in the way that the Buddha does he celebrates this this uh factor of the

137
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:57,119
path good friendship by saying there's not a single thing that gives rise to skillful qualities

138
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:03,359
or makes unskillful qualities decline like good friends when you have good friends skillful

139
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:08,640
qualities Arise at unskillful qualities decline

140
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:15,359
so our choice of friends can have a profound influence on us in the spirit of Social and communal

141
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:22,140
Harmony one of the things that bikubody says this brings forth is a sense of discretion

142
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:26,660
that's of Interest a sense of discretion

143
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:35,339
so looking into the qualities of beautiful friendship there are some very beautiful lists in the in the teachings

144
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:42,780
and I'll just mention one the Buddha was talking to a young person and he says that there there are these

145
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:48,480
four kinds of kind-hearted friends there's the one who is helpful

146
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:55,079
there's the friend who shares one's happiness and suffering third there's the friend who points out

147
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:00,119
what is good in terms of action and there's the friend who is

148
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:07,800
sympathetic and he explains the the friend who's helpful is someone who's um

149
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:15,900
someone who's willing to look after you when you're heedless and gives more than is required

150
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:22,200
and is a refuge for you when you're frightened when I think to

151
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:27,900
when I think to the circle of support the circle of Dharma friends that

152
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:33,300
can grow for us over years and years one of the qualities I feel in that

153
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:40,460
Circle whether it's explicit or not is that these people can be a refuge when it's difficult

154
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:48,540
a friend who shares and happiness and suffering this is a friend who

155
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:53,700
is willing to practice modita for us sympathetic Joy is willing to practice

156
00:37:53,700 --> 00:38:02,180
compassion for us when we're suffering oh may you be free of suffering it's someone who cares

157
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:09,780
this third type of kind-hearted friend the friend who points out what is good

158
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:14,940
um it's here that we see that in the texts there's an emphasis on uh

159
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:20,820
kalyanamita a good friend is someone who is a teacher or a mentor for us

160
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:27,839
I like to reflect on good friendship in this broader sense it's like all of our relationships

161
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,660
and um there is this way that trusted mentors can help point us away from what's

162
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:38,820
harmful and toward what's helpful and then there's the friends who are

163
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:44,640
sympathetic so important to Social and communal Harmony I think this is someone who will

164
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:51,480
actually commend other people who are speaking well of you speaking well of your virtues Maybe

165
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:58,099
and will uh it said stop people who are speaking dispraise of you

166
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,720
they undermine divisive speech

167
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:09,240
then in contrast to the beautiful friend the wise friend the wise person in the

168
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:15,359
text we have this person uh that we call the fool um maybe not what it sounds like at

169
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:20,880
first glance but a fool a fool is to Define in terms of uh actions

170
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:27,060
it's someone partaking of unskillful actions of body speech and mind and that ends up having the effect

171
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:32,000
socially of a sort of Calamity that brings harm

172
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:40,440
um in the dhamapada it says that as long as evil has not borne fruit the fool thinks

173
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:46,280
it is like honey isn't that so

174
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:55,440
but a really important principle here is that uh it seems and it seems in the teaching fool status is not permanent

175
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,140
that um maybe fool is someone someone who's acting in a misguided way

176
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:05,300
and that they can always become a wise person

177
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:13,460
and a story that's really well known the um

178
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,839
the Buddha's attendant Ananda declares

179
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:28,320
uh half of the Holy life is good friendship good companionship good comradeship and

180
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:34,079
the Buddha and his well-known response no another don't say that don't say that the entire

181
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:41,160
holy life is good friendship good companionship good comradeship and when he says the

182
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:47,579
holy life here it's the training the life of training when a monastic has good friends when a

183
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:56,240
practitioner has good friends it can be expected that they develop and cultivate the noble Eightfold Path

184
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:01,320
this has always been an interesting point for me that one of the ways that we can

185
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:06,660
recognize good friendship in this sense in a dharmic sense is are we growing in

186
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:12,060
skillful qualities is it supporting what's wholesome what's

187
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:17,640
helpful or is it uh is it um leading us into its

188
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:26,480
opposite then the Buddha carries on he goes on

189
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:33,180
so a and he's asked this rhetorical question how is it that a person with good

190
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:38,520
friends uh cultivates the the Eightfold Path

191
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:45,119
and the first thing he says based on good friendship is that they develop Right View we're right back at the beginning of the

192
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:50,820
week there's this very interesting thing happening here where Right View

193
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:56,040
we've made our way from Right View through practice to good friendship the

194
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:02,940
right view points us to good friendship and allows us to recognize good friendship

195
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:10,079
and then good friendship points us right back into Right View it's this positive

196
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:16,279
feedback loop good for us good for others

197
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:27,300
so good friendship is something worth celebrating and also worth noting

198
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:33,300
I think it applies for most of us maybe I'll just speak for myself we're not perfect people

199
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:40,320
sometimes we Act in a way that we are the fool and sometimes we act in the way of a

200
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,900
wise person um but there's a there's a way that

201
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:51,119
there's this great way that Norman Fisher uh mentioned in a talk

202
00:42:51,119 --> 00:43:00,740
these um these actions we take that we're talking about is maybe foolish he calls them our little buddha foibles

203
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:07,260
I love the levity of this phrase you know it doesn't dismiss the fact that something might be amiss

204
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:14,220
but there's something compassionate and accepting that gets communicated in the phrase little dutifoigels

205
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:19,380
whatever those might be in the spirit of rahula's repeated

206
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:25,380
reflection if we if we act in a in a way with our little buddha foibles

207
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:30,720
We Lay It open we share it with a good Dharma friend and we resolve

208
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,280
on something else in the future

209
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:40,980
so maybe at times we're both fool maybe sometimes we're the wise

210
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:46,680
person hmm

211
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:52,200
I hope that I hope that allows us to include everything in our practice all

212
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:57,859
of ourselves there's nothing that has to be outside sometimes we're the good friend

213
00:43:57,859 --> 00:44:02,940
sometimes we need the good friend sometimes someone comes to us and says

214
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:08,819
oh I notice I'm having this difficulty uh it seems like you kind of have some

215
00:44:08,819 --> 00:44:15,900
skill in this area what do you what do you suggest maybe we're the good friend they come to

216
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:22,818
maybe sometimes we go to them I'm having this difficulty what do you think

217
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:29,579
there's some way that the the relationships are nourished by Mutual Trust

218
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:35,579
and by our practice of mindfulness our practice of mindfulness

219
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:41,579
supports this this movement to a bond that's deeper than Pleasant and

220
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:49,380
unpleasant when we practice mindfulness we learn how to not respond immediately

221
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:56,599
to Pleasant and unpleasant and I think that opens up a field where we can connect on a deeper level

222
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,220
so so good friendship

223
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:07,260
I hope uh I hope good friends in this sense can be inspiring

224
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:13,260
encouraging helpful and that we cultivate and make our way

225
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:20,760
toward relationships that are conducive to the path conducive to our growth to the well-being of ourselves and to others

226
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:27,359
may that be for the benefit of all beings maybe so

227
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:33,240
and tomorrow we will continue the Buddhist teachings on social and

228
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:39,440
communal Harmony please take care

229
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:42,660
