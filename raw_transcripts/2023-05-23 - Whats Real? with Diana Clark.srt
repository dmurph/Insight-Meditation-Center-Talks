1
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,020
ah

2
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:20,478
good evening so a warm welcome to everyone

3
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:28,220
so as you know sit in silence for 45 minutes

4
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:37,259
and then I'll offer a brief talk so we'll ring the bell at 8 15.

5
00:06:37,259 --> 00:06:39,740
thanks

6
00:51:45,559 --> 00:51:52,819
good evening welcome welcome nice to see you all

7
00:51:56,819 --> 00:52:03,920
so I um you know these days there's this talk about artificial intelligence AI

8
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:09,119
and this some maybe not directly but maybe it is

9
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:15,540
directly I don't know I haven't I'm not so up to date on whatever he's talking about but there's this question of like

10
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:21,260
what is real what is real

11
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:26,819
and if we were anything that we feel like it must be real

12
00:52:26,819 --> 00:52:35,220
it must be like you or me right this like I'm real you're real you're

13
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:41,900
real right so this idea like okay well you know I'm real

14
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:49,079
but there's a you know the the Buddhist uh the Buddhist teachings

15
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:57,059
include this idea of not-self and so what does that mean really

16
00:52:57,059 --> 00:53:02,640
with that whole idea of not self so I'd like to explore this a little bit

17
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:07,859
and I'm influenced by a contemporary philosopher Julian bikini

18
00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:13,200
not a Buddhist or maybe is I don't know but he writes

19
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:18,780
as a philosopher and

20
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:24,180
he he gave a talk a Ted talked every 10 years ago

21
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:29,579
that I heard and I thought oh okay so there's pointing to this same idea of

22
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:34,819
not self but from a really different angle that I found interesting and

23
00:53:34,819 --> 00:53:39,839
interesting to think about but

24
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:46,260
before I go into that I want to talk a little bit about some of these initial reactions we might have to not

25
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:52,920
self-teachings or even hearing about this maybe for the first time or over and over again

26
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:58,079
we might have this ideas of what I don't get it

27
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:03,960
not self like that's just what of course there's a self this is ridiculous

28
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:10,020
and so we might have this idea of like we want to be a little bit dismissive of it because it's so different than our

29
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:15,240
actual experience of course there's a self there's a real

30
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:21,119
self what are they talking about so there's a way in that this teaching runs counter

31
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:28,020
to our experience and our ideas and certainly the way that like society and

32
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:36,059
our culture suggests that there's a self I'll talk a little bit more about that but so our initial reactions and

33
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:41,819
certainly this was mine a little bit of puzzlement or disbelief

34
00:54:41,819 --> 00:54:48,300
and I remember hearing some teachings that they really touched me and I felt

35
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:54,960
like wow this is like so great so Buddhist thing I felt like oh okay I

36
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:01,380
found a home here it makes sense to me except for that not self stuff so I kind

37
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:09,119
of thought that idea okay well I'll be a Buddhist whatever that means I didn't even know at that time but I'm just gonna be a self I'll let them kind of

38
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:15,119
keep all that not self stuff and I'm gonna keep myself here and it's not uncommon right to have

39
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:20,520
these ideas you was like oh okay well Maybe

40
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:26,880
if it true I don't know but to feel a little bit uncomfortable with it and have maybe this

41
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:33,180
attempted to dismiss it just as um I did and that's perfectly fine you can do

42
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:39,180
that you don't have to believe anything that I'm saying there's the last thing we want to do it's like

43
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:45,839
here's a collection of beliefs that you have to adopt or some views you have to adopt that's not the direction we're

44
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:52,500
going it's this tradition we're really pointing to experiences then I'll be pointing to that in a

45
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:58,020
moment but maybe one last thing that I'll say about some of our initial reactions when

46
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:05,339
we hear about this even the concept or the idea of not self after maybe some puzzlement or some disbelief or wanting

47
00:56:05,339 --> 00:56:13,140
to dismiss it is this recognition that this path of practice part of what I think makes it

48
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:23,220
so powerful and attractive is that it requires or

49
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:28,440
I don't know if I like this word requires but maybe that it asks for some

50
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:35,220
open-mindedness and some humility oh this path is about right we hear

51
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:41,220
about beginner's mind this idea of like okay what is there to learn what is

52
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:46,440
there to see how can I learn and how can I see

53
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:51,720
right if we thought that we already knew everything or had everything we

54
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:58,500
would have no need for meditation practice we would have no need for a spiritual practice we'd have no need for

55
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:05,880
coming to IMC on Monday nights right if we already had everything

56
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:10,980
so this path asks us for to engage with our experience

57
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:16,380
to be present for our experience with a certain amount of open-mindedness and

58
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:25,440
humility and maybe I'll even add on that that this isn't just a nice thing to say

59
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:30,960
but investigation this quality of open-mindedness and humility and asking

60
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:38,400
like what's really here what's really here what are my ideas about what's here what

61
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,440
are the experiences I'm having like what's happening what's my relationship

62
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:50,040
to happening this whole idea of Investigation this whole practice of Investigation

63
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:55,559
is one of the factors of Awakening this is part of what leads to Awakening is a

64
00:57:55,559 --> 00:58:02,220
support for awakening so it's more than just saying oh it's nice to have this open-mindedness and

65
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:07,819
this humility I would say it's an integral part of this path of practice

66
00:58:08,339 --> 00:58:15,440
so let's getting back to this idea of a non-self

67
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:22,079
so there's this sense of self it just kind of like makes common sense if you

68
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:28,800
were to ask people maybe if I were to ask some of you or prove to ask somebody walking down the street like what is

69
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:35,400
what does it mean to have a self and then kind of look at you a little bit oddly perhaps we don't think about

70
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:41,160
this so much but there's this idea often that we have a a

71
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:47,880
core or an essence and some people rather than self might

72
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:54,480
even use this word ego which maybe feels like part of itself or some people might use the word soul

73
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:59,720
so this like inner entity

74
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:06,359
that stays with us like through our life as we grow and

75
00:59:06,359 --> 00:59:15,000
go through our lives and there's lots of things in our culture that really reinforce this idea

76
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,059
and uh kind of a funny what I mean not funny but in one that I hadn't thought

77
00:59:21,059 --> 00:59:28,079
of before was this even this whole idea of horoscopes if you're born on this month or this

78
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:36,180
time frame you have this uh or astrological sign and therefore it

79
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:44,160
means something about you and often you know I still hear you know people talking about even Buddhist practitioners well I'm a Gemini and that

80
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:49,380
means that blah blah blah or in true Aries fashion I did blah blah blah you

81
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:56,700
know there's this idea that even that a person could have a horoscope that says something about how they this integral

82
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:03,299
to their essence or something like this and maybe if you don't believe in the

83
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:09,240
horoscopes or astrological signs we still have like in a professional world

84
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:15,380
and in career development all these types of things we have these personality tests

85
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:20,880
Myers-Briggs type indicator mbti maybe some of you have done this taken

86
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:28,380
these tests and you get these four letter designations that like the type that you are

87
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:34,020
and then they suggest you know what the best way that you work or the best way that you learn or how to be a good

88
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:40,619
manager a good employee or something like that right so here's another way in society's kind of suggesting that you have this

89
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:45,720
Core Essence and not only that that it can be uh

90
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:53,780
assigned a type and that this type is going to be with you as you progress through life

91
01:00:54,180 --> 01:01:00,000
of course it's it's we have these official uh type indicators but you know there's

92
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:06,059
plenty of websites and magazines there's a lot of stuff take these answer these five questions

93
01:01:06,059 --> 01:01:12,240
and we'll tell you what can I have a learner you are what type of a what type of exercise is best for you the best

94
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:20,579
diet you know everything right anything you can imagine so this idea that we even have like one

95
01:01:20,579 --> 01:01:28,319
distinct style or type or something is part of what kind of society in our

96
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:35,660
culture believes and many of us kind of accept this makes sense

97
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:43,619
and so if we believe that there's this core or this essence

98
01:01:43,619 --> 01:01:49,799
then we have this idea that this core this Essence as experiences

99
01:01:49,799 --> 01:01:55,319
but then just get like tacked on like here to the to the outside of this core

100
01:01:55,319 --> 01:02:00,980
or this Essence there's this thing in the middle and now it has these other things hanging on to it

101
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:07,680
experiences memories things that we learn Sensations all

102
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:14,339
these types of things sense of there's something here and everything else is somehow attached to

103
01:02:14,339 --> 01:02:19,740
it but there's this thing here or type our style or

104
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:25,760
ego Soul self all these types of things

105
01:02:27,299 --> 01:02:33,780
to be sure I mean we certainly we have desires we have beliefs we have knowledge we have Sensations we have

106
01:02:33,780 --> 01:02:40,339
experiences all these things that maybe we believe are been

107
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:45,420
distinct from this core but somehow attached to it

108
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:51,119
and then what the Buddha is pointing to and even modern day neuroscience and

109
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:56,819
some schools of philosophy that there actually isn't this

110
01:02:56,819 --> 01:03:02,940
core there isn't a you uh I me

111
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:07,640
at the center of all experiences

112
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:12,380
well then you might ask well what is fair then

113
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:20,420
so clearly we have these memories and desires and beliefs and knowledge and Sensations

114
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:28,740
so these things exist and and they're all integrate it in some way and they overlap in some way

115
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:35,040
or in our beliefs are related to the experiences we have

116
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:42,119
Sensations that we've had and our memories the things that we think are important are also associated with our

117
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:48,960
beliefs and maybe the knowledge that we have Sensations are associated with what we

118
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:54,839
do in the world or how we're experiencing the world and that's also associated with

119
01:03:54,839 --> 01:04:01,619
thoughts that we might have or so there's a way in which all these things are interrelated they're not completely

120
01:04:01,619 --> 01:04:08,220
distinct so that there's an overlap and related

121
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:17,040
but maybe the emphasis here is on the way that these things are connected

122
01:04:17,099 --> 01:04:24,420
so components are of our lives are connected because certainly they all belong to one

123
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:31,200
body and brain right they're not happening my Sensations aren't happening to any of you I'm not having any of your

124
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:37,020
sensations of course so they're connected in that way

125
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:43,740
but they're also connected because there's a narrative that's

126
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:51,420
getting created this sensation means X

127
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:58,619
and whatever the x is is based on our beliefs based on our values based on

128
01:04:58,619 --> 01:05:04,440
knowledge we have based on other experiences we have

129
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:10,920
so there's experiences Sensations thoughts beliefs

130
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:16,079
and then there is a narrative that's like knitting them together and making a

131
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:25,220
story we're adding meaning to them the story that we tell about ourselves

132
01:05:26,099 --> 01:05:34,440
the story that highlights that oh yeah that memory

133
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:39,599
was me and I'm different now

134
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:45,119
even though the memories actually happening in the present moment

135
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:51,780
and the fact that we're remembering it is a indicator of something that maybe a

136
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:56,420
experience or a sensation we had right now

137
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:04,740
and so there's this way there's this maybe invisible or unseen story that's knitting all our

138
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:10,559
experiences together to make sense nobody else nobody likes things to not

139
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:17,339
make sense we all kind of want to have our life make sense our experiences make sense so there's this narrative that

140
01:06:17,339 --> 01:06:26,819
we're layering on top so what does this mean exactly

141
01:06:26,819 --> 01:06:33,440
we might say that the these connected things I can use this word things

142
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:40,500
beliefs values knowledge Sensations experiences

143
01:06:40,559 --> 01:06:47,339
are what you is a me is collection

144
01:06:47,339 --> 01:06:53,819
of connected things I'm using this word things

145
01:06:53,819 --> 01:07:00,780
beliefs Sensations values thoughts

146
01:07:01,799 --> 01:07:07,279
in some ways we're like the the sum of the parts

147
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:14,460
so maybe to I like this example

148
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:21,119
and this is from Julian bikini the philosopher part of it I like it because uh some of

149
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:26,819
you may know I'm trained as a scientist and this is a little bit of science tiny little bit of science

150
01:07:26,819 --> 01:07:32,400
makes me happy so there's we could take something like

151
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:37,799
water H2O we all know this H2O

152
01:07:37,799 --> 01:07:45,359
two hydrogen atoms one oxygen atom put them together you get water

153
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:50,400
it's real kind of like know this there's I think too complicated about it

154
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:57,960
but what you guys probably didn't think is that there's this essence of water and

155
01:07:57,960 --> 01:08:03,420
then we stick a hydrogen on it over here another hydrogen ion over here and an oxygen over here

156
01:08:03,420 --> 01:08:10,799
no you understand that it's two hydrogens and an oxygen together and that's the water

157
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:17,359
there isn't this core that we call water that then we stick things on

158
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:24,719
or maybe we might even say that microphones

159
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:30,060
there's a I don't know how microphones work exactly I think there's sound waves

160
01:08:30,060 --> 01:08:37,560
that come in there's a diaphragm that vibrates and it is connected to a doohickey which is

161
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:43,679
connected to a thingamajig which is connected you know I don't know what exactly how microphones work

162
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:49,620
there's a wire it's the same thing right there isn't

163
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:56,100
this core that's called microphone that we stick the diaphragm the coil I think there's a coil I think I'm a jig on and

164
01:08:56,100 --> 01:09:03,420
the doohickey on right no it's a collection of things microphone is you know all

165
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:08,460
these things in a particular configuration

166
01:09:08,460 --> 01:09:18,500
and they're working together they're doing something they're amplifying my voice in this case

167
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:25,380
Mickey Mouse in cartoons the same type of thing right it's a character

168
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:32,940
it's on TV or on the computer which was drawn by somebody

169
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:38,160
has and there's stories about it but

170
01:09:38,160 --> 01:09:43,318
is it real is Mickey Mouse real

171
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:48,600
it's a collection of things that were created and I don't actually know how

172
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:55,320
they make cartoons but Mickey Mouse right it's important for some children as a rule that it

173
01:09:55,320 --> 01:10:02,400
teaches and stories but so it's not not real because it has

174
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:09,420
an impact on people water is real microphones are real

175
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:15,000
they don't have a core though they're just a collection of things and

176
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:20,660
we are assigning a label to this collection

177
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:26,880
or rainbows right these are just when the conditions

178
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:33,840
are present Etc right water in the atmosphere and sunlight and

179
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:38,880
I guess there needs to be like a human being or some entity that has can

180
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:47,219
visualize a rainbow see in that color spectrum but Rainbows are real

181
01:10:47,219 --> 01:10:52,860
but they're not substantial like we love rainbows we can take photos

182
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:59,640
of them but they're just a collection of certain conditions came together and made a

183
01:10:59,640 --> 01:11:05,820
rainbow about you they're not I mean they're real but right there have

184
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:10,340
this insubstantiality to them also

185
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:19,260
so there's a few ideas that I'm pointing to you here that all of these things Mickey Mouse

186
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:25,920
rainbows microphones water everything actually

187
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:32,340
everything doesn't have like a core that we then

188
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:38,120
stick attached to that has other things attached to it

189
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:46,260
so why should the self be different why should this idea of a self be

190
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:51,140
different than everything else in our experience

191
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:58,020
why do we think that uh that we're not just a collection of all our parts we'll

192
01:11:58,020 --> 01:12:03,600
use that word parts but instead we have this idea that there's a core and other things get

193
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:10,320
attached to it but there's nothing like that that exists that we can point to

194
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:15,020
that scientists can point to at all

195
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:24,840
so I want to highlight that I'm not saying anything like this doesn't exist that selves don't exist or

196
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:31,940
that's silly of course I exist and of course you exist

197
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:37,980
we're just saying that often when we say that there's a self we're assuming that

198
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:44,219
it has certain qualities that has this core and that everything else happens to it

199
01:12:44,219 --> 01:12:50,760
and I'm saying no it's just a collection of parts in the same way that a waterfall

200
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:58,260
is you know water falling the waterfall is always changing

201
01:12:58,260 --> 01:13:05,100
it's different droplets of water that are going over Landing in different places and the

202
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:12,840
water has a history before it gets to the waterfalls and it goes over the waterfall so a self is kind of like that

203
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:18,659
too all these parts are changing they're

204
01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:24,420
interrelated they're changing but it's they're moving in some kind of way we

205
01:13:24,420 --> 01:13:30,960
might imagine that doesn't mean waterfalls don't exist Niagara Falls if you ever take pictures

206
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:38,640
of them they're beautiful they even make rainbows but there isn't like a solid core

207
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:45,440
substance to them so the self is like this

208
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:51,900
and there's actually something quite fantastic about this because

209
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:57,300
the fact that for a collection of parts

210
01:13:57,300 --> 01:14:02,520
or processes instead of like this

211
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:07,620
stable core that's in the middle not changing

212
01:14:07,620 --> 01:14:13,500
it means that we can develop and cultivate

213
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:20,460
grow change otherwise if there was this stable thing that just gets us experiences attached

214
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:27,659
to we'd be trapped so this is kind of like the freedom

215
01:14:27,659 --> 01:14:34,020
that's available to humans and there's even more freedom when we

216
01:14:34,020 --> 01:14:40,380
really start to understand this deeply because as long as we think that we have

217
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:46,080
this core then we have to protect it

218
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:53,219
we have to Shield it we have to pretend it looks a particular way to everybody else

219
01:14:53,219 --> 01:15:00,300
there's a reason why we often aren't sharing our inner thoughts with other people because we often there's a feeling like

220
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:05,940
oh this inner cores somehow not quite right

221
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:13,080
this is a pervasive feeling that humans have not everybody but a lot of people have

222
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:20,100
so we're trying to hide it so we're creating these narratives these stories

223
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:25,320
that trying to convince everybody yeah I'm fine everything's under control

224
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:32,159
I got it no problem when we might actually be desperately confused or

225
01:15:32,159 --> 01:15:38,760
feeling not like their life is going the way we want it to or something like this Meanwhile

226
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:43,460
we're trying to convince yeah no problem I got it

227
01:15:45,659 --> 01:15:52,380
so we're trying to protect it we're trying to bolster it make sure that it looks good we feel vulnerable if we have

228
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:59,219
this core like we don't want people to maybe even know about it or

229
01:15:59,219 --> 01:16:07,320
to injure it in some kind of way we build walls around it so we don't get

230
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:14,100
close to other people this idea of this Center a central core

231
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:19,920
or Essence source of a lot of duka

232
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:25,159
a lot of Duke a lot of dukkha

233
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:33,480
and as this starts to maybe loosen up and that's maybe we don't feel like we

234
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:40,440
have a core but we only do at certain times and then maybe we can loosen up and feel like there's

235
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:48,140
just a flow of experiences and the more ease we have in our life

236
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:56,000
chances are if you were to think about the best moments of your life it doesn't involve being like

237
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:02,219
contracted and feeling separate from everybody else and feeling like you have to protect yourself or something like

238
01:17:02,219 --> 01:17:09,239
that instead probably the best moments of your life or when there's a sense of flow and connection

239
01:17:09,239 --> 01:17:13,940
with others with nature or whatever it might be

240
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:22,760
so the Buddha is pointing to this that there's the self is just a collection

241
01:17:24,360 --> 01:17:30,659
I'm not going to go into the details of what this collection is maybe maybe I will in a subsequent talk but

242
01:17:30,659 --> 01:17:36,480
I wanted to talk about a little bit how can we go about

243
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:42,920
loosening up or even seeing how it's part of a collection

244
01:17:43,020 --> 01:17:49,860
maybe one thing I'll say is that it's often meditative experiences that can

245
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:55,199
really cause a giant shift but there's lots of

246
01:17:55,199 --> 01:18:02,460
small shifts along the way that we can be doing and practicing with

247
01:18:02,460 --> 01:18:08,580
and this is um from Joseph Goldstein who shares some practices to do in daily

248
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:14,699
life to kind of like support this idea if they're not being a solid core or

249
01:18:14,699 --> 01:18:20,640
Essence and one is and uh I appreciate that Joseph is

250
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:27,300
saying okay this is for daily life so he says for three minutes so somebody only had to do for three minutes

251
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:32,780
is just to listen to The Sounds

252
01:18:37,860 --> 01:18:43,920
in this building sometimes we hear traffic it's from the year my voice we hear

253
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:49,980
people shuffling a little bit maybe your breath it absolutely doesn't matter if you want

254
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:55,920
to do this exercise I'm not going to point to whether it's in a quiet place noisy place it doesn't matter

255
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:02,300
just listen can I open up the awareness

256
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:08,880
hear a sound and then drop in the question

257
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:13,698
what's knowing these sounds

258
01:19:14,699 --> 01:19:24,440
knowing is happening there's sounds and we know that there's sounds but what's what's knowing that sounds

259
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:32,219
let me just do a little investigation is there something inside that knows

260
01:19:32,219 --> 01:19:37,460
is there a nowhere this feels like an odd

261
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:44,940
expression or odd question but we can just look

262
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:50,940
maybe we'll just do this now what is there a nowhere

263
01:19:50,940 --> 01:19:58,460
inside that can like hear these sounds or even know the meaning of these words

264
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:15,920
like what wouldn't how would we even know when nowhere

265
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:23,040
like what is a nowhere so

266
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:29,658
when we investigate we see that there's actually really nothing to find

267
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:39,060
and the trick is to look again and again and again

268
01:20:39,060 --> 01:20:46,380
and again and again to do this exercise when you hear sounds

269
01:20:46,380 --> 01:20:52,260
just a turn what's the knower do it when the mind is quiet when the

270
01:20:52,260 --> 01:20:58,020
mind's agitated and just to investigate

271
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:04,800
it's not it won't be sufficient to do it you know 10 times and say okay there's nothing there I get it now what's next

272
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:10,739
there's something about the looking and not finding repeatedly that has an

273
01:21:10,739 --> 01:21:17,100
impact so that's one thing we can do it's so

274
01:21:17,100 --> 01:21:23,480
this recognition that all that's going on is hearing

275
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:32,840
and the knowing of the sounds there isn't uh this nowhere it's just

276
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:38,760
sounds be known there's no self

277
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:44,640
there's no core there's no essence a second

278
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:49,980
practice that Joseph talks about and he also says you could just do this

279
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:55,980
for three minutes to do this like in daily life and Joseph gives a story

280
01:21:55,980 --> 01:22:01,980
about doing some walking meditation while on retreat

281
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:07,980
and he recognized that when he was walking there's a whole collection of

282
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:14,100
Sensations pressure on the bottom of the feet maybe the feeling of air going

283
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:20,719
across the body or maybe the sense of motion or maybe there's a sense of

284
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:25,860
lightness like we're not stuck and heavy but we're kind of like have this

285
01:22:25,860 --> 01:22:32,000
lightness mobility of it can move so there's a collection of Sensations

286
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:40,199
and then to notice that that they're simply experiencing

287
01:22:40,199 --> 01:22:45,020
Sensations in space

288
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:50,580
the sensations are down there on the bottom of the feet

289
01:22:50,580 --> 01:22:56,900
but there's also maybe Sensations feeling the breeze on the face for the hands

290
01:22:56,940 --> 01:23:02,820
there's also maybe a sensation in the leg as or the legs as the material of

291
01:23:02,820 --> 01:23:09,659
the clues moves against the body so it's a collection of Sensations

292
01:23:09,659 --> 01:23:16,500
there's the mind that creates a narrative and creates the self oh there's a body that's doing this motion

293
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:23,719
that's walking that's true but that actual

294
01:23:23,719 --> 01:23:31,620
experience different than the narrative the actual experience like really the

295
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:38,460
actual Sensations maybe I should use that word it's at the bottom of the feet

296
01:23:38,460 --> 01:23:43,980
maybe on the upper legs maybe on the face

297
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:50,719
but that's not a body that's a collection of Sensations

298
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:57,659
so Joseph Joseph recommends for three minutes do some walking and feel how

299
01:23:57,659 --> 01:24:03,300
there's oh yeah there's just this collection of Sensations as we move

300
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:10,140
it's a little bit extra it's not a little bit it's a lot it's a lot extra but we're so used to doing it we don't

301
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:16,140
notice but it's extra to impute the whole body

302
01:24:16,140 --> 01:24:22,320
that's walking so Joseph highlights to see that

303
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:27,960
actually the body is he has this expression he was um

304
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:34,620
he was called like this fluid energy field I don't know if that resonates for you

305
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:41,100
it might a fluid energy field but that's different than this

306
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:46,620
anatomical body that you could see on an X-ray for example or CAT scan or

307
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:51,780
something like that this just this collection of Sensations

308
01:24:51,780 --> 01:24:57,900
so we might have this idea of the solidity of the body and maybe in some way we might think

309
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:04,500
that oh this is core or the essence because this feels pretty solid

310
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:11,719
but when we move we can start to see it's a collection of Sensations

311
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:19,280
and I maybe want to emphasize that this not self-teaching is really about

312
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:26,580
Sensations phenomena it's so much not about the mind it's

313
01:25:26,580 --> 01:25:35,100
pointing to actually how the mind creates Concepts like the idea of water like we think water but it's not a core

314
01:25:35,100 --> 01:25:42,840
which we attach things water is concept a word that gets assigned to a

315
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:51,320
collection and the body is the same way the body's the same way and the self is the same way

316
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:59,159
and maybe for the and Joseph gives this last uh recommendation for something that we can

317
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:04,560
do to help us see through this idea that we might have that there's a solid core

318
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:10,679
or Essence is that too this often Works a little

319
01:26:10,679 --> 01:26:18,239
bit better when the mind is a little bit quiet but it's not uncommon for us to identify

320
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:27,900
with the thoughts okay maybe I'm not my body okay well maybe I'm not um

321
01:26:27,900 --> 01:26:34,199
I'm I'm not uh the nowhere I'm not even sure where that

322
01:26:34,199 --> 01:26:41,539
is but my thoughts clearly what this inner narrative is that's must be me

323
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:49,560
but when you look the actual experiences again I'm talking

324
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:56,340
really subtle but that what actually is happening

325
01:26:56,340 --> 01:27:01,860
is a lot of thoughts thoughts that come and go come and go

326
01:27:01,860 --> 01:27:10,320
come and go come go come and go all day long it's just a collection of thoughts

327
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:17,340
some thoughts we believe some other thoughts we don't believe some are wispy some get repeated a bazillion times they

328
01:27:17,340 --> 01:27:23,280
are all thoughts and so Joseph talks about just for a

329
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:28,679
while if you can just notice wow wow how many thoughts

330
01:27:28,679 --> 01:27:34,860
we have in a three-minute period can you notice this is so easy often we just get

331
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:40,139
lost in them but to notice how thoughts are arising and passing thoughts even the thoughts

332
01:27:40,139 --> 01:27:46,139
like this is silly why am I doing this you know they're all just thoughts

333
01:27:46,139 --> 01:27:51,800
and they're coming and going so if we think that we are like our internal World well

334
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:56,000
which thought would we be

335
01:27:57,239 --> 01:28:02,820
like we're like only these thoughts but not those thoughts the ones that we like or maybe we're only the thoughts that we

336
01:28:02,820 --> 01:28:10,460
don't like and there isn't a core there isn't an Essence there

337
01:28:11,159 --> 01:28:17,040
so this idea of not self is just pointing to

338
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:23,040
how it's completely appropriate that we use Concepts and labels that we assign

339
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:28,080
to collections of things

340
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:34,260
and this idea of scent the self is a label we use to assign to a collection

341
01:28:34,260 --> 01:28:40,860
of things there isn't this core

342
01:28:40,860 --> 01:28:46,380
always will be with us forever and who knows like next life past life these

343
01:28:46,380 --> 01:28:52,320
types of things and I know somebody's going to ask well wait if there isn't itself what gets

344
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:58,980
reborn this is right right I'm not going to answer that right now it's the you know that it's a perfectly

345
01:28:58,980 --> 01:29:04,320
legitimate question it's a good question right I'm just going to say for here

346
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:12,920
that uh there isn't a self and the way that we think there is

347
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:20,100
there isn't like the ego with the way we think there's there isn't a soul the way we think there is

348
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:27,780
of course there's a self right I'm a self you guys are a self I don't want us to get too tripped up on language so it

349
01:29:27,780 --> 01:29:36,000
would be better if we had another word than self ego or Soul maybe it's a better word

350
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:44,119
even though that doesn't quite match but uh maybe points to the same thing

351
01:29:46,139 --> 01:29:52,679
so this idea of not self when we think about it

352
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:58,800
like I said might be a little bit puzzlement or we might want to dismiss it or it might even bring up some fear

353
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:05,100
or a lot of uncomfortableness I often don't like to teach about this

354
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:12,440
topic because it causes a lot of uncomfortableness I'll just say this

355
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:17,940
but it's one of those teachings that the idea of it seems really weird or

356
01:30:17,940 --> 01:30:25,760
uncomfortable the experience of it which usually happens in a meditative State some deep

357
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:31,739
this deep recognition is beautiful

358
01:30:31,739 --> 01:30:37,320
and it turns out to be like one of the biggest relief

359
01:30:37,320 --> 01:30:44,340
oh I didn't even know that I was like carrying this burden this idea of a self

360
01:30:44,340 --> 01:30:49,800
that I have to protect and make everybody like and you know all

361
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:55,739
this stuff so the experience is different than our

362
01:30:55,739 --> 01:31:01,460
ideas about it maybe that's a fundamental teaching here

363
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:10,040
so with that I'll uh open it up for some questions or comments are there some

364
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:13,638
questions

365
01:31:29,880 --> 01:31:36,440
all right nobody has a self we don't have questions

366
01:31:37,980 --> 01:31:45,739
that's fine with nobody has you don't have to ask questions assistant provide an opportunity

367
01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:57,300
there's a way of been thinking about this um can you hold this a little bit closer so we can and to go like this yeah there

368
01:31:57,300 --> 01:32:03,179
you go thank you I am uh I'm a craniosacral practitioner which is

369
01:32:03,179 --> 01:32:10,940
a very subtle gentle type of Bodywork and I notice

370
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:17,760
when practitioners talk about what happens in the physiology and the

371
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:24,239
it comes out of osteopathy so it's got its whole has a particular Paradigm in languaging

372
01:32:24,239 --> 01:32:29,460
around it but I notice when practitioners are

373
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:37,080
talking about what happens in the physiology and what we're doing and the issue of self as a practitioner

374
01:32:37,080 --> 01:32:42,239
really becomes a problem because it's really it's a type of work that's like a

375
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:47,580
non-doing it's being very present with somebody and you're not you're not doing

376
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:53,880
something you're attending to um you're tracking you have awareness

377
01:32:53,880 --> 01:33:00,659
but it's very important that it's a non-m manipulative intent it's not an intent to alter somebody

378
01:33:00,659 --> 01:33:07,080
and so I have been noticing how practitioners have a real challenge around how to

379
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:12,540
language that and I really feel like it's that self no I always think oh this

380
01:33:12,540 --> 01:33:18,480
is so very Buddhist and it's I mean it's real it's how it is it's just the truth that

381
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:25,800
they're trying to get at and they often end up going towards a spiritual language and then it becomes like a God

382
01:33:25,800 --> 01:33:33,780
thing right so um it's just something I've been rolling around in my mind about this in terms of

383
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:40,679
actually the experience that they're pointing to is not self that there is physiology there is

384
01:33:40,679 --> 01:33:46,040
phenomena there is awareness there is a tending to

385
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:52,980
there is not manipulating there is not controlling there's not fixing there is not

386
01:33:52,980 --> 01:33:58,139
remediating you know so um

387
01:33:58,139 --> 01:34:05,340
just for myself as a practitioner has been sort of playing with you know like oh I wonder how that could be

388
01:34:05,340 --> 01:34:11,880
you know it could be articulated it really to me it really comes to what we talk about in Buddhism as not self

389
01:34:11,880 --> 01:34:17,340
but that's outside of the paradigm that it's operating in right you know they're

390
01:34:17,340 --> 01:34:23,100
trying to they're trying to quantify that experience which is real you know

391
01:34:23,100 --> 01:34:29,520
um they're getting into that essential experience but they lack the language because it's not Buddhist actually you

392
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:37,380
know so this is so they also have the idea that there isn't this core or that's what that's what I feel is trying

393
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:42,780
to be articulated because that's a real and true experience when you get into

394
01:34:42,780 --> 01:34:48,540
that that actually there's nothing there's not a self there's just being present with there's attending there's

395
01:34:48,540 --> 01:34:55,199
experience there's phenomenal um and I think you're pointing to something that's when we when there is

396
01:34:55,199 --> 01:35:00,719
like a Core Essence then we often feel like we have to fix it or we have to

397
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:07,920
manipulate it or to people I don't know it gets yeah there's definitely this sense comes in yes thank you thank you

398
01:35:07,920 --> 01:35:14,639
yes but then when you relinquish all that to just attend to in fact how do you describe it right

399
01:35:14,639 --> 01:35:20,820
what are you doing yeah you know so

400
01:35:20,820 --> 01:35:27,120
um yeah it's something I've been rolling around like huh how could this be articulated and in Buddhism we know how

401
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:32,699
to articulate that we recognize that as not self but that's outside of the

402
01:35:32,699 --> 01:35:37,760
Paradigm of this thank you thank you

403
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:46,139
okay Okay so thank you all for your attention

404
01:35:46,139 --> 01:35:52,099
and I wish you all a wonderful rest of the evening thank you

405
01:35:54,659 --> 01:36:01,880
and if you'd like you can come up and talk to me afterwards otherwise I wish you a safe travels home
