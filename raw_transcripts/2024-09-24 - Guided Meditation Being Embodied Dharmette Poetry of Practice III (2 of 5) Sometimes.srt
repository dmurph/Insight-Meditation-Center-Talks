18
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,760
we kick off our time together this morning

19
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:02,519
everybody good morning it's uh nice to be with you all to practice

20
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,920
together I'm continuing the series on what I'm calling the Poetry of practice

21
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,319
this is the third week I've done this I've done it uh two other times and I

22
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:21,320
think it was in 2023 when I've done it so it's been a while since I've done poetry of practice and just bringing

23
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:28,600
poetry into practice into our meditation practice and I'd like to start this

24
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,280
morning I'm just going to read this uh quote from uh David White who's a

25
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,280
well-known poet and um before I guide us into some

26
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,800
meditation so David White he's writing on the poetic

27
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,759
imagination this expression he's using this poetic imagination and writing

28
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,199
poetry and for me it feels like oh he's pointing to a meditation practice and

29
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,039
David White he has said that he has a Zen practice hasn't he doesn't necessarily identify as a Zen Buddhist

30
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:10,520
but that he has been practicing Zen for uh quite a few years maybe even

31
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:17,600
decades so this is a quote from David white one of the great First Steps in

32
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,600
writing poetry is to stop the surface conversation you're having

33
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,759
now the peripheral conversation you're having the conversation where you are in

34
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:34,360
competition or you feel besieged where you feel

35
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:42,840
fragmented and drop down into a central image or tonality in the body or in your

36
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,919
understanding that can hold a whole constellation of individual qualities

37
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:55,160
together qualities that circulate around you at the edge of your ordinary

38
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:00,759
everyday life this is called the poetic imagination

39
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:06,560
I love that he's talking about stopping the conversation that you're having some of the we could think about this as like

40
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,319
the chatter the thinking all this stuff that happens in the mind conversations with ourselves

41
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:20,440
imaginary conversations with other people but maybe just the way that the mind is speaking quote

42
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,479
unquote so he's putting down like to put down the story making and this chatter

43
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:33,080
and maybe the everyday way in which our likes to do things and instead to be

44
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:40,560
embodied to be present here so I'll lead us in some guided

45
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,880
meditation and then I'm going to drop in a poem from David White and we'll unpack

46
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:54,280
it and explore this poem a little bit uh after the guided meditation so if you haven't

47
00:06:54,280 --> 00:07:02,840
already take an upright posture a posture that expresses

48
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:06,639
your intention to

49
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,330
meditate it be nice to have some

50
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:24,319
[Music] exhales help the arriving process

51
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,759
help us to get collected

52
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,960
around this bodily experience this

53
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:53,240
moment so that we can inhabit this moment inhabit Our Lives

54
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:11,080
feeling the pressure against the body pressure from the sitting

55
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:26,560
surface feeling connected grounded where here having this

56
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:34,399
experience ordinary everyday experience and can

57
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:40,839
that be okay and you be in a body that's just

58
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:48,360
having an ordinary mundane experience uh being in a meditation

59
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,360
posture

60
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:29,680
of a b body scan starting at the top

61
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:38,399
feeling into any area that feels like it wants to be felt

62
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:52,440
into areas that have tightness or tension often around the eyes or jaw

63
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:10,000
shoulders letting them be away from the

64
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:19,279
ears maybe there's a way in which the shoulders move back just a tiny bit that

65
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:26,720
allows the chest to open allows the chest to be a little bit

66
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,120
less shielded guarded more

67
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,040
spacious very small

68
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,959
movement feeling the other side of the chest the upper

69
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:11,440
back there be ease softness

70
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,040
there and the lower back

71
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:44,000
can we send some love and care to our lower back as

72
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,440
humans sometimes have issues

73
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,839
there the belly allowing it to be

74
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:27,519
soft and it be unguarded relaxed just for this meditation period

75
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,639
and again feeling the pressure of this sitting surface against the body the

76
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:00,160
buttock back of the legs

77
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,279
repeat and we be embodied with an attitude of kindness

78
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:32,680
and

79
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:42,880
warmth resisting any feeling of wanting to complain

80
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,199
or fix the

81
00:13:52,399 --> 00:14:00,000
body can we inhabit our physical forms with

82
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,360
appreciation

83
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:53,079
as we inhabit the body we notice the body breathes

84
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,880
can we rest attention on the sensations of

85
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:14,240
breathing feeling whatever there is to be f with

86
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,240
inhales

87
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,800
and exhales what do an exhale feel what's

88
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,079
the experience of

89
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,959
exhaling e

90
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:57,839
resting knowing that the body knows how to breathe

91
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,000
we don't have to do

92
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,280
anything to breathe or just noticing the experience

93
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,520
of

94
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
breathing

95

107
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,210
going to drop in a [Music]

108
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:13,320
pem you don't need to do anything with this

109
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:22,799
poem you don't have to understand it you don't have to figure it

110
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:31,679
out you don't have to remember it and you certainly don't don't need to Google

111
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,159
it and you just experience

112
00:24:55,159 --> 00:25:02,760
it this poem is called sometimes by David

113
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,840
White sometimes by David

114
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:13,360
White and it goes like

115
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:22,640
this sometimes if you move carefully through the forest breathing like the ones in the

116
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:30,320
old stories who could cross a shimmering bed of leaves without a sound

117
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:37,919
you come to a place whose only task is to trouble you

118
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,440
with tiny but frightening

119
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:51,960
requests conceived out of nowhere but in this place beginning to lead

120
00:25:52,399 --> 00:26:00,520
everywhere request to stop what you are doing right now and to stop what you are becoming

121
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:08,240
while you do it questions that can make or unmake a

122
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:18,919
life questions that have patiently waited for you questions that have no right to go

123
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
away

124
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,240

White sometimes if you move carefully through the forest breathing

127
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:05,200
like the ones in the old stories who could cross a shimmering bed of leaves

128
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:11,919
without a [Music] sound you come to a place whose only

129
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:18,559
task is to trouble you with tiny but frightening

130

welcome good morning greetings hello those of us those of you who are

146
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:38,799
joining at this time after the guided meditation the guide meditation I

147
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:44,960
dropped in this poem called sometimes by David White and uh David White he has

148
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,760
spoken about this poem in a number of uh different settings and like you know some poets who never talk about their

149
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,120
poems and they just kind of like offer them out to the world and let the world

150
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:03,799
interpret them however they'd like and and David White in this poem

151
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:09,679
he's spoken about in some rather large forums I would say that is uh with Sam

152
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:15,839
Harris on a podcast and with Oprah so these are like two big uh forums so

153
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:22,760
where he's uh discussed this maybe um I'll say this poem a

154
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,480
little bit and then I want to share some things that uh David White has uh shared

155
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:36,118
about this poem it's called sometimes by David

156
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:42,320
White sometimes if you move carefully through the forest breathing like the

157
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:51,280
ones in the old stories who could cross a shimmering bed of leaves without a sound you come to a

158
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,520
place whose only task is to trouble you

159
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:05,280
with tiny but frightening requests conceived out of nowhere but in

160
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:12,640
this place beginning to lead everywhere request to stop what you are

161
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,240
doing right now and to stop what you are becoming while you do

162
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,400
it questions that can make or unmake a

163
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:30,320
life questions that have patiently waited for you you questions that have

164
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:37,839
no right to go away so David White talks about this

165
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:44,200
very last expression questions that have no right to go

166
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:50,200
away and uh he expresses them saying that these are um questions that have to

167
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:57,760
do with the person we are about to become and he's uh writes that they are

168
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:02,880
conversations that will happen with or without our conscious participation but

169
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:10,079
they have something to do with how we might be more generous more courageous more present

170
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:18,240
more dedicated so he's talking about these questions that um maybe and I like that

171
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:24,599
that he's using this word conversations there's this way in which you we're often having conversations with

172
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:30,839
ourselves conversations with our environment with our experiences without maybe necessarily

173
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:38,720
talk using that expression conversations but there's a way in which the thinking mind is like you know engaging with and

174
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:45,880
interacting with uh itself our experiences and uh the environment out

175
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:53,640
there and I kind of like this uh word uh conversations as a as a way to express

176
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:58,880
that and so he's talking about this um

177
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:05,680
potential that these questions that have to do with the person we are about to

178
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,800
become so he's talking about like being embodied and being present for our lives

179
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:18,200
and being present for what's happening and taking note of maybe about

180
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:24,880
to become in Buddhist language we might say like what are we uh identified

181
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,960
with or it could also be you know what is uh can we be present for what's

182
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:37,280
simply unfolding here I'm opening my hands we're identified often as like grabbing onto something or uh what

183
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,680
what's uh what's unfolding what's naturally

184
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:49,760
happening so in response to this uh expression like what questions that have

185
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:58,920
no right to go away David White he offers a number of questions specifically and I'd like to um

186
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:07,319
offer just a tiny tiny subset I think he gave a list of 10 I think I'll do two this

187
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:14,720
morning one question he offers is that we can have with ourselves and that might arise uh as a result of maybe

188
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:20,680
being embodied my interpretation of what he's pointing to in his poem one

189
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:29,240
question is what can I be wholehearted about what can I be whole wholehearted

190
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:36,640
about have this expression wholehearted like you know like bringing in the fragments bringing in the different

191
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,520
pieces and instead just to what is something that feels like all of myself

192
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:50,599
can be present for all of myself can be collected around or something like

193
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:58,680
this and David White writes what do I care most about in my location in my

194
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:05,880
family life in my heart and mind he continues this is a conversation

195
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,040
we all must have with ourselves at every stage of Our Lives a conversation we so

196
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:18,160
often don't want to have we'll get to it we say when the

197
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:24,800
kids are grown when there is enough money in the bank when we are retired perhaps when we are dead it'll be easier

198
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:32,359
then but we need to ask it now what can I be wholehearted about

199
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:39,160
now I love this like so often we find ourselves spending our time our energy

200
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:44,920
doing things that we think that we're supposed to be doing showing up in a way that we think we're supposed to but like

201
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:52,759
what is it that um like all aspects of ourselves can get collected

202
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,359
behind instead of like a way in which we are often uh

203
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:03,560
um pushing them to a side or ignoring them or thinking like okay I'll get to

204
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:10,280
that later I'll be completely myself uh be with all different aspects of myself

205
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:16,240
sometime later I appreciate that he's writing

206
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:23,160
this is a conversation that we all must have with ourselves at every stage of Our Lives a conversation that we so

207
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:29,680
often don't want to have and I know that uh when I was a scientist all those

208
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:38,200
years training to be a scientist and then all those years actually being a scientist in some ways there um I now

209
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:44,240
you know retrospectively I can look back and say there was this place which I love science I still love science so

210
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,319
much and biochemistry some of you might know I'm a PhD biochemist I love

211
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:54,520
biochemistry I still do but there was a way in which also I

212
00:40:54,520 --> 00:41:01,760
was ignoring kind of like you know my inner life and ignoring what was or trying to at least ignore certain

213
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,760
aspects of myself just as I was pursuing um science

214
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:14,520
biochemistry so is this a conversation that what can I be wholehearted

215
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:24,400
about and then um another question that David White offers he WR here's the question can I

216
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,359
be the Blessed saint that my future happiness will always

217
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:36,800
remember can I be the Blessed saint that my future happiness will always remember

218
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:44,440
and then this is David White writing here's the explanation for what sounds like a strange question and this is

219
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:52,079
David White I have a poem called Coleman's bed about a place in the west of Ireland where the Irish Saint Coleman

220
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:58,000
lived the last line of that poem calls on the reader to remember quote the

221
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,359
quiet robust and blessed saint that your future happiness will always remember so

222
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:10,160
I love that day by po right he's kind of like tying together like one poem with another poem and you know he's like

223
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:17,280
having conversations with himself and the poems are having conversation conversations with each

224
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:22,880
other so David White he continues we go to places of pilgrimage where Saints

225
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,079
have lived or even to Graceland where Elvis lived

226
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:36,079
I love to kind of throwing in Elvis there because these people have given to the rest of us music or good works that

227
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:41,440
has carried on down the years and that was a generous gift to the

228
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,680
future but that blessed Saint could also be

229
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:54,960
yourself the person who In This Moment makes a decision that can make a bold

230
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:01,160
path into the years that come and whom your future happiness would

231
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:07,720
always remember what could you do now for yourself or others that your future self

232
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:14,920
would look back on and congratulate you for something that could view with real thankfulness because the decision you

233
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:21,160
made opened up the life for which it is now eternally

234
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:26,599
grateful so David White is pointing to what can we do now that helps creates

235
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:32,319
the condition s that there can in the unfolding of our life there can be more and more peace

236
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:37,720
and happiness and greater ease and I'll use this word

237
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:44,520
Freedom what can we do now that in the future we will think oh yeah that was

238
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:50,880
that was helpful I'd like to offer of course that having a meditation practice is a part

239
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:59,240
of that having a meditation practice in which we give ourselves the opportunity and the space to ask these questions and

240
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:06,720
to um become sensitive to our lives to embody our lives and to be able to feel

241
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,920
into what is it that we can be wholehearted about what is it that will

242
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:21,280
help create the conditions we can have a future that is a future that

243
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:28,920
um has the great uh spaciousness and ease and peace and love and kindness or

244
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:36,200
whatever it is for you that's meaningful wisdom compassion

245
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:43,319
Freedom this is part of the beauty of this practice we get to choose which words we get to choose which uh what's

246
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:48,800
the most meaningful for us but what can you get wholehearted

247
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:55,480
around what can you do today that supports a

248
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,880
future that's filled with happiness we don't know what the future

249
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:08,960
holds of course not but can we this is what I'd like to offer can we create the

250
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:15,200
sensibility the skills of that whatever the future holds

251
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:23,160
we can hold it with love kindness compassion

252
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:28,680
wisdom no matter what the future brings us

253
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:35,839
so I'll end with saying one more time this

254
00:45:36,119 --> 00:45:43,240
poem sometimes by David way sometimes if you move carefully

255
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:51,000
through the forest breathing like the ones in the old stories who could cross a shimmering bed

256
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:57,079
of leaves without a sound you come to a place whose only t

257
00:45:57,079 --> 00:46:02,200
ask is to trouble you with tiny but

258
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:07,359
frightening requests conceived out of nowhere but in

259
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:12,440
this place beginning to lead

260
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:17,520
everywhere requests to stop what you are doing right now and to stop what you are

261
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:26,040
becoming while you do it questions that can make or unmake a life questions that

262
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:34,039
have patient ly waited for you questions that have no right to go

263
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,559
away thank you thank you for your practice it's

264
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:46,319
lovely to practice together and maybe join me in this exploration of the

265
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:54,000
Poetry of practice wishing you all a wonderful rest of your day or rest of your evening

266
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:01,040
or whenever it is that you're listening to this thank you
