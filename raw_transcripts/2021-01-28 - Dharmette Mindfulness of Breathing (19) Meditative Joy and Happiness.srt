1
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,320
so a

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,480
couple of words kind of to end this

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,759
meditation

4
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,200
before switching to the talk

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,600
because of the nature of these 16 steps

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,720
of anapanasati

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,800
you know there's more to teach as we go

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,560
along and

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,960
so maybe i'll be talking more guiding

10
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,560
more in meditation than

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,960
maybe than usual and

12
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,880
and what you might want to do and

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,200
consider

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,000
is to if it works for your life

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,120
is to meditate a second time during the

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,320
day

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,559
even if it's just 10 minutes 15 minutes

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,879
or another half an hour

19
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,399
and perhaps having a little more

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,600
practice with what we're doing in this

21
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,440
guided meditation

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,520
and or build with it or allow for more

23
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,440
of it to kind of percolate and develop

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,559
and

25
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,400
and then it might you might find that it

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,000
supports you more when you come so you

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,720
have

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,600
back to the guided meditation and also

29
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,159
you might

30
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,320
appreciate the time to have more silence

31
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:27,840
to explore this on your own

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,280
so continuing on the 16 steps of

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,600
breathing meditation that the buddha

34
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,880
taught

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,600
that does come from a variety of places

36
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,320
in the

37
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,439
discourses of the buddha the most common

38
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:45,840
one

39
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,359
place is a text called

40
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,360
discourse on mindfulness of breathing

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,280
and it's um in the what's a collection

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,399
called the middle length discourses

43
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,159
and there's been a variety of books that

44
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,640
are you know complex

45
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,200
explaining this or describing this the

46
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,160
descriptions are

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,080
16 steps are really just like cliff

48
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,800
notes just like brief sentences

49
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,680
and different meditation teachers will

50
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,040
have a little different take or

51
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,959
explanation of how these work or what

52
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,040
they are and which is appropriate

53
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,800
there's many techniques and

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,239
they're like you know these are just

55
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,280
kind of little placeholders for a whole

56
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,160
universe of

57
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,920
experience so we're coming into the

58
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,400
fifth

59
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,000
and sixth step of anapanasati

60
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,040
and it's the fifth one says

61
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,640
one trains in other words one practices

62
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
one like one practices the alphabet to

63
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,760
really learn it

64
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,879
one does it over and over again

65
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,120
one trains to

66
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,319
trains that as one is breathing in

67
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,680
one experiences

68
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,159
joy as one breathes one trains that as

69
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,120
one breathes out

70
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,480
one experiences joy and then this the

71
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:14,959
sixth

72
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,400
the sixth one is as breathing in

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,920
one experiences happiness

74
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,239
breathing out one experiences happiness

75
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,720
and um the um

76
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,560
so these words for joy and happiness

77
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,120
some people will translate uh like the

78
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,120
famous translator bekabodi which has

79
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,720
translated as a rapture

80
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,599
for joy and what i translate as

81
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,879
happiness he translates as pleasure

82
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,159
and and the difference between these two

83
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,120
is that uh whatever this uh the joy

84
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,720
factor is or

85
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,560
um is it's a it's something that's a

86
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,040
little bit energizing it's a little bit

87
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,159
it can be quite strong

88
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,120
but it's something that's a little bit

89
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,599
more

90
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,280
like a thrill in the body a delight

91
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,280
it's a flow of energy or flow of

92
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,319
pleasure

93
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,280
in the body that is kind of uplifting

94
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,120
and delightful and

95
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,560
and just has a lightening feeling

96
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,519
and and then the the next one that what

97
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,520
i call happiness

98
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,800
he calls pleasure is uh when the

99
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,720
energy energetics of joy quiet down

100
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,919
that that the pleasure of the joy the

101
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,320
happiness of the joy

102
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,479
remains something more subtle than

103
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:39,360
something has more

104
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,880
sense of contentment some people

105
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,840
um get quite attached to the energetics

106
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,800
of joy and

107
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
sometimes this feeling of ecstasy and

108
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,639
rapture and very strong

109
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,479
can course through our body wave

110
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,199
cascading waves of joy and

111
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,080
it's quite and it can be quite intense

112
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,000
and

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,759
but sooner or later people get a little

114
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,680
tired of the energetics of it

115
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,479
and then the energy the energetics the

116
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,000
upwelling energy of it

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,280
begins to settle and quiet

118
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,680
and now there's kind of a state shift

119
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,600
and and that uh

120
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,639
and uh and in retrospect we see that the

121
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:19,199
joy

122
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,280
has a kind of mental quality mental

123
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,039
energetics of it

124
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,960
that it settles and then we're more

125
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
subtle in the body

126
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,680
and then a more feeling of contentment

127
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,479
in the body

128
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,520
of well-being in the body tranquility in

129
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,520
the body

130
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,680
that for me feels like a very sublime

131
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,639
kind of

132
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,240
happiness but because it's more physical

133
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,160
some translators like to translate it as

134
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,520
pleasure

135
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,639
and because it doesn't have the mental

136
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,160
energy of it of it as well

137
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,360
and and so

138
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,800
uh and the operating word

139
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,000
verb is is one experiences

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,639
uh you could just as well translate the

141
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,720
pali language word here

142
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,840
as one feels when it allows when someone

143
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,800
really feels

144
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,199
what it's there elsewhere the buddha

145
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,759
says when this kind of pleasure or joy

146
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,479
begins to surface when it's allowed to

147
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,840
feel it in such a way

148
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,160
that one allows it to spread through the

149
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,759
body

150
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,520
and as i said yesterday the buddha said

151
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,400
this kind of pleasure or joy

152
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,560
is is not to be feared

153
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,000
and as not to be kind of dismissed or

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,759
belittled it's actually quite a healthy

155
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,360
thing to experience it

156
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,280
some people when they feel it finds very

157
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,479
healing

158
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,080
and it creates a context in the body and

159
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,120
the heart

160
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,240
in order to better kind of be present

161
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,120
for what is difficult it's not a denial

162
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,440
of what's difficult and painful in our

163
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,560
lives or

164
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,960
difficult emotions and what's happening

165
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,639
in the world around us

166
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,680
but it's easier to be present for it

167
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,680
with uh without uh falling victim of it

168
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,720
or being

169
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,199
oppressed by it or being you know

170
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,639
suffering ourselves

171
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,039
even more by it or feeling self-pity

172
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,560
but because we have this goodness we

173
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,840
have this joy happiness well-being

174
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,280
in which to hold um the challenges of

175
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,840
our lives

176
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,319
so um so uh there's something about

177
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,199
so this joy this well-being that comes

178
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,319
in this step

179
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,120
it comes a lot from really being uh

180
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,400
starting to be absorbed

181
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,000
or really intimate and continuous

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,039
with the experience of breathing it also

183
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,960
comes when there's more sense of

184
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,120
uh a wholeness everything is included

185
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,000
is being held at bay and so the earlier

186
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,720
steps

187
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,400
the steps of the body has to do with

188
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,960
really feeling the body and relaxing the

189
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,840
body

190
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,680
when the body is tense the body is in a

191
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,360
certain way not whole

192
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,960
so we're kind of cut off from parts of

193
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,639
it this kind of way

194
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,520
but as we feel the body and relax the

195
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,120
body there's feeling of wholeness of

196
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,039
gathering together

197
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,800
and that gathering together and becoming

198
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,680
whole is what contributes

199
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,240
to the joy arising it's kind of like

200
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,680
we're creating the channels we're

201
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,879
creating the

202
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,080
the openings for this well-being to be

203
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,680
there

204
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,279
that can come when we start becoming

205
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,120
really uh

206
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,839
um intimate or connected or continuous

207
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,959
in the attention and so the awareness

208
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,399
itself

209
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,360
gets gathered together to really be in

210
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,880
the present moment

211
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,519
with the breathing as opposed to the

212
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,279
thoughts jumping around here and there

213
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,120
and about what's for dinner and what i'm

214
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,959
doing tomorrow and what i did yesterday

215
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,480
or something

216
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,360
the the mind begins to the wholeness the

217
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,320
mind also begins to gather around

218
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,240
just this experience here the mind

219
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,519
itself now

220
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,480
centers itself on the experience of the

221
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,320
body just breathing

222
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,120
and this i this centering itself in the

223
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,959
body breathing

224
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,160
has the joy or the delight of we know

225
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,040
the the problems of our life the

226
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,240
preoccupations the agitations the

227
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,080
anxieties that are

228
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,959
um that are fed by thoughts and

229
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,640
perpetuate by thoughts

230
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,000
begin to quiet down and so just that is

231
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,959
a relief

232
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,880
to have and then we uh and then this

233
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,920
the combination of the

234
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,320
the mind's intimacy the awareness is

235
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
intimacy with the whole experience of

236
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,959
breathing in

237
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,160
and the wholeness of the body then it

238
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,760
tends to

239
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,640
start producing from the inside out a

240
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,760
sense of

241
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,320
goodness which is my kind of generic

242
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,360
name for a whole

243
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,279
whole class of things family of things

244
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,200
we might feel

245
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,920
joy delight satisfaction contentment

246
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,120
pleasure that

247
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,320
thrill wonderful feelings that come

248
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,120
and and they don't they come back for no

249
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,640
good reason

250
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,320
for what's outside in the world nothing

251
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,640
has to be better in the world in our

252
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,440
you know it just comes because of this

253
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,040
really this intimacy and gathering

254
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,880
together this harmony

255
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,240
harmonizing of our whole being that

256
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,320
can come when we're really present here

257
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,880
so the first four steps of anapanasati

258
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,480
which can take a long time to kind of

259
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,519
really do and have a lot to do with

260
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,839
really finding ourselves really present

261
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,200
here

262
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,240
in a whole way in an embodied way in an

263
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,920
inclusive way

264
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,240
so it's not a narrow tight little

265
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,519
concentration

266
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,959
but rather a centering on

267
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,560
everything's included and everything is

268
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,920
centered so the image i have for it is

269
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,839
a big bowl that if you take a

270
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,320
a marble and drop it into this big bowl

271
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,040
it'll go up and down and around and if

272
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,680
you

273
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,760
dip lean into the bowl and push the

274
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,120
marble

275
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,800
you can just keep it going it just keeps

276
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,680
spinning forever if you keep pushing it

277
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,959
but if we stop pushing it slowly slowly

278
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,000
it'll come to center at the bottom of

279
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,360
the bowl

280
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,640
with the whole bowl is there but

281
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,680
it's center it's resting at the center

282
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,680
so the same thing with our attention our

283
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,880
thoughts our

284
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,680
awareness that we keep spinning it uh

285
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,399
pushing the marbles in our mind with our

286
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,160
thoughts with our involvement with our

287
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,639
interest with our reactivity to things

288
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,160
and the mind just the thinking mind just

289
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,279
spins and goes and gets distracted

290
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,760
but as we leave it alone then

291
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,600
everything begins to settle gather

292
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,839
together and we support it with our

293
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,760
practice of intimacy and getting close

294
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,000
to

295
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,120
breathing and and

296
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,880
and then with time we find we get

297
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,440
centered at the bottom of the bowl

298
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,320
centered on the breathing and this can

299
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,839
starts becoming a very pleasant

300
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,639
experience

301
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,760
and uh very enjoyable and if

302
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,320
this uh the the joy factors begin

303
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,560
bubbling up within

304
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,600
and the buddha's description of this

305
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,720
is i think i said it recently is that of

306
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,240
an underwater spring

307
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,079
flowing up into a lake

308
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,240
and it just flows up from the inside and

309
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,600
spreads out

310
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,639
and so with a for example sometimes you

311
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,880
can feel that with the inhale

312
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,920
it's almost like there's an underwater

313
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,360
spring under deep in her torso

314
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,240
right down near the base of our body or

315
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,959
uh

316
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,160
base of our chest or something and

317
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,880
as we breathe in there's an upwelling

318
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,160
feeling

319
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,959
of this and then as we exhale perhaps

320
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,880
there's a feeling of it flowing all back

321
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,079
down again

322
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,639
and flowing out because flow and flow

323
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,440
happening

324
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,600
of this pleasure this energetics this

325
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,760
lightness

326
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,399
they can be quite subtle when it begins

327
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,440
happening

328
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,279
and it's good to recognize it and

329
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,880
realize oh this is actually a good thing

330
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,440
to pay attention to

331
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,360
don't look for it when it's not there

332
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,279
don't try to manufacture it

333
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,160
and don't feel like you have to have it

334
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,120
this fifth step

335
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,240
and sixth step of anapanasati

336
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,160
it's you know only only sometimes it

337
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,760
begins to come happening

338
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,320
the core practices the first four and

339
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,560
this is so beneficial just to stay in

340
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,399
the first four for a long time

341
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,079
in a sense the longer we stay with the

342
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,880
four the stronger foundation we

343
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,440
allow ourselves to have for what follows

344
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,760
but uh unless you learn about this

345
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,720
potential for

346
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,639
joy and pleasure as part of the

347
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,480
meditation practice

348
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,600
then you might not appreciate it when it

349
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,360
happens you might not recognize it when

350
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,320
it happens

351
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,680
and then you won't kind of include that

352
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,279
or become whole with that let that

353
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,959
spread and open and

354
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,160
receive it through your body and all

355
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,639
this requires some modicum of a quiet

356
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,839
mind

357
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,519
it doesn't have to be completely quiet

358
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:34,800
there can be some thoughts in the

359
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,160
background or

360
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,240
light thoughts so don't be at war with

361
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,519
your thoughts and think you have to not

362
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,800
think at all

363
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,160
that just produces tension but

364
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,720
there is a quieting that happens as we

365
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,880
practice

366
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,040
so

367
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,680
mindfulness of breathing and

368
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,519
i hope that you'll have some

369
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,040
opportunities through the day and

370
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,639
through meditation

371
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,560
to appreciate and value and enjoy

372
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:12,480
your self-breathing thank you very much
