1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,280
so good evening

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,600
here the last

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,279
monday

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,719
evening year of the year

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,480
and uh

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,040
one announcement is that for the next

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,560
two mondays we won't meet here at imc

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,560
so we'll start hopefully start again on

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,240
the 16th of january

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,599
and it just felt like it was uh

11
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,359
the wise thing to do to be a little

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,039
cautious during this time we don't know

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,640
what's happening with the omicron and

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,880
and

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,120
there's some theory that it might peak

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,640
in about two weeks so i don't know if

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,280
it's the right time to open then but

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,520
we'll have a little bit more sense so

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,360
yeah you can look on the website and see

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,239
if it's open then on there

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,079
and i think this i think will be the

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,600
17th of uh january

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,920
and uh

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,800
and we might require everyone to be um

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,720
fully vaccinated this time you might

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
meet the boosted as well so you might

27
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,560
have to resubmit your vaccination card

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,159
and uh i think it's just uh

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,920
who knows how necessary all these things

30
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,600
are but hopefully it's good for everyone

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,360
to know that we're being as cautious as

32
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,400
we

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,960
it's as cautious as we can be and try to

34
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,000
make everybody safe for everyone

35
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,200
and

36
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,920
so i find it

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,280
rather

38
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,520
amusing

39
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,799
that

40
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,280
the english word for the current last

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,920
month of the year

42
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,799
they say it's the 12th month right

43
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,600
and

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,520
but the word december comes from the

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,880
latin word that means ten

46
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,399
it's tenth month

47
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,320
so if you know latin it must be very

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,320
confusing

49
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,159
and

50
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,840
november

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,160
means ninth in latin october means 8th

52
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,120
september is 7th

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,599
and so

54
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,840
you know we're marking

55
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,440
a little bit confused in the english

56
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,200
language about

57
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,560
what we're actually

58
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,520
commemorating here

59
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,640
and uh

60
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,840
and we just passed this the

61
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,040
the

62
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,959
solstice

63
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,680
which is kind of a

64
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,040
kind of a real event in terms of

65
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,799
the planets and the sun and everything

66
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,800
but

67
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,120
this new year's eve that we celebrate

68
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,920
this break with this transition from one

69
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,239
year to the next

70
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,440
it's not a thing that really exists

71
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,040
i mean it's not like it doesn't mark

72
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,319
anything that's

73
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,319
unique

74
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,680
that happens in the stars the sun the

75
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,000
earth

76
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,480
it's just a kind of arbitrary day that

77
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,440
somehow was used to mark the end of

78
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,280
an arbitrary

79
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,599
year

80
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,599
where we're confused about the names of

81
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,159
the months

82
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,080
and nothing really will change between

83
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,000
you know you know in uh

84
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,239
from the 34th of december to the 1st of

85
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,200
january except the clocks that somehow

86
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
and the computers and all this will mark

87
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,239
the time is being changed but

88
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,720
in the in the non-human world there's

89
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,599
nothing really that happens

90
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,599
of any particularly

91
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,640
import as far as i know

92
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,239
and even when you know

93
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,480
we were fortunate to live in

94
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,239
i think we're fortunate to live in this

95
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,040
bay area which is so cosmopolitan and

96
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,480
cultures and people from all over the

97
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,159
world

98
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,000
and you can kind of go around different

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,840
weeks in the bay area and celebrate

100
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,840
different new years

101
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,599
different cultures societies celebrate

102
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,400
new years at different times

103
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,560
some other have some market by the lunar

104
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,959
lunar calendar not the solar calendar

105
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,560
so i like this thing about reflecting on

106
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,600
new year's eve this way

107
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,360
is that

108
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,840
we see that it's a convention

109
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,600
it's just it's a

110
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,800
construct of the human mind

111
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,880
some people who made up this

112
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,800
calendar and we live by it

113
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,880
and

114
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,759
but

115
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,759
but i don't want to dismiss it because

116
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,720
the construct is a convention

117
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,720
but the conventions and constructs that

118
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,840
we have we have so we can share our life

119
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,240
together

120
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,680
they've been they're kind of or they're

121
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,320
made by people so that they can kind of

122
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,080
support each other or kind of be on the

123
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,039
same page the same year and the same

124
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,800
kind of communication together in a

125
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,440
certain way

126
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,479
and

127
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,080
and if we share some of the same

128
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,520
conventions

129
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,720
the conventions link us

130
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,080
they make a connection between us

131
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,680
and so

132
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,199
i don't know how many of you might stay

133
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,400
up until midnight on the 31st

134
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,919
but i don't know if people still do this

135
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,440
when i was young

136
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,960
there were people who would stand on a

137
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,639
chair

138
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,479
and when midnight came they would jump

139
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,000
into the new year

140
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,639
off the chair

141
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,479
it really worked

142
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,880
they got there into the next year just

143
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,639
and the people didn't jump got there as

144
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,639
well but maybe somehow you got there

145
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,960
better when you jumped

146
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,639
the um

147
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,240
but still it's something that people do

148
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,160
together some people party some people

149
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
come together and

150
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,960
and

151
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,319
there was a time when people came

152
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,319
together much more in the last couple of

153
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,560
years

154
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,479
and i think it's important for people to

155
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,080
come together and i thank those of you

156
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,600
who came here today

157
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
to sit this together i find it precious

158
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,840
that we're meditating together thank you

159
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,880
and we share these conventions

160
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,319
and they link us

161
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,080
they link us and kind of organize our

162
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,759
lives and we kind of

163
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,199
share

164
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,960
the conventions and share the life in

165
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,840
some ways

166
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,400
but it's more for me it's more important

167
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,960
it isn't that they link us

168
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,639
but rather they're channels of

169
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,039
communication

170
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,120
and the question is

171
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,319
what are you communicating when you use

172
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,360
shared conventions

173
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,039
and that is what i find is most

174
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,400
interesting about this what i'm trying

175
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,199
to say today what are you sharing

176
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,120
what are you communicating

177
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,440
when you use a convention

178
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,520
when you use when you simply say

179
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,199
how are you to someone hi how are you

180
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,520
and it's a lot of people in english

181
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,599
don't really want to know how you

182
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,880
they say how are you they don't really

183
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,639
want to know how you are

184
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,360
you you say oh i'll tell you sit down

185
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,400
you have an hour i'll tell you

186
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,479
they don't really want to know they just

187
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,400
want to know that it's kind of like a

188
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,880
convention to say hello and i i see you

189
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,080
and uh

190
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,840
and so you say you know you play the

191
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,880
convention sometimes you say fine

192
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,639
and then how are you and the fine and

193
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,240
then you can go on to the

194
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,919
business you have to do it's just a kind

195
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,199
of little dance you do get connected

196
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,879
maybe a little it can be a little

197
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,479
communication or friendliness or

198
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,400
recognition there are some cultures

199
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,560
where they say hello by the word for

200
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,720
hello is i see you

201
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,400
isn't that kind of nice

202
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,479
i see you

203
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,319
and um

204
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,520
and so

205
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,560
uh

206
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,080
we're communicating through the

207
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,360
conventions that we use

208
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,879
and and uh this i find precious

209
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,520
and what do you communicate

210
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,280
when you use the conventions when you

211
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,840
say hi

212
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,199
how are you when you say happy new year

213
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,960
happy holidays or whatever you say

214
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,879
you're participating in conventions that

215
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,880
we share

216
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,800
and what are you communicating what is

217
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
traveling in your words to the other

218
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,200
person

219
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,599
is it friendliness is it kindness is it

220
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,000
recognition

221
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,279
is it a feeling of shared humanity

222
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:50,720
that we're in this journey together

223
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,279
we're accompanying each other

224
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,600
that we're

225
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,519
caring for each other that we are

226
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,120
respecting each other

227
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,480
or is it something else

228
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,519
now here in redwood city i've heard of

229
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,800
there heard terrible things be

230
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,360
yelled.car windows to people walking on

231
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,000
the sidewalk

232
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,839
that communicates something else

233
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,040
do not say how are you to someone

234
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,640
you know maybe that communicates a

235
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,480
little more of an indifference

236
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,760
some different feeling

237
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,279
so what are we communicating in the

238
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,640
conventions

239
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,000
so one of the things that happens when

240
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,560
people practice vipassana mindfulness

241
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,000
practice

242
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,240
there's a kind of deconstruction process

243
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,680
that goes on

244
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,640
we're kind of slowly deconstructing the

245
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,279
conventions we live in

246
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,040
some of the conventions get

247
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,880
claustrophobic some of them are not

248
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,839
helpful for our own hearts and minds

249
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,440
some of them are

250
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,760
burdensome that we live under some of

251
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,800
them are just part of just our lives

252
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
but as we sit and get quiet in

253
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,079
meditation calmer and calmer

254
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,079
the calmer mind

255
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,240
is no longer

256
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,800
participating at all the conventions

257
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,720
and for some brief moments perhaps in

258
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,320
meditation

259
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,240
a good percentage of the usual

260
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,399
constructs of the mind thoughts ideas of

261
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,079
who i am and other people are and what

262
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,360
i'm supposed to do and what i'm supposed

263
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,360
to accomplish and

264
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,040
my to-do list is forgotten

265
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,880
my

266
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,120
concerns of work are put aside for a few

267
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,160
minutes

268
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,000
and we experience a calmness or

269
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,560
peacefulness and letting go we

270
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,000
experience our life our world ourselves

271
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,200
of uh to some degree free of all the

272
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,000
constructs the ideas the

273
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,560
the beliefs the to do's the

274
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,839
identities that we live by

275
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,839
and it can be a relief

276
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,800
to put it all down

277
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,880
and when the more we can do that

278
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,920
the more than we can see

279
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,600
we can recognize

280
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,279
when we reintroduce the conventions

281
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,760
when we reinduce interpretations we

282
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,600
introduce thoughts and ideas and

283
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,360
projections and assumptions and

284
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,519
judgments

285
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,880
and

286
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,279
that we have about ourselves others the

287
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,120
world around us

288
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,920
and that's a special place

289
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,160
to be able to watch how

290
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,360
we

291
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,720
these things come back in

292
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,600
so if you

293
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,800
feel pretty calm in meditation

294
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,480
pretty peaceful and things are pretty

295
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,639
good and quiet and

296
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,800
you leave meditation to go out here to

297
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,760
find your shoes

298
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,959
and

299
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,519
you see your shoes

300
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,480
and

301
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,839
probably none of you have these kinds of

302
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,000
thoughts but you see your shoes and you

303
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,920
say oh

304
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,360
they're those old tired shoes

305
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,839
of mine

306
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,480
that really are embarrassment to the

307
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,760
human

308
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,880
to humankind

309
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,959
and i hope no one notices

310
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,440
you've now introduced a whole series of

311
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,800
conventions constructs and ideas

312
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,360
to watch it come in

313
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,200
to watch the mind pick it up oh they're

314
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,040
in my shoes they're tired and old

315
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,240
they're

316
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,440
and watch it as thoughts coming up

317
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,320
and be quiet enough to see it arise

318
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,680
and say no thank you

319
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,519
say i don't need to go there i don't

320
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,120
need to pick that up

321
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,000
this is optional

322
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,519
you could just then drop it and speak

323
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,279
quietly put on your shoes they probably

324
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,839
will get you home

325
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,920
another option you have

326
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,399
is you can see your shoes

327
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:12,720
recognize that you're going to

328
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,240
spiral down in some kind of

329
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,440
self-loathing around your shoes

330
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,519
so i'm not going to do that

331
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,200
instead you can look at your shoes and

332
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,560
say you know i've had those shoes for a

333
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,160
long time

334
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,240
they've take care of me in many many

335
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,680
places and

336
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,240
we've been through a lot together

337
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,639
maybe i'll just thank my shoes

338
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,560
thank you shoes

339
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,160
i'm grateful

340
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,839
before you put on your shoes you bow to

341
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,079
them

342
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,399
and maybe that's a silly thing to do

343
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,639
but what a world of difference it is to

344
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:50,160
live in a world

345
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,279
where we

346
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,120
look at our shoes and have loathing for

347
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,440
the shoes ourselves embarrassment

348
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,760
versus when we feel grateful for it our

349
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,560
shoes what a difference

350
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,920
which which world would you rather live

351
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,040
in

352
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,720
if you have those are the two options

353
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,720
i know i would better i'd prefer to live

354
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,600
in the grateful one

355
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,880
so we come to new year's eve

356
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,680
another convention

357
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,279
and there's a lot of things people do

358
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,360
for new year's eve that doesn't interest

359
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,160
me whatsoever

360
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,720
and there was a time in my life where i

361
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,839
maybe would have been a little bit

362
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,279
dismissive of what people do

363
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,639
i think some things people do probably

364
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,240
not so healthy for themselves

365
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,839
but i don't want to dismiss people

366
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,440
anymore don't want to dismiss and be you

367
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,560
know i don't want to live in a world

368
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,079
where i'm judging people i'll look at

369
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,120
that and what they're doing

370
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,639
i'd rather live in a world where i

371
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,160
appreciate people and value them and

372
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,519
i'll say oh look at that

373
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,920
people are having a chance to celebrate

374
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,040
people are coming together

375
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,600
humans need to be together some of them

376
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,600
do

377
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,760
and wish them well may they be well may

378
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,480
they be safe

379
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,320
and if those are the only options those

380
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,519
two to be dismissive or to

381
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,399
think

382
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,720
well about them and wish them well

383
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,839
i'd rather live in the latter

384
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,440
think it's better for me and it's really

385
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,880
bad it's the kind of world i'd like to

386
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,199
live in

387
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,560
and so this idea that we live in the

388
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,040
world of conventions ideas and

389
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,560
constructs an idea of what's going on

390
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,880
some buddhists want to dismiss it all

391
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,680
and say it's all empty it's all not real

392
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,040
we want to stay with close to what's

393
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,279
real

394
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,320
and some buddhists will say well

395
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,399
maybe they're not real in some kind of

396
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,160
absolute way

397
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,079
but they're real enough in the sense of

398
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,680
we have a choice

399
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,639
how to use them

400
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,399
and use them well

401
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,959
you make choices like that all the time

402
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,920
you sit down at a meal

403
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,399
you could probably eat your soup with a

404
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,000
knife

405
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,720
or the fork

406
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,199
but it's a little more useful to you eat

407
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,920
your soup with a spoon

408
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
that's a convention this idea it's a

409
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,800
choice we make

410
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,959
so we can make the same we can make

411
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:37,199
choices with how we use our words

412
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,160
how we use our evaluation of people and

413
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,320
circumstances

414
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,880
and that is one of the powers that come

415
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,600
from meditation

416
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,160
if you in meditation have learned to get

417
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,480
quiet and peaceful enough

418
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,880
to have put to rest some of the

419
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,959
judgments some of the ideas some of the

420
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,079
projections some of them

421
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,120
activities of your mind

422
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,678
just enough so you can see them when

423
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,918
they get when they reappear

424
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,959
and see them as reappearing oh there it

425
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,798
is it wasn't there now it's come

426
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,480
and don't give it

427
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,199
authority don't take it being real

428
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,558
the thoughts the judgments

429
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,400
but rather see them as thoughts three

430
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,080
them as judgments see them as

431
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,880
evaluations

432
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,200
the fact that you see your shoes as old

433
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,600
tired shoes

434
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,120
maybe they've been around for a long

435
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,360
time

436
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,039
but then to follow that in the wake of

437
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,960
that of oh this is embarrassment

438
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,200
it says oh

439
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,039
is that true just because i think it

440
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,840
doesn't make it true

441
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,720
because i think it

442
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,760
it's not so much but is it true or false

443
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,200
but in that i think it

444
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,039
is it helpful or not

445
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,520
in that i think it

446
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,960
how can i

447
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,799
use it

448
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,720
for something that's beneficial that

449
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,159
makes this world a better place

450
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,679
and this you know tireless

451
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,240
or continuous

452
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,480
dedication love devotion

453
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,919
to making this world a better place

454
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,480
why not

455
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,840
why not do that

456
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,240
i believe that there are people who

457
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,559
seemingly are continuously

458
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,960
doing the opposite

459
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,120
continuously thinking about and how to

460
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,120
make this

461
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,559
maybe they're trying to make a better

462
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,240
life for some people but they're making

463
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,600
it other people miserable

464
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,160
but what if we make it make us world a

465
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,640
place that we care for people and trying

466
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,360
to make it good for everyone

467
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,640
and you might say that that's a moral

468
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,960
choice

469
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,360
i'd like to say that it's

470
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,480
it's a

471
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,240
not a moral choice exactly but rather

472
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,520
it's the

473
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,919
more healthy choice

474
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,080
for our hearts and our minds

475
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,720
and so even as simple as how you go

476
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,559
to put on your shoes as you leave here

477
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,000
if by the time you get to the shoe rack

478
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,120
and you remember wow

479
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,440
but if i rush home right now

480
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,919
i think if i you know really raced home

481
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,160
and gunned my car and maybe hopefully

482
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,440
there's no police on the freeway and

483
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,679
just really get there i'd get back just

484
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,279
in time for the beginning of the tv show

485
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,679
that's a choice

486
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,000
or

487
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,600
see the those thoughts arise and say

488
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,120
wait a minute what world do i want to

489
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,799
live in do i want to live in a world

490
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,440
that's rushing and dangerous

491
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,799
or is there better things to do

492
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,960
is there healthy things for my heart and

493
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,440
my mind a healthy way to drive healthy

494
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,440
way to leave stay connected to myself

495
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,159
and like that is that is that that kind

496
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,960
of questioning

497
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,720
is the kind of questioning that i

498
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,480
believe comes from doing buddhist

499
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,480
practice

500
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,799
buddhist practice is not a magical

501
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,720
pill that you just do the practice and

502
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,080
everything will be glorious and

503
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,840
wonderful

504
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,080
but buddhist practice is one that gives

505
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,520
us the

506
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,480
the

507
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,799
knowledge the material the capacity

508
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,320
to see what we're doing moment by moment

509
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,720
to choose

510
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,760
the healthy option

511
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,720
in their words we speak and the actions

512
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,679
we do

513
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,039
and even the thoughts that we have

514
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,400
and to do that

515
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,760
in in

516
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,480
a regular way ongoing way

517
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,200
begins to kind of change

518
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,880
the inner and outer environment

519
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,840
there's less stress

520
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,840
there's less fear and anxiety

521
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,080
there's less tension that we carry with

522
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,240
us

523
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,200
and there's the opposite

524
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,159
the rewards are huge

525
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,679
the benefits are fantastic

526
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,559
to live in that place

527
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,120
in the present moment

528
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,840
where we can see

529
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,080
how we live

530
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,720
the choices we make

531
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,799
and to choose choose the ways that are

532
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,720
healthy for you for ourselves and for

533
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,240
the world

534
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,159
do things beneficial for self and others

535
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,080
and all the conventions we use the

536
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,360
communications we have

537
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,919
to never dismiss anything

538
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,200
but always to see how can we this be

539
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,559
used how can this be a channel

540
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,120
where i can spread goodness

541
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,600
freedom

542
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,039
kindness

543
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,679
compassion love

544
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,480
so we come to this end of the year

545
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,679
beginning of the next year

546
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,840
and we have all these conventions that

547
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,240
we do and one of the conventions is to

548
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,799
kind of review the year

549
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,960
and to set an intention for the next

550
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,200
year

551
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,520
and it's a nice that's that can be a

552
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,240
nice thing to do

553
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,280
and

554
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,760
what i hope is that

555
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,159
we keep making that resolve that

556
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,400
intention over and over again

557
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,200
it's it's how we live our lives it's not

558
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,480
something we do once a year

559
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,400
and so

560
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,240
it's a life and buddhist life is a life

561
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,120
of

562
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,600
making choices resolves intentions

563
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,679
all the time

564
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,480
but not in a way that's tiring

565
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,679
but in a way that's obvious

566
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,880
it's so obvious

567
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,760
that if you're going to drink soup

568
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,880
you do it with a spoon

569
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,200
to try to eat the soup with a knife

570
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,080
it's

571
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,000
you know

572
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
maybe once a lifetime it's okay to try

573
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,440
but it's

574
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,400
you know

575
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,840
it's a goddess you know

576
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,559
which is the easy choice

577
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,080
the spoon

578
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,880
it becomes that natural that easy

579
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,039
to live this life of choice to live the

580
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,880
life

581
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,720
of

582
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,039
being in the present moment to care for

583
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:22,640
what we do

584
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,840
each step along the way

585
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,080
so new year's eve

586
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,360

587
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,880

588
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,840
