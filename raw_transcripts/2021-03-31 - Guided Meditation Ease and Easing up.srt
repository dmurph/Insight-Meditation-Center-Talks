1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:10,080
so good day warm greetings

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:18,720
and here we are to continue on our adventure in

3
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,720
mindfulness of breathing and the last tetra at the end of this

4
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,080
whole sequence of settling in deeper and deeper

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,360
is to come to a place where we're able to

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,320
observe things in a

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:49,200
non-interfering way non-reactive way and whereas

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,039
observing by itself might not seem like a very interesting way of meditating perhaps or a little

9
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,239
bit detached it comes after [Music]

10
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:07,600
a process of calming relaxing the body and mind and liberating ourselves just enough

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,799
with our reactivity and our preoccupations and our busy mind

12
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:20,000
so that rather than letting go at this point we can let things be

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,880
and letting things be can be seen as a very generous thing

14
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,079
to not interfere to not assert the self and not assert one's preferences

15
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:39,280
and desires and aversions but to really just kind of have the peacefulness to

16
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,960
observe and some things we observe are difficult we might be anxious

17
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:52,399
we might be upset we might be you know agitated in some way but it is

18
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,759
possible to come to a place where we just observe that and we let it

19
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,439
be we don't have to let go of it because we can just let it be

20
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,200
um and uh and

21
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:18,480
and watch it see it and so the last tetrad is just observing

22
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,840
things coming and going and starting to become attuned to the fact that in some way or

23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,360
many ways in profound ways our experience is constantly shifting and changing

24
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,640
and arising and passing and to now not be interested in the

25
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,519
content of our experience the content of our thoughts the content of our feelings

26
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,519
but rather to be interested in the process by which they arise in their past they come and they go

27
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:57,440
we're switching to process rather than content as a big shift for the human mind and to observe

28
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,840
to let be and in a sense we're learning to ease up on our

29
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:11,360
experience not to get rid of it but to be able to observe it in a peaceful way

30
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,159
so beginning with a meditation posture

31
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:27,360
that allows you to both have some alertness but also to feel at ease in yourself

32
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,200
some easiness

33
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:42,879
and to gently close your eyes

34
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,840
and to take a few long slow deep breaths

35
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,599
long slow deep breaths to feel yourself

36
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:03,680
fill yourself with awareness and to relax to settle in

37
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:11,439
and to settle in as you exhale to some place within that feels stable

38
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:19,919
a stability stable in your body

39
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:28,000
stable in your heart

40
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,840
maybe stable in your mind

41
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,400
not looking for great stability but rather

42
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:47,360
becoming a little more stable than you were stable here definitively

43
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,080
here and now in this place at this time

44
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,000
and then letting your breath return to normal and

45
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,800
perhaps as if there's waves of relaxation through your body

46
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,840
relaxing the muscles of your face

47
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:23,039
as you breathe the waves of breathing are like waves move washing through your face

48
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,120
softening relaxing

49
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,840
waves of relaxation through the shoulders

50
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:54,880
waves of relaxation through the belly softening on the exhale

51
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,840
and waves of relaxation through the whole body

52
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,639
and then letting yourself sit quietly here

53
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:40,960
and let yourself be easy be at ease in your body

54
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:49,199
or if your body feels it uneasy ease up on how it is

55
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,039
allow things to be but ease up around them it's okay

56
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:03,840
breathe with it ease up and just observe

57
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,000
experiences of your body

58
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,840
and set your heart at ease

59
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,199
maybe you can feel gentle tender soft

60
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:38,000
in the heart here and now at ease or if the heart is uneasy to ease up on

61
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,400
that it's okay and for you to observe this is

62
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,560
how it is as if a as if the observing is

63
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:59,840
accompanying the uneasiness you feel with care and compassion

64
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:13,840
and as you exhale setting your mind at ease it's okay to be here now

65
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:26,400
and if the mind is uneasy ease up on that

66
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,479
so you can maybe just observe

67
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,080
and be at ease in how you observe

68
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:54,399
no need to strain or be afraid as you open up to observe

69
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,040
phenomena

70
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,560
the observing itself is a place of safety

71
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,800
we begin approaching a place of non-reactivity non-harming

72
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:22,480
just observing phenomena

73
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,320
and one of the things you can observe

74
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:37,839
is how you lose your ease how you lose your calm

75
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:50,320
how you go in the opposite direction then easing up

76
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,680
be sure that you don't overlook the moments of

77
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,920
contraction and agitation

78
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:11,200
reactivity but when you see it when you know it meet it with relaxing

79
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,839
meet it with easing up

80
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,079
with observing this is how it is now

81
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,839
letting it be

82
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:42,880
but not being it letting it be but not becoming

83
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:47,839
the reactivity

84
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,839
and all along breathing in and breathing out

85
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,680
as if breathing is the rhythm of the universe

86
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,800
that washes through you through

87
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
everything

88
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:10,709
[Music]

89
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
um

90
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:35,839
[Music] ah

91
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
so

92
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:02,240
noticing ways that you've been caught that you get caught in thoughts and

93
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,039
feelings and experiences in the body

94
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:14,640
we're being caught or preoccupied or concerned

95
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:22,160
is going in a different direction than being at ease easing

96
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:29,840
up simply observing

97
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,840
with the help of breathing

98
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:51,760
let breathing help you not get so caught in things stay with the rhythm of breathing

99
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:59,640
so that you're in better position to simply observe the comings and goings of reactivity

100
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,640
preoccupations

101
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:15,440
contractions comings and goings of what you want and what you don't want

102
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,679
the coming goings of wanting and not

103
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
wanting

104
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,890
[Music]

105
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
um

106
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,320
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

107
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:23,440
to appreciate the possibility of easing up

108
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,360
and one way this easing up is so helpful is to

109
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:40,158
help us recognize in inner safety

110
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:46,880
that as we sit and meditate we don't need to be talking to people or

111
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:55,919
interacting with them and be out in the world driving our cars on dangerous freeways

112
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,159
that for these few minutes of the meditation

113
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:08,960
you don't have to solve your problems or

114
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:17,840
engage in the difficulties of life it's a safe time just to be let be

115
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:24,559
and it's also somewhat private what goes on inside

116
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:33,039
so in the safety and privacy without anybody needing to know

117
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:39,840
can you open your heart tenderly caringly

118
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:49,600
to feel good will to have kindness love first for the people in your life

119
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:56,000
it's relatively easy to love and have good will

120
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:04,480
and allow you yourself the luxury of feeling that privately

121
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:11,520
without the any complications of it being done publicly or

122
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:18,960
overtly just feeling the simplicity of your care your kindness

123
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:27,520
your appreciation of others perhaps breathe with it breathe through

124
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:33,520
those feelings make room for it

125
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:46,640
and with this simple useful connection to your goodwill

126
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:55,039
perhaps it's easier now again in the privacy of meditation

127
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:01,840
to have thoughts of well-wishing for others

128
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,159
it would be quite wonderful if they could be happy and peaceful

129
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:18,799
safe and that they they could thrive and

130
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,840
have a good life

131
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:30,559
and then to give words to this good will this well-wishing

132
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:37,279
may they be happy

133
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,880
may they be safe

134
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,559
may they be peaceful

135
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,320
may they be free

136
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:03,279
and may our well-wishing extend outwards throughout the lands

137
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:11,360
and seas and in all directions how wonderful it would be if all beings

138
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:18,720
could be happy may all beings

139
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:26,720
be peaceful may all beings be safe

140
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,840
may all beings everywhere be free

141
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:42,000
and with the support of our meditation practice mindfulness practice

142
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:47,840
may we in our way in ways that we can

143
00:31:47,840 --> 00:32:00,870
contribute to that being possible

144
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:04,370
[Music]

145
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,039
you
