1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:03,919
so

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,680
we've taken a little bit of a pause of

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,679
moving through the next steps of the

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:14,559
16 steps of mindfulness or breathing to

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,960
really look a little bit more deeply at

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,880
this particular way in which the mind

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,320
works

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,039
the use of imagination in the mind

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,039
and i'll talk a little bit more about

10
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,800
specifically the buddha's use of this

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,000
word imagination

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,760
and i've read sometimes people say that

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,800
there's no poly word for imagination

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,840
but there actually is it's a little bit

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,760
of translator's choice but i think

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,680
there's a good argument i'll talk about

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,440
it tomorrow

18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,120
the words that have to do with it and

19
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,960
they have a lot to do with um

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,120
they also relate to this idea of

21
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,120
self and not self which is so important

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,000
in buddhism

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,879
for today i want to uh so this is kind

24
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:03,280
of pausing to look imagination is a

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,920
is a preparation for next week when we

26
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,799
start looking at

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,720
um uh the mind more carefully and

28
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,400
what goes on in the mind the mental

29
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,760
activity

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,640
but to create the right conditions for

31
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:17,520
supporting

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,759
investigation and a deeper letting go in

33
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:20,960
the mind

34
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,799
is part of the function of these earlier

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,280
parts of anapanasati mindfulness of

36
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,799
breathing

37
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,920
and to to the more sense of well-being

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,720
that can come in meditation

39
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,400
the easier it's going to be to really

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,200
work with the mind

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,439
there's a i've told the story many times

42
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,479
but i love the story

43
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,240
of when my son was in kindergarten

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,200
once a week they would play with

45
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,600
beeswax with a little wax and um

46
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,680
and uh when it was time for them to play

47
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,360
they would actually been sitting up on

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,479
the

49
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,119
shelf and it would be um usually when

50
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,719
the form or whatever animal they made

51
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,399
the week before

52
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,959
and they would it would be hard and

53
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:11,680
being hard

54
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,120
it would be brittle and the only thing

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,720
you can do with any of it would be to

56
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,840
break it

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,760
and a little animal legs can be broken

58
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,840
off easy enough for something

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,680
but what they would be instructed to do

60
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,360
every week would be

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,920
to put the little the piece of wax they

62
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,560
had

63
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,239
in the palm between the palms of their

64
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,440
two hands and just hold it there

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,720
while the teacher told the story and by

66
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,480
the time the story was over

67
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,120
the warmth of their hands had softened

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,319
the beeswax

69
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,720
so that the or whatever kind of wax it

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,360
was

71
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,160
and so that they um then they would then

72
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,840
they could make these beautiful little

73
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,280
figures animal figures or whatever it

74
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,879
was they made

75
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,800
but you had to have the warmth to soften

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,360
it so the same thing with the mind and

77
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,400
the heart

78
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,080
to in order to make it into something

79
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,440
beautiful to move it towards freedom

80
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,480
it helps to soften it and warm it up

81
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,080
and the the the the good feelings the

82
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,879
calmness the joy the happiness the

83
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,080
well-being

84
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,800
the contentment the calmness that we sit

85
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,840
in

86
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,560
um are all kind of creating the right

87
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,840
conditions

88
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,879
to begin softening the mind

89
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,920
so the mind can be more pliable

90
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,200
more flexible more malleable in the best

91
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,000
possible way

92
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,080
so that the healthy mind the healthy

93
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,680
functioning of the mind

94
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,519
can operate smoothly and easily

95
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,480
so on the way to do that the cultivation

96
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:40,959
of

97
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,519
these deeper states of well-being that

98
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,840
come in meditation

99
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,040
the the mind is actually used to do that

100
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,959
the mind is always being used the mind

101
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,439
is being used to apply the attention

102
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,560
uh to sustain the attention

103
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,239
but it's also used to um it can be used

104
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,879
supported by the imagination and the

105
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,439
buddha uses a lot of similes

106
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,599
and and rather than thinking about them

107
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,879
as being

108
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,040
active and intentional uses of

109
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,599
imagination when we sit down to meditate

110
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,040
it's more like we learn those similes

111
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,519
internalize them well enough so that

112
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,199
they're kind of in the background of the

113
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:21,840
mind

114
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,160
so the mind associates meditation with

115
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,360
those similes

116
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,000
in a kind of a natural way the similes

117
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,240
create kind of a positive kind of view

118
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,840
orientation that supports us

119
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,360
to be present now it's very easy

120
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,960
to have lots of

121
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,840
uh imagination which is um

122
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,600
not so helpful we can carry a lot of

123
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,120
unconscious and conscious associations

124
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,479
bias fears

125
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,320
projections onto our experience so that

126
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,360
it's kind of creating kind of an uh

127
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,320
unhealthy or unsupportive environment

128
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,840
for our practice

129
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,199
the simple imagination that i'm a lousy

130
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:11,919
meditator

131
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,960
i can never do this that's also kind of

132
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,120
an imagination it's kind of an

133
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,360
idea a thought that creates a certain

134
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,560
atmosphere

135
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,720
which is a little bit it's something in

136
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,880
extreme forms is a self-fulfilling

137
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,840
prophecy if we're completely preoccupied

138
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,000
by the idea that i cannot meditate

139
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,080
then you probably can't because of

140
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,520
because of that preoccupation

141
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,400
and and so there's you know there's also

142
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:38,800
fear

143
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,120
like there's people who uh there's fear

144
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,560
what's going to happen if i open my

145
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,400
heart in meditation if i relax and

146
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,000
really feel what's here

147
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,680
and there might be some good reasons to

148
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,199
have some caution

149
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,479
but to have chronic anxiety and then

150
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,280
kind of vague imaginary ideas of

151
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,400
why or what's going to happen um it

152
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,240
doesn't it's not really supportive for

153
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,960
the process of deepening and meditation

154
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,800
we have to be wise about that anxiety

155
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,199
and caution not not feel

156
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,039
not not feel bad about having it it's

157
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,400
there for reasons

158
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,240
but we want to try to work with it and

159
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,319
find another way of being

160
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,680
so when the buddha offers all these

161
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,360
similes

162
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,639
he's uh providing he's kind of seeding

163
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,319
in the mind uh associations and

164
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,960
imaginary associations which then begin

165
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,440
to create a different atmosphere

166
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,280
for what we're doing and what meditation

167
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,720
is about

168
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,479
so whether we bring up these these

169
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,000
imaginations

170
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,160
actively or we just let them sit there

171
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,600
in the background

172
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,759
both of those are supported by really

173
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,680
knowing these similes knowing these

174
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,800
imaginary

175
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,199
kind of scenarios

176
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:53,759
so this comes into particular play with

177
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,160
the deepening of concentration what's

178
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:56,479
called

179
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,080
genres deepening states of absorption

180
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,599
that really kind of really kind of

181
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,240
settling in and really being present

182
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,800
in a clear continuous way almost like

183
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,240
there's a state shift

184
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,280
so that oh now i'm here i'm present it's

185
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,960
clear i'm here

186
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,120
and the buddha doesn't give a lot of in

187
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,880
descriptions

188
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,440
kind of prose descriptions of these

189
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,199
states

190
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,319
he describes a little bit but

191
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,240
but to really get a feel for what the

192
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,560
buddha is talking about

193
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,960
he provides similes almost ever many of

194
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,800
times he talks about describes what they

195
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,520
are

196
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,440
he then follows up with a simile for

197
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,000
each of the four of these absorptions

198
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and these similes if you kind of feel

199
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,759
your way into it and

200
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,039
and kind of let it kind of live

201
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,360
in the feeling of it or the sense of it

202
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,680
or almost imagine that you are the

203
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,360
simile in some way

204
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,039
then something begins to be kind of an

205
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:55,759
atmosphere

206
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,080
the context is being formed an

207
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,000
association that awakens something

208
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,199
inside of us

209
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,360
that's not the imagination but rather

210
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,879
the felt sense of what

211
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,080
the buddha is pointing to so the

212
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,960
imaginations for

213
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,520
uh these similes for deep states of

214
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,879
concentration where there's a lot of

215
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,560
well-being

216
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,680
um use

217
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,479
three of them use water as part of the

218
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:23,759
simile

219
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,560
and often in the kind of symbolism of

220
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,759
the buddha

221
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,120
water represents the mind and

222
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,120
perhaps the clarity of the mind or the

223
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,039
awareness itself of the mind i think

224
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,159
maybe awareness maybe more than the mind

225
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,518
and um and so we're getting a sense of

226
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,200
how to work with awareness or how to

227
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,360
relate to the awareness or how to

228
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,160
notice uh qualities or aspects of

229
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,080
awareness as we settle in into the

230
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,600
practice

231
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,800
and um so um

232
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,279
so there are four of these and i want to

233
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,160
read

234
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,680
the the similes for you and

235
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,920
maybe you could kind of let it sink in

236
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,440
for you and kind of

237
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,720
imagine that you're somehow this you can

238
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,399
feel this with your body or

239
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,440
feel it with inside

240
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,320
the first one begins with an assembly

241
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,519
that's very much with

242
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,440
in modern world maybe we would associate

243
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,160
it with making dough with flour

244
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,240
where you sprinkle water onto the dough

245
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,200
until and

246
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,560
and and knead the the water in until

247
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,640
it's the all the whole all the flour is

248
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,760
moist

249
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,000
and in the ancient world it has to do

250
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,920
with making a certain kind of powder

251
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,320
soap

252
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,480
powder that they had and making that

253
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,320
into a kind of a bald

254
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,160
so just as a skilled

255
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,720
bath person or a bath person's

256
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,320
apprentice

257
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,000
heaps bath powder in a metal basin

258
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,839
and sprinkling it sprinkling it

259
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,680
gradually with water

260
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,640
kneads it until the moisture wets one's

261
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,440
ball

262
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,600
of bath powder soaks its and pervades it

263
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,800
inside and out yet the ball itself does

264
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,320
not ooze

265
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,440
so too a practitioner makes the joy

266
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,720
and happiness born of seclusion

267
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,440
drench steep fill and pervade this very

268
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,240
body

269
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,079
so that there's no part of one's whole

270
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:22,480
body unpervaded with a joy and happiness

271
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,320
born of seclusion

272
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,440
so here there's awareness in in kind of

273
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,800
my kind of

274
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,839
description that's that's that comes

275
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,839
along with joy and happiness

276
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,279
so we're sitting in meditation there's

277
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,959
feelings of well-being

278
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,079
and then one big gently kind of needs it

279
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,399
massages it or or spreads it or expands

280
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:46,880
it

281
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,360
through the whole body so no part of the

282
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,399
body is not

283
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,480
moist with this goodness of joy

284
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,839
and happiness so so it

285
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,399
implies that there's a kind of

286
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,240
engagement with the process

287
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,079
so not just opening and allowing

288
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,000
well-being there but in a certain kind

289
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,240
of way gently lovingly

290
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,320
kind of maybe each time we breathe kind

291
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,440
of opening and

292
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,240
filling opening stretching letting it

293
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,399
kind of ooze or letting it like

294
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,200
spread through the body so there's a

295
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,720
little more active involvement

296
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,360
and and and this is where the mind is a

297
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,160
little bit more

298
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,560
involved in staying there stay present

299
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,680
be with it

300
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,120
work on work on the breath the

301
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,079
in-breaths and the out-breaths

302
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,240
as the mind gets stiller and quieter

303
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,320
there's no more needing no more work is

304
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,079
needed to stay present no more work

305
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,760
to spread anything or cultivating it

306
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,880
and so the next uh

307
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,040
level of absorption

308
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,519
so just as though there were a lake

309
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,360
whose waters welled up from below

310
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,800
and it has no inflow from east west

311
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,360
north or south and would not be

312
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,600
replenished from time to time by showers

313
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,200
of rain

314
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,440
so there's no streams flowing in from

315
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,320
any direction

316
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,639
into the lake from the top it's only an

317
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,839
upwelling of a spring from below

318
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,600
then that cool fount of underwater water

319
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,160
flowing

320
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,440
up in the lake would make the cool water

321
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,560
suffuse

322
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,760
fill completely fill and pervade the

323
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,959
lake

324
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,519
so there's no part of the whole lake

325
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,079
unpervaded

326
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:39,680
by the cool water um in this way

327
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,279
one suffuses and fills and completely

328
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,480
fills and pervades

329
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,880
this very body with the joy and

330
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,519
happiness

331
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,839
born of samadhi no part of the body is

332
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,600
unpervaded with joy and happiness born

333
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,240
of samadhi

334
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,360
the third absorption just

335
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,480
as in a pond of blue

336
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,399
or red or white lotuses some lotuses

337
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,040
that are born and grow in the water

338
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,240
thrive

339
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,760
immersed in the water without rising

340
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,680
out of it and cool water suffuses

341
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,000
feels completely fills and pervades

342
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,720
these lotuses to their tips and their

343
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:25,600
roots

344
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,839
so that there is no part of all these

345
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,000
lotuses unpervaded

346
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,760
by cool water

347
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,920
so one experiences happiness in the same

348
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,680
way one experiences happiness with the

349
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:42,959
body

350
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,519
that the noble ones describe when abides

351
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,360
abides with happiness

352
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,120
of one who is equanimous and mindful

353
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,160
when suffuses feels completely fills and

354
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,920
pervades this very body

355
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,040
with happiness no part of the body is

356
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,880
unpervaded with happiness

357
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,600
so the joy has stopped which is more

358
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,279
active and energetic and now it's just

359
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,360
happiness

360
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,560
and then the final one um

361
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,079
is um

362
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,079
just as though a person were sitting

363
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,120
covered from the head down with white

364
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,320
cloth

365
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,639
so that there's no part of one's whole

366
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,839
body enclosed

367
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,519
um not

368
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,120
enclosed by the white cloth

369
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,240
so once it fuses

370
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,959
and fills it completely fills and

371
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,720
pervades this very body

372
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,279
with mental purity mental clarity

373
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,920
no part of the body is unpervaded with

374
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,760
mental clarity

375
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,839
just as a so

376
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,600
the the idea of surrounded by a white

377
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,920
cloth so no part of the body is not

378
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,959
touched by this white cloth is the idea

379
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,639
that

380
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,600
there's no outside stimulus anymore and

381
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,240
there's no

382
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,199
clear defined body anymore it's kind of

383
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,199
you can't quite see it but it's there

384
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,399
it's it's covered and and

385
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,120
it's a softness to it the soft clean

386
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:21,920
cloth

387
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,839
that touches it everywhere so we go from

388
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,639
working the

389
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,199
working the joy through the body to

390
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,320
feeling the joy

391
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,639
uh so being a very peaceful quiet lake

392
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,360
with

393
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,800
whatever we've experienced kind of

394
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,680
floating in this stillness of awareness

395
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,279
happy awareness to um

396
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,040
to becoming so quiet and still

397
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,120
that the body begins to recede and very

398
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,399
peaceful safe

399
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,600
quiet equanimous and characterized by a

400
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,720
kind of mental purity mental clarity or

401
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,600
cleanliness that's there

402
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,480
so this is the closest we get to the

403
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,040
buddha really describing

404
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,680
or these met these states of

405
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,360
concentration

406
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,040
and i don't know if they mean something

407
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,639
for you or whether you kind of

408
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,519
evoke some imagination for you but if

409
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,680
they evoke your imagination

410
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
then these are things to kind of take in

411
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,440
and and

412
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,160
internalize a certain way some people

413
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,279
memorize these

414
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,160
descriptions and and then they're there

415
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,519
in the background

416
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,639
for the mind to kind of

417
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,480
perfume itself or perfume meditation

418
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:34,880
with

419
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,920
dissociation and associations which

420
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,279
might be a lot better

421
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,800
than some of the other ways in which

422
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,959
your imagination is

423
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,320
influencing your experience

424
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,279
so thank you and and

425
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,440

426
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,519
happiness

427
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,959
have a chance have the opportunity

428
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,680
to spread and pervade and soak your

429
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,000
whole

430
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,360
body don't get so distracted

431
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,438
that you don't allow your well-being

432
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,959
happiness and joy

433
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,760
a real chance to really be felt and be

434
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,798
experienced in this body that we have

435
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:24,240
so until tomorrow thank you
