1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,080
so

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,639
in these

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,360
almost 70 sessions we've gone through

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,960
the

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,359
16 steps of mindfulness of breathing

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,920
and the most famous discourse

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,599
where i have where these

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,320
16 steps occur is actually in a

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,280
discourse that has much more in it

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,440
and it has a second half where

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,680
the practice is discussed as how it

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,160
follows up how it continues

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,840
after we're being well established in

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,920
the 16 steps

15
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,680
or it continues and describes

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,440
part of the wider kind of unfolding

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,520
that happens while we're doing the 16

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,600
steps

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,640
and somehow the second half presents

20
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,719
more richness and fullness

21
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,920
to it and partly it does so by

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,000
harmonizing

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,799
bringing together and showing how other

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,400
aspects of early buddhist practice

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,200
come into play in doing mindfulness or

26
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,720
breathing

27
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,439
and in particular there's two and that

28
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,240
is the four foundations of mindfulness

29
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,240
how they how the four foundations of

30
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,880
mindfulness are fulfilled through this

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,640
breathing meditation and how it leads to

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,479
the seven factors of awakening

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,720
and um inherent in this discussion

34
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,920
that here's you know this second half of

35
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,479
the

36
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,479
instructions or this description of

37
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,000
practice

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,920
is uh is something that's called the

39
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,000
onward leading nature of the dharma

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,840
there's a very famous description of the

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,280
dharma

42
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,000
where it says that it's immediate

43
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,560
inviting inspection onward leading

44
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,599
to be known for oneself

45
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,120
and um but this onward leading

46
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,879
uh the word for onward leading could

47
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,319
also imply

48
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,280
kind of like it carries it carries us

49
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,959
along

50
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,959
so it isn't so much that we're the agent

51
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,959
of developing and growing in the

52
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,080
practice

53
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,080
as as we enter the dharma stream

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,120
we enter the stream of meditation and

55
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,319
somehow the meditation

56
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,840
the dharma carries us along

57
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,760
and a kind of very simple way of

58
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,080
understanding that this

59
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,920
in one aspect is that most people

60
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,360
spend their days preoccupied maybe with

61
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,920
tension

62
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,840
and attachment wanting and their mind

63
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,120
racing and spinning

64
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,280
and afraid or or

65
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,760
angry resentful all kinds of ways in

66
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,360
which we're caught

67
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,360
and phenomenal and activities and

68
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,200
and so there's a lot of tension physical

69
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,159
tension emotional tension

70
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,800
mental tension and if we begin to relax

71
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,159
that all that preoccupation all that

72
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:24,720
entanglement with everything

73
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,760
then um it isn't just that we then

74
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,480
nothing happens but it starts to being

75
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,400
an unwinding a dissolving of fading away

76
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,599
of attachment and that fading away

77
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,159
that's

78
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,959
a dissolving of attachment begins to

79
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,040
change there's an onward movement

80
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,720
onward moving phenomenon and that as we

81
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,440
change

82
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,879
things open up within us that qualities

83
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,560
and capacities we have

84
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,680
that were submerged or repressed by our

85
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,840
fears our attachments our

86
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,959
preoccupations or entanglements

87
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,319
have a chance to begin showing

88
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,640
themselves and they become

89
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,040
stronger and stronger and it isn't so

90
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,840
much that we're

91
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,000
trying to make them become stronger but

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,120
they begin unfolding and moving

93
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,680
and uh and we it's wonderful to feel

94
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,040
in meditation slowly day by day or

95
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
whatever way we might feel it that

96
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,840
there's a kind of an opening

97
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,280
a kind of releasing a growing and

98
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,479
maturing

99
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,520
of something quite beautiful inside that

100
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,320
uh

101
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,040
it's kind of like a plant that has

102
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,840
finally

103
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,919
come into the sun sunlight it's been in

104
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,160
the dark for a long long time

105
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,280
and the plant grows and it just flowers

106
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,759
and this natural uh kind of that

107
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:50,639
description

108
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,479
of a flower coming to full blossom

109
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,600
is part of it is inherent

110
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,639
is inherent in the in the teachings of

111
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,600
the buddha

112
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,280
where there's kind of over and over

113
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,120
again a reference to

114
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,720
an organic movement growth unfolding

115
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,280
flowing a phenomenon as we enter into

116
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,240
this dermapath

117
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,680
the one of them is in fact the growth of

118
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,199
a plant

119
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,280
we can cultivate the plant but we don't

120
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,479
tug on it to make it grow

121
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,520
a frequent frequent metaphor is that of

122
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,240
a

123
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,120
of a river or stream coming down from a

124
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,080
mountain

125
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,039
if it rains in the mountaintop the rain

126
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,160
rains enough

127
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,639
then the rain the raindrops start to

128
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,720
flow down the side of the mountain

129
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,960
they join together and form little

130
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,120
streamlets the streamlets become streams

131
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,960
the streams become rivers the rivers

132
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,680
become

133
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,560
you know bigger and bigger until finally

134
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,560
they come down to the plains

135
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,160
and become wide big silent rivers

136
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,360
just flowing along into the ocean and

137
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,680
that water has its natural flow and flow

138
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,360
of gravity

139
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,840
and that metaphor is used for the if

140
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,840
we're getting into the stream the flow

141
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,039
of the dharma

142
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,840
it will carry us along and as we kind of

143
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,039
go into the dharma these

144
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,039
qualities become bigger and bigger

145
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,800
something inside of us becomes bigger

146
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,000
and stronger

147
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,639
and also much more silent and the

148
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,479
metaphor of silence

149
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,600
is the silence that happens within when

150
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,600
there's no conceit

151
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,080
when we're not no longer caught up and

152
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,199
preoccupied with me myself and mine

153
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,880
it isn't doesn't mean that we're

154
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,319
physically silent

155
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,880
but it means that there's a silencing of

156
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,360
this kind of extra agitation

157
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,240
that spills over into the world in all

158
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,199
kinds of

159
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,400
noisy ways and so

160
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,479
this flow down the river

161
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,120
that uh entering the stream is one of

162
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,400
the metaphors

163
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,639
that uh with the first experience of

164
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,680
real liberation

165
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,039
real freedom a person is changed forever

166
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,120
because now they know what the stream is

167
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,880
they know where the current is they know

168
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,680
the

169
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,240
both directions and how to be in that

170
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,039
current

171
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,360
that's going to carry us onward to full

172
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,599
liberation

173
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,599
and so um the onward leading nature

174
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,479
of the dharma in the anapan assad and

175
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,160
there's one way that concentration

176
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,080
practices onward leading

177
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,280
and another way that uh

178
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,520
insight practice is onward leading and

179
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,440
the two go together

180
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,400
and the concentration practice is

181
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,639
armored leading is described

182
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,800
as the there's the arising of gladness

183
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,759
when we're no longer caught up in the

184
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,720
hindrances

185
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,120
no longer the mind is no longer

186
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,520
distracted all the time

187
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,479
and the glad that we're finally present

188
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,280
that gladness

189
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,919
is the condition out of which flows

190
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,599
joy and if we really feel that joy

191
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,520
it's a condition that out of which flows

192
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,400
a deeper tranquility

193
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,039
relaxing a calming

194
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,360
and with that deeper calming there is

195
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,440
happiness

196
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,599
and with happiness there arises

197
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,520
concentration

198
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,759
and the way that this these five

199
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,039
gladness joy

200
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,520
tranquility happiness and concentration

201
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,200
are talked about in the suit dozen in

202
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,880
buddha's teaching

203
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,080
they are not something that the

204
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,159
meditator is doing

205
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,320
and making happen directly but rather

206
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,959
we're creating the conditions where this

207
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,800
onward leading movement

208
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,360
through gladness joy tranquility

209
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,120
happiness and concentration

210
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:56,000
can unfold on its own and

211
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,320
and and then that's the concentration

212
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,279
path

213
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,240
the inside path as described best i

214
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,360
think by the last

215
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,480
four steps of the

216
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,120
mindfulness of breathing that there is

217
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,720
insight observation observing

218
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,080
inconstancy there's a fading away

219
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,880
of attachments that depend on things

220
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,200
having more constancy

221
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,320
there's the ending cessation of

222
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,519
certain attachments and then there's the

223
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,240
letting go the relinquishing

224
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,839
of you know of our investment

225
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,279
belief in those attachments and so this

226
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,360
that also is described more of a natural

227
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,000
flow it's not something we do

228
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,519
but something we're observing and

229
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,360
watching happen

230
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,880
and so in anapanasati the

231
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,160
flow of practice moves through

232
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,560
concentration

233
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,480
and then leads this insight of deep

234
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,800
observation observing

235
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,839
and the but the what the meditator does

236
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,040
all along

237
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,079
mostly is just staying with a breath

238
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,720
being with a breath and there's a little

239
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,000
intentionality

240
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,240
to just stay focused stay focused on the

241
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,600
breath

242
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,519
which is expressed in the repeated way

243
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,720
in which the

244
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,000
grammar of the phrase is

245
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
having to do with being mindful of

246
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,519
breathing occurs

247
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,560
it says one trains

248
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,480
two says and then there's a quotation

249
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,000
like this is what i'm doing and saying

250
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,360
to myself

251
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,000
i will breathe in

252
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,000
when trains i will breathe out

253
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,200
when we'll engage over and over again no

254
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,959
matter what happens as we go through all

255
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,560
these 16 stages

256
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,160
we're not getting sidetracked by

257
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,320
anything we're allowing all the other

258
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,160
things to happen in the onward leading

259
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,120
nature

260
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,600
and we're recognizing allowing the the

261
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,480
tranquility

262
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,839
the relaxation the joy the happiness the

263
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,040
gladness the concentration the

264
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,320
liberations the observations that happen

265
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,920
but each all along the dedication is

266
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,480
simplicity of just staying with a breath

267
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,519
i will breathe in i will breathe out

268
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,079
i will stay connected to it this is

269
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,839
where the home is

270
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,279
for people doing mindfulness or

271
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,880
breathing it's not

272
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,320
exclusive the attention is open and

273
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,519
aware

274
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,079
so that this wider field is allowed to

275
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,560
manifest and to grow the dharma that's

276
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,440
onward leading can appear

277
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,839
but to keep us relaxed and not caught in

278
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:46,720
anything

279
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,920
not preoccupied we keep staying with the

280
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,200
breath in a relaxed

281
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,560
open committed way not clinging to it

282
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,120
but just kind of staying open but

283
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,399
staying there

284
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,639
so we don't get drift off and get caught

285
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,320
in other things

286
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,920
and if we have this relaxed open uh

287
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,680
steady continuous dedication

288
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,600
love for devotion for just breathing one

289
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,440
breath at a time

290
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,680
and of course we'll get distracted but

291
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,920
just whenever we can to come back i will

292
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,600
stay here with the breathing

293
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,480
this is what i'm doing then this we

294
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,639
start entering into

295
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,519
the dharma which is onward leading the

296
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,959
flow that begins to unfold

297
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,600
and and one of the things that it

298
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,279
unfolds into

299
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,320
this is uh

300
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,680
the the the core aspect

301
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,480
of the four foundations of mindfulness

302
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:46,800
and

303
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,200
um and how this mindfulness of breathing

304
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,800
connects with four foundations will be

305
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,839
the topic for tomorrow

306
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,200
so uh thank you so much

307
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,399
and then i hope that

308
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,600
you will be open to

309
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,880
not being the agent of change not to be

310
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,720
the one in charge of making things

311
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,200
happen

312
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,079
and fixing things all the time but you

313
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,440
go through the day

314
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,760
with some room to allow things to unfold

315
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,959
to allow yourself to unfold

316
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,279
to make room for yourself and room for

317
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,480
the dharma

318
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,240
that you can't do if you're just

319
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,240
constantly caught up in

320
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,399
being in charge or being the agent or

321
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,920
being the subject

322
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,120
of your preoccupations so

323
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,600
thank you
