1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:10,600
so welcome welcome it's good to be with you

2
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,279
i saw a uh a cartoon and uh

3
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:28,480
like two people on a beach sort of i in chairs looking out on the the water

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:35,120
and uh and one person says to the other um i'm relaxed enough that i've stopped

5
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,200
thinking about the drive here but not so relaxed that i'm not thinking

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,079
about the drive back

7
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,160
so um topic for this morning is uh

8
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:04,079
is thinking um thinking mindlessness mindfulness rumination

9
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:11,040
and and want to try to

10
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,200
in a sense parse different forms of non-mindfulness

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,159
yeah then maybe not all forms of non-mindfulness are created

12
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,640
equal yeah so

13
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:38,400
the patterns of uh of thinking they they do change uh i think kind of dramatically

14
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,759
over the course of a practice life that

15
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:51,040
we come to contemplate the dharma to think about

16
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:57,520
the dharma a lot in a sense more and more

17
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:05,439
reminds us of the dharma and so this becomes a kind of active

18
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,720
point of reflection of contemplation

19
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:19,040
and uh and there are other changes there are um

20
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:26,879
i think real reductions in certain species of self-related

21
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:34,720
thinking yeah and it's not that all thoughts of self-reference drop out

22
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,400
of consciousness entirely maybe maybe

23
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,360
not not for me but

24
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,599
but there are certain kind of self-referential

25
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,800
ruminative thought of who we are what we're like where we're

26
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,680
going what people think what the future looks like for me

27
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,680
who i will become what i will acquire

28
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,680
that fades quite a bit

29
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,400
this kind of movement of of really taking

30
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,840
taking the self as an object and pondering it

31
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,360
that's a [Music] a very congealed

32
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,959
mode of thinking and

33
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,200
i think that fades but not all

34
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,680
non-mindfulness is the same not all thinking is the same not all

35
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,840
forms of autopilot are equally destructive

36
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,560
and you know we

37
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,120
okay thanks um

38
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,400
we meditators um we're almost um

39
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,560
tend to be like a little embarrassed that we think you know

40
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,600
that um uh the when the guided meditation kicks in

41
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,680
right and we're in the middle of some

42
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:50,240
wild something you know or we're wondering what that

43
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,970
knocking is that's fairly persistent for the wrong door

44
00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:02,400
[Music] you know but that moment of just like okay we get called back to whatever to

45
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,680
the breathing or something and um and

46
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,199
um it's it's you know jarring and there's a sense of just almost like a

47
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,880
child being caught doing something wrong or something yeah

48
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:27,039
and um and of course thinking is is not the enemy and the mind is just another sense

49
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:34,400
gate yeah it's just another sense gate like hearing or feeling

50
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,280
and i remember a teacher saying you know you would never um

51
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:48,720
try to plug your ears with cotton in order to get enlightened yeah

52
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:56,080
but uh we do that we have those same fantasies whatever the equivalent of plugging the ears with cotton would be

53
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,160
for our thinking yeah and

54
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,800
i remember during a retreat uh michelle mcdonald said

55
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,400
you know if you broadcast what everyone was thinking

56
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,440
in the hall you know if you just broadcast at all hundred

57
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,199
right which she said it would break your heart you know

58
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,400
it would break your heart

59
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:39,360
we're learning about um about thinking and about silence and

60
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,960
in a way if we're ashamed of anything inside us it short circuits

61
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,560
investigation yeah if it feels like we may discover

62
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,680
something about ourselves about our conditioning that could break us we

63
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:03,680
don't look yeah so

64
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,840
um a researcher uh kalina kristoff brain

65
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:15,919
brain researcher she does a lot of very interesting things

66
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:23,199
and is interested in mindfulness meditation stuff and among other things and

67
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:29,599
in one one research approach she had

68
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,639
participants do this think aloud

69
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,759
paradigm you know like 10 minutes in a room

70
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:46,080
it's kind of like just speak out the papancha in your mind

71
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,759
the mental proliferation just say it out loud don't censor yourself

72
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,840
10 minutes just go right and

73
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,919
um and then research assistants you know transcribed it and then coded

74
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:11,520
it you know to sort of deciphering it into different categories and chunks and um

75
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,479
and so she kristoff gave one you know just one line um hopefully i'll get the new job because i really want it

76
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:24,240
i'm tired of my old job um i miss my dog i haven't seen her in a

77
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,720
long time yeah so it's just that ten minutes just that right

78
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,800
and uh you gotta you gotta kind of lift a glass

79
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:43,599
to the research assistance there too that's the no joke that job yeah

80
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:50,240
um but they gathered all of this kind of like

81
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,440
they're trying to parse this what is happening in people's minds yeah

82
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,680
and so it was 1300 words yeah on average that in

83
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:10,000
and 30 discrete chunks of thought you know where there is including 20

84
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
major transitions so that that example of i'm tired of my old job i miss my dog

85
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,320
that's a major transition yeah 20 of those in the course of the 10 minutes

86
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:30,480
and and she was looking as i'll get back to later about the valance yeah

87
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,839
the the kind of the vedna sort of like um

88
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:43,680
neg positive you know positive negative neutral yeah and then the continuities

89
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,200
and discontinuities and so

90
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,560
just seeing seeing that is like okay 1300 words 30 discrete chunks of thought

91
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,360
20 20 breaks in continuity and that is 10 minutes and we kind of live in that

92
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:12,160
yeah and a question of like why has evolution

93
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,880
conserved those habits so exquisitely is it just to like humiliate

94
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,360
us as meditators right it feels like that sometimes you know

95
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,680
uh but it's probably useful for staying alive yeah like that that we heard the door

96
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,079
knocking and there is some like sense of a little vigilance or

97
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:45,360
question what is that we did not stay with our breath you did not keep listening to me right

98
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,800
all of a sudden there was something else yeah and

99
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,440
and so yeah single pointedness is uh

100
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,680
is there's a certain kind of defenselessness about it yeah

101
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:12,000
to just sit and to relinquish the kind of vigilance and the the orientation and the tracking

102
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,279
of threat and opportunity that

103
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:24,079
entails some measure of trust some measure of safety some measure this is part of why we take the precepts

104
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,519
on retreat yet to know that we have each other's backs to know

105
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,640
that we are formally committed to non-harming yeah so that some of the

106
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,920
vigilance might be released yeah and this may allow us to settle into the

107
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:46,320
moment in a deeper way and so

108
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,320
yeah those habits the habits of fragmentation of discontinuity of

109
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,480
narrating our life has evolutionary value for i'm sure

110
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:06,079
but um our happiness was not at the top of evolution's to-do list

111
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:12,480
yeah it's like this is why some of this path

112
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,720
is against the stream so

113
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:26,880
sometimes it's said that that mindfulness is the only factor

114
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,240
that you can't get enough of you can sort of overdo

115
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,680
anything else you can overdo the effort the energy the compassion the equanimity

116
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,120
that can put you out of balance but one of the classical views is that

117
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,440
there is there's no such thing as too much mindfulness that can never actually put us out of balance which is an

118
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,120
interesting yeah and

119
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,440
i was reflecting on this and and feel like oh yeah i agree if if we're aspiring

120
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,959
for awakening in every moment mindfulness is vital

121
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:14,480
mindfulness is vital and when we're really practicing

122
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:21,200
we can sense even a short burst of unconsciousness carries a

123
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,240
certain kind of hangover yeah

124
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,560
there's like a hangover from unconsciousness

125
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:40,160
and in the context of like some deep aspiration around

126
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:47,440
enlightenment or something like this there's there's you're kind of like

127
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,959
kindling a fire you know and moments of unconsciousness sort of douse

128
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:02,240
the glowing embers you can actually start to feel it yeah

129
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,680
and the the kind of uh way that

130
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,920
yeah just unconsciousness diffuses diffuses the energy of insight of

131
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:21,040
samadhi that's when we're

132
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:27,120
dedicating each moment to freedom but

133
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:34,480
if we're honest at best we're aspiring for enlightenment

134
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,600
some of the time

135
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,839
not all the time right let's be honest

136
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,959
some of the time the rest of the time i just like to be comfortable you know

137
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,959
right

138
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:05,519
so i want to put in a plug for um

139
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:12,480
for mindlessness yeah this is not a retreat talk by the way some talks you could give

140
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,160
on a sunday morning or in a retreat this one you do not give on a retreat this is

141
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:24,000
it is different yeah so um this is different yeah this is kind of

142
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,040
like all right how do we be nuanced about mindlessness and you know

143
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:40,079
i this portion of the talk is uh sponsored by netflix just

144
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:46,320
interest of full disclosure uh so um

145
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,399
when the attention is engaged consistently it requires effort and energy

146
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:58,800
yeah just there are times when we just develop so much momentum that it's

147
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,079
the image gill uses of just coast the mindfulness is just like coasting down

148
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,519
water with you know there's there's wind at your back there's some current at your back

149
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:17,600
but a lot of times to attend to move the attention to the breathing for example entails a measure of energy

150
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,959
it's like attentional energy

151
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,399
that has some fatiguing effects yeah

152
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:37,600
now part of why we practice part of why we practice moments of mindfulness is

153
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,360
such that we elevate the trait level of

154
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,560
mindfulness the dispositional level of mindfulness the mindfulness

155
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,800
that we're at when we're not trying to be mindful

156
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,120
yeah that that changes over time right and so it makes it such that we

157
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,438
don't actually have to marshal all this energy can i be mindful can i remember can i remember

158
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:14,159
the cruising altitude of our awareness is is is clearer

159
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:21,360
but that's a whole process and it i don't think it ever stops really

160
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:28,480
and in the meantime it takes energy yeah to devote the attention to

161
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,840
the breathing or to a book or to

162
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,960
anything a person to work

163
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:47,360
and there can be a kind of backlash or a certain kind of depletion

164
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:54,000
or fatigue and sometimes you see it in in retreat you're sort of like exerting

165
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:02,240
a lot of energy and then you just hit a wall yeah how many people have done residential retreat uh in here okay

166
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,679
it's hopeful so you may be familiar with those those

167
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,280
like the energy just sags and it just gets chaotic and

168
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:19,679
very difficult to focus or to kind of feel even connected to the whole

169
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:26,320
path of practice yeah the energy flags and

170
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:33,520
and maybe in our lives just we've been through something intense yeah

171
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:40,480
and it might be some significant life event for you something in the larger culture covet

172
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:49,039
all of this it might be just a day of work or a day caring for

173
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:55,679
a child or a parent or something and there's a sense of

174
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:02,160
oh yeah the the the attention has flagged in some way it like needs to go

175
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:08,240
slack and we see this again after retreat

176
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:15,039
sometimes people have maybe a maybe a really rich retreat and then get home

177
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:20,640
and it's like this backlash of unconsciousness yeah

178
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,679
where it's like oh you know it's like the attention needs to go like fully

179
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,039
slack yeah that's how it feels at least

180
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,679
and we seek something that is like utterly

181
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:45,200
undemanding attentionally speaking yeah like that we seek the path of least

182
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:53,039
resistance we seek the activity with like zero

183
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:58,880
attentional caloric burn yeah

184
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,559
right like running is a thousand calories an hour and rowing or whatever

185
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:12,960
you know like we're looking for zero what is zero calories burned attentionally speaking

186
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,799
in some moments yeah and

187
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:24,640
it's worth examining like our own patterns around this what

188
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:32,480
what what are the low low calorie attention habits yeah like

189
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:38,559
how do we try to soothe around that what are the rhythms of exertion

190
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,440
and going slack and

191
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,159
and maybe sometimes sometimes maybe we could say like oh i'm just feeling lazy

192
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,919
or something but other times it actually feels like

193
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:02,000
no there's something uh i don't know i was almost going to say

194
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:07,039
the word wholesome maybe that's too much but it's like there's something

195
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:12,480
needed to restore the attentional balance where there's a sense of needing

196
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:20,080
to go slack attentionally to burn zero attention calories yeah

197
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,960
and uh and maybe sleep is part of this and

198
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:34,158
zoning out in different ways for sure is part of that thirst that we have

199
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,600
and our days are really punctuated by this rhythm of like giving attention and

200
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:46,158
conserving it yeah of giving it and rebuilding it

201
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:53,840
and um i almost thought of like again this parallel of exercise of like the

202
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:01,600
interval training that people do they'll run really fast for a little bit and then walk slowly and run really fast and

203
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,440
and it's worth investigating like how do we how does our attention economy

204
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,720
function inside and uh

205
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:19,919
some of our work is is examining like what are what the intervals should be

206
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,760
yeah and to be careful also

207
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:31,440
what we're consuming on our attentional breaks because

208
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,559
um we're pretty porous kind of defenseless

209
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:41,760
in that time and things you know tiknot han's vision of the

210
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,000
the precept around non-uh you know not taking intoxicants includes

211
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,320
like entertainment or things because it sort of like gets in deeply

212
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:03,039
and we want to be sensitive to when we've had our fill when the attention has gone

213
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:10,559
slack and there's some kind of wholesome restoration process happening

214
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:16,960
but then we sort of keep going there's some kind of momentum of the

215
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,240
unconsciousness and we keep going even when we've actually like really had

216
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,760
our fill even when the attention has been kind of replenished

217
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:35,520
we can keep going in this kind of zero attentional caloric burn mode

218
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,520
and that is um you can start to feel that that feels

219
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:49,200
different that feels different than the restoration mode is it making sense yeah

220
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:56,880
so so summing up uh where we are so far um you don't need to

221
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,320
be engaging the attention all the time but be careful be careful in the sort of

222
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:09,600
doses of mindlessness what's consumed the intervals between engaging

223
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,200
and releasing attention

224
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:22,480
so this has been a kind of like oh yeah i'm trying to maybe dignify certain forms of

225
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:30,559
non-mindfulness yeah other species of non-mindfulness are

226
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:36,880
more corrosive yeah more problematic where we're

227
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:45,039
we're really kind of actively marinating in the defilements

228
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:50,559
yeah it's just like the forces of greed hate and delusion

229
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:57,120
were like actively marinating in them now maybe the traditional view would say any

230
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,400
mindlessness is marinating in the defilements i i don't know but i i

231
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:08,480
want to just illuminate a distinction that feels real to me

232
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,400
um that that there are other species of being

233
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,480
lost that are more problematic than that kind of

234
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,480
attention just going slack and so

235
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,919
the wellspring of of suffering greed hate and delusion great aversion delusion

236
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,600
um we're very familiar with what greed looks like with what aversion or hate

237
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:43,679
looks like delusion is slippy more slippery you know and

238
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:50,960
sometimes delusion itself is defined as just being lost in thought

239
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,000
being lost in thought

240
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:05,120
when mindfulness collapses we truly are on a train ride

241
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,640
and we never

242
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:17,039
get to decide where we're going our habits good and bad

243
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,000
make that call they're the conductor yeah

244
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:28,080
and when when um the the kind of we noticed this the

245
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,200
movement from like okay we were attending to the breathing the movement

246
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:40,080
from the breathing to being identified with thought is itself thoroughly encased in

247
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,520
unconsciousness yeah it's not like

248
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:51,039
okay now maybe i'll get lost in some

249
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:56,559
thoughts of dragons or whatever right

250
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:03,200
it's just like no we there's this collapse and this move into

251
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,400
off the the breathing and into some thought realm

252
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:15,520
and then we live in that bubble and we are kind of severed from the

253
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,039
dharma yeah like there there is a very precipitous

254
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:26,880
collapse that happens in that and

255
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,840
the nature of mindlessness is that it is um

256
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,120
it's a kind of perfect identification with the content of

257
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:45,200
thought perfect identification with the content of thought

258
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:52,320
it's this utter collapse of knowing yeah

259
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,960
this is a philosopher metzinger

260
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:03,120
the beginning of every mind-wandering episode

261
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:10,159
is marked exactly by the collapse of our epistemic

262
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:16,799
agent model i'll say unpack this metzinger always talks like this so

263
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:24,480
the the beginning of every mind wandering episode is marked by the collapse of our epistemic agent model a

264
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,799
conscious representation of now possessing the ability

265
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:38,000
for epistemic self-control for knowing yeah and the end of every episode of mind

266
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:45,360
wandering is marked by the re-emergence of a new epistemic agent model the

267
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:50,559
meta-aware self the self that is then aware the meditator

268
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:57,039
that then can know uh lost and thought now here

269
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:02,799
i think it could be fruitful to analyze mind wandering as a loss of mental

270
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,720
autonomy goes on to say

271
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:16,159
when we're not identified with thought we have a model of ourselves like an

272
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:23,840
implicit model of ourselves where we can direct our attention we can

273
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:30,720
direct our thinking we can direct the attention to the breathing or to the body more broadly

274
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:40,000
or to feeling tone or to the mind right we can do this we have a sense of a model

275
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:48,080
of where we can exercise attentional control yeah

276
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:54,799
and when we get lost the epistemic and this is the

277
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:01,840
word around the the knowing the capacity for knowing

278
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:10,159
that epistemic agent something capable of knowing collapses

279
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:17,440
very precipitously yeah in a sense no one's been there to notice

280
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,039
that there's just we just

281
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,880
collapse yeah that model collapses and we become perfectly identified with the

282
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:37,200
thought and it's literally like like we

283
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,240
become the protagonist of the thought world

284
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:49,120
and we forget it's just a character yeah

285
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:56,399
and so we do we truly lose sense of of mental autonomy

286
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:02,320
and wherever that train is going that's where we're headed

287
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,600
yeah maybe headed to heaven or hell

288
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,240
we are not conducting yeah

289
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,279
in those moments um we are

290
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:28,559
the dharma feels kind of remote yeah

291
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:36,080
the default assumptions of that mode of living of being identified with thought

292
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,840
is not full of dhamma

293
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,480
and the moment of coming back is the kind of the re-emergence of

294
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,519
meta m-e-t-a awareness mind some kind of mindfulness

295
00:31:53,519 --> 00:32:01,840
it's the re-emergence that is a moment of mindfulness as every teacher says that's a moment of mindfulness

296
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:08,559
and once again we we are aware of phenomena as phenomena

297
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:16,240
yeah we're aware of the body as phenomena the breath as phenomena everything is phenomena again

298
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:22,559
but that was really deeply forgotten in that collapse of the knowing the

299
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:28,200
collapse of the epistemic agent

300
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:40,480
one species of this collapse that

301
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,559
deserves note is is a rumination

302
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:53,440
yeah so and this brings us back to kalina kristoff yeah

303
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:59,360
the the rumination the brooding this kind of obsessional

304
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:06,000
very abstract very deeply lost mode of thinking

305
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,159
is uh is not so good for us yeah

306
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:18,000
so kristoff writes instead of freely moving from one topic to another individuals prone to riemannation

307
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,279
exhibited longer negative thoughts and negative content

308
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:30,559
in ruminative individuals was linked to a narrowing in conceptual scope

309
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:37,840
yeah over time suggested by higher levels of semantic

310
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,039
so higher like the in the ruminative modes

311
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:48,559
there's less it's this narrowing yeah but we can feel it when we get in those

312
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:56,000
modes it literally feels claustrophobic yeah the mind feels claustrophobic it feels

313
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,840
narrow we're perseverating about something we're chewing on something and we're

314
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,120
like and there's more similarities with

315
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:14,240
semantic similarity encoding the words there's more similarity yeah

316
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,760
this is a very congealed sense of self

317
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,679
yeah very congealed and

318
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,158
in the dream of rumination

319
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:39,520
we've really almost completely forgotten the three characteristics yeah

320
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,638
dukkha anicha natta that

321
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,520
suffering unreliability not self

322
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,760
in our ruminations in that state of deep loss

323
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:06,480
we fantasize about a durable pleasure that might structure our lives

324
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:12,240
we fervently hope to tie up all the loose ends of being human and hold the

325
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:19,200
world still we try to game out uncertainty and find

326
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:26,720
the path through the labyrinth of a nietzsche of uncertainty on reliability

327
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:33,599
and we fantasize about taking a refuge in an identity of finally finding our

328
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:42,440
home in some sense of this is me this is self

329
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,838
all of that are different kinds of dead ends

330
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,000
but we're so earnest in our rumination in our laws

331
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:06,720
and really the we're trying i think often with

332
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:15,280
rumination we're trying to solve an affective emotional problem with

333
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:22,960
thoughts yeah we trust thinking we sort of like it's

334
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,480
the kind of main tool in our problem-solving arsenal

335
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,160
and we over trust it

336
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,400
the word me itself means chewing yeah and um

337
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:49,359
to ruminate and it's like we're trying to to digest our problem with our thought

338
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:54,960
yeah and we're just kind of like going to chew

339
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,520
until we feel better but usually wind up feeling worse

340
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,760
and that is because that mode of thinking maybe thoughts generally like

341
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,040
they do not function well as uh

342
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:19,838
digestive enzymes yeah they just don't

343
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:26,160
maybe certain kinds of you know speech with one another that can

344
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,280
function that way but when we're in deep in our own heads often

345
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,520
in this ruminative mode things are not being digested it's quicksand

346
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,760
and to enter that realm is to lose

347
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:53,440
and so the invitation is to go to the body to go to the engine

348
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,680
of feeling i was alluding to this in the in the sit uh

349
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,119
to go to that's like thinking is only

350
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:11,280
it's it's clinging necessitates thinking yeah

351
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,720
i i don't know that all thinking is a function of clinging but a lot is

352
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:23,200
and when we find ourselves clinging we

353
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:30,240
thinking becomes vital yeah we we just feel compelled to think to think our way

354
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:37,920
to the object of our clinging and so instead of instead of taking that

355
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,079
approach we we go to the body to the engine the engine

356
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:53,040
of feeling and the thoughts that come off like like exhaust on on off an engine

357
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,880
we we go to the body okay we're willing to feel badly

358
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:05,599
yeah equanimity with unpleasantness doesn't feel good

359
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,280
yeah there is there is a subtle taste of relief in it

360
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:18,640
but at least initially it does not feel good but we cannot try to solve

361
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,839
the affect of you know challenges with the thought

362
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:29,119
itself yeah so we go to the body

363
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:36,560
and we're we practice patience and equanimity and

364
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:42,400
begin to release some of the energy of clinging it begins to take some of the

365
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:49,680
thorns of our thinking the thorns of rumination out

366
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,160
and this reconnects us to the dharma to what

367
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,720
we know to our own wisdom to our goodness

368
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,359
to the path to the buddha

369
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:25,400
so i offer this for consideration should sit for a moment together

370
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,400
