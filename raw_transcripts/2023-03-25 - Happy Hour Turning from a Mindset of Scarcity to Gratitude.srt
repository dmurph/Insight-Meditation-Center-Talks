5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,980
if not in time but asynchronously so so for today's

6
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:36,260
practice I wanted to um offer a quote from

7
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:41,940
Lynn twist Lynn twist is the author of a

8
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,000
wonderful book called The Soul of money if you're not familiar with this book

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,600
The Soul of money by Lynn l-y-n-n and E twist t-w-i-s-t

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:02,460
just a lovely book and um and there is a quote from it and many wonderful quotes

11
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,580
but the one that I wanted to share for us as the inspiration for our practice

12
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:16,140
and we've we've worked with the theme of enoughness many times before and just the sense of

13
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:23,580
scarcity versus enoughness and and this quote from her really

14
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,040
um Nails it so here we go

15
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,280
um for me and for many of us our first Awakening thought of the day is quote I

16
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,500
didn't get enough sleep the next one is I don't have enough time

17
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,560
whether true or not that thought of not enough occurs to us automatically

18
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,380
before we even think or question you could think two question or examine it

19
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:58,100
we spend most of the hours and the Days of Our Lives hearing explaining

20
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:04,320
complaining or worrying about what we don't have enough of we don't have

21
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,380
enough exercise we don't have enough work we don't have enough profits we don't have enough power we don't have

22
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:16,459
enough Wilderness we don't have enough weekends of course we don't have enough money ever

23
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:21,599
we're not thin enough we're not smart enough we're not pretty enough or fit

24
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:28,140
enough or educated or sex successful enough or Rich enough ever before we

25
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:35,520
even sit up in bed before our feet touch the floor we're already inadequate

26
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:42,180
already behind already losing already lacking something and by the time we go

27
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,819
to bed at night our minds race with a Litany of what we didn't get

28
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:54,660
or didn't get done that day we go to sleep burdened by those thoughts and

29
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,780
wake up to the reverie of lack what begins as a simple expression of the

30
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:08,400
hurried life or even the challenge to life grows into the great justification for an

31
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,280
unfulfilled life here's the the last part of it this

32
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:22,019
internal condition of scarcity this mind said of scarcity lives at the very heart

33
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:27,840
of our jealousies our greed our prejudices and our arguments with

34
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,480
life quite profound and

35
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:40,080
um and I appreciate in some ways maybe we see

36
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,920
some of our attitudes in some of what she says maybe not in everything or maybe in all of it

37
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,200
um but there is this sense of scarcity the sense of lack

38
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,540
um that I know too when I go to bed some at night oh okay I got this done great

39
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:04,019
great their sense of you know I tried to remind myself of of the the beautiful things in the day and of course there's

40
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:11,459
a there's a sense of I didn't get that done and that done but usually I try to turn towards what's what's good what

41
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:17,639
what were the gifts of the day what what I'm grateful for and yet I think I for

42
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:24,419
me as I read this like I had the sense of oh yeah this this sense of not enough and it's not enough time not enough this

43
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:32,820
not enough that so I wanted to bring it in for your consideration if you identify with any aspects of this not

44
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:40,620
enoughness and how can we turn our minds turn our minds from scarcity to to

45
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,380
enoughness what actually we have plenty of what there is good what what good

46
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:52,380
there is in our lives already the sense of plentifulness already here the time

47
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:57,840
we have the resources we have the goodness we have the love we have what

48
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,680
is already here so that is the invitation for for today's practice

49
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:11,479
so with that let's land our bodies and meditate together

50
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:22,680
so arriving arriving arriving in this body arriving in this

51
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,039
moment

52
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:37,020
and what if we arrive with a sense of enoughness whatever has been accomplished or or not

53
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:44,479
but today whatever there is or isn't

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,160
whatever is happening in this body

55
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:00,440
how do we turn into enoughness

56
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:07,620
however the conditions are can we tune into the enoughness In This

57
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:14,479
Moment and to the perfection in this moment

58
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:24,919
not into what's lacking but what is good what is plentiful

59
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,180
so let's start with our bodies

60
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,880
feeling our feet on the Earth

61
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:47,039
gravity is enough it's reliable

62
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:54,919
we never think of that do we yes gravity thank you

63
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:12,800
feeling our bottom on the seat on the chair the cushion

64
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,659
the sitting here is enough it's plenty

65
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,380
it's wonderful it's awesome

66
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,520
the fact that we can do this could sit and be breathed

67
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:48,780
with as much health as there is available in this moment it's enough

68
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:52,280
it's enough it's plenty

69
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:07,800
to appreciate what is with every breath feel grounded in our body with every

70
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:14,000
breath just this

71
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:54,180
give thanks in our hearts for what is here already

72
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,620
we usually don't notice

73
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,580
appreciating opening senses with calm with

74
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:24,480
with peace with gratitude the spaciousness and peace there is

75
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,680
already there's so much peace inside we just keep staring it up

76
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:56,279
and we appreciate this breath his body however

77
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,720
it's showing up right now

78
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:08,040
recounting the goodness of having been able to eat today

79
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,600
breathe Digest

80
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:23,720
have as many organs working functioning

81
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,920
so many sight hearing

82
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:38,899
smelling tasting touching cognizing

83
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:37,019

colleagues bringing them too hard for a moment

89
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:51,260

everyone else such a beautiful place to live from to

165
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,860
live out of with intentionality

166
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:58,460
may all beings may all beings everywhere

167
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:05,840
no truly no appreciate their goodness Their Blessings

168

may all beings everywhere including ourselves be well and be free

169
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:41,299
it's everyone thanks for your practice today

170
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:50,100
so so tonight we turned towards the practice of knowing our goodness

171
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:57,299
knowing appreciating the blessings and the

172
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:02,340
practice we did was bring blessings to mind First Imagine our life without them

173
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:09,539
they're not here and then bring them back and really appreciate the sense of fullness

174
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:15,779
and living from this place really appreciate turning our minds intentionally towards

175
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:21,419
what's good what's what's beautiful it's as the Buddha said whatever you turn

176
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:28,380
whatever you Ponder and frequently reflect upon becomes the inclination of

177
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:36,899
your mind so if we Ponder Upon Our lack there's

178
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:44,100
not enough we need more we need more as Lynn twist says in the quote I read

179
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:51,240
we become more greedy we we have jealousies prejudices as she says

180
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:57,120
arguments with life that would be our orientation and instead if we turn to

181
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,880
what's here there's so much here already so much

182
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:11,878
your hearts feel full abundant grateful generous the opposite of of greed is

183
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:18,419
generosity generosity towards ourselves towards life this brief

184
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:26,838
short life where we are here appreciating living it fully from a place of fullness

185
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,679
so so for our small group practice today

186
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:41,118
I'd like to invite us practice with a joy inducing

187
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:49,500
gratitude-inducing practice we've done this before and it never fails to bring more joy and gratitude and that is going

188
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:56,700
around and the question is what are you grateful for what are you grateful for

189
00:34:56,700 --> 00:35:03,480
what are you grateful for what brings you Joy what are you grateful for and

190
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:10,680
we'll go alphabetically first name when your turn comes you can offer something or say pass you can just hold

191
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,780
silent presence that's perfectly fine offer one thing authors will hold it

192
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:21,599
with generosity with happiness for you this is a half this is a modita practice

193
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:27,060
too happiness for the happiness of others and then the next person you'll

194
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:33,119
celebrate what brings them Joy what they're grateful for and round and round

195
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:39,599
so so let's turn towards our fullness and each other's fullness let's celebrate

196
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:44,760
our own fullness and celebrate each other's fullness so wonderful to

197
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:50,400
celebrate fullness of others it's so beautiful to to be able to do that to

198
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:58,740
celebrate yeah other people's blessings yay as if they were our own practice

199
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:04,320
