wanting to meditate wanting to do

13
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:24,780
something in a particular way but step into the possibility of

14
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,680
just being not doing but being

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,040

you don't have to do anything nothing is needed of you expected of you

53

but to just be be

54
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:38,759
human as poignant as

55
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:45,420
beautiful as broken as it is to be human to just be

56
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,079

77
00:21:52,620 --> 00:22:00,320
what is it like to put down expectations of yourself

78
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:08,899
of the world of others foreign foreign

foreign

86
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:52,020
foreign this

87
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,820
sit to a close together

88
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:07,080
letting go of any expectations and you should for what this period of practice should

89
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,600
have looked like Let It Go of judgments letting go of

90
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:18,440
expectations it was exactly what it had to be

91
00:29:18,659 --> 00:29:27,419
even all the causes and conditions I preceded it let go let go of shirts let go of

92
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:35,820
expectations In This Moment an offer all of us let us offer

93
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:44,700
goodness of our practice goodness of our heart showed up as best as we were able to

94
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:50,520
share that offer that to all things everywhere

95
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:58,278
may all beings be well may all beings be free including ourselves

96
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:02,289
[Music]

97
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:16,100
thanks everyone thank you for your practice

98
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,080
so the theme foreign

99
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,820
expectations letting go of shoulds of

100
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:40,279
demands of just letting go letting go that sense of no one to be nowhere to go

101
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:46,440
experimenting offering ourselves this release release from expectations

102
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:54,120
release as a form of meta because we often layer on so much on ourselves and

103
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,340
the society does the same and of course many of that is appropriate for who we

104
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:07,740
are and and what you know the wholesome aspirations we have in the world the rules we have the relationships not to

105
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:15,179
not to let go of all of that however it's experimenting in this

106
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:21,600
moment with this practice what if I let go of that I can bring it all back on you know in 30 minutes after this

107
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,360
meditation is over but what if I let go of expectations on myself what can I if

108
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,580
I let go of it as much as possible what happens do I notice the weight of it how

109
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:37,919
much of it is extra how much of it is appropriate how much of it is extra this

110
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,679
big driven to do and be and whatever it might be the

111
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:49,080
the shape of it in our constructs a nice psychological and life constructs but

112
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:54,960
just noticing that difference if I put it down oh wow

113
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,299
it's different it's just it's it's profound to just be

114
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:05,840
you just breathe you just live this life simply it's profound it's beautiful

115
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:13,799
nothing needs to happen so that was the invitation to explore

116
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:19,620
that a little bit as much as might have been available or not it's perfectly fine

117
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:25,380
foreign like to invite us now to turn

118
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:31,500
to explore this question of doing being becoming and letting go

119
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:38,159
of that just for a minute as an exercise in this practice offering this Freedom

120
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:45,179
radical freedom to ourselves um as an act of meta to um to explore

121
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:50,580
that together in small groups in conversation what was that like what did

122
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:56,880
you notice um and the answer might be I fell asleep I was

123
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,360
and I was so relaxed I so I let go so much I wasn't even here that's fine not

124
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:09,360
a problem you can also offer your silence your presence and when your turn

125
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:16,620
comes to say past so let's Go reverse alphabetical order

126
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:22,919
um share just one thing one reflection about this exploration and the next person the next person then you can

127
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:28,019
after everyone has gone around then you can open it up for a conversation in the

128
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:33,179
time so not asking questions from one another

129
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:39,480
but just keeping it simple and light letting each person be in their experience just offer from your own

130
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:46,559
experience that's all if you don't want to offer you can offer silence and kindness offer kindness

131
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,960
offer freedom to each other no expectations see what what it's like to

132
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:57,000
take the spirit of this practice into the breakout rooms no expectations no

133
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:04,200
expectations of your of yourself so gonna create the rooms I'm opening them

134
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,480
up take care of yourselves take care of each other here we go

135
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:14,700
so everybody's back welcome back everyone now let's just take one or two

136
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:21,839
Reflections um what did you notice either in the meditation or in the uh

137
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:27,240
conversation about this topic of the heaviness and noticing the heaviness or

138
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:33,000
letting go of expectations oneself especially I like to invite those who haven't spoken recently to pull forward
