1
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:10,460
good morning greetings

2
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,440
and this is um sitting here in the

3
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:24,980
innermost meditation Hall of IMC

4
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:32,460
and this morning the reference point for the meditation

5
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:38,160
it will be intimacy and intimacy comes from a Latin word I

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,399
think intimus which means innermost or deepest

7
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,300
and intimacy can be it has two meanings in terms of meditation

8
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:58,260
one is to be aware from the most the innermost deepest

9
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,660
place within an intimacy

10
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,420
uh the place where awareness feels most intimate

11
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,479
where knowing feels most intimate the other meaning

12
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:24,020
is to have awareness be most intimate with our experience

13
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:31,380
that we don't stand far away we don't step back to watch or see things being

14
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:40,380
aware from a distance as we talked about yesterday but rather we get really close

15
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,140
and it's so close that uh it's a place where awareness and

16
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:52,619
Sensations meet and uh and really kind of feels really

17
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:59,898
going to be connected to touching in touch with our experience

18
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,880
and it's helped by the phenomena that Sensations

19
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:11,400
and sensing the sensations are inseparable

20
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,420
to have a sensation is to is to sense the sensations is to be aware of the

21
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:24,480
sensation and so this intimacy is right there to be right there where those two are the

22
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,239
same but the intimacy and mindfulness meditation can be even deeper

23
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:38,400
in that we go into we we kind of put attention inside of the experience we're having

24
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,300
so if we're experiencing the breathing maybe in the chest or in the belly the movements there

25
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,739
um almost like you imagine putting yourself in the middle of the breathing and the inside of the whole

26
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:57,780
experience and From the Inside Out being aware of breathing

27
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,000
it's a little bit more clear sometimes for some people around pain

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,580
that we can sometimes it's best to watch see the pain from a distance that's the

29
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,159
easiest way to have some equanimity sometimes it can be easier to go to that

30
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,980
innermost area of the pain to go inside the pain almost like you open the door and you

31
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:26,879
step inside of it because pain is not a unitary singular thing a singular thing

32
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,239
is made up of a variety of different Sensations and things and to go put yourself right into the middle of it the

33
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,340
heart of it and rest the tension there it's a very different relationship than

34
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:45,200
even being up against it touching it and sometimes when I've had extreme pain

35
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,120
the way that I've managed to stay somewhat balanced with it is to do that

36
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,299
that very thing I kind of let myself enter into into the middle of the pain

37
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:03,840
if I'm right at the edges of and touching it it's too easy to be in the reactive mode or thinking about it or

38
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:11,459
having an attitude or about it but if I put myself right in the middle of it then if something gets quiet

39
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:16,500
and the reactivity kind of Falls away or just there and then the pain becomes

40
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,139
something else or if there's pleasure not just to feel the pleasure

41
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:28,380
but kind of almost like go into it to feel its component parts feel how the

42
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:35,400
sensations of pleasure are dancing and moving and changing in and of themselves

43
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,400
so these two meanings of intimacy finding a place within where awareness

44
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,740
feels intimate to be aware that place there's a real intimacy from the inside

45
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,780
out that maybe is not felt if this in in the

46
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,960
head watching or the experience and then to kind of come really close so

47
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:04,860
close to the experience with awareness that you kind of sinking into it or settling into it

48
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,918
rather than even being against the edges of it touching it

49
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,680
so to take a uh upright

50
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:21,020
posture either literally or metaphorically

51
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,340
and to gently

52
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,660
close your eyes

53
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:44,820
and take some gently gentle long slow deep

54
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:51,780
breaths on the exhale relax into your body

55
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:57,780
settle down into your body like you're lowering yourself into

56
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,840
a very nice pool of water a bath

57
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,039
taking a deep breath in settling in

58
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,180
and letting your breathing come to normal

59
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,560
and on the exhales continue with the relaxing the body

60
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,400
and relaxing the face the shoulders the belly and each time you do

61
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,039
feel or love or imagine that you're

62
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:05,580
settling deeper inside the awareness is settling

63
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:11,960
deep to maybe the most intimate place within

64
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,680
and from a place of the innermost place from where you can

65
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,380
be aware or to feel sense your experience

66
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,060
become aware of your breathing

67
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:52,100
and find kind of what you think is the center of breathing

68
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:59,120
kind of the center of the innermost part of the whole experience of breathing

69
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:13,399
and let the awareness of that kind of intimacy with the breathing

70
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,980
not thinking about it

71
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:30,899
not being you who's aware of the breathing that's there

72
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:39,000
but all of you seemingly settling into the center of

73
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,459
your breathing as if there's an easy chair there in

74
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:50,480
which you can sit and from there be aware of

75
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:59,600
the sensations of breathing how those Sensations arise

76
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:09,259
as they're known as they're known their eyes

77
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:15,300
and if while you're aware meditating

78
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:20,839
something else becomes more predominant than breathing

79
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,620
bring yourself really close to that to the emotions

80
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,540
not to the thoughts but to the thinking mind

81
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,639
not to what you're listening to but inside

82
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:48,139
the listening in the Years sensations of listening

83
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:58,579
other sensations of your body that predominate

84
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,379
feel them from the inside out

85
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:11,520
with your ability to know and sense feel

86
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:17,400
be aware can you get be more intimate with the

87
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:23,700
experience be more intimate by putting aside your

88
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:29,880
stories your judgments your feelings of being for and against

89
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:36,240
what's happening almost as if you trust whatever is

90
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,240
happening in the present moment you trust that it's okay

91
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:50,100
to be intimately aware of it and from there breathing with it knowing

92
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,760
it deeply

93
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,299
foreign

94
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,480
foreign

95
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,320
foreign

96
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,140
thank you

97
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,980
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

98
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:16,980
to appreciate in intimacy here with oneself

99
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:23,179
in whatever every way that feels like you're away

100
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:32,220
is there some place where you can rest your attention Within that feels like home or feels comforting

101
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:40,340
or maybe it's a place that you don't easily share with other people

102
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:45,559
but in the privacy of meditation

103
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:52,580
you can open to it you can settle in it touch it

104
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:02,340
maybe it's in the heart or maybe there's something deeper than

105
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:09,080
the heart someplace deeper in the body

106
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,640
it could be anywhere

107
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,299
the place that's most intimate might be a place where

108
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:35,360
we have the most acceptance of ourselves

109
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,279
the most kindness and

110
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,940
to ourselves

111
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:56,779
the most sense of belonging to yourself in a

112
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:07,259
in a generous way in a full way here

113
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:19,580
and without anyone needing to know in the privacy of your own meditation

114
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:25,679
from the most intimate place within where you're capable of

115
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:32,000
love compassion kindness

116
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,539
good will

117
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:46,158
to rest in that place let awareness settle and feel

118
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:54,740
where you can have kindness

119
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:02,720
doesn't need to be expressed or spoken or no one needs to know about it

120
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:08,640
nothing you need to prove with it or accomplish

121
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:15,620
just the simplest place of tenderness of warmth

122
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:19,580
the generosity of heart

123
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:29,600
and from there to gaze upon the world kindly

124
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:38,399
from there invite your the whole world into your

125
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:46,880
heart as you allow your heart to become bigger and bigger

126
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:53,960
than your heart becomes infinitely large

127
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,640
to be able to hold the privacy of your own meditation

128
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:09,960
all beings everywhere maybe all beings and everywhere as if

129
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:16,320
they're your relations your relatives

130
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,799
your friends your fellow Companions and the journey

131
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,278
of life

132
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:33,539
and to gaze upon them kindly wishing them well

133
00:30:33,539 --> 00:30:38,480
wishing them safety and belonging and

134
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:45,200
a deep acceptance a deep

135
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:51,240
possibility of being able to share their deepest place

136
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:59,000
of intimacy with the world wishing that they too

137
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:04,580
could know and feel their own depth

138
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:09,860
and with that know the depths of others

139
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,039
may all beings be happy

140
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:20,659
may all beings

141
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:30,539
be safe may all beings

142
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:40,039
be peaceful may all beings be free

143
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:48,059
and may we stay close to where we can have these wishes

144
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:54,860
stay close to where we can gaze upon the world kindly and caringly

145
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:03,179
May our care kindness and generosity serve for the welfare and happiness of

146
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:05,539
the world

147
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:20,529
[Music]

148
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:17,099
okay so here we are at the third talk having to do with the locations for

149
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:24,898
awareness or the different locations for awareness

150
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:30,540
and um it's one thing to be aware it's one

151
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:36,720
thing to be mindful and know that that's there's only and

152
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,020
only know one way to be mindful one way to be aware

153
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:48,419
but um how we're aware

154
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:56,280
and where where where we are aware from can be a choice it can be variable can

155
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:02,760
be different and to be aware

156
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,160
to be able to have some you know a range of how to be aware and then to be able

157
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:15,900
to adjust how we're aware depending on the circumstances we're in is so important

158
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:21,900
because if we only have one way to be aware in some circumstances that way of

159
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:27,839
being aware is not doesn't serve us it doesn't really work

160
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:34,920
and so if we're only aware intimately the feelings and the emotions of what's

161
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:41,160
Happening and we're feeling our own suffering or other

162
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:47,839
people suffering and might feel overwhelming but if we can be aware

163
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:56,760
not through feeling and sensing but be aware in the mind's eye or in the knowing mind

164
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:02,700
Renaissance stepping back and having the bird's eye view of it then the impact of

165
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:09,240
the emotions that we have might not be as difficult as if we're living in them

166
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:14,940
but then sometimes if we're too distance and you know observing from

167
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:20,339
the head or from a hillside far away like I talked about yesterday

168
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:26,280
then it might be too aloof and not connected sometimes it helps to connect that way

169
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:32,040
and sometimes it doesn't and sometimes if we're a lot in our head thinking about things and we don't feel

170
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:39,480
what's going on for others or really ourselves then it's useful to know this way of being present intimately

171
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:45,480
and as we become more intimate we generally come in closer to where the

172
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:51,599
sensations are then and Sensations are closely also where emotions are and how they're felt

173
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,359
and there's two ways of being intimate coming in close one is like like there's

174
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:05,400
you know two things touch each other and sometimes I've given people the instructions to let awareness be like a

175
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:11,880
soft soft cotton gauze soft cotton ball and if there's a lot of uh very

176
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:19,440
difficult things inside pain or difficult emotions imagine that awareness is a soft cotton ball that

177
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:27,839
just gently Taps against the difficulty and then pulls away comes close in Taps and pulls away

178
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:34,740
and then it then we're there to acknowledge we feel we make space for how it actually is and really you know

179
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,960
commit contact so we're present but we don't overdo it by staying there too

180
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:45,780
long and knowing how to pull back and be a little bit further away makes room for

181
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:51,839
something to discharge and unravel settle for some confidence to be built

182
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:58,920
to begin feeling that we have some agency with what's going on we not have to just be aware in one way and then

183
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:05,760
stuck there so there's a this ability to kind of come close so then pull away come close

184
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:12,780
and pull away and then sometimes just be right there being really present

185
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:20,160
sometimes that intimacy is even deeper where we are going inside the experience

186
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,619
and inside the emotions in a sense are inside the physical Sensations we're

187
00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:32,520
having and from you know to penetrate it inside it's almost like we're knocking at the

188
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:38,040
door or we push the door gently and it opens up and we're able to step inside

189
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:44,160
and um and uh and what that does is it's kind of like

190
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:50,940
a pen kind of like um from the outside um of

191
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:57,240
the you know outside it just seems like things are covered it seems like a

192
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:03,660
single single object like but if you unwrap it and go inside then they find

193
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:09,480
out there's many presents inside there's many factors of Sensations things going

194
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,640
on inside of it and that can be true even in a little square centimeter of

195
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:21,000
pain or or tightness or warmth or pleasure that we feel that it's possible

196
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,640
actually to kind of almost feel like you're going uh you're

197
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:32,760
not staying in the surface of it making contact but you're actually going into it and start feeling what's in the

198
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:38,280
inside there and really sense and feel it and that's true with

199
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:45,000
ourselves as well with awareness awareness can be as I've been trying to

200
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,040
say this week can be variable where where how we're aware where where we're

201
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:55,740
from we can be in the head we can be in the you know more distant aloof

202
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:02,760
we could also discover where does it feel most intimate where is the innermost

203
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:09,740
place where there is awareness knowing um

204
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:17,700
deepest places of sentencing ourselves and that deepest place of intimacy

205
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:24,180
and uh and uh to settle in there to rest in there and feel that takes

206
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:29,820
time to feel it and get to know it and let it expand and spread through the body

207
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:36,119
and then to know from there maybe the breathing will help here because you can breathe with it then

208
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:41,838
through it and into it as a way of staying connected

209
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,060
so to come close to the experience to sense it

210
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:54,140
and and that could be you know on everyday life experiences

211
00:40:54,140 --> 00:41:01,020
where it's kind of at the kind of the largest life level where uh you you're

212
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:06,240
in a difficult situation and you stay and stay connected for a

213
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:12,839
while and then you choose to leave a while to regroup and then you come

214
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:19,079
back to go at a distance and watch the whole situation from a distance and then come

215
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:26,099
back if people at work are as a team kind of working in hard and hot and trying to figure something out and and you're part

216
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:32,099
of that kind of you know in the intensity of people huddling together and not managing to figure out what's

217
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:39,119
going on or some difficulty find some way to step away and look at it from a distance

218
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,579
see if that regroups you and gives you a different perspective and a different way of coming back and joining and

219
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:51,000
participating in many social situations I think it's a

220
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,820
useful skill is to step outside and get some fresh air and then come back in

221
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:01,980
so here we have this intimacy you know we're close close in and then we learn

222
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:08,160
how to step away uh one one place that people allow you to step away is you excuse yourself

223
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,339
saying I I need to go to the bathroom and most people are not going to

224
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:18,900
question what you're doing in the bathroom what you're doing is you're going to breathe

225
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:26,099
you're going to meditate sitting you know on the toilet door not using it but just uh just there's a

226
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:31,320
place to chill so in all kinds of circumstances this

227
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:37,500
art of coming in close feeling it being with it and then learning how to step

228
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:43,200
away and then finding the right balance and finding out what's the right distance

229
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,540
sometimes at the right distance might be not as far away as you could be but it

230
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:54,300
could be kind of you know it's like like a personal space how much personal space do you need

231
00:42:54,300 --> 00:43:01,980
around people if they can come into your personal space and it feels like it's too much some situations it's good to be three

232
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:07,020
feet away so I mean it could be 10 feet away where's the right distance where it

233
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:13,619
allows you to be most settled and present in a useful way and the same principle applies then to

234
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:18,960
the inner awareness inner knowing and mindfulness that we can adjust how we're

235
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,800
aware and when we're really intimate and when we're not so intimate when we're feeling it and when we're more

236
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:33,420
cognitively knowing it which is most useful in different situations different ones are useful

237
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:42,300
so then repeating myself but it's such an important point if you only know how to be aware one way

238
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:48,540
then sooner or later that one way is not appropriate that one way is not going to

239
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:54,359
be helpful or useful it might actually be difficult or cause more problems because

240
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:59,819
some some situations feeling what's happening is not really the best thing

241
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:07,339
to do this other situation it is the best thing to do simple at times being more in the head

242
00:44:07,339 --> 00:44:13,260
maybe even observing or thinking about knowing it in some cognitive way is the

243
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:20,520
best thing to do and sometimes it's a not that good thing to do and sometimes being far away imagining you're kind of

244
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:27,839
from a distance um and so all these different ways of knowing and locations of knowing

245
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:35,300
so for today um and um

246
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:38,720
if you can

247
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:48,000
if you want try intimacy try what it's like to really be in touch

248
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,280
with things and maybe even imagine you're actually going into it

249
00:44:53,280 --> 00:45:00,500
it could be something even as simple as eating your food what would it mean to be intimate with your food rather than

250
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:08,460
eating while you're listening to the news or something and what's it like to be intimate with

251
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:13,859
sitting in a chair what's he how would that feel here intimacy

252
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:20,339
how would it be what's intimacy like in meditation what's a certain kind of intimacy

253
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:28,140
that doesn't cross an appropriate lines certain kind of knowing awareness intimacy as you're

254
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:33,240
listening to a friend they don't have to know that you're feeling intimate but what's a way of

255
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:39,900
being really there and touching feeling what's happening internally so you

256
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:47,460
really feel connected and um so intimacy

257
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,800
so thank you and um and we'll kind of continue and

258
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:59,660
kind of build on this tomorrow and I hope that um you

259
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:06,599
kind of can appreciate playing around with awareness in mindfulness and

260
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:12,900
knowing and sensing and begin living in the playground of these things

261
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,619
thank you
