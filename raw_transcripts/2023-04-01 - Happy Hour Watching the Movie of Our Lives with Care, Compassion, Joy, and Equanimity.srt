so so the themes I want to bring in maybe

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,500
I'll just say a very quick word and we'll transition to meditating

6
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:41,160
one is this this appreciation appreciation for this being who is me being

7
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,460
a character in this play called life in a particular time in a particular

8
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:54,899
zeitgeist I've been teaching at 7 A.M about the

9
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:00,000
Improv of the Dharma the Dharma of improv and the taking on characters and

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,299
seeing ourselves as a character yeah this kind of a character was showing up because of all these cause

11
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,700
and conditions so little lightness to the way we see ourselves the way we

12
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:17,340
relate to this being who is me it's one idea I want to bring in and um

13
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,580
and the other one is sense that oh this this dear character meta for this dear

14
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:30,659

101
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,220
using ibrahimovihara

102
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,840
foreign

103
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,320

joys happiness in their life yay celebrating

108

scenes of happiness letting yourself be happy

109
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:40,320
reliving perhaps or being happy for those moments of happiness

110
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:48,799
not so much reliving but deteriorizing gratitude arising

111
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,620
if scenes of challenge difficulty arise I think

112
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:01,158
therapy sucker compassion Etc

113
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:08,658

to learn be kind

120
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:19,559
sometimes failing and it's okay for giving this character

121
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:25,440

00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:29,880
thanks everyone thank you for your practice thanks for exploring this practice and

131
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:36,360
in in a novel different way we had never quite practiced in this way so many ways

132
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:43,080
to practice so many ways to to practice with the Brahma vihar is the Heavenly abodes the the four beautiful

133
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:51,120
practices so so the invitation tonight was to this

134
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:56,940
sense of perspective of ourselves the protagonists this plane

135
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:02,460
called our life and watching with with the Brahma vihar is watching scenes from

136
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:10,760
our lives with and whatever those scenes arise maybe they realize Compassion maybe their eyes would detach all of yay

137
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:18,059
maybe the whole Arc of the movie gives rise to a Calamity yes ups and

138
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:25,980
downs ups and downs yes this is human life this is what it's like and always always sense of matter I

139
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:31,440
always sense of Good Will good will for this character it's trying their best

140
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,559
so many many things that might have come up and uh

141
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:44,279
and it's all good it's all okay as long as there was a moment of kindness

142
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:49,440
more compassion or more data or any of the Brahma viharas if just one moment of

143
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,320
it it's all good it's all good it's all planting seeds so

144

00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:04,740
while in the large group I'd like to invite you to step forward and if you

165
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:11,340
have spoken recently step back so that we can hear from and folks who haven't shared in a while

166
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:17,000
um or ever so Amy please

167
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,380
hey so this I love this perspective on looking at life as if we're like

168
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:28,019
watching ourselves in a movie it's great I think I'm gonna carry that with me

169
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:33,779
and uh it reminded me a few things one is Defending Your Life um not all this is an old movie where

170
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:39,539
they're watching their lives after at the end um and try to decide if they're gonna go back to Earth and do it again

171
00:33:39,539 --> 00:33:45,059
differently and better or go on to something else and it's a little bit of a cringy movie but it's like similar in

172
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:52,019
that way um and then the other thing it had me thinking about was with internal family systems and this which is like Arts work

173
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:59,340
where you have like these different parts of yourself but as I was watching the movie I was like oh there's this part of me wanting to do that and then

174
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:05,100
trying to be compassionate and equitous about that and then this other part of me the one's the opposite oh that's cute

175
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:11,280
that's fun and then you know just kind of like noticing all of it um but trying to come from that yeah

176
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,099
that like Buddha Dharma land um if I'm watching it off it's very

177
00:34:17,099 --> 00:34:23,520
sweet thank you thank you Amy thank you so much it was just so lovely getting Goosebumps as as

178
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,940
you're sharing um this this compassionate perspective on on your life and and all the person I'm familiar

179
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:35,638
with ifs internal family systems I love the framework so to have that like oh

180
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:42,300
yeah that's that poor sweetheart yes yes oh sweet oh you won the complete opposite oh you too sweetheart it's just

181
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:47,820

182
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:54,720

186
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:22,140
what came up for me was was gratitude um because I have a a relatively

187
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:27,900
Newfound equanimity that has developed over the past year or so

188
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:35,460
um and Doc went through some stuff today that would have bothered me much more a couple years ago and now it doesn't

189
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:40,560
phase me that much and I felt a great deal of Joy over that and it's because

00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:48,420

198
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:42,420
there's no doubt I have full trust this is awesome people are asking what's the name of the

199
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:48,540
movie the name of the movie was yes thank you Amy Defending Your Life Defending Your Life

200
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:55,980
um PT um are you saying that PT arose when you were practicing PT meaning Joy arose

201
00:36:55,980 --> 00:37:03,020
when you're practicing you're not quite sure about that but you can comment there SRI Devi

202
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:10,680
Meineke really enjoyed the the you know the topic um so I have a you know I asked a lot of

203
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,619
questions so my question is uh I want to you know I'm most of okay I

204
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:21,960
like to be honest so it seems that white lies are required by adults

205
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:28,440
um so I don't want to do White Lies so how do we say things

206
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,480
say the truth but at the Saint not heard I don't know like

207
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:39,960
don't hurt the other person but at the same time it should be the truth

208
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:48,000
yeah well truthfulness is is no I actually recently wrote a piece on right

209
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,740
speech on why speech that just showed up that just came out in lines or magazines so you can look at that but but

210
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:00,780
um since it's a little off topic for today but but I uh what you're asking

211
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,820
but I will say that there are different guidelines for for why speech and

212
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:11,579
truthfulness is very important and it's important um not only truthfulness is important

213
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:17,760
but but but even more so there is this idea of not causing harm not causing

214
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,099
harm so with the white lie consider how are you causing harm

215
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:30,240
Force to yourself to others is there a way um to not cause harm

216
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:36,300
and um so it's really becomes a an inquiry

217
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:43,040
um so the Buddha of course talked you know being truthful and factual is one of the the

218
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:50,220
it's part of the right speech and yet you know people often ask you know if if

219
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:55,380
they you're living during you know World War II and the Nazis knocked on your

220
00:38:55,380 --> 00:39:01,500
door and you were hiding people who are being prosecuted you have to you know do you have to be truthful I can think well

221
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:08,880
that's where's the harm who's going to be harmed in what way which is a really big frame and maybe in the cases that

222
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:16,079
you're talking about maybe actually you're hurting your own Integrity more by telling the white lie than actually

223
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,960
just being honest and making yourself uncomfortable and making the other person uncomfortable so through just a

224
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:27,900
lot of considerations I can give just a one size fits all answers but just an

225
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:33,960
inquiry for all the the different questions that you need to ask all the different considerations for why speech

226
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:41,180
you can look up the various considerations for why speech you're welcome

227
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:49,680
yeah thanks sure and oh look there is

228
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,560

232
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:21,078
