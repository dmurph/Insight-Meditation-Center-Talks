1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:11,840
good morning good day here we are again on our week of meditating with the

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,240
Inner Mountain and so we've been going through

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:26,400
uh this metaphor in various ways and um yesterday we did uh expand

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:33,600
this sitting with the mountain uh in a way that expresses the whole ecosystem

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:43,200
within like the mountain mountain ranges it's um a whole ecosystem with its trees

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,640
the forests uh Earth rocks

7
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:56,719
streams and so today uh we are going to uh expand even

8
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:03,440
further um to include

9
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:12,000
space the mountains don't exist uh separate from the space that's

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
all around and that's within and it is so for uh this body

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:27,439
this mind and heart and there is a space within and that there's a space all

12
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:34,200
around and so meditating like a space

13
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,079
including uh the whole ecosystem of the mountain

14
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:48,159
within so um with that uh let's meditate

15
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,920
[Music]

16
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,840
allow the words to

17
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:14,400
settle arriving arriving at the Temple of this

18
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,120
body mind and

19
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:31,840
heart coming here and now

20
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,360
with a gentleness and a

21
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:50,239
care without demanding for things to be otherwise

22
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,480
arriving with a few long deep breaths if you

23
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:20,599
like arriving with a sound and a silence if you like

24
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:40,000
arriving with the global sense of the body sitting lying down

25
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:07,920
whatever the measure of a disease or

26
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:16,079
pain is included arriving with it

27
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,639
not dismissing anything

28
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:06,800
sensing the lower half of the body if you're sitting

29
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,800
upright the pelvic floor feet

30
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:21,080
legs settling downwards towards Earth

31
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:31,520
underneath and if you're lying down you're sensing the whole body

32
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,840
resting

33
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,280
down like the mountains

34
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:10,039
rooting in the earth

35
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:31,560
underneath stable

36
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,680
steady our mind can become

37
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,400
steady with the

38
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,840
feelings sitting like a mountain

39
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,400
sitting like a aive

40
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,520
Mountain the trees

41
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:42,120
breathe the streams in the mountain

42
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:00,280
flow the creatures

43
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,039
are alive in the

44
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,919
mountains feeling sensing

45
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,360
including the movements the

46
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,680
livess in addition to the stability and Stillness

47
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:12,240
including the waves of emotions if they're

48
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,240
present

49
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:29,320
moods like a weather systems in the mountain

50
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:06,760
feeling and sensing without having to comment on

51
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,160
your

52
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,839
experience noticing space

53
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,839
or a felt sense of a

54
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:47,920
spaciousness that's within this body and all around

55
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,920
my vast space and the mountains are not

56
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,360
separate here too in this

57
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:26,720
body we can feel and then

58
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,680
sense the space ious

59
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,120
nness that holds

60
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:06,360
everything softening and relaxing into the spaciousness

61
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:43,600
the space doesn't have

62
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:51,839
conflicts with our emotions

63
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:02,120
thoughts it offers vast

64
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,560
room for things to float

65
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
through

66
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040

80
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:09,799
no spaciousness and the spacious

81
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:19,600
knowing holds all aspects or all parts of

82
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,600
ourselves

83
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:38,080
the whole of ourselves our health

84
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:06,000
give yourself a [Music] permission to

85
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:12,000
soften and ease

86
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:17,158
into this spacious

87
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520

98

e

99
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
e

100
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
e

101
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,039
e

102
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,039
e

103
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
e for

104
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:22,240
as the sound of the Bell Rings notice what have shifted within

105
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:29,639
yourself maybe the breath has changed

106
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:38,480
Sensations in the body heart and mind

107
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:49,750
[Music]

108
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:27,120
so today um I brought a reflection based on a sua

109
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,880
in De AA there is this sua called

110
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:40,559
parasa and the assuta documented the last days of the Buddha in his life um

111
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:46,960
there was a very touching exchange between the Buddha and his personal

112
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:54,600
attendant uh for a few decades uh Ananda and the Buddha was in his last

113
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:02,158
days of his life and the Ananda was stressed

114
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:08,880
out and so the Buddha said to him so

115
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,200
Ananda live as your own Island your own

116
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:21,639
Refuge with no other Refuge let the teaching be your Island

117
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:30,039
and your Refuge with no other refuge and how does a practitioner do

118
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:36,720
this it's when the practitioner meditates by observing the aspect of the

119
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,840
body King aware and mindful read of

120
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,840
covetousness and displeasure for the world and that goes with the

121
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:55,360
feelings mind States and the Damas and many of you would know and

122
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:04,600
this is the teachings of the Sati and so this is how a practitioner is

123
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:10,358
their own Island their own Refuge with no other

124
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:18,960
refuge and this is how the teaching is their Island their refuge and with no

125
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:26,560
other Refuge so today I'd like to speak a

126
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,638
little bit about um this aspect of Refuge um that the

127
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:40,839
Buddha called live as your own Refuge refuge in

128
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:47,480
oneself in the past few days and I shared some Reflections and about the

129
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,760
Refuge in the triple Jam the Buddha Dharma and

130
00:34:52,760 --> 00:35:02,599
S and I pointed out that each of this ref huge um has an external Dimension uh

131
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:10,520
kind of this protection we go to or shelter we go to and and there's also an

132
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:17,280
internal Dimension and so each of this triple Jam

133
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,640
um as we practice aligned with it they come alive in

134
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,760
us and so towards the end of the Buddha uh

135
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:36,400
life he's pointing back to one's own role in the

136
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:44,720
practice and note that uh the Buddha said live as your own refuge and let the

137
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:53,440
teachings be your Refuge back to back to me uh this two are not separate

138
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,119
uh they are connected refuge in one on self and

139
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:05,200
refuge in Dharma uh are kind of um you know kind

140
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,720
of like a two sides of the coin uh in some way and they each highlight some

141
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:17,920
important aspect of the practice and I wanted to teas apart this

142
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:26,240
a bit uh today and so first uh this an aspect of living as our

143
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,560
own Refuge it highlights uh our role in the

144
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:40,319
practice uh it's helpful to remember that the Dharma uh was taught by the

145
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:45,760
Buddha um but we have to practice it we have to do

146
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,000
it and um no one can do it for

147
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,440
us and in uh ad damata there is this verse um it says

148
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:08,039
it's up to you to make a diligent effort tatas simply tell you

149
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:18,599
how and so um and it's interesting to feel into this and it may seem quite

150
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:27,000
obvious and you know there's a sense of um and we have to practice it but in

151
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,520
reality it's not always easy to do so often we

152
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:40,839
don't always trust our own capacity to practice practice with what's difficult

153
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:49,400
practice with what's hard you know we have a lot of um only y kind of conditions you know

154
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:55,599
if the weather is bad you know then it's really hard it's too hot it's too cold

155
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,800
or our neighbors are having party it's too loud and

156
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:07,440
uh you know all kinds of things you can think of the Milling reasons that we

157
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:14,599
feel we're not up to the practice and and I know that feeling

158
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:20,760
myself at times and sometimes it can feel like oh

159
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:26,160
you know we're just going to wait for some magical situation to come

160
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:32,520
in so that doesn't really sound like a refuge does

161
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:40,720
it and I remember when I was uh when I um when my son was just born and that

162
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:47,119
was a time that I um was really King on going on Retreats and and clearly I

163
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:53,560
couldn't go to retreat and so I had the thought wow you know well that means

164
00:38:53,560 --> 00:39:00,319
that I I can't practice sounds pretty straightforward

165
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:06,960
unfortunately I didn't quite believe that thought and I was very fortunate that I

166
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:16,359
came across the book on about deep and who a amazing householder

167
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:24,480
practitioner that he in she instructed all kinds of uh lay householders to

168
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:31,720
practice in the midst of things happening nursing babies kind of

169
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:40,040
just exactly kind of what I needed uh cooking washing and working all kinds of

170
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:48,319
things and that was so opening for me and all of the sudden that there is a

171
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:58,160
whole new uh Paradigm of the way of a practicing that began to open up to me

172
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:06,760
and so this also leads to this a second aspect of uh live as our own Refuge

173
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,760
refuge in ourselves and that is I liked that the

174
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:20,480
uh Buddha use the verb uh in this that live as your own

175
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:27,560
refuge and there is um uh there is another sutta that also says make an an

176
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:33,480
island of yourself or make yourself a

177
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:42,119
refuge somehow this verbs uh live or make signifies that this is an active

178
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:49,079
process that we're engaging in it's not that somehow automatically

179
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:56,200
you know we're just you know we're our refuge um but this heart and mind can be

180
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:04,960
trained we often uh look for external conditions

181
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:12,359
as a resort because we don't quite feel safe within

182
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:18,560
ourselves and the different parts may kind of fight fight against each

183
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:28,079
other um and uh uh in our meditation I invited this

184
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,760
possibility to make space for all parts of

185
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,720
ourselves and so they can exist together you know whether it's the part that

186
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,319
feels pain and uh want to be uh relieved

187
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:54,680
of pain or whether it's the part that feel depressed or um

188
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:02,200
frustrated they are there with a reason or with the reasons that we may not even

189
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:10,040
know but the fact that they exist ask for our permission to allow them to be

190
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:15,440
there and so there's a process of making ourselves a

191
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:24,240
refuge is to cultivate a way to allow all this parts to be to have a room to

192
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:33,319
have a space and so there are not to be denied they shouldn't be here no they are here

193
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:37,640
welcome welcome the them

194
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:45,359
in and so this um process of live as our

195
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:50,559
own Refuge making uh uh ourselves a

196
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:58,720
refuge um is for us to begin to learn and cultivate this kind of Inner Space

197
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:04,400
inner safety inner well-being and inner

198
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:11,880
ease uh where the whole of ourselves can

199
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:19,240
belong and that takes a cultivation and little by little with a humility and

200
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:24,599
with a dignity and it's not easy you know I'm not saying this is

201
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:30,680
easy um but the invitation is to uh not

202
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,960
too quickly and easily resort to the

203
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:43,160
tendency of saying oh no this is too hard but staying with the

204
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:48,359
hardships staying with that which may be

205
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:57,359
difficult it reminds me of another sutta um that um the Buddha pointed out the

206
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:04,240
noble disciples uh uh there was a dialogue between uh a

207
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:11,520
deity with the Buddha and the deity was complaining that the practice path is

208
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:18,000
hard and the path is rough and hard to travel and the Buddha

209
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,800
says uh the noble disciples um walks the path even if it's

210
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:33,559
a hard and difficult they do it even when it's

211
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:42,160
hard and so this process of making and living uh the

212
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:49,240
practice that the Buddha is pointing out so making yourself a refuge and let the

213
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:54,359
Dharma be the Refuge through the sincere

214
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:59,720
practice and including every everything including

215
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:09,000
everything and so that's the invitation uh for your contemplation and for your savoring of

216
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:16,800
um how uh ourselves might um be a

217
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,079
refuge and so thank you thank you

218
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,119
everyone and I'll see you tomorrow
