1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:07,879
oh it's time so welcome to our YouTube Community everyone um as um I mentioned a minute

2
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:15,679
ago my it's my first time here uh doing a YouTube live um it's here in 7 am in

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,760
California I'm in Sunnyvale um and I'm delighted to be

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:28,279
sharing the Dharma with all of you so um I'll begin with just a little

5
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:36,440
bit um uh a few decades ago there was a global meditation event um it was called

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:45,280
the harmonic convergence where uh people all over the world celebrated a rare Celestial event

7
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,960
and um and meditated together uh no matter where they were though they had

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,879
parties and celebrations and um and a couple of friends and I decided to join

9
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:04,158
them in spirit you know and to do it at Sunrise by meditating the top of a

10
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,159
nearby Mountain it was a beautiful a inspiring

11
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:17,479
Vista where we sat it was just and it was you know just daylight had just started and um we made ourselves really

12
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:25,200
comfortable bundled up in our blankets and just getting ready to really appreciate and joined the world

13
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,920
in meditation and um when a fly started by messing

14
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,920
around and very very quickly the little Annoying fly became much more compelling

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,119
than the beautiful Vista than the feeling of harmony with the

16
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:51,240
world and um in mindfulness practice we can pay attention to what's

17
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,119
easiest to notice to what's obvious so I became mindful of the

18
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,719
obvious how much I dislike The Buzz it was going to land on me the tension

19
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:12,440
my body was tight I wanted to take action against the fly um but I began to see the aversion

20
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:18,440
clearly and I saw it clearly the body relaxed and it gradually

21
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,080
dissipated and then what was obvious was that the fly had landed between the

22
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,480
three of us and it was the largest fly I'd ever seen I saw the body and the wings of the

23
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:38,720
fly and the way the sun reflected on it with the blue luminescence it was

24
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:46,200
beautiful and then I noticed a sense of affection for the little being that had joined our

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,800
meditation so just by seeing what was obvious it allowed my relationship to

26
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:59,480
the fly to transform from aversion to affectionate curiosity

27
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:07,280
so it can be helpful at the beginning of a sitting to just take a couple of minutes to establish a supportive

28
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:13,440
atmosphere in the mind a welcoming attitude to whatever

29
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,959
arises an attitude that says yes this belongs whatever shows

30
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,480
up so let's

31
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,280
sit take a comfortable and alert posture

32
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,920
gently closing your eyes taking a little time to settle into

33
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,680
your meditation posture arriving

34
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,760
here in this body in this

35
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:58,159
place in this room on this Earth

36
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:09,799
setting aside any thoughts and concerns you may have you can put them on a

37
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:16,639
shelf for the time being being fully

38
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,680
here centered in this body

39
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:38,680
and from within the body as part of the body becoming aware of your

40
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:45,919
breathing however you experience it noticing the movements and sensations

41
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:54,198
of breathing maybe you notice how the chest and ribs expand and

42
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,720
contract or the belly rising and falling

43
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:07,919
or the air moving in and out of the nose and

44
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:19,360
throat being at ease with whatever we notice however you feel these movements

45
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:53,479
now taking a few long slow deep breaths with each in breath nourishing

46
00:05:53,479 --> 00:06:00,680
the body with air feeling the body expanding

47
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,039
and with each exhale allowing the body to relax a little more

48
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:13,400
deeply to soften to

49
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:21,400
open letting go of any tensions any bracing

50
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:42,280
allowing the breath to return to its natural Rhythm noticing however the sensations

51
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:49,680
of breathing are easiest to feel and allowing the tension to rest

52
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,360
there this is your home base your

53
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:02,360
anchor it can be helpful to bring in attitude of friendliness to whatever

54
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:09,160
shows up we're here to discover what's present

55
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:15,800
what arises to get to know the mind more

56
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:30,199
intimately and if ideas or concerns show up

57
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:36,759
put them aside in favor of her actual physical

58
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,360
experience being intimate with the breath with the rhythm of

59
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
breathing

60
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440

it and gently escorted back to the breath welcome it home

69
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:37,880

e e

103
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:37,679
just as it's helpful to take a few minutes to settle into

104
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:45,080
meditation it's useful to do so in coming out a simple way to do this when I ring

105
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:50,679
the bell is to take a couple of slow deep breaths again before opening your

106
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:53,679
eyes

107
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:31,439
[Music]

108
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,120
thank you

109
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:05,600
that the theme this week will be on different aspects of

110
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,760
both knowing and not

111
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:18,320
knowing it can be said that inside meditation is based on knowing the mind

112
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:23,480
for the purpose of freeing the mind of being fully at

113
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:29,640
peace but only by deeply knowing how our minds work can we free the

114
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:36,360
mind and we can only know something well if we pay attention to it

115
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:44,000
closely in this Insight practice we value the quality of how we know

116
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:51,000
something we develop our ability to pay attention but we do so with

117
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,120
equinity so even if what we want is unwanted we can meet it with respect and

118
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:06,279
meet it with careful attention um asham brah there's a story

119
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:13,320
that aan brown tells about one of his monks um he's a Abbot of a monastery in

120
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:18,960
a remote area of Australia and um one of his monks was

121
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,679
having trouble with his teeth and he was procrastinating going to the dentist you

122
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:32,840
know knowing he had to have a tooth pulled and it was so such a long trip and of course monks don't drive so one

123
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:39,559
day a br saw the monk Standing Outside The Tool Shed with a pair of pliers

124
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:44,679
holding a bloody tooth it was obvious he had just pulled his own

125
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:50,799
tooth so he asked him you know how are you able to do that didn't it

126
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:56,720
hurt and so the monk responded that he was in his coutti in his little Hut when

127
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,600
he decided to pull out his own tooth but he hesitated at first you know and and

128
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,639
he asked himself um does it hurt now and he

129
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:15,840
answered himself well no and so he walked over to the shed across the long

130
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:24,320
field you know and in that time apprehension arose so he again asked himself does it hurt now

131
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,559
no and so he reached the shed and put his hand on the door handle and he asked

132
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:36,240
does it hurt now no and next he found the pliers and held

133
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:44,600
them to his tooth and he asked himself does it hurt now no and then he yanked the tooth out

134
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:54,279
he thought to himself that hurt but not for long um the point being that during his

135
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:59,720
walk to the shed he didn't cut up get CAU up in the emotional pain that can

136
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:05,080
arise and we're afraid in anticipation of pain or anticipation of something we

137
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:12,480
don't want so the monk was mindful enough moment to moment that he was able to see

138
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,000
clearly there was no pain in the moment until he yanked the

139
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,399
tooth was a lot less suffering than anticipating the pain all the way to the

140
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:30,039
shed when we worry about future suffering we're not seeing that in this

141
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:37,039
moment the imagin pain is not there the imagin situation is not

142
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:44,919
here and that all the pain and worry is extra it's

143
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:53,000
unnecessary and um going to continue with the teaching that rahula gave his

144
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,960
son um the Buddha gave his son rahula

145
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:06,320
uh from maim Manaya 62 and he said rahula meditate like the

146
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:12,878
Earth for when you meditate like the Earth Pleasant and unpleasant contacts

147
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:18,760
will not occupy your mind suppose they were to toss both

148
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:26,720
clean and unclean things on the earth like feces urine

149
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:33,878
spit us and blood the Earth isn't horrified it's not repelled or disgusted

150
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:40,398
because of this in the same way meditate like the

151
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:46,000
Earth for when you meditate like the Earth Pleasant and pleasant contacts

152
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,440
will not occupy your

153
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:58,200
mind so to know something to learn something as I said requires your

154
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:04,880
attention it requires or interest which arises from a curious

155
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:12,680
mind in mindfulness practice the object of attention is not

156
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:20,119
as important as the observing mind the idea is that whatever arises

157
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:25,599
whether it's a physical sensation an emotion a

158
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:32,760
mood a state of mind is present whatever arises is worthy of our attention so we

159
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:38,599
can meditate like the Earth and sometimes things show up that

160
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:45,599
we don't like fear anxiety restlessness physical

161
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:51,720
discomfort or maybe things we're not interested in like boredom

162
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,079
impatience we can bring interest to something we're not naturally interested

163
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:04,520
in we can bring interest to something we don't like and we can do that by inclining the

164
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:10,839
mind to be interested what I mean by that is that

165
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:19,680
um as first we see that we're rejecting what's present and we can aim to be interested

166
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,960
and not force anything we just know in our hearts that okay that's the direction we're going for I'm going to

167
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:31,079
engage with that uh with whatever it is we're not wanting we're not

168
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:37,319
liking and in the same way that um you know uh let's say for instance we need

169
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:42,359
to get up in the morning extra early and uh we have to set the clock

170
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:50,000
you know we we want to set it for you know just in case we don't wake up in time but our unconscious mind can wake

171
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,280
us up before the clock maybe you've experienced that already and in the same

172
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,160
way when we incline the mind to be interested um you know the unconscious

173
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:07,720
mind does the work of bringing the interest in of it as we turn towards the object we're we're looking to get

174
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:17,680
interested in um an example for myself um I once was a

175
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:23,359
project manager for an extensive building renovation at the retreat center where I

176
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:28,440
I had to make major decisions about the two septic systems there

177
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:34,680
and I had absolutely zero natural interest in septic systems at the

178
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:40,839
time I had lots of resistance to the amount of learning I needed to do I had

179
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:46,480
no background but I was committed to letting go of my resistance and I

180
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,800
persevered with it it became pretty obvious to me that

181
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:58,359
every moment of resisting was a moment without learning that it took a a lot more time

182
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:06,480
to learn something if I spent a lot of that time resisting it so I began to approach the process by

183
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,359
reading just one paragraph at a time or one diagram at a time and gradually my

184
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:18,880
interest grew and as the interest grew I was able to

185
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:26,280
learn and things gradually began to click into place in my mind and there was such a rewarding

186
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:31,400
sense of now now that I understood what was happening with the septic

187
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:38,640
system uh and I knew what I didn't know I knew what I needed to know and I started to understand how to

188
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,760
go about making a

189
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,160
decision so generally speaking knowing something gives us a sense of

190
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:58,119
confidence we know how to do our job you know how to do cook breakfast when we learn a skill

191
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:06,480
like playing a piano we may start out not knowing how to do it we become more and more confident as we keep

192
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:15,160
practicing and so you can watch an infant go from falling over backwards to walking with confidence in a period of

193
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:22,520
months so every moment of knowing develops um a confidence in the practice

194
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:28,880
a confidence in our s knowing what's here right now at any given

195
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:35,800
moment what's here regardless of what it

196
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:44,280
is and as we learn to meet all our moments in our life with mindfulness with careful

197
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:50,000
attention including the challenging moments we can develop an inner strength

198
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,200
and confidence and the trust that we meet that we can meet all our moments as

199
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,318
they change

200
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:10,240
and um and they're they

201
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:18,079
um we know what's here and we don't know what's next even if we have an idea of

202
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:25,520
what's next we don't really know what it's going to be like it's always different and there different aspects of

203
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:33,160
not knowing that that are really useful to hold with an open hand we don't know

204
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:39,920
what the future holds even whatever we imagine is not

205
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:46,359
real uh if there's confusion in the mind you know we may not know what's happening within

206
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:53,920
ourselves or confusion Our Lives we may not know that or there might be a larger not

207
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:00,040
knowing of not knowing the universe not knowing the whole of life we can't know

208
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:08,680
all of that but knowing that we don't know allows us to connect with our

209
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:16,200
experience Suzuki roshi said in relation to having an open mind in The Beginner's

210
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:22,280
mind there are many possibilities but in the expert's mind there are

211
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:28,720
few a beginner's mind supports a mind rich with curiosity

212
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,359
an attitude of not knowing helps us be open to others opinions other ways of

213
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:42,359
seeing things new Solutions new ideas new

214
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:55,480
experiences confusious said to know what you know and what you don't know that is

215
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:03,640
true knowledge there's a lot more in the universe that we don't know at any given

216
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:08,880
moment there's a lot more even in just our minds and body at any given moment

217
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,000
that we don't know there's a lot more about the future

218
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:21,760
about our life ahead that can't be known every future moment is unknown in

219
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,000
the present only imagined

220
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:34,559
but knowing the future can also be seen Through The Eyes of the excited Explorer

221
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:40,480
traveling in a new territory in a foreign country not knowing what will

222
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:46,880
happen next interested in everything they see it's all new to

223
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:54,440
them we can have a welcoming attitude to both what we know and what we don't know

224
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,720
wanted or unwanted

225
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:06,280
the know the knowing of mindfulness develops in US trust and

226
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:12,599
confidence to meet whatever shows up being interested in what we don't

227
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:21,640
know allows us to grow being aware of our moments allows

228
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:28,880
our lives to flow and like a river or lives flow into

229
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,078
the

230
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:43,200
unknown so tomorrow I'll continue the topic um of knowing and not knowing with

231
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,240
a focus on knowing and clear

232
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:59,799
comprehension so may the benefits of her practice together Ripple out into the

233
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:07,800
world may all beings be happy all beings be peaceful and

234
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:16,480
free so thank you all for your practice thank you
