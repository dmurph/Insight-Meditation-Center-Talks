meditate

e

18
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,840
e e

19
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,799
just enjoying the uh Stillness

20
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:11,120
just pouring your awareness into your

21
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,199
body making your body bright

22
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:23,799
vibrant with

23
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
awareness

24
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
e

25
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,680
e e

26
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,440
it's a sense of uh deep

27
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,280
kindness towards uh all

28
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:34,160
conditioning the uncountable UN knowable

29
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:45,520
forces that have birthed this

30
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,198
moment and its uh joy and sorrow

31
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,800
and ordinarily we focus

32
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:29,759
on the effects of that which we seem to have controlled others seem to have

33
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:38,520
controlled we have focus on that which is uh

34
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,599
conscious but there are so many forces that have come to

35
00:07:54,599 --> 00:08:01,440
shape this moment that we cannot even see

36
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:44,800
but we can uh bow to our conditioning as

37
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:54,720
a it's an animal with an evolutionary history it's an

38
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,120
Earthling with a home

39
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,959
maybe this is a way of saying we come

40
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,880
to forgive

41
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,720
history not condone

42
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,319
but open our heart

43
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:18,360
to the way is the past is

44
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:28,800
present all the forces that have shaped what we call me my life

45
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:46,000
all the things you like and dislike

46
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,519
about who you

47
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,240
are we just stop picking and choosing and just

48
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,959
say okay my

49
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:26,959
life and then there's compassion for your suffering there's

50
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:31,240
joy for your good fortune

51
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:41,519
there's equinity for the nearly complete hopelessness that defines any

52
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:54,839
life and there's a lot kindness tenderness

53
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:06,399
for what we call me my

54
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,959
life just appreciate your life in this way as we begin our

55
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
practice

56
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

57
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

58
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

59
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,079
e e

60
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:27,440
forever we've been categorizing sorting out what is

61
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:34,440
acceptable and what is unacceptable about ourselves what

62
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:41,279
aspects of our conditioning are acceptable what's

63
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,880
unacceptable What feelings are acceptable which unacceptable

64
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,199
just end all of that right

65
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,759
now and you may still want to change you may want to

66
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:29,920
appreciate skillful and unskillful but that comes out of a kind

67
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:36,880
of radical yes to all of our

68
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:53,519
conditioning in other words it comes out of acceptance

69
00:16:53,519 --> 00:17:01,880
change comes from acceptance e

70
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,440
but don't accept yourself so as to change

71
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:24,400
yourself just say

72
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:34,480
yes to everything that's always inspired a

73
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,080
no okay here I am

74
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,799
the end of

75
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,720
Shame e

76
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:30,600
don't be annoying with yourself

77
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:47,919
nitpicking it's wise loving the face of

78
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,240
conditioning then it's all

79
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
conditioning

80
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,559
for for

81
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:28,039
just putting down all the annoying behavioral modification programs you run

82
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:30,519
on your

83
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:39,799
yourself the carrot and the

84
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,799
stick just stop running the game on

85
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,278
yourself for just these

86
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:23,840
moments open your heart to the

87
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:30,880
totality what you are we'll figure out the detail tells

88
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
later

89
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

90
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

91
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
e e

92
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,799
maybe feels natural to

93
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:25,120
uh say something in our minds like

94
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,840
uh man may be

95
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,679
happy may be safe

96
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,760
protected may it be a

97
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
peace

98
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,159
e e

99
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,159
for

100
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:14,319
[Music]

101
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,080
e

102
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:54,399
okay

103
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:06,760
I don't know where that meditation came from but somewhere somewhere in

104
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:19,640
there this hasn't been super systematic guiding of meditation practice to be

105
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,919
honest but uh today we

106
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:30,440
uh yeah got on some kind of met up uh self-acceptance

107
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:38,200
train anyway we find our way with practice I don't know what's going to come up in me each

108
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:46,080
morning so uh mudita

109
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:53,320
um usually rendered as as sympathetic Joy kind of delighting in the wealth the

110
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:59,240
love in the face of Good Fortune the welfare of

111
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:05,159
other and it's kind of known as a little bit of a tricky

112
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:13,080
one because you you can't you know you can't force

113
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:20,840
Joy Moda is not supposed to be like those childhood pictures where like the

114
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:26,720
a family photo where the children are commanded to smile and you can just see

115
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,760
the weird awkward preoccupation and complicity with the

116
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:37,278
author the prevailing authorities just as

117
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:45,320
we smile have a lot of child photos like

118
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:52,600
that when I'm not protesting being photographed a lot of force

119
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:58,799
smiles and uh this is not that

120
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:04,639
with kindness compassion the physiological kind of reality of those

121
00:32:04,639 --> 00:32:11,080
States is more more easily evoked than Joy it can [Music]

122
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:19,440
be you know can feel like not pretending you know to get into Jo you know get

123
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:26,200
into compassion get into kindness Vita can be a little bit more

124
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:32,000
tricky and so we don't have to pretend we take

125
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,000
our time with the physiology often it's about putting down other

126
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,320
burdens and then we're freed up for

127
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:48,559
Joy the sutas

128
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,600
um it's characterizes the an antidote to

129
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:00,399
resentment which is you know I don't know what the poly word was but but um

130
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:07,799
that's interesting mudita joy as an antidote to

131
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:14,000
resentment right we see so much so much resentment so little

132
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,519
capacity to Delight in the welfare of others so from the um the angut

133
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:28,880
Naya uh there's no way that when mudita is has been develop pursued Ed the

134
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,320
Reigns given a grounding steadied

135
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:41,120
Consolidated that resentment will still keep overpowering the

136
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:53,320
Mind colleague uh kind of queen queen of uh mudita to Salah

137
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:59,360
Seattle and um she sometimes just goes off with the mood that's her favorite

138
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:06,080
she's Relentless I remember one time I I I think I'll read a a piece

139
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:12,638
from her um where we were co- teing online and

140
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:18,720
um I think this is 2021 you so like deep in the pandemic

141
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:26,000
and uh I don't know she just went off I remember like my face was aching like

142
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,599
literally aching cuz I I was uh she just kept going for like an

143
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:38,079
hour or something anyway so she says uh I just

144
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:45,520
transcribed what she said um we've uh come to my favorite favorite moment in

145
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:50,599
all of d uh I don't know when I opened this Pandora's Box it's not the way I

146
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:55,638
grew up with this energy I don't know anywhere in my life I would have said oh

147
00:34:55,639 --> 00:35:01,079
yeah Joy is what I would call life I grew up in a very difficult childhood

148
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:06,839
spent the bulk of my life poor on welfare Joy would not be the underlying

149
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:12,760
feature of experience I would point out but somewhere in dma I stumbled upon

150
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:19,240
this mudita it's been a game Cher so let me see if I can try to help

151
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:25,040
you see where I'm pointing to there's a great difference between mudita and the

152
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:32,599
kind of worldly joy that we could try to access regularly in our lives I imagine that each one of us on

153
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:40,800
this call there are 56 of us we all get two Joys two moments of joy in our lives

154
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,240
that's all you get two opportunities of joy and if you're like me we've already

155
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:54,200
used them up so there's no joy for the rest of the year you've already had it

156
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:59,520
so the only way you get to access a level of Joy has to come um from someone

157
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,400
else if I start telling you about Joy I have because you're human you'll feel it

158
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:10,599
if I begin to cry you'll feel that if I tell you about some sadness some

159
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:16,119
difficulty in my life you'll feel that and likewise I realized I could feel the

160
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:23,920
joy of another person and there would never be a day or a moment that I would not feel Joy never

161
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,920
it's not possible there are like billions of people on the earth and at

162
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:36,000
any given moment somebody somewhere is experiencing joy and all I have to do is

163
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,920
be willing to tap into that joy and feel it with them my granddaughter is four years old

164
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:50,000
she's learning about jokes and she starts laughing she'll say something

165
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:58,119
like and then they said go away and she starts laughing U

166
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:03,640
riously and I'm laughing and that's not even funny but I'm laughing because

167
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:10,640
she's laughing so hard like she's told some great joke it's just another way of

168
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,040
experiencing The Human Condition we're so

169
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:28,520
interconnected so Joy um

170
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:35,680
it's um it's important it's important to find ways of putting

171
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:42,720
down our pain even when that pain can't be

172
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,640
resolved and it feels irresponsible to do that how can I

173
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:55,520
leave these you know uh Loose Ends of my life

174
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:02,880
unresolved Joy is a kind of um illegitimate can't

175
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:10,119
can't risk it but it's important sometimes it can feel like Joy

176
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:15,800
is a way of of um cheating on your grief

177
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:20,960
a kind of emotional adultery of some

178
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:28,440
kind but no all compatible and part of the Dharma is that it makes Mak our

179
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:35,240
emotional life more and more Supple such that the trace of the last moment

180
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:42,400
becomes less and less a moment of Joy followed by a Moment of grief followed

181
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:51,319
by humor and none of the prior States kind of leave a trace you

182
00:38:51,319 --> 00:38:59,359
know we can just be available for the full range of our emotional life

183
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,000
sometimes it's easier to talk about removing deconstructing the

184
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:13,838
obstacles to Joy rather than creating joy and so what what obstructs

185
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:21,160
mudita ownership possessiveness comparing mind

186
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:28,920
andv the The Reflex of ego is to incorporate all goodness into

187
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,800
itself kind of like an amiba right I think I remember that like an amoeba

188
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:42,760
just incorporating some food into itself that same my ego tolerates no

189
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:49,040
goodness outside itself it must appropriate everything everyone's

190
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:55,560
Joy appropriate our own spiritual practice fruits of

191
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:05,160
that and so we have to snap out of self viw to truly enjoy another's

192
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:14,280
happiness now I I'm not suggesting that uh mudita is like a

193
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:20,640
public policy you know meaning that we Overlook all conditions that might

194
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,040
engender Envy the disparities of health and wealth which are

195
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:32,200
unsustainable this is not a public policy this is about the heart of the

196
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,280
practitioner so um the essayist Joseph Epstein quoting the the uh like this

197
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:49,599
quote um the seven deadly sins of lust and gluttony greed laziness wrath pride

198
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:54,839
and envy and uh says uh of the seven deadly

199
00:40:54,839 --> 00:41:02,920
sins only Envy is no fun at all it's really

200
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:10,440
not envy is usually about two people jealousy usually about three a

201
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:19,240
triangle and um you know some of this may have

202
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:26,000
evolutionary benefit right but uh we should not deify

203
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:34,680
the mechanisms of evolution Evolution doesn't care about it Freedom even a

204
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:41,760
little you know we're here because we're the sufferers in a

205
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,560
sense this is from evolutionary psychology despite the manifold

206
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:53,640
unhappiness that jealousy creates jealousy has a crystalline functional logic precise

207
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:59,599
purposes and supreme Sensibility exists today in modern humans because

208
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:07,400
those in the evolutionary past who were indifferent to the sexual contact that their mates had with others

209
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:15,560
lost the evolutionary contest to those who became jealous as the descendants of successful

210
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:20,920
ancestors modern humans carry with them passions that led to their forebear

211
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:26,119
success the legacy of this success is a dangerous passion that creates

212
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:31,359
unhappiness but the unhappiness motivated adaptive

213
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:36,960
action over human evolutionary

214
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:44,359
history it's jealousy and then Envy

215
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:53,800
Envy Envy shows us where we're identified Envy uh illuminates

216
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:02,119
the the sacred Cows of our go and wherever we're identified it

217
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:10,400
impaires love identification impaires

218
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:19,559
love in a sense Envy highlights the

219
00:43:19,559 --> 00:43:23,520
insanity of egoic

220
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
life just

221
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,838
it doesn't work it's

222
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:42,800
painful mat you Ricard in every instance Envy is the product of a wound to

223
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:48,280
self-importance and the fruit of an illusion what can other people's

224
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:56,119
happiness possibly deprive us of nothing of course only the ego can be wounded by

225
00:43:56,119 --> 00:44:02,599
it and feel it pain these are the results of our having

226
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:10,558
forgotten our innermost potential for affection and

227
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:19,520
peace the more sufficient we feel the more we affirm the kind of tender acceptance

228
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:26,280
that I was alluding to in the Sith the more sufficient we feel the the

229
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:35,200
more free read up we are to Delight radically in the well-being of

230
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:42,920
others we become more fluid inside and that

231
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:50,160
fluidity um is uh makes the well-being the success

232
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:57,559
the Excellence of others not a threat to our own egoic fragility but but just a

233
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:04,000
source of delight there's no comparison in it at all it's just partaking in

234
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,240
goodness yeah and so the Delight of others

235
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:17,000
becomes totally unthreatening so much joy so much

236
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:24,640
joy I see I know my nickname is captain buzkill and I talk relentlessly about
