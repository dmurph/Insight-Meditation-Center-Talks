1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,599
warm greetings from this dark

2
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:13,320
Dawning morning in Redwood City and I'm happy to be here with all

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,320
of you and to share this time together and I do think of more than I

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:28,160
think I've kind of based my adult life on the idea that Buddhist practice is a

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:35,680
peacemaking PR practice it uh uproots

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,640
the the impulses to violence and harm making in

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,680
ourselves and is and it's a practice which is devoted

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,000
towards bringing peace to this world in its own way in it's in a

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,160
Buddhist way and the way that Buddhist specializes in it and um so so to sit now and

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,960
meditate is in fact an act of peacemaking and it begins Buddhism

11
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:17,560
emphasizes that peacemaking begins with oneself that in a sense the source of

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,280
peace that we can have some role in begins with

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,840
ourselves that if we can't be peaceful how can we expect others to do

14
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:36,399
so and if we sit in meditation as the closer we get to ourselves the more we

15
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:45,040
have a chance to discover how to keep the peace how to

16
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,680
stay in a mode of being where

17
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:59,039
we uh do not pick up to not get involved in any kind of harm making activity in

18
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:04,119
our own mind and the deeper the sensitivity the

19
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:09,800
deeper our ability to be mindful the more the subtlety we pick up the

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,519
subtleties of ways in which the Mind operates that does in fact cause maybe

21
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:23,000
subtle harm but subtle harm compounded over years and years

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,239
applied in so many different ways in our lives uh can actually be a source of

23
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,840
tremendous pain and harm and so to think of meditation as an

24
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,680
exercise in finding peace in being peaceful being

25
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:48,599
nonharming and that mindfulness is the representative state of attention

26
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:56,319
way of attending being aware for doing so in a peaceful

27
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,319
way so as we do this meditation today perhaps you

28
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,840
can keep a dedication

29
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,519
to having a peaceful way of

30
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:21,440
recognizing what is happening to you in the present moment take refuge in the awareness in

31
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,840
the simplest knowing that knows in a way that

32
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:34,080
contributes to the peace Within it doesn't contribute to further

33
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,319
conflict to further

34
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:45,799
animosity shame

35
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:52,799
discouragement greed conceit it doesn't

36
00:03:52,799 --> 00:04:01,200
encourage it doesn't feed into the mental States and the

37
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:08,200
me mental States and the mental kind of activities which have within them which

38
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:16,280
have come along with subtle ways in which uh undermine us deflate

39
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,079
us harm us bring

40
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,360
unnecessary despair or discomfort or

41
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
pain

42
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:45,479
so to assume a meditation

43
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:55,199
posture whatever posture you're going to sit but let it be a

44
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,560
posture the posture that allows you to be

45
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,120
peaceful and to orient Orient yourself around being

46
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,600
peaceful and either lower your [Music] gaze or close your

47
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,919
eyes in such a way that you can begin monitoring

48
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:57,240
yourself tracking what is going on within you in your mind your

49
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:05,319
thoughts in your reactions to what is

50
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:29,160
happening and to sit quietly without contention with anything

51
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:35,918
that's happening without condemning anything

52
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,160
or without any Greed for

53
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:53,479
anything allow yourself to be as you are but in the in the

54
00:06:53,479 --> 00:07:01,400
middle of how you are let there be

55
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,800
knowing and knowing which

56
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:18,000
radiates a peaceful way of being to know to be

57
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
aware

58
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:35,199
peacefully a peacemaker in the middle of your

59
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,599
life peaceful knowing even when there are thoughts and

60
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:50,479
impulses which are not peaceful let them be

61
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,080
known

62
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
peacefully

63
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:18,000
in whatever ways that you're not peaceful don't struggle with that or be

64
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,520
opposed to it but find that peaceful place

65
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:31,240
within that knows it peacefully and radiates peacefulness out

66
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:40,880
outward so the example the radiance the influence of

67
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:49,160
peacefulness spreads throughout your being with each moment of knowing the

68
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,240
breath your body your feelings your

69
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:06,160
thoughts and take your time time to stay close to a peaceful way of

70
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:17,560
knowing and if you can't find that be as close to peace as you

71
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,800
can

72

for

102
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

103
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039

00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:39,840
sitting to now after this periods of meditation find within

114
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,880
you the place where there's the clearest feeling of

115
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:53,000
Peace calm non

116
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:01,880
agitation is there some place in the body that you associate with

117
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,960
this and if you

118
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:19,960
do Center yourself there as if that's who you

119
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
are

120
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:42,159
and then from there imagine yourself gazing out upon

121
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:49,600
the world a world that in many ways is on

122
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:56,760
fire with war and climate change and

123
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:05,440
people suffering uing dying people afraid and people

124
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:13,360
struggling and to gaze upon it from whatever peaceful place you

125
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:20,919
have letting your inner peace calm radiate outwards through the ways

126
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:27,840
that you are afraid or dismayed the ways that you are one of

127
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,600
the suffering

128
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:40,120
people and let whatever peacefulness you

129
00:28:40,279 --> 00:28:45,960
have the kind of peace that we would wish on

130
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:56,399
everyone and wish that for others wish this for our world may our world be

131
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:03,880
peaceful May the fevers of greed hate and

132
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:10,360
delusion cool down for

133
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:26,320
everyone May the agitation of dismay and

134
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:34,960
fear calm down so everyone has the ability to tap

135
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,679
into their best wisdom and

136
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:54,840
love from whatever well-being we have wish others well may all beings be

137
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,200
peaceful may all beings be

138
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,799
safe may all

139
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:15,480
beings be peaceful happy may all beings be

140
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
free

141
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,398
thank

142
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
you

143
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:43,080
one of the most repeated teachings of the Buddha is that of living a life of

144
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:51,360
nonharming nonviolence Aima and um sprinkle throughout the

145
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:58,039
teachings all kinds of little quotes in this regard and if we ask our ourselves why

146
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:03,519
the Buddha emphasized this we could uh maybe get a

147
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:11,279
clue in uh the way he described himself before he was awakened and this is

148
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:16,799
uh uh description where you get a sense of the Buddha's

149
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:23,679
own dismay challenge the way he was troubled by the state of the world of

150
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:30,679
his time this is from um uh a discourse called the discourse on

151
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:37,240
being violent at and it's

152
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:43,720
um it's um in a book that I've uh teachings I've translated in a book

153
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:49,679
called the Buddha before Buddhism the book of eights it's chapter

154
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,919
11 chapter not 11 it's U chapter

155
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:04,600
15 so the the Buddha uh States violence gives birth to

156
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:09,760
fear just just look at people and their

157
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:16,440
quarrels I will speak to you of my dismay and the way that I was

158
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:24,360
shaken seeing people thrashing about like fish in little water and seeing them feuding with each

159
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:32,559
other I became afraid the world is completely without a core

160
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:39,360
everywhere things are changing wanting a place of my own I saw

161
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,480
nothing not already taken I felt

162
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:55,039
discontent at seeing only conflict to the very end then I saw an arrow here hard to see

163
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:01,639
embedded in the heart pierced by this Arrow people Dash about

164
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:10,838
in all directions when the arrows pulled out they don't run and they don't

165
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:18,358
sink so the pathos of the Buddhist time

166
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:26,079
before his Awakening how he looked around the world and was deeply moved disturbed by it it's very different

167
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:33,118
contrast to kind of idea that many of us have of who the Buddha Buddha was after he was

168
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:39,320
awakened and here the suggestion is that it was his seeing the violence in the

169
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:45,280
world the way people are fighting uh the way that the fighting is they saw no end

170
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:52,760
to the fighting that uh the people had have um that this sounds like it

171
00:34:52,760 --> 00:35:00,320
motivated him to find an alternative way of living that he didn't see any solution place

172
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,640
for him uh as a refuge any place in the world that he could go to be

173
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:13,359
safe um and so he looked within and lo and behold he found what he called an

174
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:20,040
arrow that uh was is not inherent to in the heart but can pierce the heart

175
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:26,520
causing a lot of pain and because it's not inherent to it because it's not um

176
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:33,200
you know part of the heart that Arrow can be taken out and that's what he

177
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:39,160
did and then he says as he did that then

178
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:45,960
um one doesn't run about and one doesn't sink one is not agitated or one doesn't

179
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:52,680
give up and just kind of collapse and um so that's a to me I'm

180
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,880
very touched by this description that uh it feels much more you see the humanity

181
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,960
of the Buddha compared to some of the descriptions of his Enlightenment where it seems a little bit more almost maybe

182
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:12,680
sometimes it could say disconnected from the world or very much in focusing on his own personal suffering seemingly and

183
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:21,200
uh the way description is and what about the world around us and um the Buddha then emphasised

184
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:27,000
emphasis for the next 40 45 years of his teaching career on the importance of non

185
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:34,960
violence and the importance of discovering the roots of violence in oneself and pulling out that Arrow um

186
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,640
became a common theme one way or the other of what he taught and

187
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,000
um and um and part of the reason for that

188
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,040
was I think that there was plenty enough violence in his times there descriptions

189
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:59,440
of the wars and the fighting that went on around him um the cruelty of rulers

190
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:06,880
and uh Bandits and robbers and it was a dangerous time and the sad thing is that

191
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,240
it's been this world has been dangerous ever since and um I don't think that

192
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,440
given the history of humanity we can expect that the dangers the horrors of

193
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:25,119
it are going to stop um they'll probably continue but there has to be

194
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,200
Alternatives there has to be some people who find that Arrow embedded in the

195
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:36,920
heart so that we're not motivated by our reactions to that pain that doesn't have

196
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:44,880
to be there and not a few people their anger their despair their dismay their

197
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:51,680
um fear uh the way that we run around and act impulsively and maybe act

198
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:58,240
violently either with our words our Deeds even our thoughts uh are those are

199
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,599
born from trying to struggle with our own pain not knowing how to be with our

200
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:10,240
own pain feeling the suffering of the world and having that be like U salt on

201
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:16,520
our own wound having that be to evoke the pain of this arrow that we have

202
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:23,280
within and so then the response to the world is not uh trying to stop what's in

203
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,800
the world from being terrible but we're trying to raise react to the world to try

204
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:35,280
toage this this pain of Our Own in our own heart by looking in the wrong

205
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:42,880
direction and um and so in the Buddhist practice the idea is to to turn oneself

206
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:49,720
inside out go in find the arrow and then in turning on inside out then step into

207
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:56,760
the world uh with that peace with that capacity of um being a non-reactive

208
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:03,040
presence for this world and does that mean that we become passive

209
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:10,240
no um the Buddha stepped forward into the world uh uh and sometimes moov

210
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:16,480
towards where the violence was the kind of the representative example of this in

211
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:23,000
the sutas is the story of a mass murderer named anguli Mala who uh was a

212
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:30,560
bandit and robbed people but killed people and he was apparently quite vicious and and uh killed many many

213
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,280
people and uh the people at times were quite afraid of him and uh when the

214
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:42,520
Buddha heard about it U the Buddha went into the jungle to find him and uh

215
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:50,160
people try to stop the Buddha and said it's too dangerous don't go there you're an unarmed mendicant but the Buddha went

216
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:55,640
anyway and the City of go and and and went there and was able to pacify the

217
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:02,720
murderer and was was able and actually converted him to become a Buddhist monk the um uh this idea of going

218
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:09,119
towards where the conflict is and uh

219
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,480
firefighters go towards the fires Medics sometimes go towards the

220
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,400
war not to fight but to help people who are deeply trained

221
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,599
deeply liberated have pulled out the heart are people who then have the the

222
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:32,960
fearlessness to go towards conflict towards violence and

223
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:39,040
um and uh another kind of Representative example of the power of being

224
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:47,480
peaceful is a story of King Ashoka and one of the first uh uh rulers of a huge

225
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,720
vast of India one of the first empires of India and uh he went apparently was a

226
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,800
vicious conqueror large army going around conquering and killing

227
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:03,599
and um at one point he was involved in a very large battle where thousands upon

228
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:11,359
thousands of people died on the battlefield even though he won and um the day after the battle he

229
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:17,040
was walking across the battlefield looking at the Carnage and walking right through the

230
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,319
middle of the battlefield was a Buddhist monk and that Buddhist monk had a

231
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:28,119
demeanor had a way of a bearing which was so peaceful and calm there was such

232
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:37,680
a radical contrast to the Carnage of the war that uh this got the um the king's

233
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:45,240
attention and um and the King asked him you know what who are you and what's going on here with you and and um he

234
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:53,520
explained that he was a Buddhist monk and and what is it your teacher teaches and the monk calmly said hate is

235
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,760
not overcome by hate hate is overcome by love this is

236
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,480
the ancient teaching so to have the demeanor of

237
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:12,599
peace to step into the battlefield after the fact to be able to have a presence

238
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:19,839
that somehow influenced this person to be calm uh and then to um have these

239
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:25,520
teachings that touched his heart uh and then this king of shoka then became

240
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:33,680
known as a proponent of nonviolence he became the first seemingly righteous or

241
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,079
just king of India and he created lots of shelters and hospices and fed the

242
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:45,760
poor and created shelters for animals and and uh and kind of completely turned

243
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:51,599
around how he was a king it's supposed to have been a true

244
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:57,000
story with there lots of stories about King akoka being transformed from a vicious King to a

245
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:02,599
a nonviolent King whether that story is accurate or not I don't know but it's a

246
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:08,520
wonderful representative example Tik nadan use a similar example to talk

247
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:15,319
about the boat people who who fled Vietnam in the 1970s maybe early 80s on

248
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:21,040
very flimsy boats packed with people trying to get to the Philippines and um

249
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,240
and there were storms in the middle of the ocean and big waves and tikah is for

250
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:32,760
me a powerful teaching that um that if one person could stay calm on

251
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,079
the boat um the boat would stay calm enough so it wouldn't tip over in the

252
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:45,280
big waves and everyone be would be safe one person to be calm one person to be

253
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:52,920
peaceful and uh one of the fallacies about pulling out one's own arrow and

254
00:43:52,920 --> 00:44:00,559
being peaceful is that it's avoiding uh taking care of the world and taking

255
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:08,000
care of others and the Buddha was very adamant about don't sacrifice yourself

256
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,280
don't in order to take care of others take care of yourself

257
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:19,119
first so you can be a effective Peacemaker in the world and a very

258
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:26,400
challenging teaching I think a very evocative teaching provocative teaching of the Buddha is the one where he says

259
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:33,640
don't give up your own welfare for the sake of others welfare however great

260
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:39,480
clearly know your own welfare and be intent on the highest

261
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:46,319
good this is also not meant to be don't ignore other people but the

262
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:54,079
highest good elsewhere he talks over and over again also about live a life um uh

263
00:44:54,079 --> 00:45:00,280
that is intent on the welfare of self and other the welfare and happiness of

264
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:06,440
everyone involved and so the and then we want to look for examples of people who are

265
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:12,400
doing this to see how we can support that kind of activity instead of the

266
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:19,119
activity of endless war endless conflict endless ways in which we continue to

267
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:24,760
evoke fear and people's hearts endless ways in which we keep driving that uh

268
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:33,119
Arrow deeper and deeper into people's hearts because we are just continuing the cycles of conflict that go on and

269
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:38,400
on and um and the more we

270
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:45,640
feel deeply moved by violence in the world whether it's the violence in Gaza

271
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:51,400
and Israel or the Ukraine or Syria there's places in the world right now

272
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:58,839
where thousands of people are being killed and um fighting in these conflicts and horrific ideas of what's

273
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:04,400
happening and um where are the peacemakers do we support them can we

274
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:11,559
bring them into the Forefront uh there's an organization in Israel called standing together where uh

275
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:18,119
Palestinians and uh Jewish Israelis are working together to bring humanitarian

276
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:24,319
Aid to people who need it and this idea of working together is

277
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:31,680
um and finding a common ground it goes against what many many people maybe the

278
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:38,200
majority of people are doing but uh that example of people walking across

279
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:44,000
the battlefield the example of someone else who's helping um this is I think

280
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,160
what we want to highlight and shine a light on uh on our on our world and can

281
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:59,480
we be a person like that can we be a person who lives uh uh

282
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:08,480
peacefully so here is um a king who uh at the time of the

283
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:15,319
Buddha who uh came to see the Buddha and made this comment that what he saw the

284
00:47:15,319 --> 00:47:25,240
Buddha together with his monastics venerable sir Kings quarrel with Kings nobles with

285
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:32,280
Nobles brahin with brahin householders with householders mothers quarrel with

286
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:37,760
children children with mother father with children children with Father

287
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,760
Brothers quarrel with Brothers Brothers with sisters sisters with brothers

288
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:51,559
friends with friends but here I see monastics living in Concord

289
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:58,160
with mutual appreciation without disputing blending like milk and water

290
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:05,240
viewing each other with kindly eyes so there are people who live this

291
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:10,720
way may we shine the light and appreciate those people who are doing

292
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:18,559
this may we be that kind of person may we feel that it's that being a

293
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:25,000
peacemaker to Turning towards the violence in a peaceful way bringing a

294
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:32,440
peaceful influence is a revolutionary act and may we be courageous may we have

295
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:39,680
faith in that may we trust that so that um we can find an alternative to

296
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:46,960
violence without an alter uh alternative to violence do we want to live in such a

297
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:54,280
world do we want to live in a world where our so-called peace is at the expense of others

298
00:48:54,280 --> 00:49:00,280
people's s suffering one way or the other can we be an example of someone

299
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:05,839
who has pulled out the arrow in our own heart and then becoming

300
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:11,400
a a calm force a peaceful influence into

301
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:20,040
this world around us thank you and um May you

302
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:27,520
become a peacemaker in your world
