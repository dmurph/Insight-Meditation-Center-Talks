1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,280
good morning

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,600
again

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,240
and for those of you on youtube who

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,520
weren't there at 6 45 this morning i'm

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,279
diana clark

6
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,840
and gil will be back tomorrow at seven

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,320
california time he's spending some time

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,840
with his family this morning

9
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,640
so to say a few words about

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,960
anapanasati practice mindfulness of

11
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,800
breathing

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,840
that gil has been doing on these

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,719
mornings

14
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,800
and as many of you know there are 16

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,320
steps and gil has been through the first

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,760
half the first eight and there's a

17
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,280
number of ways in which we might

18
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,800
understand all these

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,878
steps and the organization of them

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,960
one way is that this is a progression of

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,080
getting to know one aspect of our

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,880
experience

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,680
the body the mind

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,119
and then after becoming familiar with

25
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,240
it and being with it then there's some

26
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,680
letting go some releasing of that aspect

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,640
of experience

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,840
when the time is right it doesn't have

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,400
to be

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,079
in a hurry we just take our time

31
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,119
allowing the experience perhaps to

32
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,799
melt or soften

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,200
as best we can

34
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,280
so we started with noticing the physical

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,759
aspect of our experience

36
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,759
breathing and this breathing accompanies

37
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:02,640
us

38
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,200
through all the other explorations

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,959
just in the same way that when we're on

40
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,280
a pilgrimage we just keep walking

41
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,520
one step after another one breath

42
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,319
after another

43
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,440
and after breathing then there's

44
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,680
expanding to include the whole body

45
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,200
the bodily sensations of course

46
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,400
breath is occurring within a body

47
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,879
so to expand the awareness to include

48
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,440
the body

49
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,720
and in this we also include any sense of

50
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,920
contentment

51
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,519
any sense of okayness any pleasure

52
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,800
pleasant sensations

53
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,519
associated with this bodily experience

54
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,400
and allowing those to be a support

55
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,000
as we continue on our pilgrimage so to

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,319
speak

57
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,680
i mean then we turn towards the mental

58
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,640
aspect of our experience

59
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,840
including the physical sensations that

60
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,760
are associated with

61
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,640
thinking or whatever mental activity we

62
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,840
might be having

63
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,720
sometimes that's really subtle the

64
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,640
physical aspect of the

65
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,560
mental experience so without getting

66
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,920
tangled up and trying to

67
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,680
figure it out maybe just kind of being

68
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,239
with the experience without being

69
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,840
identified or

70
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,720
lost in the experience in some ways it's

71
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,920
a little bit of a pulling back

72
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,120
from our thinking and of course

73
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,120
noticing how our judging our evaluation

74
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,439
of our experiences yet one more mental

75
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,040
activity

76
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,079
we might feel feel how that feels

77
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,479
the judging the pushing the pulling

78
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,960
wanting not wanting this is desirable

79
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,840
not desirable

80
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,800
so this to help support this

81
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,040
experiencing mental activities it can be

82
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,080
a stepping

83
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,320
back of some sort so kind of a pulling

84
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,600
back a little bit

85
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,160
and knowing what is taking place rather

86
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,120
than being fully

87
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,479
immersed into it and

88
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,199
mental activity deserves our attention

89
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,800
sometimes we might have the idea that we

90
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,560
just have to get rid of it

91
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,360
but it deserves our attention because

92
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:05,840
when

93
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,919
unattended it often is running our lives

94
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:10,560
without

95
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,680
our even knowing it

96
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,280
so then there can be after becoming

97
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,080
familiar

98
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,880
with mental activity there can be a

99
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,919
calming a

100
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,039
softening or relaxing

101
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,720
of that mental activity

102
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,080
and notice that i'm not saying we have

103
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,840
to eliminate eradicate

104
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,960
exterminate something like this

105
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,000
the mental activity we're just allowing

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,720
it to

107
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,280
quiet

108
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,880
maybe i'll say a few words about what

109
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,560
can be some supports for this

110
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,560
one is that the earlier steps in

111
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,800
anapanasati

112
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,840
the breath being with the bodily

113
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,440
sensations allowing some

114
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,680
ease or relaxation of the bodily

115
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,039
sensations

116
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,639
can be a tremendous support for

117
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,000
calming the mental activity

118
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,800
so if we find ourselves really caught up

119
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,319
and busy

120
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,680
with thinking we can just

121
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,639
incline the mind towards the physical

122
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:29,680
experience

123
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,840
including the physical experience of

124
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,680
thinking

125
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,039
so that's one way is to ground

126
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,680
our awareness in the present moment in

127
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,400
the

128
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:49,840
embodied presence that we have right now

129
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,000
and this also includes being aware

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,599
of some of the pleasant sensations

131
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,199
we might be having there might be

132
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,280
some ease with the breath some

133
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,360
smoothness of the breath

134
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,479
there also might be some vague diffuse

135
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,520
experiences of just some contentment or

136
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,400
okayness

137
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,360
maybe we can incline the mind that

138
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,479
direction

139
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,199
that also can be a support for the

140
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,280
calming of the mental activities

141
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,039
is to if there's some aspect of ease

142
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:39,280
to tune into that aspect of ease

143
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,759
and maybe we can

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,720
rather than feeling like we have to get

145
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,800
rid of our thoughts or make them slow

146
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,599
down or go away or

147
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,840
whatever ideas we might have

148
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,160
maybe we can have this emphasis on

149
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,440
a gentle inquiry is this

150
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,960
helpful or is it unhelpful

151
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,639
is it helpful in promoting a sense of

152
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,680
ease

153
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,599
and freedom peace and

154
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,120
or am i learning something here

155
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,319
is this valuable or

156
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,039
or is there a feeling i'm just stuck and

157
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,719
i'm just going around and around and

158
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,760
around

159
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,120
there's no sense of potential potential

160
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,760
learning

161
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,959
or potential

162
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,079
freedom or ease

163
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,440
so that might be one another way to kind

164
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,440
of work with mental activity is

165
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,519
to shift away from it has to be

166
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,480
different

167
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,399
to shift towards well is this helpful

168
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,360
and sometimes the answer to that can

169
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,320
bring a different

170
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,880
reaction response to our mental activity

171
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,600
which

172
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,000
might allow that mental activity to

173
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,760
unfold in a way

174
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,720
that is helpful

175
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,279
another thing that we might do is to

176
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,560
just do a gentle

177
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,000
inquiry of what's fueling this thinking

178
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,839
there might be an emotion

179
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,680
and just like at the beginning of this

180
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,120
um

181
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,040
before the guided meditation i talked

182
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,600
about when we're on a pilgrimage there

183
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,959
might be some parking dogs

184
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,279
and one way to be with them is just to

185
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,080
like show them our open hands and show

186
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,480
them

187
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
that we're safe for them so

188
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,040
is there a way in which we can be safe

189
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,240
for our emotions to be expressed

190
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,000
to show up can we

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,600
maybe in some way listen deeply

192
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,560
to ourselves and allow the emotion to

193
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,000
arise

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,279
without getting tangled up and thinking

195
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,279
that it has to be otherwise or it has to

196
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,920
be different

197
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,680
can we just create the space for our

198
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,040
emotional

199
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,839
experience

200
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,440
and that might also kind of soften some

201
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
of the mental activity

202
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,040
as we soften the fuel what's supporting

203
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,320
that mental activity

204
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,079
and then maybe

205
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,640
one other thing that i will say is

206
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,279
sometimes it can be skillful

207
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,480
to replace unhelpful thoughts

208
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,360
with other mental activities that are

209
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,839
more helpful

210
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,240
so to intentionally do something

211
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,120
an example might be to do some loving

212
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,880
kindness practice if we

213
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,079
feel that we're filled with rage

214
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,320
and ill will and thoughts of harming

215
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,600
hostility

216
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,560
in a way that is not helpful or healthy

217
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,120
or

218
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,399
we just feel like we're lost in it

219
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,160
so we can do some loving-kindness

220
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,600
practice

221
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,680
in whichever way it's easiest

222
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,519
we're not necessarily towards the object

223
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,160
through which we have hostility but just

224
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,000
incline the mind

225
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,360
towards where it's easy with a lovable

226
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,360
being

227
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,279
allowing the mind to kind of like calm

228
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,839
down and settle with this loving

229
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,200
kindness

230
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,560
so it might bring in to like replace

231
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,880
thoughts and comfortable thoughts with

232
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,040
some

233
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,120
or unhelpful thoughts with some other

234
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,959
thoughts

235
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:11,839
another way might be to use our

236
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,800
imagination

237
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,480
sometimes we do this in guided

238
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,639
meditations maybe you do it yourself

239
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,839
the wings of a bird flapping

240
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,160
or maybe ice skaters that they skate

241
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,519
skate skate and then

242
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:38,480
glide and feeling into the glide

243
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,480
or maybe the imagination of

244
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,320
taking off this itchy scratchy sweater

245
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,720
and instead putting on your favorite

246
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:52,880
t-shirt

247
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,200
so there might be some skillful ways in

248
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,639
which we can

249
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,680
replace some of our thinking

250
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,959
and can we do this while being aware of

251
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:03,920
the breath

252
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,839
all the while allowing the breath to

253
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,639
accompany us

254
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,040
and maybe the last thing i'll say

255
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,360
is there might be also opportunity to

256
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,880
say for some thoughts

257
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,240
some mental activity no

258
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,040
i'll work with this later after

259
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,800
meditation

260
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,720
right now i'm going to be with the

261
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,160
sensations of breathing

262
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,760
so i offer these as some tools that

263
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,519
might be helpful as we're practicing

264
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,639
meditation

265
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,680
and as tools if they're not helpful

266
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,839
we don't use them

267
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,959
so with a

268
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,000
sincere wish

269
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,320
that you are being with the sensations

270
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,839
of breathing with your practice your

271
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
meditations

272
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,480
maybe they be a source of support of

273
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,120
ease

274
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,480
and peace and freedom

275
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:17,120
in your life and in the lives of others

276
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:25,360
thank you
