sweet and in the chat I see old friends and many new

8
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,080
friends great to see

9
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:26,680
everybody so Gil spoke yes last week uh provided

10
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:35,079
an overview to Buddhist ethics and the intention this week is

11
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:43,320
to continue with that and perhaps expand on it by taking a look at what are known as

12
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:50,680
the five precepts these are five commitments that

13
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:57,640
we can make in our practice commitments to avoid unskillful action

14
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,320
in five areas of Our

15
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:11,039
Lives commitments to bring our mindful attention to our

16
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:18,480
actions and their consequences in the world in a way that

17
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:26,040
cultivates a heart of non-harming and at the end of his talk

18
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,560
on Friday uh Gil talked about this idea

19
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,239
that from uh effortful cultivating of

20
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:42,480
virtuous action in our practice there can be a transition to an

21
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,200
almost effortless second nature way of meeting meeting situations with with an

22
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:57,280
intention to not to not cause harm and in the spirit of that um

23
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,799
Insight of gills let's sit together and let's uh let's

24
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,239
dedicate this sit let's let's BR bring the the spirit of this sit its

25
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:15,040
inspiration around cultivate around awaking the

26
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,200
heart of nonharming sometimes dormant in

27
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,400
us uh and by bringing attention to the heart we can sort of become attuned to

28
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:33,040
it and awaken its its potential for nonh harm so join me I'm going to bring Buddha

29
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,480
into the background here let's sit

30
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:50,640
together and we can take our meditation

31
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:59,400
posture move into a comfortable position that physically keeps us both relaxed

32
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:07,599
and alert a relaxed alertness an alert

33
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,040
relaxation can bring the eyes down if that's comfortable bring them all the way down

34
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,759
if that if that's comfortable

35
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:26,759
and reorient our attention from the outside world the

36
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:35,280
responsibilities of the day whether those are before us or behind behind us bring our attention inward Inward and

37
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,160
downward inward to this inner life to this inner World downward into the

38
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,280
body and finding in this internal space the breathing

39
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,199
happening this this Breath Right Here is sufficient just noticing this in breath

40
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:04,800
this out breath and then the next

41
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,800
one we can kind of keep our attention circling around this breathing thing

42
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:26,000
happening the motion of the body the rise and fall of the abdomen the shoulders lifting

43
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:35,840
slightly falling slightly and we can keep coming back here to

44
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:44,360
this to this here and now of our experience the heess and nowness of

45
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,160
things each time the mind gets caught up in things snagged by things each time we

46
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,080
find ourselves each time we find the mind doing

47
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,440
its doing its things looking into the future considering the past thinking

48
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,599
about other people thinking about ourselves the usual without judgment with gentleness

49
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:24,000
we can nudge attention back to the breathing or we can let the breathing fill out open

50
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,240
back up to become the center of what's happening in our awareness

51
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:39,360
and the way we return to the breathing the way we let the Mind open back up to

52
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,000
the breathing is so important we don't have to

53
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,919
hurry we don't have to judge ourselves for having strayed

54
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,599
away from the here and now maybe we can remind ourselves that

55
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:04,599
it's the returning over and over over again that creates a habit of mind to be

56
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:13,199
here now we create by this return leaving the

57
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:20,400
entanglement of thought leaving the the

58
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,000
rapidity and some of the tightness of thinking we return to the breath to the

59
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:33,000
here and now to the body where things are by their nature slower

60
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,360
simpler more balanced as we return each time we

61
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,918
return we create a tendency a

62
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,720
momentum and as we We Begin an exploration this week of five

63
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:12,199
precepts and given the intimate relationship between mind

64
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:20,240
and heart we can make each return to Here

65
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:27,440
and Now each return from thinking to the breath for

66
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,599
example a return to to the heart as

67
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:46,120
well maybe when we return to the here and now the heart

68
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:50,760
seems tight restricted

69
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,440
constricted and if we find a heart a little closed

70
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,279
off maybe we can soften just a little around

71
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:11,839
it maybe just by noticing what it's like there's a softening at least we're here with

72
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,880
it at least we're attending to

73
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:32,680
it and perhaps we can notice that with returning

74
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:41,760
from thinking getting caught up in things planning remembering all good functions of the mind can't live without

75
00:09:42,079 --> 00:09:48,120
them maybe we notice that with those activities of mind the heart feels

76
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:55,519
more closed or tight and when we return to the breathing to the here and now

77
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:01,320
there can be a subtle opening or softening

78
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,800
maybe the heart feels a little more expansive a little more generous when we

79
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:16,560
return and there too we create a tendency the

80
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:24,360
heart in the present moment the heart here and now the heart at rest in meditation like the mind can rest here

81
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:32,320
in this meditative space this can be the heart of

82
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
non-harming

83
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240

117
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:56,440
so as this meditation period draws to a close

118
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,320
having perhaps touched in with the

119
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:14,480
heart we can dedicate any Stillness of Heart any

120
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,600
peace we find any openness any generosity of

121
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:26,360
Heart To A broader benefit in addition to being of benefit to ourselves may it

122
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:31,518
also benefit Others May it may it enrich our

123
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:41,880
relationships and may it spread out Ripple out to the benefit of all beings may all

124
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:49,840
beings know the calm and peace that come with the freedom from suffering

125
00:29:52,840 --> 00:30:15,849
[Music]

126
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:40,960
so again good morning and welcome wonderful to see

127
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:54,120
everyone wonderful to be with you all so last week

128
00:30:54,120 --> 00:31:01,960
Gil provided an overview of Buddhist ethics rather a rather a large topic and

129
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,360
in a sense this week we can bring it down to

130
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:14,000
uh sort of an intimate intimate size uh by taking a look at what are

131
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:21,360
known as the five precepts five areas in which we can make

132
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,639
a commitment to adopt this heart of non-harming we

133
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:32,360
can Comm commit to restraining from unskillful

134
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:38,639
action and today we'll talk just a little bit about the five precepts in general and then we can take a look at

135
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:46,639
the first precept before even saying before

136
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:51,760
listing the precepts it may be useful to say that we undertake

137
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,360
these commitments to skillful action and particularly to avoiding causing harm as

138
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:05,720
supports of our practice they help us be Freer in the

139
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:13,399
world and as our practice deepens we'll notice that there's a natural opening to

140
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:18,519
this kind of action this kind of response to the suffering of the

141
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:23,799
world that moves us away from harmful

142
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:30,120
action Gil spoke of this Friday in his final comment this idea of

143
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:35,960
being ethical action don't remember exactly how I put it instead of doing

144
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:43,039
ethical acts um that is finding that virtuous

145
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:48,760
action becomes second nature as the practice

146
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,880
deepens so the way these five precepts are presented is very very significant

147
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,000
and very important and they are the following and I'm going to provide them in the form in which they're chanted by

148
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:06,518
those who undertake them lay practitioners and others

149
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:13,320
um and they take this form here are the five of them that for the purposes of practice

150
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:19,880
for the benefit of practice to support practice I undertake a commitment to

151
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:26,760
abstain from taking life for the purposes of practice to support

152
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:33,880
practice I undertake a commitment to not take anything not freely

153
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:40,480
given to support my practice to support its benefit in the

154
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:50,760
world I undertake a commitment to abstain from causing harm with my sexual

155
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:57,880
actions to support practice

156
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,159
I take the commitment make the commitment to abstain from harmful

157
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:11,079
speech unwise speech un skillful speech and finally fifth as a support for my

158
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:16,720
practice I commit to abstaining

159
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,638
from intoxicated

160
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:29,079
heedlessness so these are these are not Commandments they're not rules rules uh

161
00:34:29,079 --> 00:34:35,079
they're not that simple they uh instead ask us to they're

162
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:43,520
much more demanding in a way than Commandments they they ask us to take every situation every interaction in in

163
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:50,240
the Here and Now of that interaction they encourage us to see

164
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:56,679
every interaction as presenting a different context the common denominator in all of

165
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:02,800
them is to avoid causing harm and yet their expressions are

166
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,760
Myriad and and variable something that might be an appropriate way of not

167
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:15,000
causing harm in one circumstance may not be the the way to respond the next time

168
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,040
or in another circumstance or with another person as we'll

169
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:28,040
see so as Gil pointed to Friday there's a doing here and there's also an

170
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:33,400
allowing allowing the practice to respond to situations allowing practice

171
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:41,200
to come forth and whether that's pausing before we speak um not reaching out to take

172
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,280
something and make it ours kind of um restraining ourselves from an

173
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,400
acquisitive uh movement of mind and heart and

174
00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:03,200
body but there's also um in this respecting practice and um trusting

175
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,000
right having confidence in the practice sometimes when we get out of

176
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,079
the way and let the practice lead let the practice respond we're we're safer

177
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:22,760
we're less likely to cause harm and of course Gil says this and uh

178
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:28,960
and Trust Gil's judgment but he says so on good Authority this is something that

179
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,680
the Buddha points to too in one of the ancient texts that comes down to us as a foundation for the Insight

180
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:41,040
tradition the Buddha says that somebody who's really awake practitioner who

181
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:49,160
really really is practicing well really awake becomes unable to take life unable

182
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:56,079
to speak unwisely unable to take something not freely given unable to engage in inappropriate sexual

183
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,280
interaction unable to um unable

184
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:08,599
to engage in intoxicated heedlessness as I've called it in case of the fifth

185
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:15,359
precept so we can watch this in our practice as the practice deepens it's harder and harder harder and harder to

186
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:21,960
cause harm so as we

187
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:28,640
um it's interesting so much of this practice is about uh

188
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:34,680
this same way of cultivating these aspects of mind and heart of noticing in

189
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:40,079
this case of the precepts what how unskillful action feels how skillful

190
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,839
action feels how the wholesome mind states that lead to skillful action feel

191
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:51,440
how the UNH wholesome state of heart that leads to unskillful action feels

192
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:57,760
and as in so many other aspects of the practice when we bring attention to to

193
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:09,760
the state of the heart noticing when there's an urge toward a tight fisted um a lack of um a

194
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:16,240
selfishness and then noticing a movement in the other direction towards greater generosity towards giving back towards

195
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:22,880
giving away towards letting go we can lean into that and we can in that

196
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:28,280
leaning in we can create a momentum a tendency a a

197
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:34,280
propensity to engage more frequently more regularly in that kind of action

198
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:41,359
and that's how it becomes increasingly second nature that's how as K put it Friday we

199
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:48,280
move from kind of consciously doing things that are ethical to just

200
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:54,760
responding without thought in a way that supports ourselves supports others and

201
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:00,640
avoids causing harm so let's take a look at the first

202
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:07,160
precept and in each of these there will be a couple emphases that I think I hope

203
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:13,040
will come forward uh one is that the focus in this is actions not ourselves

204
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:20,640
as actors it's not about being a good person or a good Buddhist or a good actor it's about cultivating

205
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,800
actions that don't cause harm avoid causing harm it's the first

206
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:34,760
thing the second thing is the importance the centrality of mental action for the

207
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:40,520
Buddha it's actions of mind that are um

208
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:47,280
perhaps um don't know if I want to say come first but as we uh read in the

209
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,480
first few Verses first couple first vers first two verses of the DAP all action

210
00:39:53,480 --> 00:40:01,319
is preceded by mind and when we act with a mind that's free and clear the action that flows forth from it is

211
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:07,200
skillful is wholesome doesn't cause

212
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:14,160
harm so the first precept this is not taking life and uh this will be a

213
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:19,200
brief a brief sort of look at the first

214
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:26,440
precept again it's not a commandment and um just because I'm not an Axe Murderer

215
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:31,720
for example doesn't mean I can just check the box and say okay uh don't take

216
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:37,000
life on a regular basis uh and I can move on to the second precept it's an

217
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,839
encouragement to notice any movement toward causing harm to other beings to

218
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:48,240
taking life and uh sometimes it's best to move

219
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:54,119
from sort of the level of Axe Murderer which I've just invoked uh or global

220
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:59,680
conflict among humans down to the down to things down to small

221
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:06,680
examples trying to think of an example humorously the first thing that comes to mind when I talk about think

222
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:13,880
about taking life and little things I hope this work is

223
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:21,520
ants little creatures in our lives and the way we inter we interact with them

224
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:27,280
uh we can notice even as we approach the daddy long legs in the bathtub the ants

225
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:36,200
in the kitchen sink are pets we can notice the movement of heart and this is the practice noticing the urge to harm

226
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:42,920
the urge to care the urge to protect and how uh how that moves it's

227
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:50,319
interesting somebody's just chatted about mosquitoes where I used to live mosquitoes carried West Nile Virus so it

228
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:57,480
was really challenging but the point is to challenge ourselves and notice how the heart feels when we have an urge to

229
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:04,880
violence when we have an urge to take life the famous entomologist eio Wilson

230
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,760
was once asked in a lecture academic lecture talking about his research on the chemical signaling with which ants

231
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,720
communicate somebody in the back of the lecture hall said raised hand and said

232
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:27,200
you know this is great very interesting but I've got ink I've got ants all in my kitchen you know what should I do and EO

233
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:34,200
Wilson said enjoy them this is a response I love um because it involves a

234
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:39,880
change of heart so you might experiment with this

235
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:45,800
a bit little things and you know it doesn't mean um

236
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:54,280
that we can meet all experience with uh by just enjoying um

237
00:42:54,280 --> 00:43:00,720
the little creatures around us or by not um occasionally finding that we're in

238
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:08,280
these moral dilemmas around uh ants but what we can do is um

239
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:14,040
refrain what we can do is avoid feeling complacent or smug that that we're

240
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:21,319
ethical actors because we have um avoided being avoided gross physical

241
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:28,599
harm or taking life for example of other humans and focus more on the Mind states

242
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:34,520
that come up when we um when we feel a temptation to

243
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:40,960
harm the under the objective of undertaking a precept like this is not

244
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,040
to act perfectly where we're likely to fall short not beat ourselves up for

245
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:53,520
falling short but rather to um become more aware of how our actions have

246
00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:00,480
consequences we may find ourselves asking more frequently before we Act is this action likely to cause harm to

247
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,760
myself to others may maybe will it cause harm to relationships or is this action

248
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:13,480
in which I'm currently engaged likely to cause harm to myself or others or is

249
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:20,480
this action that I just without a great deal of thought just completed is this action likely to have

250
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:28,000
caused harm to myself to others so to leave with a practice for

251
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:35,440
the day which I gather is something that Gil sometimes does might notice till we get to the

252
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:42,280
second precept tomorrow the urge to harm when it comes up uh in our interaction

253
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:47,319
with the little things maybe and the Lesser life forms maybe just seeing them

254
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:53,800
as lesser is actually um a movement of heart that we can we

255
00:44:53,800 --> 00:45:00,920
can correct a bit we might notice an opposing urge to protect and we might notice the actions

256
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:06,440
that follow how does it feel in body how does it feel in mind how does it feel in the

257
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:13,440
heart which movement of mind and heart has greater stress in it which which has

258
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:21,280
greater ease and as we notice this we can encourage we can incline we

259
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:27,720
can um we can support the movement of the heart away from harm

260
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:34,240
and as we as we do that we create a tendency a momentum in our practice and

261
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:40,559
in our lives that allows us to be more fully awake to the consequences of our

262
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:45,640
actions and more fully present in our

263
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:52,800
experience so that's where I'll leave it for today very much appreciate being with everyone and appreciate appreciate

264
00:45:52,800 --> 00:46:00,960
your efforts to think and bring attention to to the actions we engage in the mind

265
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:07,319
States from which they emanate and our impact on the world and on one

266
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:14,040
another do so with a light heart do so with a smile and we'll meet again tomorrow

267
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:19,359
morning thank you and take care everyone
