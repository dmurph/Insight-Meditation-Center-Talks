and there which is which is okay but not accidental I'm muting I meant um

32
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:23,879
I change the settings so that all chats will only come to host but I ask you to

33
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:28,919
keep the chat uh silent quiet until the end when we

34
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:37,339
open it for Reflections and questions and comments but uh last but not least turning on

35
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:44,060
recording for the sake of Audio Dharma here we go

36
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:51,240
okay all right so welcome lovely to be with you all

37
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,300
for this rendition of happy hour

38
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:04,080
so so for today um I wanted to to invite us to

39
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:11,580
um reflect on so we'll we'll do some meta practice some simple meta practice but I

40
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:17,519
also what I wanted to bring in was an invitation to reflect on our own

41
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:24,600
goodness in this particular way so we all

42
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:32,100
have been reached out to we've all reached out to others through simple acts of

43
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,500
kindness and um these simple random acts of kindness

44
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:44,220
and sometimes they don't seem quite random we text a friend how are you doing or or

45
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,860
um we we are generous with our time with our care with our attention

46
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:57,620
and um we tend to underestimate the value

47
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:04,399
underestimate the power of these acts of kindness in fact

48
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,779
there was a research article that was published uh

49
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:15,120
about a month ago and Neil sent a wonderful paper from New York Times to

50
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:22,440
happier Google Groups and I became really interested in that article and then then I wrote and I read the uh the

51
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,540
original signs paper and then a few other science articles that all point to

52
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:34,019
how we underestimate the power of these random acts of

53
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:39,120
kindness and in fact if you happen to listen to yesterday's talk at IMC

54
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,920
Sunday's talk at IMC I talked about um to this theme this this underestimation

55
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:54,620
this delusion we have this confusion we have this cognitive bias we have about

56
00:10:54,620 --> 00:11:00,660
our kindness about how impactful it really is we don't

57
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:07,200
realize how impactful it really is and how it both impacts the receiver and it also

58
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:13,740
impacts us so there is goodness all around in these acts of kindness

59
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:21,420
so by bringing our awareness to them to appreciate them

60
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:27,440
after the fact recognizing our own goodness recognizing our own

61
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,940
intentionality the Ripple effects which we may not even know what the Ripple

62
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:38,579
effects are but but to appreciate the goodness we can

63
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:45,000
make it more possible that we will do that we will strength the karmic

64
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:52,079
potentiality that we might actually pick up the phone and reach out to a friend or we might

65
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:58,560
say hello to a neighbor and smile not realizing that that might brighten their

66
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,720
day because they're having a tough time etc etc so bringing attention to to

67
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:10,800
appreciating the goodness Within can make these random acts of kindness

68
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,899
more likely for us to actually do them

69
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:21,839
it's a long-winded way of saying it but I hope it makes sense what I'm pointing to so

70
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:28,440
number one we tend to underestimate the impact of of random acts of kindness

71
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:35,339
on others number two we underestimate the impact the the

72
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:41,640
um the positive impact that they have on us on how happy they make us so number

73
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:49,860
three what we're going to do in the practice today besides practicing simple meta is to bring awareness it's like

74
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:55,680
we've planted seeds let's water them let's water them so more

75
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,720
more flowers will bloom more kind flowers in

76
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,120
daily life will will Bloom and what do you know will become a kind

77
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,639
person drop by drop by drop little by little by little through these small

78
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:17,339
little acts of kindness okay I think that's plenty of Framing

79
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:24,720
and if you want more framing you can go and listen to the Sunday's talk uh on Audio Dharma but without further Ado

80
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,079
let's practice together let's let's settle let's arrive

81
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,800
ah so

82
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,760
arriving Landing letting go of all the words

83
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,360
here

84
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,779
oh sweetheart here

85
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:15,779
referring to ourselves kindly gently lovingly

86
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:19,220
oh dear one

87
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:28,740
oh dear one I've brought you to sit to practice

88
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:36,860
I care for you this is how I share and I show my care

89
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:48,800
for myself softening relaxing the body

90
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:01,399
and just letting yourself be breathed

91
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:18,180
for a few minutes without an agenda

92
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,860
just taking Refuge

93
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,720
feeling our sit bones and the cushion and the chair

94
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:06,000
feeling supported connected to the Earth through our feet our legs

95
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:13,320
our bottom ah relaxing the body the upper body

96
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:19,820
offering the entire weight of the upper body to land

97
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:29,060
the way to offer it up to the Earth

98
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:22,678
my thoughts arise if you find that we're entangled in planning remembering it's

99
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:28,799
okay it's all right this is what Minds do we know this we

100
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:34,399
know this mines are like puppies

101
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:42,380
being kind to the puppy of our mind

102
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,960
releasing letting go

103
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:59,340
of the juicy bone that seems juicy but it's really Hollow

104
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,740
and say not now we'll come back later

105
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:12,440
I'll come back later and taking Refuge in our hearts in this moment

106
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,660
and what is the most nourishing

107
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:25,280
nourishing to our marrow to our bone marrow

108
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:34,860
resting resting

109
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:41,840
that our hearts rest and be breathed

110
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:51,559
and as each breath is welcomed each in breath each breath

111
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:08,360
with your body your heart be filled with kindness breathing in kindness

112
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,880
receiving kindness breathing out kindness

113
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,760
the world around you

114
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:33,419
and it's not so effortful it's not that you're doing it just

115
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:40,080
imagine it's happening there is goodness here there is goodness in your heart

116
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:45,900
your good intentions for cultivation otherwise you wouldn't be showing up right now

117
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:51,500
for this practice so trust

118
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:59,280
trust this desire this intention for goodness for cultivating kindness

119
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:06,020
as if you're bellowing you're blowing on an ember

120
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,260
your breath

121
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:19,100
it's blowing on this emperor of loving kindness

122
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:30,860
making this Holy Fire of loving kindness this warmth

123
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:38,900
this care for yourself and others a warm heart

124
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,919
with each breath in your heart center

125
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:48,000
as if with each in breath may I be well with each other breath May others be

126
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:57,080
well may I be saved May others be safe

127
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:05,480
may I be happy May others be happy in breath and not breath

128
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:15,320
can do the four phrases of mitta having to do with safety

129
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:21,380
health happiness and ease or just keep it simple

130
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:29,659
in breath may I be well out breath may all beings be well

131
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:02,460
Let It Be easeful effortless if it becomes too hard

132
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,919
let go of the phrase and just let yourself be

133
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:15,919
breathed that's kind enough

134
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,559
foreign

135
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:29,220
and if you like and stay with this here

136
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,419
or if you wish

137
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:41,059
you're staying embodied breathing in and out

138
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,539
you bring to mind

139
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:54,919
some kindness some random act of kindness that you received

140
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:03,419
in the recent times it was as simple as smile or

141
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:09,140
would be someone being very kind to you going out of their way

142
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:21,360
or whatever it might have been let yourself feel

143
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:29,059
the goodness of that gesture how it impacted you

144
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,880
how it still impacts you

145
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:45,020
let yourself relish be open

146
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:51,440
to relishing this goodness in the world is kindness

147
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:58,039
is quite possible that the person who shared this act of kindness didn't quite

148
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:03,140
appreciate or underestimated how it impacted you

149
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:10,500
maybe in your heart in your mind saying thank you

150
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:16,340
I appreciate them be grateful to them

151
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:27,080
nourishing this goodness goodness begets goodness

152
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:34,278
let yourself feel inspired

153
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,840
and now let yourself bring to Heart bring to mind

154
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,600
some kindness random act of kindness maybe it was a smile Maybe

155
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:19,640
was letting someone go ahead of you and align or maybe reached out to a friend

156
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:27,980
hey how are you I've been thinking of you are offered to help

157
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:32,299
or helped in some way

158
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,778
went out of your way to be kind

159
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:50,700
let yourself bring that to heart and relish relish the goodness

160
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,860
goodness begets goodness

161
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:30,679
and as we often underestimate the impact of our kindness let yourself really appreciate turn up the appreciation

162
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:36,320
of the ripple effect you may not even know

163
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:47,760
yourself feel inspired by this kindness as if

164
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:53,760
as if you are your own twin and it's your twin good at this kindness

165
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,779
you're inspired

166
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:06,200
by your twin wow that was nice ah

167
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:34,080
this is not a time to judge yourself like oh I could have done that I should have done that I was not good enough

168
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:40,919
this is not the time at all if that comes up say thank you very much

169
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:49,860
this is not the time to be judgmental I am relishing goodness and turn your mind to relish goodness

170
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:58,039
you have choice we all have choice exercise it

171
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:06,799
relishing goodness

172
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:52,800
and that's a point whenever feels like your heart is full with appreciating

173
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,380
goodness received and shared you can go back to Simply

174
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:06,560
breathing in kindness breathing out kindness may I be well May others be well

175
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:12,320
may I be well May others be well

176
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:59,300
age in breath may I be well each out breath spreading kindness

177
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,260
spreading loving kindness

178
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,700
May others be well

179
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,599
and as we bring this practice the area to close

180
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:25,859
spreading your kindness far and wide your good will your meta internally to

181
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:33,260
seep into every cell of your body and externally 360 Degrees

182
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:40,740
no preference of inside versus outside outside versus

183
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:48,180
inside may I be well it may others be well

184
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:56,480
all the same it's all the same no separation between me and others really

185
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:05,339
may all beings everywhere be well may all beings everywhere be free

186
00:44:05,339 --> 00:44:08,599
including ourselves

187
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,940
thank you all for your practice foreign

188
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:35,240
before we transition into small groups

189
00:44:37,619 --> 00:44:44,640
which will have an interesting prompt tonight but before we do that any Reflections you'd like to share

190
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,318
Fred please

191
00:44:52,319 --> 00:45:00,540
hi hi thank you I had an experience today that was uh so much the mirror of what you had

192
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:06,900
prompted and of the article that Neil sent us thank you Neil uh so I was I was

193
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:12,359
standing in line at Kaiser to get my covid and my flu shot

194
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:17,400
to do that they would put different colored ribbons on your chest

195
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:24,660
and so I moved down the line and right at the threshold where we're about to enter there was a woman who had one

196
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:30,359
ribbon on and she and her partner came up and told her oh you could if you get the other ribbon you can get both shots

197
00:45:30,359 --> 00:45:36,240
and there was a moment she was about to go in the door into the further chamber

198
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:41,460
of this routine and she froze and I could see that she was anxious and

199
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:47,160
wanted to go back there but it was afraid about losing her place in line so I just took mine off I said here

200
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:54,000
please take mine and she went in and I went back to get another uh ribbon for me and took me all of you know 30

201
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:01,380
seconds and then later we were in another chamber of this routine and she she was

202
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:06,960
somewhat ahead of me and she looked at me and said are you the person who gave me the ribbon because we were in masks

203
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,660
and we had just seen each other for a moment I said yeah I was and she said you made my day

204
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:19,020
and um you know that was much more than I thought I did but of course when she

205
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:27,260
said that that sort of made my day uh and I was then thinking

206
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:35,760
as we began here uh that I think I did that without

207
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:41,339
a hesitation and without embarrassment or fear

208
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:48,720
but also with a moment of scoping out the situation and looking in her face and seeing is this the right thing to do

209
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,060
and I might have made a mistake but in this case I didn't and I

210
00:46:54,060 --> 00:47:01,140
I think it's from coming here for a year and a half that made that more possible

211
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:06,240
and it strikes me that oh well this is another case of the Ripple

212
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:11,760
from your being here Nikki and from Diana and from the other people and for

213
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,579
everybody else here in Sangha um in which these things move and there

214
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:23,099
this is one of those rare occasions when the the trajectory and the origins seem

215
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:29,780
apparent to me um mostly of course they're invisible so thank you

216
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:37,380
thank you thank you so much red so eloquently said spoken thanks for

217
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:43,079
sharing the beautiful story of of your random act of kindness how it made your

218
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:48,599
day and and uh how it made well how it made her day and how it made your day

219
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:54,599
and now you're making all of our days by by uh bringing bringing these this

220
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:59,960
ripple effect and thank you Fred yeah thank you so much

225
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:33,300
which is um Reflections on on when you had you

226
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:42,300
didn't act a random act on kindness um just just as Fred shared and

227
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:49,920
um it made your day or or somebody was kind to you and it made your or you were kind

228
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:55,319
it made their day made your day yet they were kind to you it made your day

229
00:48:55,319 --> 00:49:01,319

groups we'll be roughly groups of three and let it be a chance for mudita from

231
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:15,240

okay welcome back everyone all the rooms are closed

239
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:15,299
so we have a few minutes now for Reflections how was it the sharing

240
00:59:15,299 --> 00:59:21,299
about random acts of kindness receiving giving what what did you notice both in

241
00:59:21,299 --> 00:59:28,099
the process or speaking about it was it inspiring was it

242
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:36,900
seating or planting more seeds I saw it there you go

243
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:44,040
Neil I saw your hand please so it was a lovely meditation and a lovely breakout

244
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:50,460
um so I was I would have to say entertain during the meditation when I noticed

245
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:55,680
that I was like so thrilled at the random acts of kindness that happened to

246
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:00,900
me and so disparaging of the acts I gave to other people I kept switching looking

247
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:09,480
for one that actually made a difference and then I'm like that's the article you sent her it's what she just talked about

248
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:16,700
um you know yeah yeah yeah apparently I'm stuck with my human mind for now

249
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:24,000
oh thanks for sharing that Neil that is that is so human and and I love that you

250
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:31,200
got to see it so clearly and that you're sharing it out loud and laughing at it because that's exactly it you know in

251
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:36,720
Buddhism when we call talk about you know greed hatred and delusion that

252
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:42,859
confusion that one one um uh synonym I've just come up for uh

253
01:00:42,859 --> 01:00:47,940
with is is um uh cognitive

254
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:54,420
um bias is cognitive bias is like radical cognitive bias and you just saw

255
01:00:54,420 --> 01:01:01,020
your radical cognitive bias right and these cognitive biases are measured in Psychology expert we know we have them

256
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:07,920
it's just the Illusions like wait a minute I know this and yet I'm doing it wow isn't it interesting to be human so

257
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:14,339
this cognitive bias of oh yeah what other people's people do it it's impactful and what I do is just not good

258
01:01:14,339 --> 01:01:20,099
enough like oh sweetheart that's such a cognitive bias so thanks for sharing

259
01:01:20,099 --> 01:01:27,260
cognitive bias or clearly naming it yeah thanks to you

260
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:34,460
that's great that's great other Reflections what else came up

261
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:40,799
groups in in your practice also in breathing in kindness breathing

262
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:46,380
out kindness that was actually that was a new experiment uh I had never let it

263
01:01:46,380 --> 01:01:51,480
in this particular way I have to say we've done many different ways but but

264
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:58,559
with the in-breath may I be well um and out breath May others be well to

265
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:05,339
pair that I wonder if notice the shift and and if you noticed the shift with that

266
01:02:05,339 --> 01:02:12,420
um one person says so much to learn from my group and how to find the moments of

267
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:17,460
light in the dark in the day and ask for help beautiful thanks for sharing that

Nikki I wanted to comment that uh within within my small group

271
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:50,099
the uh the consensus was that we get so much goodness from being in this group

272
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:56,460
that kind of tunes us into these little you know little moments in life where we

273
01:02:56,460 --> 01:03:03,359
can make a difference and it helps a lot it really does be being in the group
