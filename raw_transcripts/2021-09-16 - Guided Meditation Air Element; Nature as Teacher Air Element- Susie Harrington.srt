1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,600
good morning and uh this is

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,320
the first couple days i hadn't figured out outside my range how to see the

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,520
chat that people are sharing that are on the youtube stream and i

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,519
have to say that i can see it i can't read it all while i'm

5
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:29,439
talking but i can see it and it's quite lovely it's really i can feel the sangha

6
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:36,399
this spread all over and quite beautiful and i realize there's many of you that

7
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,879
have have this as your regular practice that you're committed to being here every day

8
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:49,280
and just want to celebrate that with you that this has been made possible

9
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,640
and sort of one of the gifts that's come out of these

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,640
very difficult recent times

11
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,240
so beginning today with air we've talked about

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,280
earth and water and fire and now moving on to include air

13
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,439
and this last year [Music] has been

14
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,280
particularly poignant the year and a half really around air

15
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,119
we've seen sort of this and we've gained so much understanding

16
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,720
about how connected we are and it's come through our awareness of

17
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,799
breath so there's um you know i really

18
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,840
uh last summer and with george floyd the eye can't

19
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,640
breathe and how deeply we were all affected by that

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,399
and rightly so and how that phrase

21
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,479
like got us right where we where we live and where we die

22
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:14,560
and raised consciousness in a huge way in a way that was really good

23
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,040
and in the midst of that we have

24
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,800
covid which is has made us so aware

25
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,319
of how connected we all are by breath that this

26
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:39,360
thing this virus that is carried on the breath has traveled the entire world

27
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,959
we it's it's sort of a a terrible and yet

28
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,959
clarifying

29
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,440
unfolding of how clearly our breath is intimately

30
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,720
connected everyone you can't be left out of this

31
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,720
and then again in a another way with the smoke and you know

32
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,159
when the smoke from the california fires reaches all the way to the east coast

33
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:24,159
and it's like oh right the air we breathe it moves everywhere

34
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:33,840
so there's something so intimate about this

35
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,840
and sometimes challenging i want to acknowledge that part too

36
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,360
but the breath we start our practice with our breath that's where we begin

37
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,599
and there's so much in that there's so much potency available if we

38
00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:01,840
start to connect with this universal breath that we all share

39
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,439
so we'll begin our practice i'll offer a poem to start

40
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:15,040
and i'll offer a few different ways to connect with this

41
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,320
element of air

42
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,800
beginning with a poem as you're settling into your meditation spot

43
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,199
finding your ground this is from dana faults

44
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,199
walk slowly it only takes a reminder to breathe

45
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:46,639
a moment to be still and just like that something in me settles softens

46
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,240
makes space for imperfection the harsh voice of judgment drops to a

47
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,639
whisper and i remember again that life isn't a relay race that we will all cross the

48
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,160
finish line that waking up to life is what we were born for

49
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:11,360
as many times as i forget catch myself charging forward without even knowing where i'm going

50
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,680
that many times i can make the choice to stop to breathe

51
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,880
and be and walk slowly into the mystery

52
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:36,918
so as you settle into your posture feeling your connection with the ground

53
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,560
feel the pressure of your buttocks on the chair the cushion

54
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,639
feel your feet in contact with the ground

55
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:17,199
allow yourself to feel the spine rising up

56
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:26,800
and then the muscles softening responding to the pull of gravity

57
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,440
softening in the shoulders

58
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,240
letting the eyes soften

59
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,759
and allow yourself to tune in a little bit to the

60
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,800
place where you are recognizing that even if you're in a building

61
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,720
but just outside there's trees

62
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,800
there's plants there's other beings

63
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,840
and allow yourself to feel how these other beings just acknowledging perhaps

64
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,720
conceptually and then just sensing it a little that these other beings

65
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:09,360
are breathing that the trees are breathing

66
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,520
they breathe out carbon dioxide and breathe in oxygen

67
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,039
the algae of the ocean are breathing in great quantities

68
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:29,120
the deep forests the tropical forest the boreal forests

69
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,560
all breathing and as we breathe in we breathe with

70
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,560
them

71
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,800
and the breath is carried on the wind through the air

72
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,240
spreading everywhere

73
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,600
and as you breathe feel this breath

74
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,440
as it comes into your body

75
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,200
through this open door of the throat

76
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,360
feel the breath in the area of the diaphragm the solar plexus

77
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,720
as it comes in and fills you here

78
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:10,100
as you breathe it [Music]

79
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:25,040
as you breathe in let the breath be felt in the lower belly

80
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,480
sense it from the inside the world coming in through the throat

81
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:41,600
all this breathing coming right into your lower belly just notice you don't need to change the

82
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:48,839
breath to feel it there just notice that you can feel it

83
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:10,480
let yourself feel the breath all the way to the base of the body

84
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,839
in the perineum into the joints of the hips it'll become subtler there

85
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,040
but it's still affected we can still sense the breath

86
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,040
here

87
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,839
perhaps noticing that you can feel it even along the back along the lower

88
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,959
lumbar and the sacrum

89
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:11,079
notice if you can have even some sense that the breath flows down your legs

90
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,639
the slight ripple of movement we know that in fact the breath

91
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:26,000
the oxygen is being transported through our blood down

92
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:35,200
to every cell but can you sense it just the subtle energetic movement

93
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,200
of breath flowing down into your legs perhaps you can tell part way down your

94
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,480
legs or fully whatever you can feel

95
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,839
or sense

96
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,839
this nourishment of breath

97
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:26,959
perhaps noticing the whole body from the waist down

98
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,279
that it's breathing

99
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:43,399
it's being breathed no effort required

100
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,920
letting yourself sense up into the chest area

101
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:06,880
you can feel it most clearly to the front but notice that you can feel the breath also along

102
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:13,720
the back the ribs expanding just a little

103
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,399
the breath along the sides of the ribs

104
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:09,839
then feeling the breath in the upper chest and both in the front in the back

105
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:17,160
under the whole region of the collar girdle shoulder girdle

106
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,720
feel the breath in the right shoulder

107
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,480
see if you can notice this sensation of breath traveling

108
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:49,839
and including your right arm breath

109
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,240
nourishment the molecules of the amazon and the ocean

110
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:06,279
algae breathing in flowing down your arms

111
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,560
and the left shoulder

112
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,000
sometimes the shoulders the body has to soften some to allow

113
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,839
more this sense of air to be filled

114
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:33,720
and be nourished letting the breath flow down the left arm

115
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:52,000
feeling your body from the neck down one

116
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,839
full breathing body

117
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:12,319
the blessing of breath coming in and flowing to every corner

118
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,798
every cell

119
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,240
and letting this sense of the breath

120
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:29,120
fill your head as well the neck filling all the way through all your

121
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:36,240
sinuses filling your brain

122
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:44,840
breath nourishing deep inside the skull

123
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,240
feeling the whole body breathing

124
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,799
being breathed aliveness

125
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:22,279
notice this air element may have some aspect of vibration or lightness

126
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:58,320
we can't see this air we can see its effect we can feel it

127
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,200
move in the body

128
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,320
you might notice that thoughts when they come are much like this element of air

129
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,559
they have this air quality they appear ephemeral

130
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:58,880
cannot really be touched directly and then they just drift away disappear

131
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,799
right back in to the empty space they came from

132
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,679
allow your thoughts to come and go

133
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,320
like the air

134
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,799
drifting in and out like rustling leaves

135
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:47,440
and as you breathe you don't need to exclude anything sound comes through the air

136
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:54,240
sensations arise thoughts come and go

137
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:02,679
all to be breathed in and allowed to breathe out

138
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,240
foreign

139
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,600
feeling the whole body breathing and in those moments where we start to

140
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,120
latch onto a thought where we cling to some

141
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:46,880
thing that's arisen just notice that there's a way the breath there's a constriction a contraction we

142
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:53,200
lose contact with the fullness of the breath and then we remember

143
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:59,360
that we're being breathed and we can rest in this breath

144
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:06,080
and the relaxation [Music] the fullness is available again

145
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:15,840
let yourself notice any coming and going

146
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,640
every cell in your body being awoken

147
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:22,960
alive with the breath of the world this thin

148
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,399
layer of air covering the surface

149
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,910
this living alive breath that we share

150
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:41,039
[Music] you are part of it

151
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:52,120
you too are breathing breathing with the whole world

152
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,960
no inside no outside simply breath

153
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,840
coming and going

154
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:46,559
breath perfading your whole body the space around you

155
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:52,039
inside each living being

156
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:12,520
rest and allow yourself to be held great sacred breath

157
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,600
foreign

158
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:44,159
it's fun to realize that in spite of our distance and the spread and the way we

159
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,760
just sort of appear as i appear as a voice and you maybe as a

160
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:57,840
typing or on zoom as a box but we're all still breathing together

161
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:06,480
it's all still moving around and this breath is so important in our

162
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,480
sangha i mean in our practice it's and in our sangha but in our practice the

163
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,600
buddha started his instructions on the four foundations with pay

164
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,039
attention to the breath does it come in short does it come in long

165
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:28,640
how does it feel and many of us are very intimate with

166
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:36,159
our breath sometimes our breath can be challenging and we can go to the places of constriction or

167
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:44,080
places where it's difficult and i always appreciate the the instruction of go to where there's

168
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:51,760
ease and pleasure in the breath go to where you can find it

169
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,480
this uh connection aspect of it it's so interesting we start with the

170
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:05,039
breath we are connected to it and yet it has this insubstantial

171
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:13,839
it's it's a doorway it's starting to move into this mysterious earth is so here solid right

172
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:19,520
there and the water we can touch and now as we're moving towards the air we're

173
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:27,599
starting to move into this area of the mysterious and it's interesting the word spirit

174
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:36,079
in greek was breath wind and that word turned into our western in

175
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:42,000
our languages into the word spirit and anima comes from latin

176
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,200
air breath to animate animal

177
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:55,440
this connection that has been there in our language is intuitively known by us that the breath

178
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,480
the spirit the animation the aliveness

179
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:07,839
are all so intimately connected and to let ourselves feel that

180
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:14,160
this animation that comes this spirit

181
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,440
in some indigenous traditions when they talk about the great spirit

182
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,680
the that's the translation we get they're talking at least in the ones i know the dna

183
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,200
that it they're speaking specifically to the wind to the air

184
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,640
that that is the spirit the great spirit that connects

185
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,560
the dna say that's uh the navajo they call themselves the dna

186
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:48,240
the wind within one is in no way autonomous for it is in a continual

187
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:56,240
process of interchange with the various winds that surrounds one and indeed is entirely a part of the

188
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:03,280
holy wind itself it's a quote from david abrams book

189
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:10,160
a spell with the sensuous and he doesn't name the particular individual so that's why i didn't say

190
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:16,800
this idea that the spirit is moving around this aliveness and coming into us

191
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,160
and then adding to that that our breath is our

192
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:28,400
speech that when we speak we are

193
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:35,040
speaking with this sacred breath that comes out of us

194
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,880
and what is our speech this connection this possibility this opportunity for

195
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:47,040
truth and beauty and then how it gets distorted and

196
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,400
confused but we can come back and this is often

197
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:59,119
in spiritual traditions and certainly in ours singing and chanting

198
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:05,440
are part of the tradition we join our breath together in speaking and feeling

199
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,680
the sacred

200
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:16,960
there's a play here happening i hope you can hear it between the scene and the

201
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:23,119
unseen that happens through the breath through the wind and we see it all

202
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,560
around us you know when the when the leaves move on the tree we see the

203
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:35,440
result of it when the clouds move we see this sort of

204
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:43,920
wind air made tangible for a moment and then dissipating or being moved

205
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:51,838
and we live in this world of breath

206
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:59,680
in the body as we feel it and just as i talk even keep noticing see if you can

207
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:07,200
feel your breath perhaps even the words that i'm saying can you breathe them in

208
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:14,079
what is that like to let them come in and be felt in your body

209
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:20,880
to stay connected to this breath and breath has a

210
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:27,680
lightness to it in some ways you might say it's the balancing with the earth

211
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:33,839
element it brings up and it's often talked about in the

212
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:41,599
buddhist tradition as having the vibration quality and i think of that as kind of this aliveness that we feel in

213
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,800
us you know there's something that it's almost hard to pin down what

214
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:53,920
it is but when you feel into your body you can feel a certain aliveness here

215
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:02,079
this is the air element as we recognize it right here in us

216
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:09,040
and as i mentioned in the meditation the the thoughts are understood to be an

217
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,960
expression of the air element and that makes sense doesn't it the way

218
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:22,160
that thoughts just sort of appear out of nothing they have this sort of temporary

219
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,040
quality and then they disappear

220
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:36,560
dissipate into nothing once again and when we can understand and sense

221
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,920
the way the thoughts are this air element it can help us

222
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:48,079
become less be less attached less clinging to them as if they were solid

223
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:54,640
right that's where we get in trouble when we start believing that our thoughts are solid and real in the final

224
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,079
word on everything and instead recognizing oh they come and

225
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:06,960
they go and even the words that we say they're sacred on one side

226
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,880
and on another way they just disappear into nothing

227
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:19,760
and we're doing all of this in communion

228
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:27,760
with the algae the plants that breathe one a practice that i

229
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:35,839
offer to you that's something that i like to do is i go out in the where there's trees or a plant and i go

230
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:42,800
out and i sit with it and i breathe with it and what is it to breathe with this

231
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:49,440
other being that's so different in some ways than us and yet it too is

232
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,200
breathing i started out very early on in

233
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,880
high school being fascinated with plants and the soma that are breathing and

234
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:07,040
taking in the those are that's their their breathing mechanism

235
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:12,240
and us too we're all being breathed

236
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,040
feel your breath let yourself breathe

237
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,838
i want to end with a poem from

238
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:41,920
rumi called in every breath

239
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,920
in every breath if you're the center of your own desires you'll lose the grace

240
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:54,319
of your beloved but if in every breath you blow away your self-claim

241
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:59,839
the ecstasy of love will soon arrive in every breath if you're the center of

242
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:07,040
your own thoughts the sadness of autumn will fall on you but if in every breath you strip naked

243
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,720
just like a winter the joy of spring will grow from within

244
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:19,920
all your patients come from the push for gain of patience let go of the effort and peace will

245
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:27,040
arrive all your unfulfilled desires are from your greed for gain of fulfillments let

246
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:34,240
go of them all and they will be sent as gifts fall in love with the agony of love not

247
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:40,560
the ecstasy then the beloved will fall in love with you

248
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:50,400
i want to offer today as a practice allow yourself to feel the generosity of

249
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,040
the world of all the beings that are participating in this breath

250
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:04,640
the generosity of all the plants and as you breathe out

251
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:12,640
as you breathe out others breathe in feel it in your body right now

252
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:19,040
and whenever you remember today not just your breath not just the breath

253
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:26,480
but that you're breathing with no inside no outside

254
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:36,160
all of us breathing together breathing breathing alive animated

255
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,440
thank you all
