1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,838
okay so let's go ahead with the the meditation together

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,880
i see folks arriving and more will come and join us

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,240
so just settling in arriving

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,760
and allowing yourself to have a sense of

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,200
slowing down becoming present for your experience

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,520
you can let the eyes close

7
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,760
i just feel the body in the sitting posture

8
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,039
feeling the straightness of the spine

9
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,720
feeling the connection to where you're sitting

10
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:29,040
contact points of the seat and the legs or the feet

11
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,399
we might imagine that the body rises off the cushion or the chair

12
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:53,119
the way a sea plant rises off the sea floor it's anchored at the bottom

13
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,359
and just floats in the water lead upward

14
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,959
the arms float the head floats on the spine

15
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:21,200
it can help to imagine a little space between the top vertebra and the base of the skull

16
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,920
to soften the neck

17
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,319
softening the eyes and the eye sockets

18
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,720
releasing the chest the belly

19
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,640
so inviting some ease or expansion in the torso

20
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,640
so the invitation today is to take body sensations as the focus of

21
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,360
mindfulness

22
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:52,080
this includes sounds and the breath

23
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,959
often one of the more prominent body sensations

24
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,760
and also all the various pulsings and

25
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,360
tinglings heat and vibrations that

26
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,480
course around in the body

27
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,959
some of these are related to being in the sitting posture or whatever

28
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,040
posture you're in some relate to

29
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,309
digestion or breathing [Music]

30
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,280
and some are just there because because the body is alive

31
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,840
so we have these different sensations

32
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,680
and we put those into the foreground

33
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,560
while letting thoughts or emotions be more

34
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,919
more in the background for now

35
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,840
those things are fine but they're not the main focus for now

36
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:45,280
so just resting with the various body sensations

37
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,240
opening to that or being willing to listen to the body

38
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,080
whether the sensations are pleasant or unpleasant

39
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,520
as well as all the many many neutral sensations

40
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:05,680
the body has a way of opening up when we turn our

41
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,479
gentle mindful attention toward it

42
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:22,639
perhaps the way a flower opens when the sun begins to shine on it

43
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:31,080
perks up a bit it shows more of itself

44
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,039
when there's a genuine non-judgmental interest

45
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:43,200
there are a lot of options with the body so if a given part is feeling

46
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,720
painful it may draw the attention but there's no need

47
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,880
for us to continue with that if it feels like it's getting stronger we can just move the

48
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,160
attention elsewhere

49
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:10,160
or we can open to sounds or even open the eyes

50
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,079
you can find what works

51
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,680
is simply to be to be simple

52
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
okay

53
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,440
me

54
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,959
as we stay with this realm of the body and breath and

55
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,959
sounds

56
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:37,360
it's easy to see that many of these sensations are changing

57
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,560
some are very quick just to rise and pass

58
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:52,000
others feel like they're there ongoing but if we look carefully they're they're

59
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,560
probably shifting fluttering a bit

60
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,839
there are different ways to be with changing

61
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:27,120
experience like this we might

62
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,800
kind of feel each one as an event

63
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,079
noting it

64
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,839
or we can also have a sense of mindfulness as a field or

65
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,680
an expanse like a lake or like the sky in various

66
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:03,320
experiences come in and out of that happen within that

67
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,319
in either of those ways is fine

68
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,560
but just being aware of this changing

69
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,360
flux of experience

70
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:05,169
[Music]

71
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:50,320
and from time to time we might again just scan through the body

72
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:58,800
and invite ease in case any parts have tightened up

73
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:07,440
sometimes the eyes get tight if we are literally trying to look

74
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,639
at experience

75
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:22,279
or sometimes the changing nature of experience brings up some tension

76
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,680
so it can help to imagine softening

77
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,839
just letting the experience be changing as it

78
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:43,839
so we have a sense of resting in the normal flow

79
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,839
of sounds and sensations and breath

80
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,160
resting

81
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:10,679
when we are noticing impermanence or inconstancy

82
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:18,960
it becomes clearer to see when the mind hangs up or gets

83
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:25,440
fixed on something which is very normal

84
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:32,240
and when we notice that the mind has grasped onto the

85
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,440
bank of the river we can just gently get back into the

86
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,440
flow

87
00:21:52,920 --> 00:22:00,400
[Music] again seeing if we can rest [Music]

88
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:07,159
and soften with this changing experience

89
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:40,399
noticing the changing nature of experience

90
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:47,000
gradually helps the heart learn to let go

91
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:55,320
there's no point in grasping this flow

92
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:07,519
there's hardly anything to grasp as it changes so much

93
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,559
it even seems to run by itself

94
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:06,480
so as we move toward the ending of this sit

95
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,080
we might consider how might it be to

96
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,679
flow a bit more today

97
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,919
we may find that it's easier to be present for other people

98
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,600
when we are not stopping the flow of an interaction

99
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:39,360
in our mind by grasping on to our own thoughts or views

100
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:46,240
thinking about what we're going to say next but instead just staying present

101
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,840
for this other person

102
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:03,080
our own willingness to be with how things are changing

103
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:11,039
makes us more available for other people and more resilient

104
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:16,039
more flexible more responsive

105
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:22,240
so cultivating this understanding of change is our friend

106
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:29,320
and it's a an important rather deep aspect of practice

107
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,760
and it evolves over a long time

108
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,120
so

109
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,670
[Music]

110
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,799
[Music]

111
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:37,440
so first i just have one little announcement which is that on friday

112
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:45,039
we will have after this session a community meeting on zoom

113
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:51,600
and the link for that will appear on the imc website in the what's new

114
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,919
section and it'll be on the calendar also and i'll i'll be there for

115
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:03,039
any questions you might have and and we'll have time for some breakout groups also

116
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:07,398
so that's friday if you're interested

117
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:26,320
one time gill was on a long retreat during his time in asia

118
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,679
and he had an insight about mindfulness

119
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,799
sometimes these things don't sound maybe as profound when spoken out of context

120
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:43,039
but his insight was that we can be mindful of anything

121
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:51,120
there's nothing that can't be known in awareness and this is really good news

122
00:30:51,120 --> 00:31:00,080
it's really good news so we talked yesterday about practicing to extend our mindfulness

123
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,279
into broader realms of our life and the focus was about how

124
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:10,559
mindfulness counteracts what are called the five chords of sensual pleasure

125
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:16,880
which also includes a version so today we're going to go deeper into this

126
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,120
territory that mindfulness can penetrate so even beyond

127
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,399
the kind of more everyday situations where we have tempting sense pleasures

128
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:34,720
or more challenging emotions there is the great challenge that all

129
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,760
humans face of aging and illness and death

130
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,159
and this too is a realm for mindfulness so the buddha gave some brilliant

131
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:52,240
teachings on mindfulness in relation in particular to death or or terminal

132
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,320
illness and i hope you're not reaching for the off button at this moment please stay if

133
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,840
you can i'll be sharing some some stories around this

134
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,519
including something that the buddha said as his own death was approaching

135
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,760
so many many suites talk about mindfulness at the time of death as well

136
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:22,480
as mindfulness being a refuge in general in times of challenge

137
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:32,320
so both of those are today's theme mindfulness at the time of death and mindfulness as a genuine refuge for us

138
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:40,159
when the buddha was giving meditation instructions to his son rahula

139
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:47,440
one thing that he taught him was mindfulness of breathing and in the discourse where he does that

140
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:54,720
he says to rahula when mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated

141
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,840
even the final in-breaths and out-breaths are known as they cease

142
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:06,640
not unknown so it's quite powerful he's saying that in other words you know we can die

143
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,240
mindfully just through the basic practice of mindfulness of breathing

144
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:19,679
which i know many of us have have done at least to some degree so continuing with that

145
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:26,720
goes all the way to being mindful up to the last moments the last breaths

146
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,720
so mindfulness is a reliable practice for us in ways that

147
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:39,120
some other practices may not be the monk um osagie became agitated

148
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,640
around the time of death because he was a practitioner mostly of concentration

149
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:50,159
and he found that he could not concentrate his mind when he was enduring

150
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:57,039
a terminal illness and so he expressed this concern to the buddha he said i think i'm slipping back because

151
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:05,039
i can't get concentrated and the buddha pointed him toward letting go of attachment even to meditative states

152
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:10,480
and he said just be mindful he didn't quite say it that way but

153
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:18,240
he um he pointed out the reliability of simply knowing we can be aware of how we are

154
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,760
mindfulness is always possible um being aware is very simple

155
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,520
as ajahn sumeto says and this is very practical advice for any time

156
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,960
right now it's like this i've practiced that myself sometimes

157
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:41,520
just um realize right now it's like this and it brings the mind right back right

158
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:49,118
to a simple place and we could do that all the way up all the way up to the moment of death

159
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,158
so then another story

160
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:00,960
one time the buddha visited the sikh ward according to the discourse

161
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:08,480
place where the monastics who were sick were staying and he said to the monks there

162
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,400
a person should await their time mindful and clearly comprehending

163
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,440
this is our instruction to you and how is a person mindful

164
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,560
and then he goes on to name the four establishments of mindfulness

165
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,800
exactly using the same language that they're stated in the santi patana

166
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:37,599
here a person is mindful of the body in the body ardent clearly comprehending and mindful

167
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:44,079
and so forth so it's interesting that he

168
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:49,440
he points out that this is what should come to mind as we are even when we're

169
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:56,880
sick even when we're in the hospital essentially so then which aspects of satipatana

170
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:03,440
might be particularly relevant for someone who's in a state like that

171
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,560
and in one teaching the buddha points particularly toward the contemplation of

172
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:14,320
feeling tongue so you might remember gil has been going through all the

173
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:22,000
satipatanas and when he spoke earlier in the series feeling tone is the second foundation of

174
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,640
mindfulness and it's about whether experience is pleasant or unpleasant

175
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:35,359
or neither pleasant nor unpleasant so it's a very kind of basic response that we have to

176
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:40,880
experience and so that means it can be done without much mental effort

177
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:47,040
to just know whether something is pleasant or unpleasant or neither is

178
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,200
something the mind can know every moment and it's a powerful practice because it

179
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,720
directly prevents the mind from or at least reduces the chances that the mind

180
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:06,400
will move into craving or aversion so if we just know something with the label this is pleasant we're much less

181
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,640
likely to mindlessly go on into thinking how can i get more of this i really need

182
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,240
this etc or if it's unpleasant we can just stop

183
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:24,079
there and not get into a long thought trail about how horrible it is and how we wish it would end

184
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:30,400
which the mind would otherwise naturally do so this is definitely relevant for for

185
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:37,760
dying we don't want to keep our mind in a prolonged state of aversion

186
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:45,680
and then the uh the suit does also very much encourage the wisdom reflection that all feeling tones are impermanent

187
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,880
that was what we looked at in the meditation that was more just impermanence of

188
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:57,040
sensations so that means it's not fruitful to grasp onto them or push them away

189
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:03,599
so reflection on impermanence is a major theme in the as you might guess in the teachings

190
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,040
about death so again even just the simple practice of sitting and

191
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:14,400
noticing changing sounds changing body sensations

192
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:19,839
in our current state is something that will fortify the mind

193
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:25,520
and prepare it for something that's coming later

194
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,680
so all of our current practice is actually building up strength in the mind

195
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,920
i volunteered in a hospice for a while and i noticed that there was a big

196
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:46,000
difference between the people who became overwhelmed by regret or pain worthy

197
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,599
general indignity of dying compared with those who could stay present and could

198
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:56,800
somehow keep their mind in a more wholesome place

199
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:03,040
i guess to be clear i'll say that there is not just one perfect way to die the proverbial

200
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:10,000
good death however you die is going to be fine but it is good to at least aim the mind

201
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:18,160
toward mindfulness and it can help in particular to keep feeling tongue in mind

202
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:26,160
so having this method of avoiding falling into craving an aversion

203
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:32,560
really serves as a refuge for the mind and the heart so there's again this sense like we

204
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,160
talked about yesterday that when the mind is mindful we're safe we're we're

205
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,680
protected in a sense so i wanted to look now at some

206
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,440
passages from the sutta that deals with the death of the buddha

207
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,960
so that's the mahaparinibana suta and it

208
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,880
chronicles the last few months of the buddha's life it's a very long suta that kind of

209
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,560
goes through everything he was doing in his travels and his teachings all the way up to

210
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,520
to the time of his death and it includes these um famous lines that some of you have

211
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:20,480
probably heard so he says monks you should live as islands unto

212
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:27,119
yourselves being your own refuge with no other refuge you should live with the dhamma as an

213
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:32,720
island with the dhamma as your refuge with no other refuge

214
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,839
and many people have only heard that much and that alone is good advice for

215
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:43,200
dying which we will be doing alone even if there are people with us of course no

216
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:50,319
one is coming along with us in that transition but i want to highlight today because of

217
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:55,680
this series what comes after those famous lines so

218
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:03,440
the buddha continues and how does a person live as an island unto themselves being their own refuge

219
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:10,400
and with the dhamma as an island as a refuge here a person abides contemplating the body

220
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,920
as a body ardent fully aware and mindful having set aside covetousness and grief

221
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,280
for the world a person abides contemplating feeling as feeling

222
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,640
and so on you may recognize the lines again straight from the satipatana suta

223
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:34,079
saying language so the buddha says that cultivating the four establishments of mindfulness is

224
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,440
how we can be a refuge for ourselves and how we can also take the dharma as our

225
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:46,560
refuge and he thought that was important enough that he conveyed it clearly and strongly

226
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,760
quite close to the time of his own death he was taught he was thinking about what to pass on

227
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:59,520
uh to people so one more story this one modern

228
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:06,800
and this is um about uh this is something i heard from a friend of mine who trained as a monk in asia

229
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:12,640
and he tells the story of an abbot about an asian monastery who was dying so this

230
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:19,119
is recently during the 20th century and the abbott summoned his senior monk

231
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:25,440
saying that he wants to give him a final gift and the monk was wondering what's that

232
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:32,560
going to be and so he came to the abbott and the abbott took the monk's hand and

233
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:39,520
he folded down four of his fingers and he just held his hand like that

234
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:44,560
among sand and he said the four foundations of mindfulness are my gift

235
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,079
to you as i pass on

236
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:59,200
so these are um some lines from vikku anaglio's book on on mindfully facing disease and death

237
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,480
suppose one has suddenly become seriously ill and is in pain

238
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:11,119
physically unable to sit in formal meditation or just be quietly by oneself perhaps

239
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:17,680
even being close to passing away what to do the one thing to rely on in such a

240
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:23,280
situation is mindfulness from early buddhist meditation to modern

241
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,720
day clinical pain relief mindfulness is what empowers one to face

242
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:36,400
disease and death after all we might say what's the alternative

243
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:45,200
so mindfulness is valuable even as we approach death the great challenge for humans

244
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:53,040
and so it might be that at this point you're starting to get a sense of the real strength and power of mindfulness it's

245
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:59,119
very powerful so we started just a couple days ago by talking about

246
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:05,359
an almost passive guarding of the scent stores but mindfulness has a different

247
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:11,920
dimension also where it can step forward and meet very difficult situations

248
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,520
so that's the direction that we're going to go next tomorrow i'll talk about the

249
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:26,240
strength of mindfulness and some of the wonderful images that go with that it can be can be quite inspiring

250
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,960
so thank you
