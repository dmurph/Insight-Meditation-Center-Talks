110
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:59,240
integration [Music] in your body and mind maybe sense of calm stability

so lovely to sit with you grounding to sit with you i hope

128
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:33,919
i hope you did um experience and

129
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:39,200
and uh well i'll say a little more about the guided meditation and and

130
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,200
the theme so so maybe what i'll say first about the

131
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,640
guided meditation the invitations what um

132
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:57,840
what i was inviting us to consider um is the sense of

133
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:04,080
wholeness of the body body as a whole this entirety of the body

134
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:10,480
and mostly i was bringing in the teachings of um

135
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:17,140
the four elements the element of earth as well as actually i was bringing

136
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:23,360
[Music] all the elements in here and there there's so many different ways

137
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:29,279
to practice the four elements but the sense of solidity the sense of

138
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:34,720
wholeness of this body as a statue as a buddhist statue also for us to feel the

139
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:41,919
uprightness the the sense of integrity um

140
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:47,200
in this body so the element of solidity hardness

141
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,200
feeling the body sitting like a statue and then also

142
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,399
feeling inviting the sense of the breath coming in and going in which is the air

143
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:03,760
element as well as the cohesion the sense of

144
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:10,158
cohesion and that's the water element feeling the cohesiveness cohesiveness of the body that's the

145
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:17,118
water element and [Music] there's the heat there's also the fire

146
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:25,599
element there's a sense of heat which i guess i didn't bring in much but a sense of warmth in the body sitting

147
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:32,720
and also the space element sometimes considered as the feeling the spaciousness of the breath

148
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,560
that's the way i was bringing it in but the idea here the idea and the guided

149
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,398
meditation is to ground the mind in the body in this

150
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:50,560
wholeness of the body and the solidity of the body in the fullness of the body

151
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:57,040
and the mind can really settle and i hope you experience that a little

152
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,680
bit there's a sense of settling cohesiveness there's a sense of being embodied

153
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,520
be getting in our body instead of living our our lives from a few feet away from

154
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,839
our head from our bodies and our heads always running ahead running running ahead or running behind in the

155
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:21,920
past but the idea is that we can become embodied through bringing the attention

156
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,760
bringing the awareness to the uh in different ways and there are

157
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:34,720
different ways by by bringing our awareness and our attention to the body in different ways

158
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,760
there are different results that can actually come up it's not the same old

159
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:47,200
same old okay and pay attention to your breath in your abdomen rise and fall but the different ways

160
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:53,760
that we pay attention to the body to the breath as i will discuss in the next few days

161
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,000
can have different effects for settling for awakening for working

162
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:06,000
with the five hindrances there there are many uh techniques or many

163
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,640
wise ways to relate to the body so um

164
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,359
a little bit about the the guided meditation the intention of it and the

165
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:26,400
sense of cohesiveness wholeness to release have an image of the body and also part

166
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,960
of this practice i'm pulling a lot of different practices together also part of these practices from the visual maga

167
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:40,079
from path of purification practice from abi dhamma higher teachings which i've also practiced so i'm adapting these

168
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,760
various practices um and sharing them with you

169
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:54,320
today and this week to to explore some other terrains so

170
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:00,880
so the idea of of again with this meditation today having it

171
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,160
if you want to again repeat that and continue this having a complete sense of

172
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,680
body the outline the wholeness of the body sitting moving so

173
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:19,520
there's a wholeness that brings a sense of integrity so now i want to step back and and

174
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:27,040
say a little more about the context of of this week um

175
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,240
so the buddha in gujarat nikaya

176
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:39,440
4 45 said the end of the world

177
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,800
can never be reached by walking however

178
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:53,520
without having reached the world's end there is no release from suffering

179
00:37:53,599 --> 00:38:01,200
i declare that it is in this fathom-long body

180
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,240
with its perceptions and thoughts that there is the world

181
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,280
the origin of the world the cessation of the world

182
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:18,520
and the path leading to the cessation of the world

183
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:27,599
so quite quite an interesting teaching here um

184
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,799
and and profound and and

185
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:40,800
i'll read this line again i declare that it is in this fathom-long body

186
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:46,800
with its perceptions and thoughts that there is the world

187
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,480
in this body there is the world the origin of the world's cessation of

188
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,960
the world the path leading to the decision of the world so basically in this fathom

189
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,280
long body is with all the thoughts and perceptions this is where awakening

190
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:10,720
happens this is where suffering happens this is where awakening happens

191
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,800
so the importance of the body

192
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,480
and relating to the body and awareness of the body working with the

193
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:30,560
body and i also want to remind you all that in the four and the sati patana in

194
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,079
the satipatana sutta the first satipata the first

195
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:42,079
establishment of mindfulness is the body the body is so important it needs to be

196
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:50,160
established and we need to relate to it and this practice is not about mind over

197
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,000
matter i remember teaching mindfulness years and years ago in an

198
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:03,520
introductory class and i i vividly remember there was a student who insisted this meditation mind over

199
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:10,240
body so that i can just rule my body and not feel my pain and that's not the idea

200
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:17,359
here that's not the idea here the idea of meditation and what we're doing here is not mind over body but

201
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:23,119
it's it's mind with the body it's the

202
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,960
the um mind working with the body because the body as you know affects the

203
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:37,839
mind and the mind of course affects the body so the theme of this week now i'm

204
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:44,160
bringing this together introduced introducing the theme of this week as i mentioned at the beginning of the guided

205
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,599
meditation is the mind's body

206
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:55,040
the mind's body yes we have we feel like we have a body it feels

207
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:02,240
solid there's a shape to it it hurts we have our usual relationship to our bodies

208
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:08,960
but there's also the energetic body or the mind's body if i say at the end

209
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,160
energy body or energetic body sometimes people feel like wow that

210
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,599
sounds woo-boo but it's really the mind's body the way

211
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:26,400
we relate to interact with we see we the way we bring attention

212
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,160
to the body the way we think about the body the way we engage with our minds

213
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:40,960
with the body it both changes the perception of our body

214
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:48,640
both in the in the uh in our mind of both our perception and also the physicality of

215
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:56,480
the body also shifts and changes and there's this idea of the mind's body is not so separate or different

216
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,039
from the body itself from the physicality itself

217
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:09,359
so so for so again coming back to the guided meditation

218
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:17,200
that we did by bringing attention in a particular way by seeing the body as a whole keeping

219
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:24,240
our mind keeping our attention on the body as a whole keep filling out

220
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,520
keep filling out as a whole as a whole over time

221
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:35,599
not only does the mind settle really really get grounded with the

222
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,880
sense of the body but the perception of our minds our bodies shift

223
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,400
and the sense of embodiment really living in our body

224
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,839
feeling connected and the mind being really rooted and the sense of joyfulness arises for

225
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:59,520
having your body wow isn't it amazing to to have a body

226
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:05,359
and i say this uh chuckling perhaps because on the buddhist cosmology there

227
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:12,400
are these different levels of existence there are the pita realm peter realms where there's a lot

228
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:17,520
of suffering and and um beings are being tortured in their bodies and then

229
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,960
there's the animal realm and then there's the human realm and then there are the what's called the

230
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:30,720
devil realm so the uh celestial realms and in some of the celestial realms

231
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:36,240
the beings have no body so there is no body

232
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:42,480
just just mind and yet it is said that this realm of the human realm this middle realm this

233
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:49,040
is where we are there is enough um [Music] joy there's enough suffering there's

234
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:55,520
enough challenges and enough agency all of that in is the perfect place for becoming

235
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:01,280
awakened there's perfect place so we have a body we have a sense of agency

236
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,400
and how we relate how we bring our attention to our bodies do we hate it do

237
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,880
we be rated do we feel [Music]

238
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,160
betrayed so all of these the way that we relate to our bodies so

239
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,280
so the invitation i have as we will collect and as we work together for the

240
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:30,720
rest of this week with mind's body is if you would continue

241

243
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,960
hands you know there are these teachings about washing the dishes feeling the sensations of the hand that's great

244
