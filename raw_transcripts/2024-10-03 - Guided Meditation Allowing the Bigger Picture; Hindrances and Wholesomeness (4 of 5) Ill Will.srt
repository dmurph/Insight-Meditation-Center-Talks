1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:07,719
okayy let's so let's go ahead and get started for those of you who didn't hear

2
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:13,759
earlier um Gil was always planning to travel at the end of this week so it was

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,920
arranged that I would be here with you on Thursday and Friday so very nice to

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:28,119
to see you all there many familiar names and welcome to anyone who's just

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:35,200
joining so for this meditation um I want to bring up an kind

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,200
of an image there's a there's a book from the probably the 70s and I don't

7
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,520
remember the details of it I think it's actually called Zoom and I know Zoom has

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,440
a whole different meaning now but this was back in the 70s and it starts out

9
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,039
it's a series just a it's a picture book and there's a picture on each page and

10
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,760
it starts out I don't remember what the first picture is maybe it's a a dog and

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,400
then on the next page you see that the dog is uh sitting by a pool and there's

12
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,119
some people there and then on the next page you see that actually that is a

13
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,680
picture on a postcard that somebody is writing while sitting aboard a ship and

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,000
and next one you know it goes back and back and each time you see that what you

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,520
saw and conceived as what the picture was was actually just a little piece of

16
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:44,680
something bigger going on and as you can imagine it goes back and back and back

17
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:51,200
through this um so that we have to get the impression as the book goes along oh

18
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,479
there's a lot more going on here than just this one little thing and my

19
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:06,520
understanding of what it is from the little context I have so this I think can be a valuable

20
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:12,959
idea for meditation also kind of a valuable image to keep in mind is that

21
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:20,280
each thing that's arising it has some place maybe in a bigger picture that we

22
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:28,519
can't see completely and it becomes less appealing once we go through a book like Zoom to

23
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:35,120
decide whether something belongs or not what its function is whether it should

24
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:43,599
or shouldn't be there it's like we don't we don't quite know that in the moment so might as well

25
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,760
let everything arise and be itself so this can be a very

26
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,400
valuable idea for meditation so let's go ahead and sit finding a a

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,840
posture where you feel comfortable

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,799
relaxed closing the eyes if that's appropriate for

29
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:16,959
you and bringing the attention inward

30
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:24,519
soft gentle gaze at the body the mind as it is now

31
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:29,640
just kind of taking in what's there

32
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,400
softening the body inviting some ease in the

33
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:49,000
shoulders belly down into the

34
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,640
legs inviting some EAS in the mind

35
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:03,560
a softness to our

36
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,200
awareness sense of tranquility

37
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:20,320
and protection of this time we're here having a chance to

38
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,960
sit just for now there doesn't need to be anything

39
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,960
else

40
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:44,360
maybe taking a couple of long slow deep breaths and on the out breath softening

41
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:53,440
the body and the mind and connecting them so there's some sense of

42
00:04:53,800 --> 00:05:01,439
the body being part of the larger picture of what the Mind knows

43
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:17,759
and letting the breath return to normal it's fine as it

44
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:28,280
is I'm beginning to notice the changing

45
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:37,479
experience that the mind is naturally receiving sometimes it notices the

46
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,759
body maybe the contact points or the

47
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:50,759
breath or something that feels uncomfortable in the body or some

48
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,520
energy and sometimes it's aware of an emotion or a thought

49
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:10,280
with mindfulness we can know that we're knowing sometimes that becomes

50
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:24,599
prominent might see if we can see these different

51
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:30,280
arisings as part of some larger

52
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:37,400
flow that we're not quite seeing all of which is

53
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,199
fine each thing comes in supported by

54
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:52,400
its conditions has its

55
00:06:53,319 --> 00:07:00,639
place and Fades away or maybe persist for a while

56
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:16,919
but bringing in this sense of I might not have the whole

57
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,560
picture can support a relaxation in the

58
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,879
mind to let everything arise and have its

59
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:33,240
place we can't really say that it doesn't

60
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,440
belong so why not

61
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:52,919
relax and if there is a sense of judging or rejecting or deciding about something

62
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:59,879
that's actually one more thing that can arise and have its place

63
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,800
oh there's a pain and there's the sense that it

64
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,720
shouldn't be there there's fear that it will get worse

65
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:18,680
okay that too is part of this bigger

66
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:33,518
picture in this way experience becomes

67
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,680
free of our limitation of

68
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,640
it through deciding what it is

69
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,120
already can we rest with

70
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
that

71
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
for e

72
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:25,720
we may notice that sometimes

73
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,320
mind grabs on to something in

74
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:39,079
experience because it thinks it knows what it is and what it should be

75
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:47,519
and how it can be changed it wants to chew on it or fix

76
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:56,839
it get rid of it in some way and we can notice that

77
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:02,839
movement as one that feels St and [Music]

78
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:11,380
limited and release the experience back into the flow as if we've pulled a fish out of a

79
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:16,639
[Music] stream and how much better it feels to

80
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:22,800
toss it back in let the stream keep

81
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:31,240
flowing keep letting the big picture unfold and be

82
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,120
itself three of us in a

83
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
sense

84
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

85
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

86
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

87
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

88
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

89
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

90
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

91
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,959
e e

92
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:45,050
sometimes what arises is expected or

93
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:50,360
[Music] agreable we think that it fits it's

94
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:56,279
right it's what we wanted and

95
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:02,279
sometimes what arises is unflexed or

96
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:11,959
disturbing painful in some way so quickly we decide that's not

97
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,438
right that shouldn't

98
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:26,240
be but that response is one more [Music]

99
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:34,559
arising take some Trust to allow something unpleasant to be part of

100
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,080
the bigger

101
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:46,799
picture and yet that's the invitation of a practice that sees

102
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,519
things as they

103
00:17:52,120 --> 00:18:00,480
are but we offer just a bit more trust that the big

104
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:08,679
picture can include everything and our

105
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:15,399
awareness can be there for everything as it

106
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
is

107
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

108
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

109
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

110
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

111
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

112
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

113
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

114
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

115
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

116
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

117
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

118
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
e e

119
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:14,200
in the last few minutes of this [Music] meditation perhaps taking a moment now

120
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:21,120
to look back at yourself at how it has

121
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:27,880
been in this sit to try to allow this bigger picture

122
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:35,840
this sense that we don't know everything and so we can't say what

123
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:43,279
belongs and doesn't [Music] belong what impact has that

124
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,880
had on your own inner

125
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:56,240
life it can bring sometimes a sense of spaciousness

126
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:02,320
or sense of respect that there's something bigger some

127
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:09,000
humility to us can also bring some fear or

128
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:16,960
uncertainty maybe we're not so much in [Music] control and all of these are part of

129
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:23,720
that bigger picture too part of how it is to be a human in a changing and

130
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:27,640
unpredictable world

131
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:38,399
and maybe as you go out into the day or the

132
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:46,919
evening could carry some useful part of this sense that there might be something more

133
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:52,880
going on that I don't know maybe this person I'm talking

134
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:59,080
with is having a hard time right now and that's

135
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:05,840
why they're not paying as much attention to me as I thought they

136
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,480
should maybe [Music] something has broken

137
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:22,440
but no it was much older than I thought it was or it was just the

138
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:31,919
time maybe something seems to be lost or

139
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:38,120
gone but it's making space for something new or it's

140
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:44,320
not we can't know but the bigger picture is unfolding

141
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:51,480
and we are always a part of it and we can have a choice to

142
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:59,279
participate in a way that is that is a true participant

143
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:06,080
that allows other people other things to be

144
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:12,440
as they are and we respond without reacting

145
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:18,000
without rejecting without trying to fix and judge

146
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:25,240
and make everything as we want it a bit more

147
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:32,919
grace we may find mind that other people respond

148
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,278
well to a bit softer

149
00:28:42,039 --> 00:28:51,080
approach so may it be that each person can find their way to

150
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:56,960
be in this bigger picture may we give them the space to do

151
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,039
so including

152
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:08,799
ourselves may we each find the balance the

153
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:16,799
perspective the peace that allows us to just calmly know

154
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:23,480
what is unfolding and be a part of it

155
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,240
so this week Gil has been talking about the

156
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,799
hindrances from a particular perspective and the framework is that

157
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:27,640
the five hindrances are UNH wholesome strategies that the mind has adopted to

158
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:35,640
handle the challenges of a human life and one of the ways to become free

159
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:43,039
of these hindrances is to see clearly and honestly that each one is UNH wholesome

160
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:50,279
or unhealthy and to actually feel that in the moment as a somatic

161
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:57,240
experience and then in the calm knowing of that and the the willingness to feel

162
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:03,320
what is unhealthy hey about our mind strategy we reduce the stickiness of

163
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:10,000
that hindrance and eventually learn to navigate life more freely without

164
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,240
collapsing into these patterns so we're going through them

165
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:22,799
backwards because doing that highlights the fundamental that the fundamental

166
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:29,279
issue is in the fifth hindrance which is usually translated as doubt or certainty

167
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:34,840
but it more specifically means that we aren't clear on what is wholesome and

168
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:40,279
what is UNH wholesome so if we don't have that we can't discern when the

169
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:46,200
other hindrances are present so that's kind of the the root of it in this um

170
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:54,200
perspective that we're taking the good news is that through mindfulness practice we're strengthening

171
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,639
that ability to discern and if we keep paying attention to our experience

172
00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:06,480
whatever it is with this understanding that there are healthy ways to be with

173
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:14,480
it and also unhealthy ones and we want the healthy ones then we'll enhance our

174
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:21,480
ability to see clearly So today we're moving on to the

175
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:28,360
traditionally the second hindrance which is called ill will and this is about

176
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:35,320
reacting to the challenges of life with hostility or rejection or pushing away

177
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:44,120
anger blame judgment those kinds of reactions and maybe it's good to start

178
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,840
with understanding that not all instances of Turning Away which is the

179
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:56,240
literal meaning of averting or reversion not all of those are unhealthy there can

180
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:04,240
be times when it's a skillful for our well-being to say no not right now or

181
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,080
thank you but we're not going to engage with that or sometimes even

182
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,240
stop um the hindrance but the hindrance is the ill

183
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:21,559
will that comes along with that it's kind of a a negative regard of a person

184
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:27,559
or a mind state or a situation um or even a wish for harm to

185
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:32,679
come and the underlying sense that that's bad

186
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:39,919
that's wrong that shouldn't be that is what covers over um the mind's ability to be with

187
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:45,639
the reality of experience remember that the hindrances are coverings that's

188
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:51,519
literally what the poly word for that's translated as hindrance means so if we

189
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:57,279
have this sense of that shouldn't be here um we can't quite connect with and

190
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:03,799
engage with experience fully the moment that we're experiencing may be very

191
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:10,638
unpleasant um what's being known may be very unpleasant um but it is still

192
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,158
unhealthy to attack that or to reject it with

193
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:22,118
hostility so one issue with ill will is that it gets tied in with other

194
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:31,398
hindrances very easily so it can pull in agitation or activation hindrance of

195
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:37,520
restlessness and anxiety these kinds of things uh ill

196
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:44,679
will can also lead to sinking down into what you'll call rigidity or torper or

197
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:49,960
shutting [Music] down very we're rejecting experience we

198
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:56,679
can slide into that so it can easily be entangled with the the other ones so

199
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:03,560
it's important that we get to know this quality of ill will the Mind often has

200
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:09,599
to really feel it in the body and feel actually the UNH wholesomeness of it

201
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:16,240
before our ill will has any impact on the situation or the person that we feel

202
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:24,240
hostile toward it has a damaging impact on us there's um there's an image in the

203
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:32,119
sutas where the Buddha Likens anger to grasping a stick with the intention

204
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:40,240
of attacking but the stick is smeared with excrement so before you have any impact

205
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,560
outwardly you have touched something really unclean I think it's meant to

206
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:52,280
point to a visceral feeling that we can have and the the trick is to feel the

207
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:59,079
ill will itself and not just be caught up in what we're feeling a verse two

208
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:05,599
because that's where the Mind goes you know it sees something that it doesn't like or that it feels is impacting us

209
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:12,040
imp pleasantly unpleasantly and then it jumps on that that's the thing that is

210
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:18,560
wrong it needs to be gotten rid of or reacted to and we don't quite turn and

211
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:25,280
see what that feeling in US is so you know when we when we pick up the stick

212
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,000
we might feel powerful and right um and we might think this the stick is

213
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,560
going to be effective in dispelling or hurting what we are angry about and so

214
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:45,640
there can actually be a pleasant feeling when we pick up that stick there's an a feeling of energy um Power strength that

215
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:53,079
can come through ill will it's um it's a pleasant feeling but it's not a wholesome Pleasant feeling but it is

216
00:36:53,079 --> 00:37:00,280
pleasant and if we tune only into that we might miss the

217
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:05,800
excrement so another image that the Buddha gave for anger is that it has a

218
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:12,400
honeyed tip and a poison root so that points to the fact that

219
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:20,079
anger comes from the root of hatred the root of what's called Dosa um so in a given moment of

220
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:26,119
hostility there might be both a pleasant component and an underlying feeling of

221
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:31,640
disease the excr part so you know what about the

222
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:36,800
stress that arises in the moment of anger you know when something is

223
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,560
irritating us or we're feeling hostile there is some kind of clenching or

224
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,280
contraction or a distortion of the energy in our system it can almost be um

225
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:54,119
nauseating in some cases if we really turn toward what's happening in us so if

226
00:37:54,119 --> 00:38:02,000
we're careful with our mindfulness and we're willing to see and sense everything that's going on we can feel

227
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:07,560
this um this poison root uh another image given for ill will

228
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:13,680
is that it's like a disease a literal illness and being caught in ill will so

229
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,880
identified with our anger or our aversion is like being sick we not in

230
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:25,240
Balance not in harmony not with the flow of Life the texts mentioned specifically

231
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:31,119
about not digesting well um I think this points toward one of the

232
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:38,560
uh focuses of Indian medicine but it's true when we're sick we don't digest our food very well right

233
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:45,160
and when we go around with a negative and reactive way of being we aren't

234
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:50,920
nourished in our life there is nourishing beautiful food

235
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:57,040
available around us but it's like we don't benefit from it so people who are

236
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:04,200
habitually hostile could be said to be starving amid plenty you know they've become

237
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:09,480
unhealthy from the inside so it's important to start to see

238
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:15,640
this pattern operating in us which means in the moment in real time we don't need

239
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:20,960
to reflect abstractly and this quality of calm knowing that we've been pointing

240
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,480
to this week is so helpful we can cultivate the calm knowing of two things

241
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,839
one is the object that we find repulsive or upsetting that triggers the ill will

242
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:42,000
it's important that we um use mindfulness to step back and see that clearly before the mind has its hostile

243
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:49,400
reaction this is a lot of what um mindfulness first allows us to do is create that little Gap so that we're not

244
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:55,240
just automatically reacting and then second which is actually more important is that we can

245
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:02,640
learn to calmly know ill will itself as a hindrance so it's not just about being

246
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,920
more accepting of unpleasant objects or people or experiences and learn to

247
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:15,560
tolerate them although that's a good start we also want to turn back and look at that reaction in the mind and see

248
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:21,960
that ill will is simply a reaction that our or confused mind comes up with when

249
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:29,960
it's trying to navigate a challenging world the world does have a lot of unpleasant things about it um and in a

250
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:37,119
particular human life is not easy it's not that easy to live in this body and

251
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:43,480
navigate living in the in the world so it's also important that we

252
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:50,880
don't have to bring in ideas that we shouldn't have you know this this negative feeling that spiritual people

253
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:57,520
aren't angry Etc that's just adding more ill will more judgment more negative

254
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,319
regard of ourselves so if you find that there's

255
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:09,440
every now and then a little moment of ill will um I certainly have some ill will

256
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:16,920
in my system still um there's no need to identify with that and say oh I

257
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,319
shouldn't be there or oh I'm such an angry person we we simply see it and in

258
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:29,240
doing so we have a measure of freedom in that moment

259
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:35,640
one time I was on a retreat and we had group practice discussions that were

260
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:43,599
held outside and our group was sitting out under a tree and there were birds in the

261
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:50,359
tree and one of them pooped onto the head of someone in the group and she

262
00:41:50,359 --> 00:41:57,240
reached up and realized what it was and her face contracted in repulsion and she

263
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:02,760
she looked up toward the bird and said dirty little thing and then she went off

264
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:10,040
to the bathroom to wash but she was a strong practitioner and she took it as

265
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:15,560
an opportunity for practice and actually by the time she came back she was

266
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:22,280
smiling um she had had a wonderful opportunity to see the sequence of an

267
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:27,880
unpleasant experience and then a reaction to that that included hostility

268
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:35,800
toward the bird in this case the bird was not to blame and it is probably appropriate to

269
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:43,559
find bird excrement unpleasant and to want to go wash it off that's taking

270
00:42:43,559 --> 00:42:50,920
normal care of our health it's not it's not clean right but can we do that with

271
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:56,599
just calm awareness and here's what happened we've got the bird poop in the

272
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:03,839
hair and I can respond appropriately and go and take care of it so with ongoing

273
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:11,119
mindfulness practice maybe we can learn to receive the bird poop of life if you

274
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:17,359
will and just do what needs to be done so the the Buddha says that we can

275
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:25,440
stand free of the influence of ill will and we can do that and we can if we do

276
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,800
that in a moment we will AB lied with care for the well-being of all beings

277
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:37,440
that includes ourself wanting to be free of the poison of ill will and it also

278
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,599
includes care for others for the world and all of that is enabled by this calm

279
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:49,079
knowing and clear seeeing so it's true human life and this

280
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:55,760
world that we live in does include very difficult things that are unpleasant and

281
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,800
painful but letting go of ill will is is not about denying that to live in some

282
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:08,839
kind of a blissful fantasy but we can we can we can do it all without the hostility the

283
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:15,240
reactivity which harms us before it does anything else out in the

284
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:22,839
world so I hope this will give some flavor of how we can learn to see and

285
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:29,839
meet this reaction that we have of rejecting of will and learn

286
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:37,280
to include that as one more thing that's going on so that we can um to use Gil's

287
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,599
image from yesterday we can ride our bicycle more freely not always getting

288
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:48,880
drawn in so perhaps that can be your guidance for

289
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,040
today is to remember there's probably a bigger picture there's a way that we

290
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:59,760
don't need to reject what's going on we may not be seeing it all just to respond

291
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:06,800
as calmly as we can so thank you and be well
