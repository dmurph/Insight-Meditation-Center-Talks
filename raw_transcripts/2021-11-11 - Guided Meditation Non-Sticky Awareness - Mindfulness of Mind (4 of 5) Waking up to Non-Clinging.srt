00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,440
hello everyone and welcome to our meditation time together

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,240
and um i send my warm greetings around the globe to people

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,800
all over who are participating so

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,080
this week's topic is mindfulness of mind or mindfulness of awareness

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,760
and one of the interesting facets about

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,880
our minds or our awareness is that

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,960
sometimes it acts like velcro and sometimes like teflon

8
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,800
sometimes what comes into awareness what we know what we see and feel and think

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:56,160
um remember sticks there we get stuck it doesn't leave us we get

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:02,320
preoccupied we got caught in it and and um and sometimes

11
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,680
and actually more often than we kind of realize uh the mind is more like teflon

12
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,040
awareness is like a teflon it just slides right off in the ancient language they talked they

13
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:20,400
didn't have teflon so they talked about a drop of water sliding off a lotus leaf apparently

14
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,479
lotus leaves were quite slick for water so it wouldn't stay we just slide right off

15
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,280
and so

16
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:40,479
so it's interesting to notice when it's like velcro and when it's like teflon

17
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:48,000
to notice that now that i've talked about this teflon and velcro perhaps it's lingering

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,799
your mind you're questioning it wondering about it reacting to it and it's kind of like little bit kind of

19
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,000
there to stay for a little while and um

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,520
and then some things that are happening maybe in this moment you're kind of aware fleetingly in the

21
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,879
moment but it doesn't stay it doesn't stick um it's just kind of there and passes

22
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,400
through and it could be something in the space where

23
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,560
you're sitting that you're you're aware of something and but it doesn't stick in anywhere so here

24
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,599
in this room here where i'm sitting there are chairs and i've known these chairs for a long

25
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:34,840
long time and and except for now searching for it to tell you about it i'm aware of the

26
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,760
chairs but you know they don't there's a mind is teflon with it it just doesn't stick anywhere it doesn't cause any

27
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,040
thoughts any involvement any judgments reactions at all and

28
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:53,760
so the chairs are going through the mind more like on the teflon side of it

29
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,599
and so to notice

30
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,280
and maybe a simple label simple recognition that oh now

31
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,840
awareness is more like velcro and things are stuck or things are

32
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:19,280
there's an attachment there's a involvement and now it now it's just like teflon

33
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:25,200
saying with the breathing and meditation there might be all kinds of

34
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,480
agendas about the breathing and judgments about the breathing and and then the mind awareness is more

35
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:39,760
like velcro and you might say you might even notice that it's velcro you know velcro mind or clinging mind

36
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:47,519
and sometimes the breathing is it just goes through see smoothly easily there's no resistance to it in awareness

37
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,680
and the awareness just knows it even if the breath is a little bit labored or a little bit tight awareness just knows it

38
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,560
nose tightness nose laboredness just there's no before and after there's no

39
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,360
um connecting it to a narrative a story what it's connected to what i have to do and how it was yesterday and what it

40
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,640
should be tomorrow and what i have to do and it's just a experience of the moment that kind of

41
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,959
passes right through so that the teflon mine just lets things pass through they come and they go

42
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,199
and they just let them pass through and so when you notice that's happening

43
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,040
no you might use a label teflon or if you like prefer kind of you know

44
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,800
lotus lotus leaf or just you know

45
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,440
free awareness is free stuck and free

46
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,440
velcro and teflon so whatever you know you is nice for you

47
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,600
but to begin to sit here and appreciate that that you have both capacities

48
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:06,560
and the capacity where cultivating and growing is the is the teflon is the lotus leaf

49
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,240
and um and maybe as you sit here you can a little bit

50
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,680
appreciate emphasize that side of the mind

51
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,320
so assuming a uncomfortable alert posture

52
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,840
and lowering your gaze

53
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,560
maybe down towards the floor 45 degrees with your eyes still open

54
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,759
soften the focus

55
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,638
and then if it's nice gently slowly let the eyelids close

56
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,919
and without breathing deeply as you exhale relax

57
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,440
the shoulders

58
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,479
the belly

59
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,440
the muscles of the face

60
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,440
and then very gently as if the gentleness is

61
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:11,160
a caring touch for yourself take some deeper breaths

62
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,560
and gently more caring for yourself as you exhale

63
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,479
relax the body let go

64
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:57,360
and then letting the breathing return to normal and again another round of relaxation

65
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,520
relaxing relaxing the face

66
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:11,960
any tightness associated with thinking in the area of the head

67
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,919
release the shoulders

68
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,640
and soften the belly

69
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,680
and perhaps gently caringly you can

70
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:05,800
relax deep in your core deep in your being

71
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:17,560
a softening a quieting within

72
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,839
and then become aware of the body's experience of breathing

73
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:57,839
and in this cycle of breathing in and breathing out is any of the experience of breathing

74
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:05,200
experienced more like that with a teflon mind or more with a

75
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,320
velcro mind

76
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,399
and whatever part of the breathing is more like teflon

77
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:27,760
this passes arises and passes and prioritize that

78
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,760
allow things just to pass right through

79
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,839
and when they don't gently caringly

80
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:50,519
recognize it as a velcro mind velcro experience

81
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,000
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

82
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:36,919
to consider the mind awareness

83
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,158
when it's aware of other people

84
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,960
and is the mind more like teflon or more like velcro

85
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,158
in its contact with people

86
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:02,679
either in person or in memory or means of communication

87
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:15,279
and it's a gift we give others to meet them with a heart that is not

88
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:21,679
sticky a teflon heart teflon mind

89
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:29,360
it can be quite wonderful to hold someone's hand but if they have

90
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,799
you know what a bubble gum in the palm of their hand

91
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:40,880
and you're just kind of you feel the stickiness it probably doesn't feel so good

92
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,480
maybe part of the wonderfulness of holding a hand is that maybe when it's easy to

93
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,120
release the hands nothing sticks

94
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:02,960
it's a gift to others to be fully present

95
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,000
with nothing sticking

96
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:16,240
and to recognize when there's the teflon mine and when the velcro mind

97
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:23,799
can support us help us meet others with less stickiness

98
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,760
chances are it's more comfortable for them there's more room for them they can

99
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:47,360
relax they can feel safer it's more peaceful for them

100
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,440
and may it be that what we learn about attention awareness

101
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,120
supports us to be more like a lotus leaf more like

102
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:06,398
teflon in our care our respect our kindness

103
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,600
for other people may we contribute

104
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:19,039
to the happiness of others the safety of others

105
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:25,360
the peacefulness for others and their freedom

106
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:30,640
may all beings be happy

107
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:38,520
safe peaceful and free

108
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,440
so

109
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:04,640
so before i give the talk i'm going to make a couple of announcements while they're still in my mind so i won't

110
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:11,919
forget tomorrow so next week i won't be here

111

119
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:09,200
and um i'm so happy that matthew's coming back and and with all the guest teachers that we

120
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,559
have coming um you know if if you're at all inclined to

121
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:21,279
um if you want to make a donation for them for then the easy place to do i think on youtube

122
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:27,200
there's a underneath the video there's a some text about imc and there's a

123
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,880
link to the donate button and um

124
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:39,919
the other thing is that um in uh on december 4th and december 11th

125
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:45,440
through saturdays we're having a next round of something we did last spring

126
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:53,279
which is a mindfulness circle for black identified individuals so um african-americans africans anybody

127
00:31:53,279 --> 00:32:02,000
identified as black androids and i think it's kristin

128
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,480
wicker wickerman wickerson rickerson i think i'm sorry i

129
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:15,919
don't remember exactly i don't never met her and um but anne did it before and um

130
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:22,159
that she's bringing her friend along this time to help her and um it's a opportunity for black

131
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:28,880
identified people to meet together and have some discussions and little teachings and community around this

132
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:36,600
mindfulness practice so

133
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:49,919
i see when the chat someone wrote velcro like lila the velcro can be a heavenly messenger

134
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,200
and that's yes

135
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,200
think what what we're learning to do in this practice is to recognize

136
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:09,200
[Music] the challenges we have the way we get stuck and attached as messengers as opposed to

137
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,440
as you know as enemies and as a messenger you don't want to

138
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:22,399
kill the messenger but you want to learn from it you want to use that opportunity to wake up

139
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:27,679
and this idea of waking up is such a beautiful one this concept

140
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:33,279
that um waking up when you wake up to something

141
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:40,320
you're not nothing changes in the world but you now

142
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:46,080
see clearly you now understand clearly and so um

143
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:53,679
and so maybe there is attachments in the mind clinging in the mind but you wake up to it and you kind

144
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:59,440
of it's kind of like you've become bigger than it and you kind of oh that's what's happening

145
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,880
i see it and there's something about the clear seeing

146
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,240
of uh that there's freedom there there's the

147
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:17,200
big the process of moving into teflon and is there

148
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,760
so the analogy i'm using is that sometimes the mind can be more like velcro more

149
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,118
like teflon sometimes awareness and for this week you know i'm using

150
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:35,839
these kind of synonymously mind mind and awareness so mindfulness of mind mindfulness awareness for this week

151
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:42,800
are the same thing and um and it's closely connected to mindfulness of the attitude or the

152
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:50,320
the way in which we relate to experience and what's happening is we practice

153
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:58,240
we're restoring there's a restoration process of the simplicity of awareness

154
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,760
the most simple form that's accessible to us and some people would might want

155
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,760
to call it that the natural state of awareness it's a little bit uh

156
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,920
philosophically dangerous topic a thing to claim but it's kind of like that

157
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,800
we just feel so healthy so right this is home to have awareness which it doesn't stick

158
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,079
to anything but allows things to arise and pass through

159
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,280
and and so as become mindful of awareness

160
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:39,359
of mindfulness mindfulness of mindfulness mindfulness of attention it becomes clear that attention is

161
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:45,359
operating with a certain level of porousness transparency

162
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:51,359
um non-stickiness non-clinging that's really it's there's a clarity to

163
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:57,920
the fact that yes there's a sound outside and it just comes through without any

164
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:04,800
waves or ripples in the mind it's true that my knee hurts and there's no ripples no contractions

165
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:12,560
no no stories no agendas around it it's known clearly

166
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:17,359
and we're awake to it meaning we've kind of

167
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:23,359
become larger than any story agenda reactivity judgment and the awareness

168
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:28,400
can just be with it feel it with some kind of clarity like his teflon like his

169
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:35,119
things just roll off uh or allowed to just float

170
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,720
so the um so

171
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,760
as we do mindfulness practice and this is not automatic for beginners but as we

172
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,680
do it and get deeper into the practice at some point we become aware

173
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:59,599
of the nature or the quality or the characteristics of how we're paying attention the attitude the engagement

174
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:06,320
the the extra kind of baggage we have along with it and one of them that's particularly

175
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,839
significant for buddhists is to become aware of the clinging

176
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:18,720
that has us lingering on things holding onto things pushing against things wanting things

177
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,800
and the uh uh

178
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,920
and so the um um

179
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,839
so we have to have this uh as we see that clearly and and the i you

180
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:41,359
would certainly let go of it but it's also possible to wake up to it

181
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,400
and this waking up to it is the restoration of this

182
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:53,839
healthy liberated mind and so it so we certainly can get relief

183
00:37:53,839 --> 00:38:00,960
by letting go and that's please let go when it's easy enough to do but there's a whole other process that

184
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:08,000
has to do with this um waking up the restoration of

185
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,040
of a clarity in which whatever happens can occur can

186
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:20,079
pass through and so one image that's sometimes used for this is the mind becomes like an

187
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:27,839
endless sky and the sky and things you know clouds birds

188
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,440
all kinds of things go through the sky but um uh

189
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,040
they don't stick to the sky is the idea they just the sky doesn't interfere with them doesn't stick to it

190
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,320
doesn't hold on to it um the air the the air the sky just is

191
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:50,640
just you know kind of just lets everything go right through so there are times when awareness can be

192
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:56,240
like that and and

193
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,599
it is not necessarily so far away that possibility if we associate that with

194
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:08,640
this waking up so so rather than saying how can i be mindful of this thing

195
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:15,040
we can sometimes ask ourselves how do i wake up to its presence how do i wake up to it here

196
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:21,680
and and what's the difference difference between being mindful knowing it and waking up to it

197
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:28,240
um and as i've said it kind of associated with certainly kind of with a

198
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:33,440
expansion of awareness where awareness kind of somehow seems to be

199
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:40,800
have lots of capacity to know without reacting to what is known

200
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,320
lots of capacity to allow things just be there and the floating in the sky of awareness

201
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,359
without um doing anything having an agenda wanting anything

202
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:56,880
about it and uh and then this you know and so as we

203
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:03,680
practice this restoration of a healthy mind of a free mind of a

204
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:09,520
of a um you know a teflon mind or if you prefer a more

205
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,880
natural is a lotus lotus leaf mine where the water

206
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,119
just water drops or just roll right off a lotus leaf or a sky-like mind

207
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:27,680
and and this is a very different orientation than how most minds are operating

208
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,520
where most minds are operating focused on what it wants or what it doesn't want

209
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,640
it's focused on the on objects of attention objects of thought

210
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,000
and sometimes blinded by that are completely preoccupied with that stuck on it

211
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,480
and now we're turning the attention uh not exactly it doesn't have to be away

212
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:56,400
from the objects of mind but we're shifting the focus to uh something that

213
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,319
in a kind of way is bigger than or larger than uh any particular thing that we're

214
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:08,720
thinking about or wanting or not wanting and in that spaciousness of mind

215
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:14,160
openness of mind stillness of mind

216
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,160
smoothness of mind there is there is a degree of freedom

217
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:25,839
there's a degree of space there's a kind of a healthy feeling of

218
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:32,000
of being alive and breathing and then we can feel with that as a reference point it

219
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,520
becomes clear when the mind gets stuck when the mind gets caught

220
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:44,240
in something when the mind gets preoccupied it's the stickiness there and this is one of the

221
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:50,000
great functions of this practice as we get

222
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,040
more and more sensitive more attuned to when we get attached when we get stuck

223
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,839
when we get contracted when we get preoccupied in a way that's not so healthy and

224
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:07,839
useful and and that heightened sensitivity ideally doesn't lead to more stickiness

225
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:14,480
doesn't lead to more judgments and self-criticism being caught but becomes almost a delight

226
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:22,000
oh i see it here and and this is good that i see it great

227
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,040
this is the heavenly messenger as it was said and then

228
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,920
and then to um um you know maybe you ask yourself the question you know um

229
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,119
and you know how do i wake up to this now what is it

230
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,680
like to be awake with awareness

231
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:51,119
so relaxation

232
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:59,838
that supports more open awareness the recognition of awareness itself

233
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,040
the respecting awareness and now the restoration of this

234
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:12,880
wonderful capacity of awareness and then tomorrow the release the release of awareness

235
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:20,200
so thank you very much
