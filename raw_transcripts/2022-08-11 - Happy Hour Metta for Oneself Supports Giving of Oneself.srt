1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,399
there so hello and welcome everyone welcome to

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:13,840
happy hour it's lovely to be with you ah lovely to practice together with dear

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,400
sangha so so for today's practice

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,680
um the theme i'd like to offer for us to

5
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,120
consider is how taking care of ourselves

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,920
really caring and modulating how much

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,480
we we perhaps engage how much energy we

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,800
pour out a sense of care sense of awareness of our own energy

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,000
our own engagement our how tired we are are we tired are we pushing ourselves

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,680
are we out of resources but still that level of awareness

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,119
and caring for ourselves is an act of meta to

12
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,759
how this care not only is an act of meta for ourselves but it's also a way of

13
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:22,240
sustaining ourselves so that we can care for others we can care for the world

14
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:29,040
so how caring for ourselves really being both mindful

15
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:36,240
of our moods our attention our our body our resources and caring caring for this

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,600
being after all this this person who is me

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:49,759
consider that this person we are um entrusted we are entrusted

18
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,119
to care for this being who is me as if you were your own

19
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,920
child you know your children if you've had children or you have children or you will have and with children you

20
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,560
have them they grow up you know you care for them and then you they also care for themselves whereas you're the only one

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,599
you you care for this being in this body in all ways so

22
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:20,239
so and also bringing in mindfulness mindfulness what what does this body

23
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:28,080
need what does this heart need what does this mind need so in a way bringing awareness together with meta

24
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:35,040
for oneself and in that way when we can care for ourselves we can be

25
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,319
more available to care for others to take care of others we don't become resentful like oh

26
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,879
i've given you everything i've got and now you ask more like oh no it's okay i've been actually been

27
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,040
monitoring what i have and what how much i can give and how much i need to care for myself

28
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,680
so there is a discernment that can come in that can

29
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:09,440
support us not falling into say resentment or over giving or also undergiving too so

30
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,959
so awareness together with metta

31
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:22,480
for ourselves is is the basic theme or practice tonight so

32
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,239
and it might be a quieter night because it's nice to tune in and take care

33
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,400
see what's needed and pay attention so so that's the theme so let's practice

34
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,200
together let's land let's land in our bodies

35
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:48,799
let's arrive let's arrive fully let's arrive fully in

36
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,959
our bodies

37
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:14,439
letting the breath be soothing calming nourishing

38
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:26,440
all that is needed just the breath

39
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,639
in the body

40
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,360
receiving each breath in the abdomen

41
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,120
letting it be nourishing soothing like a lullaby simple

42
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,520
very simple

43
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,479
receiving is an act of care

44
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,840
this

45
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,120
and as the breath is received

46
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,880
in the abdomen with care

47
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,200
with awareness settling

48
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,399
let the body settle

49
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,680
into receiving care

50
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:55,320
feeling cared for

51
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,680
letting there be the settling

52
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,959
settling of the body settling of the heart

53
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:27,480
whatever is present is okay can be here just as it is

54
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:06,959
after thoughts entanglements it's okay

55
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:14,240
can we bow to them and let them go can we bow to them and let them go for

56
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,600
right now they can come back later

57
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:12,240
dropping in the question with awareness

58
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:19,200
their heart their body to your mind what do you need in this moment what is

59
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,510
needed in this moment what is your level of energy

60
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:30,480
[Music] fatigue anxiety

61
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,839
whatever is present resources

62
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:42,040
as if you're reading the meter what is needed right now

63
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,600
let yourself know in your body not in your head what is needed but in the body let it be

64
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:29,560
known sensed in your heart

65
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,120
i know that this questioning this snowing is an act of care

66
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:09,600
if you're asking yourself how are you dear how are things

67
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,279
it's an act of care to ask

68
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,560
you want to know

69
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:24,560
and whatever arises is the answer what is needed

70
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:32,000
here ah can you open to it with care with love

71
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:41,839
with kindness as if this body this heart this you

72
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:48,880
as tender as a newborn needing support care

73
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,360
holding nursing rocking

74
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,440
this being that is yourself

75
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:39,760
and if it feels okay in your mind's eye as you're perhaps seeing this younger version of

76
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:45,240
yourself this this baby

77
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,159
being held rocked

78
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:05,200
a newborn vulnerable

79
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,679
completely open

80
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,640
it feels appropriate in your heart to feel

81
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:27,520
i care for you i care for you i love you

82
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:33,760
i will protect you or whatever words are appropriate or

83
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:42,200
feelings it's friendliness meta for yourself

84
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:22,320
this baby doesn't have to do anything anything to do anything right or perfect

85
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,960
to deserve to earn to scare this love just because

86
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,720
they are just because they are this miracle

87
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:42,160
of life this tender miracle of life

88
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,760
to be protected to be appreciated

89
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,559
to be tended to be tended

90
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,880
with matter

91
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:19,200
and if it feels appropriate you can stay with this image of

92
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:26,320
a younger version of yourself a baby being held rocked and stay with that

93
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,200
it's nourishing

94
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:41,280
supporting or if you like you can sense

95
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:50,960
this being who is you now [Music] in this body and drop in the reflection

96
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,080
in what ways

97
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:05,320
have you given too much or exhausted yourself

98
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,440
in what ways can you be more mindful of your

99
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,440
resources with care

100
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,640
for yourself

101
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,600
how can i care how can i care for myself better

102
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:43,279
how can i care for this body this heartless mind let yourself just drop in the questions

103
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:49,840
it's not a heady thing don't start thinking about it

104
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,480
let yourself breathe the question let yourself live the question

105
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,840
breathe the question

106
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:46,720
in what ways am i not exactly skillful and pushing

107
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:53,039
exhausting so that i don't care for myself with meta and

108
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:59,520
then wisdom does not arise maybe unskillfulness arises

109
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:06,640
i get resentful tired angry drained

110
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:13,919
haggard how can i care

111
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:21,679
how can i love care for this being who is me

112
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:29,440
in this moment and in general

113
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,960

as we bring this practice period to a close together

119
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:04,400
trusting that caring for ourselves filling our own cup is the first step of caring for others

120
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:13,040
being more available skillfully to care for others in the world

121

135
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:51,040

136
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:58,160
i'm sorry i joined a bit late but i thought of myself as a small child that was a nice place to be

137
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:06,079
and uh so i thought you know uh we all have a difficult couple of

138
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:13,760
years collectively in the world and of course it doesn't seem to be getting easier as things continue to turn

139
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,599
um uh even events today but one of the things that came to me is

140
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:26,240
i said you know i i need a brief

141
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,640

uh of going away and uh

143
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:45,839
to a place that i've gone before that i've associated with which i haven't gone to because of covert

144
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:52,800
it involves taking a plane for five hours to an island and coming back and then i thought oh i

145
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,160
should really save that money for renovations in the house you know so that i thought oh my god i'm

148
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:17,599

169
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:36,560
which is related to sanskrit but it's it's more um vernacular the vernacular

language that which the the bullet buddha taught in

171

177
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:27,200
just stuck in this proliferation proliferation of thought and maybe

178
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:33,839
emotion and just being tossed around right tossed about with thoughts and emotions and this and past and future

179

and planning and you're just gone right papancha it's just proliferation so that's a great word

180
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,640

your vocabulary so that when it comes up you know you don't go bad bad bad meditator you'll get oh sweetheart oh

184
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:12,319

185
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:19,680

188
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:41,200

189
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,160
i see your hand i don't see you your camera is turned off

190
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,079
there you are hi ryda hi um

191
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:59,440
that's like lastly i just want to say thank you um this is a really timely um topic for me

192
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,119
um and i was wondering in the beginning you said something about undergiving and

193
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:11,040
over giving yeah um and i feel like i kind of

194
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:17,040
have worked a lot more on the over giving um side of things um [Music]

195
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,720
and i guess yeah i'm just over giving your undergraduate sorry i'm thinking

196
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:28,400
yeah um i guess i was just wondering if you could say a little bit

197
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:36,000
yeah i guess i was just reflecting on um the idea of giving from a place of kind

198
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,040
of being where we can still be kind of embodied and in touch with

199
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:48,400
actually how much resource we have to give um and also without attachment to kind

200
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:55,680
of any outcome or result um and i guess on the undergiving side i

201
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:01,440
was just reflecting that i think like in a specific situation

202
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:09,520
that i have um with a family member who is sick who has been sick for a really long time um

203
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:17,119
and it's sort of an ongoing thing um [Music] and i think recently

204
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:23,440
you know having been through like my own healing journey in the past couple of years like

205
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:29,040
coming to terms with how that's impacted my health um and being really aware now of over

206
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:35,599
giving um i think sometimes there's actually a tendency to kind of

207
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:42,319
undergive in a sense of like disengaging because of like fear of

208
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:48,319
you know of the situation and everything that it brings up so um

209
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:53,839
yeah that i guess that's a lot i mean i was just wondering if you could speak

210
00:45:53,839 --> 00:46:00,319
a little bit about that yeah yeah thank you ryder thank you for um

211
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:08,079
about that and and your question and your reflection and and in what you said i actually hear a lot of awareness and a

212
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:14,319
lot of wisdom that you already have about the conditions were over-giving

213
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:21,520
and under-giving in your case and it's so hard to be a caregiver it's so important in the the case of being a

214
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:27,680
caregiver to be resourced otherwise it can lead to burnout so

215
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:33,520
easily and resentment and and and disengagement and and just it's hard all

216
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,640
around but but really realizing that caring for someone you really have to

217
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:44,000
care for yourself you really have to take time for yourself you have to ask

218
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,119
for support and figure out what this heart this body

219
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:55,760
this mind needs does it need eating sleep exercise just taking some time out go for a walk

220
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:01,280
or a movie or whatever it might be you're just like taking care taking care

221
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:07,280
of this so that you can be available so they can give um with joy

222
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:14,000
not as a way of i have to get like ah here it is again like not so it doesn't become a grim duty so that there is

223
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,520
enough water in your own cup there's tea in your own cup right there's um

224
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:24,559
so so to know that it is of the nature of

225
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:29,680
being a caregiver that's that is challenging and you have to be extra

226
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:35,119
aware so maybe the last thing i would say because again you have a lot of wisdom yourself

227
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:40,559
bring awareness bring a lot of awareness to the body

228
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:47,599
what's what's happening right now am i leaning in too much and i'm leaning out what's sweetheart what's happening here

229
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:53,760
and not to beat yourself up but sweetheart are you okay is this is so care are you

230
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:00,319
disengaging is it too much for you because when you care for yourself you're caring for the other it's caring

231
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:06,640
for for the relationship also so it's caring for yourself

232
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:16,079
there's more i can say but that might be enough for now is that okay yeah thank you thank you great thank you

233
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,760
so dear ones the time has come let us let us turn

234
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:28,160
to each other in small groups and and the invitation

235
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:34,400
um as we engage in small groups of roughly size three or

236
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:40,079
four or two or three we'll see what how it ends up the count

237
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:45,119
um so first and foremost

238
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:51,280
be kind to yourself be kind to each other to the other people in the group

239
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:57,119
and also consider it it it just offer one thing it's not

240
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:04,160
appropriate to go on a long monologue that take the entire time and share your entire life history even though that

241
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,920
might be tempting and cathartic for you but it may not be appropriate for others

242
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:16,079
so please be wise and kind share kindness this is an

243
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:24,240
opportunity to be kind to everyone in the group okay so share one nugget just a short nugget

244
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:29,440
about what it is that maybe by your practice or anything

245
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:35,680
just but kindness share kindness with others for the benefit of others so you

246
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,800
say one nugget the other person says another nugget another person comes back

247
