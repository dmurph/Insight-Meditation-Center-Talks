welcome welcome good morning good afternoon good evening wherever you are and for those

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,480
of you who are listening in the future welcome welcome those of you who are here online welcome welcome what a what

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,519
a delight it is to practice together it's a such a beautiful

4
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:27,880
thing so I'm going to continue on this series on the inner critic today's the fourth day

5
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:36,160
Thursday talking about this and there's I'm going to guide us in a

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,640
meditation that's um going to build on some of the meditations we've been doing

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,920
earlier in the week but if you haven't been there earlier in the week that's perfectly fine

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,960
also I'm going to point to something inside of us that um it's hard to

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,160
describe but it's has a certain amount of maybe

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:07,680
settledness or okayness even though there might be a lot of chaos and

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,960
difficulty and discomfort sometimes we can touch into something inside of us that

12
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,159
uh feels a certain amount of steadiness

13
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:28,360
or wholesomeness even if it's just you know a fleeting recognition of it or

14
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:35,600
a sense of of it rather than a clear description or clear ability to

15
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,920
land on it like yes this is it now in the Dad I'll be pointing to

16
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,759
this as an alternative to this inner critic which can be so

17
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:56,039
harsh and so um have such a big impact on our lives in a way that causes us to

18
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:01,439
disconnect from our experience or

19
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,479
in some kind of way okay so well that as an

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,599
introduction i' like um to begin in this way where just bringing to

21
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:22,000
mind somebody who or some creature some

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,920
doesn't have to be a person somebody who just kind of makes you smile a little bit in a very simple way notal

23
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,160
complicated we're not overthinking this just what feels a little bit delightful

24
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,239
when you bring them to

25
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,319
mind we're using our imagination they're not chances are

26
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:55,280
they're not right here in front of us that we can visually see them but and

27
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,560
maybe they are maybe it's your cat or dog but if they're not just bringing

28
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:10,000
them to mind and is there a way that we can feel

29
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,720
the warm feel the connection feel the openness or warm-heartedness towards

30
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,440
this lovable being again this is very

31
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,319
simple we don't have to try to find the perfect lovable being if one isn't

32
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,599
obvious just bring to mind mind maybe the spring

33
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:43,599
flowers here in the Bay Area spring has sprung lot of flowers it's really

34
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,720
beautiful just tuning into the the

35
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,720
light might be this sense

36
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,560
of and then with that sense of delight

37
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:38,080
or warmth or openness appreciation use whatever word feels

38
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:47,919
appropriate for you and Orient towards the bodily

39
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:58,000
experience what is it like at this moment to be having this somatic

40
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:07,680
embodied experience what is it like to be in this meditation

41
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,520
posture and to feel like we are in this meditation

42
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,120
posture at this

43
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
moment

44
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:48,160
maybe there's a sense of aliveness a sense of

45
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:56,600
embodiment I'm using these vague words so you can find your own

46
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
way

47
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,000
and to support a sense of

48
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:32,560
ease and extend the exhale just for a few breaths

49
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,440
and extend it just a tiny

50
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,599
bit just tapping into the body's natural

51
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:48,680
physiology using that as a support as an

52
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
ally

53
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:26,960
allowing the breath to return to normal trusting that the body knows how

54
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:36,160
to breathe and bringing this orientation of delight

55
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:43,240
warmth and ease bringing that with us as we rest

56
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,479
the attention on the sensations of

57
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
breathing

58
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,479
feeling the body

59
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,638
breathing feeling the

60
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,199
movements might be a stretch in the chest and a

61
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,840
subsequent release of the

62
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:45,360
stretch maybe a sense of the belly moving in and

63
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,760
out maybe

64
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,880
feeling the air moving in and out of the

65
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:15,540
nose whichever area whichever movements whichever

66
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,800
[Music] Sensations feel the most [Music]

67
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,440
accessible and the easiest the most

68
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
Pleasant

69
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

70
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,880
and feeling connected and

71
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,839
grounded we're

72
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
here

73
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

74
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

75
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

76
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:10,360
when the mind wanders as it's apt to do this is what

77
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,240
Minds do we just very simply

78
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,440
gently begin again with the sensations of

79
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
breathing

80
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

81
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:20,079
nothing in per needs to be

82
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:28,120
happening we're just noticing hanging out with the sensations of breathing and a

83
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:35,399
relaxed easy way without

84
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:41,959
insisting that something different happen than what is

85
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:48,199
happening as best we can as best we

86
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:05,160
can maybe the mind is agitated maybe the mind is

87
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,000
tired can that be

88
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:25,199
okay maybe the mind is settled [Music] and relaxed and

89
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:31,040
open and that be okay

90
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

91
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

92
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:54,959
and can we tune into any sense of

93
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:00,920
okayness wellbeing contentment

94
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:10,959
doesn't have to be our dominant experience maybe it's just a corner of

95
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:18,040
our experience but can we tune into

96
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:27,920
that any sense of settledness groundedness

97
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
okayness

98
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:48,399
and allowing it to get as big as it would

99
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:57,480
like we're not making anything happen we're just allowing

100
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:07,438
inviting any sense of okayness to get as big as it would

101
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
like

102
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,480
and can any sense of okay pain

103
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:08,000
or well-being certain amount of contentment whatever amount is

104
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,280
there can we allow this to be the

105
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:21,760
source of the mindfulness fueling supporting the mindfulness the

106
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:30,760
awareness the attention in a simple easy

107
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:45,200
way as if it were a paint paint and we're like painting our

108
00:18:52,280 --> 00:19:01,320
experience painting our experience with this whatever amount of ease we

109
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
have

110
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

111
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

112
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

113
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

114
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,000
resting attention on the sensations of

115
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:57,520
breathing and having this intention attention imbued

116
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,960
with any sense of well-being or ease

117
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:11,940
relaxation contentment that's [Music]

118
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:21,080
available in a relaxed way and when the mind wanders when

119
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:29,360
thinking happens we don't have to make it a problem we're okay with that too

120
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,120
and we just return to the

121
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
breath

122
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

123
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

124
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

125
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

126
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

127
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

128
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

129
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

130
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

131
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

132
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,369
[Music]

133
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:19,179
[Music]

134
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:47,449
[Music]

135
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,240
and with that guided

136
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:11,080
meditation just tapping in a little bit to this sometimes it's uh obvious and

137
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:19,080
sometimes it's very subtle this sense of I'm using these vague words like okayness or well-being or contentment

138
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:27,039
but something maybe that's just not agitated something that's um has

139
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:32,799
a sense of settledness or uh being present in a nice kind of

140
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:40,159
way so as you know I'm continuing on this uh series of the inner critic and as I have

141
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:47,000
been doing the other days just to define the inner critic as maybe it's a um like

142
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:53,360
a dynamic that's inside of us that is putting us down and belittling us and

143
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:59,240
judging us in a way that says okay somehow you are inadequate my with the G

144
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:05,320
you're inadequate I'm exaggerating but I'm exaggerating in terms of like um how

145
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:12,120
obvious it might be but it might you know feel the same might have this same

146
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:19,120
way this kind of like blaming ourselves and nagging ourselves with this real

147
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,760
harshness and this kind of be this sense of shame that accompanies accompanies it

148
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:31,519
and there so much uh pain that can be caught up in this structure and these days I've been

149
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:37,720
talking about this uh inner critic and for us to not like pone negativity onto

150
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:44,799
the onto the negativity of course that's how we can break the cycle because if we have that feeling like oh I have to get

151
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:50,200
rid of the critic that's just more of the same type of energy so we're trying

152
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:57,600
to meet it with a different type of uh energy that one of warmth and awareness

153
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,679
and spaciousness but we might have noticed

154
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:08,600
that there's a certain amount of resistance to stop this inner critic

155
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:16,600
there might be a certain like yeah yeah yeah that sounds nice Diana but I need it I need this inner

156
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:23,639
critic it serves me it's helpful there might be a part of us that feels a certain amount of loyalty to it

157
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:29,440
because we might have this idea this notion and it's just an idea it's just a

158
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,639
notion that without this inner critic we would never get out of bed in the

159
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:42,360
morning we would just lay around eat Bon bonss and um not do any work whatsoever

160
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:49,559
whether it's work to take care of our living space to take care of our responsibilities or our professional

161
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:55,639
life that we have this feeling that it's only with this inner critic that's having

162
00:31:55,639 --> 00:32:02,080
this this kind of a whip that's whipping us into shape and

163
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:09,039
so we have this belief that if the inner critic weren't having this admonitions that okay you have to do better that we

164
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:15,200
would just end up being lazy slobs they might be a part of us that

165
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:23,559
thinks that we need this inner critic so there's a way in which um the

166
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:29,080
effectiveness of having uh this CR iCal

167
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:34,919
mean disparaging uh movement or experience in

168
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:43,519
our life is helpful there's been a lot of research is that what motivates people or is it to be more encouraging

169
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:50,159
or positive and focused on what is possible versus uh what's wrong you

170
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:55,559
might imagine there's been a lot of research on this because Corporate America wants to know the answer to this

171
00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:02,399
and Corporate America has money to to spend on these types of things so this is not just something in the kind of

172
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:10,279
like the self-help uh community that we say but there's been some serious research and it shows numerous Studies

173
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:16,080
have shows that people are far more motivated and

174
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,320
engaged when there's a sense of encouragement and positivity and focused

175
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:27,080
on what is possible like a Direction they can go like where some movement

176
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:32,960
that's possible into something that's even better as opposed to just putting us

177
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:39,159
down and shaming and and anybody who's had a boss or indeed who has this inner

178
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:46,799
critic that's really loud but if you've had a boss who's really um kind of

179
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:54,440
mean then you notice how it kind of is deflating not kind of it is

180
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:01,960
Def I um haven't had a boss like that but I did see when I was in Corporate America in a department that was similar

181
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:07,159
to mine that we had to partner with that uh the boss of this other department o

182
00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:13,960
this person was mean I couldn't believe some of the things that came out of the mouth of this person and I saw how oh

183
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:19,398
the people that were uh in that department were kind of like demoralized

184
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:25,398
and and frankly they were mean to other people too was quite something so in

185
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:32,679
order to have the best versions of our self it's uh we need to stay connected

186
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:38,638
to what uh is valuable what we see is valuable within us stay connected to a

187
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,878
sense of meaning and purpose and stay oriented towards what's possible stay

188
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:51,440
oriented towards here's the direction we're going staying oriented towards

189
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:58,560
aspirations and what we find valuable so it turns out that we don't actually need

190
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:06,119
this inner critic especially not in the way that we think we do we don't need it to guide us in these choices because the

191
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:13,839
inner critic is just this pretty crude mechanism and has a very simplistic

192
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:21,000
view of ourselves and of the world is this very uh sophisticated view of what

193
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,200
is right and wrong it's as sophisticated as an we might say the

194
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:34,040
eight-year-old brain that developed it but and we have more sophisticated

195
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:40,320
ways more helpful ways more mature ways to guide

196
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,320
us we have a conscience we have a moral compass we have some of the Buddhist

197
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:54,040
teachings the precepts and this movement towards wholesome qualities generosity

198
00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:02,000
compassion wisdom these beautiful things loving kindness we can use these to guide

199
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,040
us rather than the inner critic and it to be sure it does take a

200
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:15,240
certain amount of trust to kind of like put aside the inner critic and to say okay I'm going

201
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:20,440
to trust that these beautiful qualities are inside me we all know they're inside

202
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:27,240
me inside us I don't know if you know what inside me but you know what I mean that all of

203
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:32,359
us have it inside and it does take a certain amount

204
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:38,880
of trust to put aside the inner critic and instead to tune into some of these

205
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:46,040
beautiful wholesome qualities that we all have we all have them and this practice is so much about

206
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:51,760
cultivating and developing those wholesome qualities we're not creating them out of thin air we're just uh

207
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:59,760
helping them to grow and become more and more a part of our life so this inner

208
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:08,000
critic part of its job is to tell you no you need me and you need me to navigate

209
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,359
difficult Realms because you can't do it on yourself this is or you can't do it by

210
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:18,720
yourself this is the critic speaking this is its job is to tell you that it

211
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:26,520
needs that you need it but the truth is and if we look at it we'll see that this inner critic just makes us feel

212
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:34,000
worse and this feeling worse it stops this kind of like engagement or this inquiry

213
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,119
into like what's really happening or some curiosity that can increase our

214
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,599
understanding instead it kind of like just shuts everything down no this is

215
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:50,640
bad this is good you're bad so you have to do that something like this so part

216
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,640
of this practice with the inner critic is learning to distinguish learning to

217
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,720
differentiate what we might say discernment from

218
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:10,760
judgment they're both similar and that they're distinguishing and uh discriminating between things but here's

219
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,960
a few ways how we can tell the difference between discernment and judgment I'll start with kind of

220
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:22,760
judgment this inner critic this inner critic there's a certain type of like power differential there's a s like I

221
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:28,800
know better this inner critic is trying to tell you know I know better and that not only do I know

222
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:35,400
better but I have the power and the right to determine what is good or

223
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:45,119
bad I and this inner critic is telling this uh like this is you know it's a

224
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:51,720
little bit odd to talk about this uh kind like in the Buddhist context but um

225
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:57,480
maybe you can uh give me the benefit of the doubt here and um just go with um

226
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:06,640
maybe part of your experiences so the experience of the inner critic is trying to tell or just assert itself that

227
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:12,000
there's this pathetic part of you that does a know right or wrong and that the

228
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,400
inner critic is needed to uh whip it into shape in some kind of way and so

229
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,680
this inner critic it has a sense of finality it's like this it's simply like

230
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:31,040
this and you know like okay done I don't have to think about it anym more and that's part of why it's uh evolved is

231
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,599
because it does makes things simple and a little bit less effort good bad you

232
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:41,680
know don't have to think about it anymore but this inner critic and this

233
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:49,480
uh passing of these judgments it's born out of a sense of wanting to control it's it's born out of a sense of

234
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:55,680
feeling uncomfortable with a sense of you know not with a sense of things

235
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,960
maybe not being as clear as we would like or maybe we don't understand things as well as we would like maybe we feel a

236
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:10,319
little bit uncomfortable with the ambiguity so the inner critic arises as a sense of control like no I know what's

237
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:17,880
right I know what's wrong and this is good and that's bad and end of story and of course this inner critic

238
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:23,880
has this kind of like this reactive quality this knee-jerk response to what is happening without

239
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:30,720
consideration and because it has this knee-jerk quality and it's trying to give us a sense of control it might just

240
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,760
be flying Under The Rad Radar trying to convince us that no this is the

241
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:43,160
truth but as I said before it takes one little piece of data one little

242
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:50,200
experience and then creates a huge generalization you

243
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:55,520
didn't reply to that email in a timely manner therefore you are a mean

244
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:02,359
inconsiderate person it's amazing how the inner critic just likes to make up stuff based on one

245
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:08,839
little thing okay so that's the inner critic what about like discernment what is

246
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:16,200
discernment this is a more personal conscious than than being critical or

247
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:22,359
judging it comes from this inner wisdom this inner knowing it comes from this

248
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:27,960
place that has more of a sense of settledness and well-being and contentment

249
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:34,960
and it might involve a more intuitive understanding of what is

250
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:42,040
best it might have this heart quality more than a head quality that's like I

251
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:49,800
know that the heart quality might be like this feels

252
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:55,400
right so there's this way in which there's this the um with discernment we

253
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:02,040
can distinguish what's helpful and not helpful or what's appropriate or what's

254
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:07,680
not appropriate whereas the inner critic often has words like good and bad

255
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:13,640
there's a discernment is more like okay yeah what's what's helpful here and so

256
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:21,040
helpful kind of like takes into the bigger context of the impact it has on oneself the impact it has on others so

257
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:28,920
it s has some more sophistication so rather than this just a habitual nature reaction it's involves

258
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:34,800
both our hearts and our minds and it seeks

259
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,520
alignment rather than control like the inner critic this it seeks alignment

260
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:45,960
with reality it seeks alignment with what's

261
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:53,800
actually happening it seeks alignment with um our heart's wish to be

262
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:59,119
free the mind's wish to be free

263
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:04,520
so it's not so much like pushing and shoving sometimes like how the inner

264
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:09,680
critic do does but it's uh yeah wanting to align

265
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,760
with truth reality Beauty these kind of

266
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:20,200
vague words that often our hearts get involved

267
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:28,520
to help us know those words I'm not saying that the mind is offline but maybe that the heart gets brought in

268
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:35,800
so in part of this I was pointing to this distinction between um judgment and

269
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:43,319
Discerning yesterday when I was talking about noticing what kind of thoughts are helpful and not helpful maybe we can use

270
00:43:43,319 --> 00:43:48,880
this language of judging versus Discerning and recognize that

271
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:56,480
Discerning is a better way to like lead our life which can be a support for us

272
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:03,520
so maybe we can just check in with a simple uh expression what does

273
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:09,119
the heart say what does the heart

274
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,800
say so we can add this on to Monday we talked about dropping in I'm doing the

275
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:23,200
best I can right now Tuesday tuning into to how am I

276
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:30,640
right now Wednesday we talked about judgment is like

277
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:36,280
this and today i' like to offer what does the heart

278
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:43,720
say what does the heart say as a way to help us make this uh distinguishment

279
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:50,359
between judging from the inner critic and this more we might say

280
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:58,839
discernment this more mature wise discernment judging versus

281
00:44:58,839 --> 00:45:05,400
Discerning what does the heart say thank you thank you for your

282
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:10,440
practice together and I look forward to coming back and practicing tomorrow with

292
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:16,800
I'm looking at the title that I wrote for today detrimental dedication to the

293
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:22,040
critic I kind of uh chose that as the bunch of the alliterations and it has

294
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:28,839
that sound kind of like that harsh sound I don't know I kind of

295
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:38,880
Tracy wrote I love that what does the heart say what would love have me know right now very nice what would love have

say

300
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:58,720
