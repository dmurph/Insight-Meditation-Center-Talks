1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:07,279
so uh hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:14,080
and happy to be here with you and i love coming down here in the morning

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,119
i live about two kilometers from imc

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:25,119
and uh different times of the year i enjoy different parts of coming down here and

5
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,480
now it's the early morning light that's here and

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,520
the sun is beginning to show itself a little bit through these big windows we have in the room here and

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,719
i think they'll probably have the shadow play

8
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,440
the wall again so

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,760
at some point as people continue meditation

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:05,119
practice and continue doing buddhist practice or just continue with life experience

11
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:11,200
they'll have a significant experience

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:18,640
of maybe i shouldn't make it that dramatic a noteworthy experience of

13
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,680
letting go of not holding on to something putting down a burden

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,520
and it could be you know something as you know retiring and no longer carrying

15
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,799
the burden of work it could be finishing school graduating

16
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:46,560
from school and no longer having to stay up late at night studying and having the anxiety of tests

17
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,439
there's many different things that we kind of put down and we get relieved of sometimes we let go of them sometimes

18
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:59,040
they leave us and we can experience something like a

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,280
state of peace a state of relief a state of

20
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,319
well-being of emptiness of the kind of a delightful

21
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,080
emptiness like now i'm free and no longer have this filling me

22
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,720
so for this meditation we're going to do you might want to consider sometime in your life

23
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:31,200
where you've experienced the degree of peace or calm uh or freedom or ease

24
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,640
to whatever degree that's accessible to you it doesn't have to be dramatic it could have been something mild that

25
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,040
happened yesterday or it could be some big event in the past in your past

26
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,760
and and then is there a way that that can be

27
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,800
a reference for you for the meditation

28
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,080
not that you have to attain it again but rather is there

29
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,720
a memory or is there a not so much a memory of the event but a

30
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,720
memory or a embodied memory of

31
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:20,879
where that sense of peace was in you or how it was or the taste of it the feel of it

32
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,959
maybe that still lives in you someplace maybe there's something that you feel

33
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:35,440
still to this day that is a remnant is a little hint or trace

34
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,720
of that experience and if so

35
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,840
can you call on that as a way to support you

36
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,959
in being present for your experience during this meditation almost as if

37
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,080
that experience of ease or peace or letting go

38
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:07,439
is a is a beacon or a guidepost here this is the direction to go

39
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:15,519
as your present with your experience here this is the way to be with being mindful

40
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:22,400
like this so sitting upright

41
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,240
in an alert comfortable posture

42
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,759
gently closing your eyes

43
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,680
and to settle in to this spot here and now

44
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,240
to remember that to really go

45
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,840
into this practice it's to realize that the mind and body

46
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,320
are being brought together so that they're cooperating in harmony here at this

47
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,960
moment now in this place the mind is mostly a task of the mind

48
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,680
coming here in the same place as the body

49
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,039
when the mind and body are cooperating or connected

50
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,039
in the same place at the same time then the dharma can begin opening up for

51
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,199
us

52
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:41,280
gently taking a few long slow deep breaths as deep as is comfortable for you

53
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,919
and on the exhale relax and let go

54
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,280
softening your body as you exhale

55
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,600
preparing your body to relax as you inhale

56
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:22,720
and then to gently return your breathing to normal

57
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,319
and as you exhale relax your body some more

58
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,919
go through the different parts of your body wherever there's holding

59
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,840
see if you can soften the holding

60
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:51,639
all an exercise that brings the mind into the body engaging the body

61
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,759
and then bring to mind a recent or distant memory

62
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:54,560
where you let go or you relieved of something that was

63
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,400
agitating or difficult and in it going

64
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,960
you experience some peace some ease

65
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,319
some freedom some calmness

66
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,919
and remembering that experience in your body how did the bot feel in the body for you to be

67
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,720
at ease

68
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,160
peaceful do you remember what it was like in the mind

69
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:45,440
maybe in the next few exhales continue to let go relax your body

70
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:52,000
as you exhale but relax into the feeling

71
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,880
or the memory feeling of that extent of peace

72
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,519
ease relaxation

73
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,839
and maybe on the inhale if there's any feeling in your body in

74
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:31,200
your mind of that experience and you inhale

75
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,640
see if you can let it spread and grow

76
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:48,360
on the exhale settling into it more

77
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:48,399
and might there be a way that a memory or a

78
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,920
leftover feeling of peace might

79
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,360
guide your mindfulness

80
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:05,000
instruct you in how to be present for your breathing

81
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,279
letting your mindfulness be based some

82
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,760
orient some peaceful orientation

83
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:57,040
some peaceful way of being and even if you're agitated

84
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,440
the mindfulness the awareness itself of the agitation

85
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,839
can be peaceful

86
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,079
letting peacefulness be a guide of support

87
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:31,600
for being present attentive here and now

88
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,920
one breath at a time

89
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:13,279
and then as you meditate perhaps the near goal of the meditation

90
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,480
just a moment or two away

91
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,680
is to be present to be a little bit more peaceful

92
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,639
to be present to touch into

93
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,279
the aspect of the present moment where there is peace

94
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,440
peaceful attention to breathing

95
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:45,480
remember the place where there's peace

96
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,919
even in the midst of agitation

97
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:44,880
and as we come to the end of this sitting

98
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,799
there are times where

99
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,720
some modicum of peace letting go

100
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,120
can allow ourselves to be ourselves

101
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:13,919
we like oh we shed the ways that we are put on a mask or not quite honest or

102
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:22,360
putting doing things which are not really who we are

103
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:30,480
and sometimes meditation is a homecoming to ourselves

104
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:39,799
and when we have some reference to peace and being peaceful

105
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:46,640
our peaceful attention of others is a way that

106
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:54,960
we allow them to be themselves allow them to just be

107
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:02,720
and relax and maybe even come home to themselves

108
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,799
may it be that whatever calm and peace and understanding we have from this

109
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:15,520
practice may it support us and our good will for others

110
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:23,278
so that we bring a generosity a kindness

111
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:29,519
a good will for the welfare and happiness of those we meet

112
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:35,080
and a friendly peaceful presence

113
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:40,640
that allows them to feel and sense who they are in some

114
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:49,039
deeper way may all beings be happy

115
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:58,320
may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

116
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,398
may all beings be free

117
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,819
[Music]

118
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:16,929
[Music]

119
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,960
so today's topic is the fourth noble truth

120
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:40,559
and how we understand that depends a little bit about how we understand the second noble truth

121
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:49,120
if the second noble truth is the cause of suffering

122
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:58,600
then we may or may not be able to let go of the suffering but we understand the cause

123
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:05,600
and knowing that maybe some attachment is the cause some clinging is the cause some belief that's

124
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,640
unhealthy is a cause and then we look for a practice that

125
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:16,799
helps us to become free of that to loosen the grip and so the fourth noble truth is the

126
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,840
practice to do that and

127
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:30,559
and so we start cultivating a way of being in the world that creates the conditions for us to let go of the cause

128
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:36,799
and so we practice right view we practice ethical life we practice meditation

129
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:42,000
practice so that we can uh [Music]

130
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,760
experience or attain the degree of subtleness the degree of non-agitation

131
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,880
the degree of integrity that allows us to

132
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,640
uh or the system our mind our hearts to begin to soften and release the

133
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:06,640
attachments we have if we know the cause of suffering and craving

134
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:13,039
or attachment and we have a very clear release of that craving a cessation of

135
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:22,880
it that's dramatic then we know oh this is the way forward

136
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,320
and and so if the eightfold path can be this is the way to

137
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:34,480
do this again this is the way to develop myself and grow myself so that these are the practices

138
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:41,200
so that i put myself in a better position to let go even more and not cling again

139
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,360
if the second noble truth is the arising of suffering and the fourth is the cessation of

140
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:54,399
suffering we see it coming and going all the different shapes and forms of suffering that we have of stress we have

141
00:30:54,399 --> 00:31:01,679
and and we see that in the arising and passing there starts to be freedom

142
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:09,519
then the um then the eightfold path can be seen as a path to can do this more and more

143
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:15,919
support that deep seeing but if the cessation the third noble

144
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,519
truth is a definitive clear dropping away the bottom drops away in some

145
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:28,240
wonderful inspiring way and then we realize oh this is

146
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:33,320
freedom this is

147
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:40,320
peace this is the profound sense of well-being that's possible i had no idea

148
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:48,159
then the eightfold path is still the practice to do it becomes a practice to

149
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:53,679
two things to move into this experience of peace more and more

150
00:31:53,679 --> 00:32:00,799
but it also becomes a practice that manifests that peace

151
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:07,600
and in the teachings of the buddha we find plenty of times where the eightfold path are eight ways of being in the

152
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,799
world which are not practices to attain

153
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,279
peace they're not practices that now we understand this is what we should practice if we want to deepen and deepen

154
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:25,279
our peace but there are more expressions of the peace

155
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:31,440
so i don't know if this is a good example but um

156
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:39,039
the an open hand might feel easeful

157
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,960
and the expression of the open has hand is eased expression of open hand is being

158
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:52,640
opened the expression of open hand is being its sensitivity available to the world

159
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,679
the expression of the open hand is it doesn't it's not creating a fist to hit someone it's just

160
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,960
an open hand so when the letting go is deep

161
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:10,720
full enough and we have a it becomes it can become a reference point and a

162
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,640
source from which we then live our life and the eightfold path then

163
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:23,760
is not a prescription for how to practice further so we can

164
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:30,720
deepen our practice or experience more liberation but rather the eightfold path is an

165
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,840
expression is a description of how we start living

166
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,960
so um if um um

167
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,120
if um so especially how are they so at some

168
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:57,600
point we have a clear sense that it's really good to be at ease to be at

169
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:05,039
peace to be have a sense of well-being and then when we have forces within us

170
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:11,679
that want to go in a different direction we would say why

171
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,200
why give up something good something useful for something is not so

172
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,280
good it's not a matter of practicing the hateful path but rather it's a matter of

173
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,398
not doing those things that take us away from the eighthful path

174
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,079
someone who is deeply practiced becomes the eightfold path they don't practice

175
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,520
the eightfold path and then becoming it they don't do the things they don't allow themselves to do

176
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,919
things that that take that away or they lose touch with themselves this

177
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:50,878
home of who they are and

178
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:57,839
so at some point in this four noble truths practice

179
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,560
the eighthful path becomes more and more interesting either it becomes we understand that

180
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:11,119
this is useful uh to do this all eight of these practices to create the conditions to

181
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:17,920
involve the tr to move into a kind of transform who i am transform my feelings my

182
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,359
my sense of being my attitude how i am in the world so it becomes easier to let

183
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:31,119
go more and more or there has been a transformation from a deep letting go and now it's a matter

184
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:37,920
of growing that transformation letting it become spread and become bigger and bigger

185
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:44,320
and and the eightfold path is then both the goal

186
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:51,680
the fulfillment of the goal and the means to the goal

187
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,680
so the eightfold path are eight sets of ways of being sometimes they're called

188
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:04,640
eight practices uh which is true when they're understood to be a means to liberation

189
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:10,240
but they're uh but they're eight ways of being when they're understood as being an

190
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,240
expression of our awakening so these are right view

191
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:24,400
right resolve right speech right action right livelihood

192
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,960
write effort right mindfulness and right concentration

193
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:37,119
and the right concentration ends with right concentration and right concentration is so the middle

194
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:43,040
ones right speech right action and right livelihood they're ethical how we behave in the world and how we

195
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,400
relate to other people how our actions affect others and

196
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:54,960
there's a kind of an orientation to an ethical transformation not to follow rules so much

197
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,760
but to follow these guidelines these these ways of being that are the ethical guidelines

198
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,119
um so that we begin to be transformed it's not about following rules

199
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:12,320
only it's about living this way so that we start being ethically transformed we

200
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:18,079
become someone who has such a sense of integrity or peace that of

201
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,720
course we wouldn't do the unethical things that would

202
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:32,000
obscure that or harm that but with the right concentration we're

203
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,839
talking also about a transformation concentration is not just a matter of having a lace not just a laser focus of

204
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:46,079
the mind it's having a unified sense of peace and calm from having let go a lot and practicing

205
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,839
concentration practicing stability and steadiness and

206
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:58,560
this is one of the primary ways that the tradition buddhist tradition has for preparing ourselves for the

207
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,480
deepest kinds of letting go we can do we're kind of becoming softer more malleable

208
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,720
more resilient more less distractible

209
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:17,200
and in that state it's kind of like we're ready for just something to be put down that we've

210
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,400
been carrying for a long time so there's some kind of inner

211
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:30,400
transformation that happens and part of that inner transformation is an experience of peace

212
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,839
and um and at some point that piece

213
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,880
becomes a reference point becomes a seed

214
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,119
that we can water and grow become something that a plant that kind of grows and

215
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:53,280
blossoms within us and and the eightfold path

216
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:01,839
is the represents that blossoming that fulfillment of it all

217
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:07,440
so if you not familiar with the eightfold path

218
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,720
there are really marvelous things to learn and study

219
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:18,560
they um once you kind of get the idea study them enough so you understand the basic idea

220
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:25,920
of what it is each of them then once you understand then you can start feeling your way sensing your way

221
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,960
understanding how these eight these eight waves of being

222
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,079
are not only practices they're also inner

223
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:43,280
wellsprings of being at home ill inner expressions of being settled and at peace with

224
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:49,680
oneself and this piece is not doesn't just doesn't start off doesn't

225
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,599
have to be dramatic but there might be little hints of what that is like

226
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:01,040
and then as we orient around that piece it can grow

227
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:07,599
there can it's possible to have very small degrees of peace in this life that we overlook

228
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:14,000
the mind is so concerned with his preoccupations that uh we just keep thinking them and

229
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,119
we have one preoccupation finished and we just jump on to the next one and the next one

230
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:25,200
and there's no space what we learn in this practice is to create a little more

231
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,880
space and attentiveness to the subtler places of well-being subtle places of

232
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,160
peace that begin surfacing through the practice and then

233
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:43,359
touch into it periodically regularly through the day find the little seeds

234
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,800
and recognize it water it with attention let it be a reference point let it be a

235
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:56,960
guide let it be kind of there to support you as you go through your life

236
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:03,520
so for this day you might study the get a book or

237
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:09,920
something or go on online and read about the eight noble eightfold path

238
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,599
but you also might look for the seeds of peace the little hints of it

239
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:21,920
that or ease or that you that might be

240
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,599
more part of you more available than you allow yourself to feel

241
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:33,039
it's pause stop take a break

242
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:39,760
check into yourself see if you can find is there anywhere within you some modicum some even the smallest

243
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:46,079
degree of peace and well-being and if you stay close to that for a little while

244
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:53,119
breathe with it what happens to you and what do you learn about peace

245
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:59,119
being an expression

246
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:06,640
and not a practice so thank you for today and

247
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:13,280
we'll have one more talk on the four noble truths tomorrow and

248
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:21,480
and we're almost done with this thank you
