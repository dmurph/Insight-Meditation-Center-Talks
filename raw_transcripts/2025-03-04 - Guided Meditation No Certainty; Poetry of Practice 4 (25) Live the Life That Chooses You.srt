1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:07,839
so here we are with our second um I don't know is the word installment

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,920
that sounds kind of funny to say this word installment the

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:19,760
second day on this idea of poetry of practice can't believe I've done this

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,840
three other times but there's this way in which um poetry touches us in a

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:32,040
different way than just the more dactic teaching I like to do dactic teaching

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:39,760
I've done plenty of it but I also like to just use language maybe in a

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,199
different way because there's this way in which poems can be you might even say a

8
00:00:46,199 --> 00:00:53,239
doorway to this another world where we're using ordinary words but their

9
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:59,559
arrangement of them kind of like evokes something a little bit different than

10
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:05,198
EXP exping this poetry is this arrangement of words that maybe includes

11
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:12,960
a rhythm maybe it uh points to maybe a possibility or some Wonder or some

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,320
openness which so much is about practice that can be a tremendous support for our

13
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:27,200
practice so with that is just a very short introduction I will lead us in a guided

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,320
meditation and I'll drop in a poem it'll be this same poem as yesterday because

15
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:42,720
as some of you know my little talking about the poem afterwards got all garbled due to the a mistake I made U

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,840
with the technology so just an invitation that when I drop

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:56,240
in the poem you don't have to figure it out you don't have to understand it you don't actually have to do anything have

18
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,399
to do anything maybe just allow it to touch you you and maybe it does and

19
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:11,959
maybe it doesn't and can that be okay okay so here we are with a guided

20
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,000
meditation taking a meditation

21
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:28,560
posture a big deep breath as a way to connect to the body connect to the

22
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,440
experience allowing yourself

23
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,360
to settle

24
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,360
in it can be with a big exhale can be a little bit of a letting

25
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,360
go

26
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,360
we're here in this moment this

27
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:22,640
location what would it mean to feel connected to the sitting surface you

28
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,680
find yourself on at this moment whatever that surface might be

29
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,840
cushion chair bed couch

30
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,400
floor feeling the pressure against the

31
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,879
body we're grounded and connected

32
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:20,479
there's a way that feeling connected to our sitting surface and serve as a

33
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:31,000
Bast so that we're not getting pushed around and lost in thoughts

34
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:54,759
can you be in a meditation posture and know that you're in a meditation

35
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:02,840
posture what is the experience of being in this posture Che

36
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:59,280
maybe a little bit of a body scan just noticing any obvious areas of

37
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:07,120
tension tightness

38
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:18,160
contraction they're welcome too you don't have to try to get rid of

39
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,160
them

40
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:38,919
around the eyes or the mouth common places to hold tension

41
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:08,879
the shoulders letting the shoulder blad

42
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,160
slide down the

43
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,680
back the chest

44
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,000
it to just soften and

45
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:43,800
open dearmour

46
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,759
itself and the belly

47
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,440
our beautiful

48
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:18,120
bellies bring in some appreciation perhaps and some ease

49
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,720
again feeling our contact with our sitting

50
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:53,200
surface feeling connected grounded we're here

51
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,720
then resting attention on the sensations of breathing

52
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:36,240
whether that's the movement of the chest or the belly or maybe the feeling of air

53
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:43,600
going in and out of the [Music] nose wherever feels

54
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:53,399
comfortable for you just resting attention there

55
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,320
what if meditation weren't a self-improvement

56
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:43,199
project instead was just an opportunity to land

57
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
here

58
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

59
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,240
e e

60
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:37,519
going to drop in a poem you don't have to figure it

61
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:45,199
out you don't have to understand it you don't have to appreciate

62
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:49,800
it you don't have to do

63
00:12:53,199 --> 00:13:01,639
anything maybe it lands maybe it doesn't that's

64
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:10,800

111
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,159
for

112
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:29,149
[Music]

113
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,960
so I just ring the bell I don't know how that sounds for you

114
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:50,919
guys hopefully it's it was okay if you wanted to put something in the chat

115
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:58,000
that' be helpful for me to know if that way of ringing the bell works

116
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:14,519
s great okay great

117
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:21,360
okay so again I'll uh talk a little bit about

118
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:28,200
this poem and again for those of you who weren't here earlier I made a mistake last time that's why I sounded like

119
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:37,440
monks on speed I heard a number of different descriptions of it so um my my

120
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,640
apologies so I'll just say a few word of um a few words about

121
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:49,440
poetry that uh it allows language to touch touch us in a different

122
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,679
way and I would say so much about meditation practice is maybe like

123
00:29:54,679 --> 00:30:00,080
opening up to different ways it's not our usual way of being in the world it's

124
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:10,679
not our usual way of maybe interacting or um feeling into our

125
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:18,240
experience and there's this way also like maybe the rhythms of poetry have this uh Beauty to it that maybe our

126
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,480
regular self speech or the speech that we do with uh

127
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:30,720
others is uh not um it's different I'm looking over this is

128
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:37,799
I'm looking over the chats to make sure that everything is okay yes okay here we

129
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:43,840
go okay so the poem for today prescription for the disillusioned the

130
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,799
same one as it was yesterday and I'll talk about it again differently

131
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:54,919
today I'll read it again prescription for the disillusioned

132
00:30:54,919 --> 00:31:02,320
by Rebecca Del Rio come new to this

133
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:09,039
day remove the rigid Overcoat of experience the notion of knowing the

134
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:14,880
beliefs that cloud your vision leave behind the stories of your

135
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,279
life spit out the sour taste of unmet

136
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:25,799
expectation that the stale scent of what if sft back into the swamp of your

137
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:30,919
useless fears arrive

138
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:36,279
curious without the armor of certainty the plans and planned results

139
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:45,720
of the life you've imagined live the life that chooses you new every breath every blink of your

140
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:52,240
astonished eyes I think this poem is uh lovely and

141
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:59,120
it's a I would say a really good description of a meditation practice and I appreciate that titled prescription

142
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,399
for the disillusioned so what does it mean to be disillusioned often it means that we're

143
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:11,880
disappointed and perhaps something we had been looking forward to turns out to not be as good as what we were expecting

144
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,360
perhaps yesterday there was a daret that you were expecting to be able to be

145
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:25,760
comprehensible and it turned out to not be comprehensible and maybe there was this like a disillusion this

146
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:33,799
disappointment so there's this way which is a Perfectly Natural and normal thing to do in which we

147
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:39,360
imagine something about how we think something will go in the future I'd say

148
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,399
we probably do this for almost everything we imagine and then we're

149
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:51,159
laying that on top of our experience and then they don't match so we have what's actually happening then

150
00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:56,840
we have our experience and they don't match and then there's this way in which

151
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:04,799
we feel disappointed and then we're trying to manipulate our experience so that it matches our

152
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:11,320
expectation kind of forgetting that our expectation is completely 100% imaginary

153
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:18,039
fabricated just collection of thoughts in the mind what's actually happening is

154
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:25,000
what meditation practice is pointing to and so when we notice this uh

155
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,600
occurring when our expectations aren't being met there's this way that we can

156
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,799
use it as an indicator or an encouragement to practice this

157
00:33:35,799 --> 00:33:42,039
recognition that what is it that is causing these imaginary ideas about what

158
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:49,600
the future will be we could say it's our beliefs so that the underlying beliefs

159
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,799
the ones that we most likely are not aware of are influencing what we're

160
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:01,880
imagining what what's actually happening is what's actually happening we don't get to control that have you noticed but

161
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,000
we're trying to somehow control it by placing our expectations on top so what

162
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,440
are our expectations what's fueling them and part of that are our

163
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,560
beliefs so do we have beliefs that we should be comfortable at at all times do

164
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:25,839
we have a belief that the world owes us something or do we have a belief that

165
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:34,440
perhaps the world is uh an unsafe place or maybe we have this idea that um think

166
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:40,040
whatever our expectations are they should just be met dang

167
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,638
it so when we find ourselves disappointed it's an excellent occasion

168
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:52,040
to just gently inquire well what were the assumptions I was making what did I

169
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:59,040
think was going to happen again we don't have to make the the experience of

170
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:06,040
having expectations be wrong because that's natural and of course we're going to do it but what the practice is

171
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:15,119
pointing to the opportunity to just notice this difference between what's actually happening and our thoughts

172
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:22,320
about what's happening we will always be disillusioned as long as we're thinking

173
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,800
that our thoughts are what should be happening to practice is pointing to

174
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,800
just pay attention to what's actually happening and it could be as our poet

175
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:41,640
here is pointing to there's often some fear that's underneath that's fueling the underlying

176
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:46,880
belief maybe that's like underneath even the beliefs or maybe it's coloring or

177
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:53,920
coding our beliefs which is coloring and coding our expectations fear of being

178
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:02,520
alone fear of discomfort fear of feeling uncomfortable emotions

179
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:08,079
that maybe we feel are lurking just underneath the surface fear of

180
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:15,800
death fear of somebody close to us a loved one being harmed or death of them

181
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:21,240
or something there's so many different things that can be uh fueling our

182
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:27,400
expectations which lead to this disillusionment and then the title of

183
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:34,119
this poem is prescription for the disillusion so this idea of prescription we could say prescription

184
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:39,680
is a recommendation that's by someone who is deemed to be authoritative and

185
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:46,839
the Buddha was sometimes considered to be a great physician who was treating what ails us

186
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:52,040
what ails all of us Dua right Dua this

187
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:58,400
single word that stands for such a wide such a wide range of experiences from

188
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,960
just the mildly irritating to the tragic horrifying the single word covers this

189
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,000
wide uh range and we could say some people have said that the Buddha's

190
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,400
formable truth is uh a way in which this great physician uh taught the world and

191
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:24,680
was helping there specifically in Ancient India but for us today so could say the first Noble Truth is the

192
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:30,400
diagnosis the truth of Dua that there's dooka when our expectations about what

193
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:38,560
we want doesn't match what's actually happening and then the there was this uh

194
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:45,480
um the Buddha it talks about the cause of this suffering we could say it's clinging it's clinging to our expectations or thoughts about how

195
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:50,920
things should be how we want them to be how we imagine them to be the prognosis

196
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:57,520
is good there can be an end to suffering this is the third Noble Truth and then of course the fourth Noble Truth is the

197
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:04,920
Noble 84 path I won't go into all steps of this but many of you will know that

198
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,160
one of them of course is mindfulness one of these eight is

199
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:16,160
mindfulness we can summarize the no eight-fold path is uh practices we do in

200
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:22,040
the world CA ethical uh mental development mindfulness concentration

201
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:27,240
and wisdom View and intention so the fourth Noble Truth is

202
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:33,599
the treatment plan that uh this great physician if you will that the Buddha

203
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:39,880
provides for us this prescription is the Noble eight-fold Path which emphasizes

204
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:46,319
the importance of being present for what is actually

205
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:53,200
happening which very often might be disappointment with what's actually

206
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,000
happening can we just be with the disappointment can we be with the experence experience of being

207
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,440
disillusioned or disenfranchised or just

208
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,480
sad about what's happening maybe it's not what's

209
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:15,960
happening and instead our poet is pointing to live the life that chooses you can you be with what's actually

210
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:22,960
happening and recognizing what's actually happening maybe there's a little bit of anger I want it to be this

211
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:30,599
way dang it and it's not so can we engage with life as it

212
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:36,160
unfolds without feeling like we have to wrestle it into submission but uh

213
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:42,119
instead is there's this way can we meet what's arising including not wanting it

214
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:50,560
to arise that way this practice meets us where we are where we are often is feeling

215
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:56,280
disillusioned disappointed and then maybe you'll say I

216
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:02,800
was working with this home disillusioned prescription for the disillusion sometimes there's tremendous

217
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,800
happiness and joy too right I don't want to make it sound like there's always this disappointment so but I'm

218
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:16,520
responding to this poem so I'll read this poem one more time prescription for the disillusioned

vision leave behind the stories of your life spit out the sour taste of unmet

expectation let this stale scent of what ifs weft back into this swamp of your
