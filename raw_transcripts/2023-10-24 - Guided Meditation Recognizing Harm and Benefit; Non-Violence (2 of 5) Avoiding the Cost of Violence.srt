1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:09,200
so good day everyone and welcome and as I we did yesterday today

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,480
I'd like to again offer a different approach to our morning

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:22,439
practice where the emphasis is not on the usual purposes of meditation

4
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,000
might be to become more calm or settled or peaceful to become more concentrated

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,160
to become um to see more clearly in a certain way uh to have some pleasure or

6
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,719
even Joy or Bliss sometimes in meditation to put those ideas

7
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:48,719
aside and uh to learn a skill of mindfulness which uh is realistic and

8
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:56,160
one that teaches us a lot and which is useful very useful for guiding us as we

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,760
live our life and that is to imagine um two

10
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,240
baskets one on each side of you and

11
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,720
whatever is going on for you whatever you're thinking whatever you're wanting

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:23,240
whatever you're not wanting whatever your uh impulses are your attitudes are

13
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,840
whatever that is happening to you whatever is arising out of

14
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,720
you sitting here in meditation

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:42,280
discern whether it is good for you or not good for you the

16
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,119
good not good is vague that it's beneficial or not beneficial that it's

17
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:55,360
uh that it is healthy for you or not healthy and when you're not

18
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,840
sure maybe it's neither then just leave it alone

19
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:08,520
and if it's healthy or beneficial for you or

20
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:17,200
has a rightness to it put it in one basket if it's unhealthy for you if it's

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:24,160
brings an ouch for you or feels like it diminishes you it brings a stress brings

22
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:31,040
some kind of feeling of of um not being supported or being critical

23
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,920
harsh put that in another basket and just put them there in these baskets and maybe at the end you have

24
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,560
some general sense of which basket is most full and this ability to discern between

25
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,319
that is invaluable so that's what I recommend for this this

26
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:58,760
sitting so to begin you would maybe lower your gaze or close your

27
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,799
eyes and then

28
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:09,560
consider whether hearing this instructions for me for what we're doing

29
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,159
today whether your reaction to that your response to that is a response that

30
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:22,799
feels good to you or feels healthy for you or feels like it inspires you in

31
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:31,159
some way or does IT contract you or bring up judgments or disappointments

32
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:38,560
something which doesn't feel that good maybe reasonable to have those things but still that doesn't feel so healthy

33
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,879
to have them so put them in one

34
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,920
basket and as you continue just consider notice your what

35
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,720
you're thinking what you're wanting not

36
00:03:56,079 --> 00:04:03,239
wanting what you're doing what you're intending ending how you're reacting to anything

37
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:06,519
that goes on here and

38
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,239
now and then put in one of two baskets putting aside any

39
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:23,479
pursuit of staying with what's beneficial holding on to it intentionally doing more of

40
00:04:23,479 --> 00:04:30,720
it just allow things to unfold as they do and as they occur

41
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,199
put them in one basket or the other or just leave them alone if they're

42
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:41,280
neither beneficial or not

43
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
beneficial

44
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
for

45
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
for

46
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
for

47
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
for

48
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
for

49
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
for

50
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
for

51
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
for

52
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
for

53
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
for

54
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
for

55
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,760
noticing if how you are and what you're doing as you sit here

56
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,959
quietly is it wholesome or UNH

57
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:41,639
wholesome is it does it allow what's Best in you to

58
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:49,720
open up or does it close you or does it bring stress or does it

59
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:57,759
bring sense of well-being and this can be very

60
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:04,600
subtle the quality the manner in which thoughts are

61
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:14,360
thought or about what you think about be subtlest wants and

62
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:22,880
aversions what you don't want what you want and if there's no wanting or not

63
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:30,680
wanting no thoughts nothing that seems obviously beneficial or harmful

64
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:39,399
just let be without a need to do

65
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:46,160
anything but be fresh and Ava available to

66
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:55,000
notice when you're involved in doing something in the mind the heart the

67
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:04,240
body which is either beneficial or not and if it is put it aside into these

68
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:11,399
two baskets and be fresh and available to

69
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,320
see what comes

70
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
next

71
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
for

72
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,839
and even if what you're thinking about seems

73
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,160
nice maybe the degree to which it is a

74
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:41,880
distraction from being aware and he is seen as not

75
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
beneficial

76
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,320
for and if it helps you stay on track with

77
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,559
this exercise you can very peacefully

78
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,679
quietly identify with the thought

79
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,080
beneficial not

80
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:55,480
beneficial as you put things aside into the respective

81
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
baskets

82
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
for

83
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
for

84
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

85
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

86
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
e

87
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
for

88
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

89
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

90
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

91
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:59,960
our body and mind

92
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:05,760
are very fine instruments sensitive

93
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,279
instruments that have the capacity of picking up

94
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:19,440
registering when what we're doing is wholesome and when when it when it's not

95
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,440
wholesome when our thoughts motivations

96
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:33,880
attitudes in some way harm ourselves even in the very subtle

97
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:40,240
ways undermines us deflate

98
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:47,760
us limit us or when they ins our thoughts

99
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:55,559
attitudes and feelings are more on the inspiring side beneficial

100
00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:00,760
side bringing a alert and good

101
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:07,120
energy even the very most subtle ways we can pick

102
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:14,240
up we can register so we can know what to let go

103
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,320
of what to stop

104
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:29,799
doing so we can know and see how to be present

105
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:37,200
in a beneficial way way that leads to happiness and

106
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:46,080
freedom and all the signposts for freedom and

107
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,360
happiness are found here in our own body and

108
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
mind

109
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:33,960
for and then as we come to the end of this

110
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:41,559
sitting to wish well for this world that we live in for the people we know the strangers

111
00:25:41,559 --> 00:25:46,960
we'll encounter the people all over this world

112
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:53,120
to wish them well and because we wish them

113
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,799
well we want to be a person who does well well in the

114
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:06,520
world that we are a conveyor of

115
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:10,520
safety well-wishing

116
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,840
Goodwill that we ourselves contribute to the welfare and happiness

117
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,039
of others even just because we respect them

118
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,600
we

119
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:41,639
are safe for them we bring a calm or a

120
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:55,679
smile may it be that this practice that we do supports us to enter this

121
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:03,639
world in an easy way light-handed

122
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:10,520
way that genuinely contributes to the welfare of

123
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:18,159
all beings may all beings be happy may all beings be

124
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:26,520
safe may all beings be peaceful may all beings be

125
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
free

126
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:45,200
[Music]

127
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:54,640
[Music] thank

128
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,519
you

129
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
e

130
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,720
so so this week the top topic

131
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:09,880
for our discussion our consideration is nonviolence and um it's I think the one

132
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:16,799
of the fundamental ethical principles of Buddhism is not to harm and it's

133
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:24,159
represented by the very first precept which is usually said uh to not to kill

134
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:31,679
but it's a little bit more comprehensive it's not to uh harm any physically harm

135
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,799
any living being and

136
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:42,000
um and this is such an important thing in this world that we live in and I

137
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,720
believe that as we meditate this becomes more and more obvious or more and more the

138
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:55,919
orientation we have is do not want to cause harm and there's are two reasons I

139
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,519
can think many reasons for this one reason is that as we meditate we

140
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:07,559
become we develop a heightened sensitivity for what the cost is to

141
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:15,279
ourselves when we harm others intentionally deliberately that uh uh it's very

142
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:22,679
stressful for the our own system it's Al it uh involves a diminishment a

143
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:27,880
narrowing of our scope it involves uh uh

144
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:35,679
being involved in anger and greed and ill will uh delusion even involves

145
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:42,360
speaking up stress and so you can feel that once we start meditating we

146
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:49,000
start feeling that the effect that UNH wholesome Behavior harmful Behavior has

147
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,360
on ourselves and so part of the motivation not to be

148
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:01,799
violent Not to cause harm to others is that that the cost we see the cost is too high for

149
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:10,080
ourselves and um another reason is we see the cost is too high for others and

150
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,320
we start feeling uh a kinship with others there's something about sitting

151
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,679
quietly and having the thinking mind become quiet the mind that objectifies

152
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:26,720
the mind that is caught up in thoughts and ideas about people and projections

153
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:33,120
into the fure future and all kinds of ideas of conceit that interfere with our

154
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,600
body and heart's capacity for sympathy for empathy

155
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:45,760
for understanding uh what it's like to be you know you know we put ourselves in

156
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:52,080
other people's shoes or and we get a sense of you know what their suffering is and how terrible it is for people to

157
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,159
be harmed and and um devastating for some people

158
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:04,399
when there's violence committed towards them and um and at some point it's so it

159
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:11,720
almost feels like a violence to oneself the knowledge and the perception of seeing harm being done to others

160
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:16,960
especially being done from our by ourselves and so there's a kind of shift

161
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:22,039
that begins happening when people spend a lot of time meditating doing mindfulness is there tends to be a

162
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:28,880
movement towards uh wanting to live a life of non-harming and one of the definitions

163
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,799
in the teachings of the Buddha for what it means to be an fully enlightened

164
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:41,480
person that person will not deliberately harm any living

165
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,919
being and will not kill any living being someone who fully enlightened is

166
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:51,960
incapable of killing and uh if that's what you know

167
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:59,720
so some of you might want to become enlightened but if that's what enlightenment is do you want it is it

168
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:05,039
still attractive to you or do you have some other idealistic idea that you have

169
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:11,519
about what enlightenment is or do you feel like Enlightenment is only kind of a freedom from your own suffering so you

170
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:18,440
don't suffer but you never thought about it as something about it changes your relationship to other

171
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:25,880
people and um and if you take this path of of Dharma the Dharma path what will

172
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:31,559
happen is that uh it's an ethical path you'll grow in your ethical

173
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:38,320
sensitivity and the increasingly become someone who lives more and more ethically even in subtle

174
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:44,440
ways and one of the manifestations of this is not only not wanting to harm

175
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:51,360
anybody um but not capable of deliberately doing so so someone who is

176
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:58,559
a well-developed Lous path uh would not be capable of of being a soldier for

177
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:03,600
example if that meant needing to kill others or go into

178
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:10,638
fighting if it means being a um uh you know being a medic uh driving an

179
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,679
ambulance maybe that's very different maybe that's something as you know Soldier could

180
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:23,720
do and um so uh so the the the rationale the

181
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:30,599
reason for nonviolence at in the of the most personal way that it the reason for

182
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:37,440
it is not logical it becomes from this deeper sensitivity we have that uh you

183
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:44,679
would have for example uh you know if you have a young baby that uh of course

184
00:34:44,679 --> 00:34:50,520
you don't want to harm the baby you'll do everything you can you know if you ever received in your arms a newborn

185
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:57,920
baby and the care and the tenderness that I think most people will hold that baby um not one to harm it in any kind

186
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,079
of way U being very gentle is phenomenal and that's just kind of built into our

187
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:10,240
system that that's what we do for many of us and that sensitivity there can be

188
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:17,280
spread and developed towards all beings everywhere now then the question becomes

189
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,480
what about when there are terrible things happening someone attacks you attacks your

190
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,880
family um violently even coming to kill them shouldn't you be able to kill them

191
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:33,000
back shouldn't you be able to defend yourself and

192
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:40,040
um and there's a little problem I have with this kind of rationale this pushing back around the value of

193
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:47,040
non-violence because it it suggests that the the B the the choice is between

194
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,359
being violent or nonviolent but there's another

195
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:58,640
possibility the choices between being violent and and

196
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:04,720
um uh learning developing oneself to be skillfully

197
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,280
nonviolent to um taking the time to train

198
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:16,160
ourselves in nonviolent forms of communication non-violent forms of

199
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:25,280
behavior that so that we can uh defend ourselves um without having to resort to

200
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,480
violence many years ago someone came to me a woman came to me in Palo Alto and

201
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,640
lives in paloalto which is a relatively you know comfortable Town

202
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:43,160
safe time Town even back then there were some dangers and she uh asked me if uh she

203
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:50,160
told me she was thinking of getting a gun to make herself safe and I didn't feel like I was I didn't want to be in a

204
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:56,240
position to decide whether she should or shouldn't be getting a gun but uh I did

205
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:02,079
tell her that I thought it was very sad uh to get a gun first and foremost that

206
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:07,880
first there's a lot of uh trainings a person can do in self-defense that

207
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:15,000
doesn't require a gun and um and maybe those forms of self-defense don't work

208
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:22,680
100% of the time but neither does a gun work 100% of the time um but uh to be

209
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:29,280
well trained in nonviolent forms of self-defense or maybe self-defense that

210
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,319
does strike out in order so we can escape from someone um so we don't have

211
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:41,960
to resort to guns that takes time and effort for a

212
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:47,240
country to avoid war uh to in defending itself takes a

213
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:54,040
lot of preparation to make the war to set up uh nonviolent forms of defense

214
00:37:54,040 --> 00:38:00,640
and sophisticated forms to live in a world where we don't have uh we don't

215
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:08,240
have to resort to violence takes Decades of planning that uh you know the first

216
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:15,000
time uh I gave a talk on the Buddhist teachings on

217
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,760
non-violence and all this was in the early 1990s in the first Gulf

218
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:29,119
War and then periodically there's been uh you know it happens again and again war and War and

219
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:35,560
war war has been part of my life my whole life I've never had never really

220
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:42,400
been in a war zone um little bit of a distance could see the country that war

221
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:51,440
kind of or something distance once I saw a mortar explode but uh it's been part of my life

222
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:57,359
uh my parents experienced VI violence during World War II my mother did in

223
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:02,800
World War II um my parents-in-law were Jews in the concentration camps in

224
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:11,920
Germany and barely survived and um they lost their parents in the camps the Vietnam War was huge

225
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,480
growing up in their early 60s and uh having to do uh this ridiculous duck

226
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:22,640
drills in school in in second grade first grade because we were supposed to

227
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:28,920
protect us from the nuclear Holocaust That was supposed to be happened when the Russian Americans went

228
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:35,200
into nuclear warfare with each other and the Vietnam War and you know

229
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:41,920
and goes on and on um the violence that you a huge impact on me personally that

230
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:47,960
shaped me was um uh Israeli bombing of

231
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:53,160
the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon in about

232
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:59,960
1982 and um uh I that I I read about that and saw pictures of it when I was a

233
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:08,880
deep in meditation practice deep in our Retreats and doing Zen Retreats and that changed me uh where I just that really

234
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,800
kind of one of the reasons why I wanted to uh become a Buddhist teacher in order

235
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:21,640
to uh respond to the world uh with uh nonviolence to try to make a better

236
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:28,240
better world for all of us to respond to the suffering we have so there can be

237
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,359
Alternatives but to expect Alternatives uh you know you can't uh uh

238
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:40,800
to close the gate of the Corral once the horse has gotten free doesn't help to

239
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:45,920
begin thinking about nonviolence when the violence is already in full blow is

240
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,280
H doesn't work but there has to be planning ahead of time lots of it

241
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,680
preparations for it and um nonviolence takes time time

242
00:40:56,680 --> 00:41:02,319
preparation and struggle even um one of the things that I've seen

243
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:08,200
is that uh sometimes violence and violent speech can have an immediate

244
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:16,520
effect sometimes the effect the person wants it stops what's happening uh we get what we want maybe

245
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:23,160
but the repercussions and the consequences we have to deal with for years afterwards um are not taken into

246
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:30,160
account and are very expensive very difficult nonviolence the difficulty is ahead of

247
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:37,920
time before the problem and then if you find a nonviolent way of dealing with a problem

248
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:43,280
then there there aren't the same repercussions and there's not the after effect of having to clean up and deal

249
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:50,000
with it afterwards um you know there for Generations Generations people suffer

250
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:59,160
when uh there is war the children who experience it and their children experience it um you know

251
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:05,160
my um you know that that my children knew

252
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:12,319
their grandparents who survived the Nazi concentration camps uh is a big impact

253
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:17,960
on them and you know they were born many many years after World War II but it

254
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:24,280
still has an effect on them has an effect on me and um and people are still dealing

255
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:29,640
United States with the repercussions of the Cil war and um people still dealing

256
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:40,280
with the repercussions of World War I even and all these things that go on and on um and um so violence is an easy

257
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,400
solution the obvious solution for immediate

258
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:50,760
survival nonviolence is a fantastic

259
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:57,119
solution provided it's done in a sophisticated way in a caring way

260
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,760
where we do the work up front not the cleanup cost

261
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:10,520
afterwards and um so if you go back and look at the Buddhist teachings you

262
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:17,880
see that uh over and over and over again he emphasizes non-harming this is a

263
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:24,200
central feature of what he's teaching and what he's getting across um so I'll read a couple of

264
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:31,839
things before we end one who neither kills nor gets others to

265
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:37,000
kill neither conquers nor gets others to

266
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:44,280
conquer with good will for all beings has no hostility for anyone at

267
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:49,720
all has no host hostility for anyone at

268
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:57,559
all somewhere else he says in Dap there's the verse Victory gives birth to hate the

269
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:07,119
defeated sleep tormented giving up both Victory and defeat the peaceful sleep

270
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:17,319
delighted all tremble at violence all fear death have en likened

271
00:44:17,319 --> 00:44:25,040
others to yourself don't kill or cause others to kill all tremble at violence

272
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:31,480
life is dear to all having likened others to yourself don't kill or cause

273
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:38,960
others to kill just as you want to live just as you don't want to be harmed so

274
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:45,279
others don't want to be killed don't want to be harmed care for them

275
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:53,160
instead so um so we ourselves are an instrument who

276
00:44:53,160 --> 00:45:01,960
can discern and feel both the negative costs of violent and

277
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:07,720
harmful action and we can feel the the tremendous

278
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:14,960
benefit from action which is not harming it it's beneficial and caring for others

279
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,040
may we choose the latter thank

280
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:27,520
you
