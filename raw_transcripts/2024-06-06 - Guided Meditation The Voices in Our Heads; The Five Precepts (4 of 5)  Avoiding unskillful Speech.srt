1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:08,760
so greetings again welcome everyone we're back today to explore further in the the

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,119
five precepts ways to bring attention

3
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:22,880
to our actions in five common Realms of of

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:30,359
action as Gil puts it in uh oh I can't remember where

5
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,600
uh but that the the practice provides a mirror where

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,760
we can come to know ourselves by reflecting on our

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,600
actions come to know ourselves in the practice through our

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,079
actions uh somehow coming to know ourselves through

9
00:00:53,079 --> 00:01:01,079
our actions removes ourselves as actor from the middle of everything

10
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:07,799
and as we know that that is freeing today we'll focus on the third

11
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:14,640
precept I'm sorry where am I Thursday fourth precept

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,720
the commitment to support our practice by refraining from unskillful speech

13
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,720
harmful speech and uh this is such a great area

14
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:34,000
of practice spee being something we engage in frequently without any

15
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,040
thought it just happens um and as we'll

16
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:47,600
see the Buddha recommends that we think before we speak in a very specific way

17
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,640
without too much more on for on that for the moment let's sit together and let's

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:00,039
do a little practice in the sitting with avoiding harmful speech

19
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:07,159
and cultivating skillful speech in the meditation I'll show you

20
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:14,160
what I mean so let's bring our eyes down if that's comfortable invitation to bring

21
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,239
the eyes down partially all the way if that

22
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,640
works settle into the meditation

23
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,840
posture and as we've done in previous days

24
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,480
find balance establish

25
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,040
balance between alertness and

26
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:50,000
relaxation attentive accepting open to what

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,440
arises alert engaged just enough energy to keep

28
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,840
attention Here and Now but also at

29
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:11,879
ease seeing if we can relax a little bit the the tendency to express preference

30
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:17,159
or push things away or bring things closer hold on to

31
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:32,439
things as we begin to settle in we can bring a attention to the

32
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,879
body sometimes it's useful to just start with the weight of the body in the chair

33
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:45,040
on the bench on the cushion on the

34
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,879
floor and then feel our way into the

35
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,120
breathing right in the center of it all there's this breathing thing

36
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:10,720
happening and we don't even need to know it as breathing or as the breath we can just notice the rise and fall of the

37
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:18,400
abdomen the sense of stretching out filling up followed by the sense

38
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:24,479
of settling down expelling the

39
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:33,280
breath we can bring our attention to just one breath at a time I'm exploring it

40
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,560
fully what's it like now sometimes we may notice the breath

41
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,280
feels open and free other times tight

42
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,280
quivery

43
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:00,759
constricted and our task is just to notice how things are right

44
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:06,600
now don't have to do anything about what we

45
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,280
notice we're just giving this gift of attention and

46
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:20,240
this this soft question of what's it like right now to be

47
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:35,680
here every time we become aware wake up perhaps to notice that

48
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,759
we've gotten entangled in thought or that maybe the mind has we can sense is

49
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:48,720
constricted kind of narrowly focused on a particular stream of thought or spiral

50
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:56,560
of thought no problem nothing to get overly concerned

51
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,800
about and maybe just noticing that tightness that narrowness we can then

52
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,720
proceed to return to the center of things the breathing happening in the

53
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:20,039
middle return again to the sensations of the abdomen rising and falling the shoulders lifting settling back

54
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:24,039
down noticing just this

55
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:36,120
breath today with exploring together the third the fourth

56
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:44,639
precept we can bring this idea of avoiding harsh speech unhelpful

57
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,639
speech unkind speech as a way to support our

58
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:57,400
practice we can notice the speech that may accompany our meditation

59
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:08,000
when we find the Mind distracted caught up in the future thinking about the past

60
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,120
thinking about other people or ourselves how do we direct it back to

61
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:19,720
the Here and Now of experience is that voice we use to guide

62
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:26,080
the meditation internally is it kind is it

63
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:32,879
supportive or is it frustrated EXA exasperated judging

64
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:39,680
Etc maybe we can just soften up a little bit around that voice and gently guide

65
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,039
ourselves maybe it's like tugging on the leash of a puppy that we

66
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:52,919
love and an encouragement to return to here and now no hurry we're going to do

67
00:07:52,919 --> 00:08:00,520
this many times over and over again it's a natural process

68
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:06,199
the mind gets caught up on things that's the mind's job we depend on the mind to do

69
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:12,120
that and in the meditation we're just we're just adding to those capacities of

70
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,400
mind that we've so well cultivated we're we're cultivating

71
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:24,960
another capacity of mind to be a little more still the Mind enjoys this too the

72
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,440
Mind likes to be at rest as well as being busy

73
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:41,039
so notice the voices in our heads we might say notice what those voices are like

74
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:48,560
and if they're unkind or ungentle just soften up around that a bit just notice

75
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,200
that maybe it's a little painful to have that voice guide us and perhaps

76
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,920
we can we can use a gentler voice

77
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,040
sometimes we can ask who voice is that

78
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,279
anyway is that a parental Voice or caregiver's

79
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:20,959
voice the one that maybe chides

80
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:26,399
us for having lost track of the breath fallen off the breath wandered away from

81
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,160
the breath a voice that hurries us back to the

82
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,399
breath must return to the breath we can be gentle there can

83
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:45,760
develop a voice of practice skillful speech in the

84
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:55,120
meditation that gently guides us back to the breath maybe it's something like oh

85
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,160
there's the mind again entangled with the future planning

86
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,959
I like to be grateful for the mind's ability to do that sometimes I say thank

87
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:13,880
you appreciate it appreciate those skills right now I'm going to head back

88
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:19,480
to the breath going to sit with the breath for a

89
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:27,040
bit be gentle with the voice in The

90
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
Meditation

91
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240

e e

126
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:33,600
so maybe we can in dedicating the Merit of our practice

127
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:41,080
today bring forward the voice or voices we cultivate in the

128
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:47,559
meditation voices that are kind and

129
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:55,519
supportive and maybe we can as we wish well to other beings we

130
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:00,600
can notice this voice too make it a central part of our practice

131
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:08,440
the voice that wishes all other beings be content be happy be

132
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:15,320
free these voices this voice we develop in the meditation for guiding our

133
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:21,879
own our own practice our own returning to the Here and

134
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:31,279
Now can be a voice we share with the world so in the spirit of that kindness

135
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:36,760
the skill that we bring to our our intimate relationship with

136
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:43,480
ourselves in the meditation let's wish that other beings benefit from our

137
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,919
practice that all

138
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:54,679
beings meet with kindness in the world all beings

139
00:29:54,679 --> 00:30:00,640
benefit from the Stillness and peace that the

140
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,320
practice offers through us may all beings be well be

141
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:14,200
safe may all beings live at peace may all beings be free

142
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,760
[Music]

143
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:29,650
[Music]

144
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:36,990
[Music]

145
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:50,760
so welcome again

146
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:03,399
greetings and welcome back to day four of our exploration of the five

147
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:09,360
precepts the fourth precept

148
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:16,519
is a commitment to refrain from harmful

149
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:22,120
speech and to cultivate kind speech is a way to support our

150
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:28,120
practice and I would just note before proceeding on to some discussion of the

151
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:34,399
precept in sort of in the actions of interaction with others and daily daily

152
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:42,080
life just that as I tried to point to in the guided meditation that the voices we cultivate

153
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,559
or the voice we cultivate to guide the meditation to the extent that it has a

154
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:53,760
verbal presence and has words that can be a voice that we are attentive to and

155
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:00,760
bring into the world a lot of times we'll notice that the voice that appears years it may have frustration

156
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:07,600
exasperation judgment as I noted and we can soften around that so that even in

157
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,039
the meditation we're avoiding harsh speech avoiding unskillful speech

158
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,919
avoiding speech that causes or deepens

159
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:29,279
harm so the fourth precept yeah uh I think as I observed at the

160
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:35,039
very top of the hour that speech is something that comes so automatically to

161
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:41,440
us and of course there's exceptions but uh to to most of us speech comes very

162
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:50,279
quickly and uh without a lot of thought and I I think perhaps the the central

163
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:55,559
injunction here in the fourth precept is just to think more

164
00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:02,039
about what we bring into the world world this act through this action of

165
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:10,519
speech so avoiding harmful speech and it's also useful to note that

166
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:15,559
as is the case with each of the each of these precepts what we undertake in this

167
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:21,559
sort of complicated formulation is not just to practice good speech or kind

168
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:27,120
speech but to avoid causing harm with speech to avoid harmful speech there's

169
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:33,880
something about the avoiding that's really important among other things I think when we avoid harmful speech we

170
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:37,519
speak less and we listen

171
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:47,600
more it's an interesting aspect of our physiology that apparently when we speak

172
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:54,399
if we were to speak without protecting our ears internally the sound of our voices could do damage to this very

173
00:33:54,399 --> 00:34:00,399
sensitive hearing apparatus we have and so there's a mechanism me mechanism might not be the right word

174
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:06,799
but there's a when we speak we we close off a bit the hearing is closed off a

175
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:13,000
bit and so when we speak we literally can't listen or we don't hear as

176
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:20,280
much and so I keep that in mind just that when I'm talking I can't listen that's true on a lot of levels

177
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:29,679
but apparently it's true in the physiology as well so um what is the bu in this case

178
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,878
the case of this precept the Buddha actually provides as many of you probably know very specific instructions

179
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:41,280
about what constitute wise speech what constitute unwise speech and I'll just give you a brief

180
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,520
flavor of this with the story there's a um there's a in in the ancient

181
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:53,079
discourses that come down to us there's a there are many cases but there's a case where a prince goes to see the

182
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:58,320
Buddha asks him a trick question as happens I don't know why people continue

183
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:05,119
to do this because the Buddha was never fooled by trick questions a master of rhetoric a master of debate

184
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:12,400
um I wouldn't I wouldn't have bothered to try um but Prince Abaya asked the

185
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:19,280
Buddha a a trick question does the Buddha ever say anything un that that people don't want to hear that's

186
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:27,320
unpleasant or painful to hear and the Buddha says well that's not a um that's there's no simple yes or no

187
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:34,200
answer to that and proceeds to give the prince a teaching and I'll just give you a flavor of it I paraphrase I'm not

188
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:40,400
quoting that would take more time than we have but the Buddha says the Buddha

189
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,839
does not utter speech that he knows to be untrue false pointless that is

190
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:54,640
disliked by others he doesn't utter speech that he knows to be true and correct but which would be harmful and

191
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:01,119
disliked and it goes on gives a very careful screening but what it I think

192
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:07,960
implies for us is that before we speak if we if our aspiration is

193
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,599
to be awake in the world um that before

194
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:19,720
we speak we should give thought to these things the Buddha gives this

195
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:26,280
complicated complicated uh carefully delineated screen for thinking about how

196
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:32,520
he might speak and can be simplified in the following way essentially uh the

197
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:41,040
Buddha says that if something is not of benefit to others we shouldn't speak

198
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,319
it if we can determine that something is of benefit then we should choose the

199
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:51,839
right time to express it and I love this I love the more

200
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:58,680
complicated screen but I love this two-part uh summary or two part essence

201
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:04,560
of it that because I can kind of quickly go is this a benefit I mean I can tell

202
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,480
in my own mind frequently this is not really this isn't going to serve anybody myself others it's not going to it's not

203
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:17,880
going to support a healthy relationship so I can I can abstain from

204
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:24,119
that that speech that would be harmful and similarly if this is speech

205
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:29,440
that this is something to be expressed that is a benefit to myself to others to

206
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:36,480
this relationship then I wait for the right time both of these things mean I end up

207
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:46,520
speaking less and uh in in my particular case to share something personal um as a

208
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:52,520
as a loquacious talkative person and as a man in our culture and Society

209
00:37:52,520 --> 00:38:00,119
somebody who comes forth as a man um it's very useful to speak less to to

210
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:05,480
because I found over time in the practice as I've been doing this that when I speak

211
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:11,240
less others speak more and I hear more I I I'm aware of other people's thoughts

212
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:18,599
more I already know what I think yeah um so saying it sometimes uh

213
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:24,440
you know isn't useful isn't of benefit

214
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:30,920
so uh the um the the story that I may mention

215
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:36,720
of it ends in a really funny way there's a lot of humor in these old sources uh

216
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,880
if you look for it the Buddha was a funny person could be um so the prince

217
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:49,200
asks the Buddha you know this is this is amazing this answer so do you as a Buddha as a fully awakened person do you

218
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:55,599
when somebody approaches you with a complicated question maybe a trick question do you have to think in advance about your answer or does it just occur

219
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:02,280
to you on the spot the Buddha says to the prince well let me ask you a question you're a prince

220
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:09,640
you're an expert in chariots a lot of princes were experts in chariots it's one of those princely things you AR

221
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:16,480
arrived places in a chariot and I I imagine in my mind the boota pointing at a part of the Chariot he says do you do

222
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:23,040
you know as an expert charioteer do you know what this part's called this one right here and the prince says of course

223
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:28,599
I know I'm an expert in chariots I I can I know what that part is I don't have to

224
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:35,800
think about it in advance I just know it on it comes to me on the spot and the Buddha says it's like that for me

225
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:42,240
somebody comes to me they ask me a complicated question I don't have to think very much about my response it

226
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,640
just comes to me on the spot and this is what we talked about

227
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:54,839
earlier this week beginning the first day just that as we become more practiced as we become more awake in

228
00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:01,079
this practice more awake in the world there's less and less care less and less

229
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:06,119
conscious thinking that goes into a response and more and more the response

230
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:13,079
comes naturally to us it becomes second nature to avoid harmful speech maybe to

231
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:19,079
be quieter and to engage in skillful speech so that's a theme that keeps

232
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:26,280
coming forward this week I didn't think about that in advance I'm just noting that this is a this is something

233
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:33,560
that comes to us through the the precepts that we cultivate them by abstaining from harmful practices and

234
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:38,680
what becomes more and more second nature to us is responding skillfully to

235
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:45,119
situations so this is this is how abstaining from doing harm helps us be

236
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,400
forces for good in the world in this practice so it's a very

237
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,520
it's a very powerful training this and supportive of our practice and then

238
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:03,200
supportive of the way we we expr our practice in the world particularly in interactions with with other

239
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:10,839
beings so yeah over time as we become really

240
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:16,960
awake we become as I said on the first day we become unable right like the

241
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:24,319
Buddha the Buddha is unable to engage in harmful speak because he's a person who's fully awake that's our aspiration

242
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:31,359
that as we become more awake we become more and are just unable to take life

243
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:37,480
to um take things not freely given to engage in sexual activity that's not

244
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:44,079
that's um harmful or in this case to engage in harmful

245
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:52,400
speech so what might this mean for a daily practice I'm going to I'm going to both

246
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,800
talk and put something in the chat and I don't know if I can do these two things at

247
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:04,640
once um but I like a practice I didn't make it

248
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:12,720
up I'm going to tell you about it and then I'm going to push send into the chat but this is a practice um that's

249
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:17,839
called by the acronym weight w a i t

250
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:25,559
weight and what it means or what it stands for w a i t i t w AIT T and now

251
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:35,520
I'm pushing to p it into the chat it stands for why am I talking W AIT t wait

252
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:44,200
why am I talking I find this a super useful way to take this uh precept into the world

253
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:51,520
to keep waiting before I respond and even waiting before I engage

254
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,599
in the practice so common that I'm thinking about how I'm going to respond and the other person hasn't even

255
00:42:56,599 --> 00:43:03,240
finished talking talking yet I'm not listening because I'm already thinking about how I am going to have a better

256
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:10,720
response get my opinion into the world speak my truth any number of things that seem really important to me me

257
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,960
me uh and if I can remember this

258
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,599
prescription against unhelpful and harmful speech I

259
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:29,240
wait and I like to ask why am I talking or why do do I feel an urge to talk a

260
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:34,599
need to talk a need to say something a question that I particularly

261
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:40,079
enjoy in my practice with this is maybe something needs to be said here

262
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:46,880
but is it I who need to say it right sometimes somebody else might

263
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:54,680
say it possibly they'd say it better possibly they need an opportunity to speak maybe I don't have to say this

264
00:43:54,680 --> 00:44:02,920
very few ideas that I have maybe I'm different from others here but very few ideas are original and uh I don't always

265
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:08,720
have to be the person who expresses something at any rate uh maybe that's

266
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:15,440
something that will be useful to take into the day wait wait without going

267
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:23,119
through the complicated screen that the Buddha provides for wise speech some of which may be familiar to some of you

268
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:30,359
simply pausing before we speak and maybe if it's helpful think is this of benefit

269
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:36,280
what I want to say and if it is of benefit is this the time to say it is

270
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:43,359
this the best time the most appropriate time the most skillful time I think what the Buddha does with

271
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:53,839
these suggestions is ask us to slow down with this action right that seems so

272
00:44:53,839 --> 00:45:02,280
automatic um so so easy easily engaged in to slow down and you may also look

273
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:07,880
around and um think about

274
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:14,480
uh I'm distracted by something in the chat um may want to look around and think

275
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,880
about um okay I lost that thought I got distracted somebody has pointed out that

276
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:25,200
uh silent is an anagram for listen okay there's probably hundreds of

277
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,720
these tricks I love them they're great so that's another one listen listen I

278
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:38,240
think that's another place that weight goes and I appreciate the distracting uh chat very nice very very nice to have

279
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,720
added that to our to our conversation okay so think about these

280
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:50,599
things tomorrow we'll return and take up the last uh of the five precepts the last five of the five lay precepts that

281
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:58,280
are undertaken commonly by householders and lay practitioners in this practice that of avoiding what did I call it

282
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:03,640
intoxicated heedlessness um this is a prescription

283
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:11,119
to avoid using technically in the language that that it comes to us fermented drinks distilled drinks or

284
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:17,680
other sub substances that cause heedlessness or to the point of heedlessness we'll look into that uh

285
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:23,680
tomorrow and uh I look forward to that it's a perfect topic for Friday night

286
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:30,079
it's a perfect topic for a Friday but it'll bring the week to another nice clothes I wish you all well take care

287
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:35,599
till tomorrow and I'm going to sign off now and read through the various things

288
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:43,200
that have been shared in the chat very much appreciate your sharing and supporting one another's practice and

289
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,520
see you tomorrow

290
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:59,880
bye for
