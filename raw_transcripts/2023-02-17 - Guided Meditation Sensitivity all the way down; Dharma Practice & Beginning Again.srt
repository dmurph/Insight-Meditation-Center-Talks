1
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:13,259
so welcome uh welcome folks nice to uh nice to be with you nice to see all the

2
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:19,039
uh the well wishes and chats and um

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,400
yeah okay we'll do what we do

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,460
and uh settle in

5
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:45,740
so the Jitter heart mind

6
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,640
that which gets liberated this path

7
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,920
not exactly sure what chitta is

8
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,599
but uh

9
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:34,140
ajin sajita says uh characterized chitta heart mind as a

10
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:41,400
primarily a receptivity system

11
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,000
so we make ourselves porous

12
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:57,860
rather than coming to conclusions about life about ourselves

13
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:08,220
let me sit poised in receptivity

14
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:23,060
compassion is said to be the quivering of the heart

15
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,979
but in a sense our whole being is always quivering

16
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:50,600
always being touched by phenomena

17
00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:00,860
the relentlessness samsara

18
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,360
when we sit here deeply embodied

19
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:54,440
our skin sensitive to

20
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,220
everything

21
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,978
our heart sensitive to everything

22
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:56,720
our affect emotion feeling

23
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,440
signals various urgencies

24
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:20,120
the urge to fiddle with samsara

25
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,519
sometimes there's wisdom in it

26
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:42,000
but for right now we treat everything as a kind of false

27
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,120
alarm

28
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:59,360
thing poised in receptivity

29
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,720
which is another way of saying

30
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:19,040
we're not Landing in conclusions

31
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,380
about ourselves about life

32
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:41,540
or poised in receptivity

33
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:08,100
is writing the intensity of embodiment intensity

34
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:11,959
of this human Realm

35
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:20,420
intensity of time

36
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,880
of Pleasure and Pain

37
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:39,259
um it's the intensity of The Human Condition your porousness

38
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:51,380
almost can feel like we we have to brace against the world

39
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:59,639
and the way one braces so as to minimize the pain in a certain

40
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:02,720
part of our body

41
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,100
or injured maybe we brace

42
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:17,600
trying to quarantine the pain

43
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:28,280
in a deeper way we brace

44
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:36,200
so as to protect sense of self

45
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,660
the Matthew within Matthew needs protection from all this

46
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:57,440
receptivity

47
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,480
but it's just sensitivity all the way down

48
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:50,899
the opening

49
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,620
the skin Quivers the heart Quivers

50
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,820
no more fake urgencies

51
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,539
no more protection

52
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,320
safety in the openness

53
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:46,559
in our race activity where we're not trying to go

54
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,000
anywhere to get anywhere

55
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:56,179
become anything

56
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,500
the goodness is already here

57
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,720
we can feel that

58
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:46,460
when there's just a kind of faith the logic of the Dharma

59
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,720
foreign

60
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,299
okay

61
00:30:53,399 --> 00:31:00,320
okay so um

62
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:14,399
or Surrender uh humor playfulness grieving

63
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:21,840
and now five days in the week uh final factor in this uh

64
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,140
made up made up list and um

65
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:32,700
I needed needed in my mind needed

66
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:40,039
a factor that acknowledges the the iterative

67
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:52,440
the iterative nature of the path uh

68
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:59,880
that that are understanding of of what we're doing of what the Dharma is is

69
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:05,580
continually updated and

70
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:10,980
we get comfortable there are phases these kind of alternating phases of

71
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:17,520
getting comfortable within a certain View of the Dharma and then

72
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:26,220
some the rug being pulled out and too much comfort for too long

73
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:33,919
is stagnation and so there's the the iterative nature of Dharma

74
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:40,440
I wanted to emphasize the way that the way that a Dharma life is a kind of

75
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:46,260
continuous feedback loop giving seething

76
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:53,000
growing giving receiving

77
00:32:54,659 --> 00:33:00,360
and I felt like I needed a factor that acknowledges

78
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,460
the permanent possibility of being wrong

79
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:11,480
a possibility that there will never be dispelled really

80
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:17,880
and so today beginning again

81
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:25,460
yeah on this path we're going to have to to begin again

82
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,679
it's not it's not a kind of linear path

83
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,679
of of practice progress practice progress practice progress

84
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,080
and if we can't begin again on the path

85
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:49,860
uh practice can become uh humiliated and

86
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:57,299
maybe we stop all together because there are there are plateaus and

87
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:03,840
descents and times when we're super inspired and the Dharma feels so fresh and alive

88
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,878
and times when we have zero motivation

89
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,480
and so we learn we learn to begin again

90
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:19,980
at uh the micro level

91
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:25,260
We Begin Again when we're attending to the breathing or whatever and notice

92
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:31,638
that we're encased in fantasy let me Begin Again

93
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:37,980
and at the macro level

94
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:44,099
um the level of our life sometimes

95
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:49,519
our past maybe is just

96
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:57,599
too messy to sort it all out the day was too messy to sort it all out

97
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,359
We Begin Again sometimes

98
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:10,220
our family history is too messy to sort all out

99
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:18,780
we Begin Again Redeeming the pain or the prior

100
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:26,660
generation and in our lives

101
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:33,260
how easy it is to forget the dumb

102
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:40,079
to become in one way or another alienated from our wisdom and from our

103
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:46,619
love so it's it's meaningful to me that that

104
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:52,020
Sati uh mindful translator renders mindfulness

105
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:57,920
um has connotations of of memory of memory

106
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:05,960
we We Begin Again when we remember the Dharma

107
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:17,400
in my suffering there's a kind of

108
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:23,640
sense of it being a kind of of forgetting

109
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:30,960
in the the dream the the you know said life is kind of

110
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:40,460
dreamlike yeah but um suffering definitely feels dreamlike

111
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:50,700
something uh about the dharmas Forgotten utterly forgotten in our

112
00:36:50,700 --> 00:37:00,320
sorrow and despair and we remember we begin again

113
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:07,380
of course we we make uh messes the kind of

114
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:13,160
the debris of greed hate delusion

115
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:19,320
and sometimes our messes were embarrassed embarrassed by the messes we

116
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:25,140
make and uh

117
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:31,560
it can be humbling but um we just Begin Again

118
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:38,280
and guilt in a way is just a kind of overestimate of the wisdom we had at the

119
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,440
time course we made a mess

120
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,500
of course how could it have been otherwise

121
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:52,579
of course they made a mess

122
00:37:54,300 --> 00:38:00,060
and we learn the the kind of lesson of

123
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:07,140
the the defilements we learn the lessons as deeply as we can

124
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:15,320
and then we completely forgive ourselves and begin again

125
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:25,079
We Begin Again within relationships within the various relationships of of

126
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:32,460
our life that sometimes there's a dense tangle or a Discord or conflict

127
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:38,040
or a seemingly irreconcilable kind of

128
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:45,420
pain of one kind or another and there can be

129
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:52,859
this tendency to want to tie up all the Loose Ends to iron everything out

130
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:59,720
and sometimes that can be done sometimes that's appropriate sometimes it's it's

131
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:07,200
utterly vital to talk things through to come to some kind of Dayton some kind of

132
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,140
resolution but sometimes the Loose Ends won't be

133
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:20,960
tied up and we just let them lie And We Begin Again

134
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:31,920
Norman Norman Fisher said it's hard being a human being there's a lot to it

135
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:40,079
it really is so I want to say in conclusion let's all agree to accept the reality

136
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:47,820
that we're not going to be able to do a very good job at this there's too much to do isn't it a relief

137
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:54,960
to know it's not gonna work out and you can just forget about that to

138
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:02,160
start with so you're not going to get it right you're not going to get it perfect well don't worry just remember there's

139
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:09,480
no hope but the important thing is the important thing is despite this and

140
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,420
recognizing and embracing this reality don't worry about finishing the job or

141
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:20,640
doing it perfectly but start you see

142
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,800
start and continue this is the thing

143
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:31,619
you can really trust that if you will start and if you will continue with commitment

144
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:36,319
that will be enough that will be enough

145
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:46,800
our our intentions uh for practice

146
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:54,480
they change over time we have to begin again sometimes we achieve or we outgrow what

147
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,760
brought us to the path we came here to

148
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:07,020
manage anxiety or came here to and for some circumscribed

149
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:12,119
kind of it reason and now okay I feel better

150
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:20,099
what's practiced now let's practice now we have to find new sources of of

151
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:27,440
motivation We Begin Again with new intentions for practice

152
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:36,540
and sometimes sometimes we We Leave Behind things as we begin our

153
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:42,060
practice We Leave Behind pieces of ourselves pieces of our history things

154
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:47,420
that were meaningful the ways

155
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:54,480
we used to play or read or pray

156
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:01,380
we leave these things behind but practice has this weird way of

157
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:09,300
looping back to Old currents in our life things that were meaningful

158
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:16,500
that we've put down and then we pick them up but in a new

159
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:25,820
way we we begin again with Old loves

160
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:42,859
begin again at the macro level We Begin Again in each moment

161
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:50,760
so uh offer this for your your consideration and uh

162
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,820
