1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:12,000
so follow up a little bit on that announcement about the threshold choir it's a beautiful um group of people who

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,560
go and sing songs to people who are dying and

3
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:24,279
so they're kind of a service they provide to different places and and so the songs are quite moving and soaring

4
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:31,400
and peaceful and kind of appropriate for that time transition in life and it's um

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:37,519
also quite nice when we don't think we're in that

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,480
transition so

7
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:05,799
um I think uh people often come to to meditation to be changed in some way

8
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,360
there's something going on in their life in themselves often in Buddhism called

9
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,680
suffering that um something which is difficult and they somehow see that

10
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,840
meditation can change them change something so that there's not so

11
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:29,439
much discomfort or difficulty or stress or suffering that they live with some

12
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:35,880
people come with the idea that there's a cause for suffering and so you have to get the insight to be able to see deeply

13
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,720
in and find that cause and pluck it out and then live happier happly ever

14
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,360
after some people have the idea that um there's some kind of way of touching

15
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,719
into a some wonderful State a wonderful state of calm or peace

16
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:00,320
wonderful state of not self wonderful state of non-duality nonpar oparation

17
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,520
that's some place to go and and then

18
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,800
sometimes people drop into some wonderful State and they think I have it

19
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:20,760
made and um yeah maybe for that moment and then life comes comes in and

20
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,959
they leave The Retreat Center or Leave The Meditation Center and they find that they have two flat tires in their car

21
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:31,720
when they're when they go out and whatever that great state was is like they've even forgot about it does they

22
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:38,440
try to like what two I mean I have places to go important things to do and and I was dwelling in all this peace and

23
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,720
calm I have an important calm to experience I better you know get this

24
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:50,800
fixed right away and you know anyway so these states they come and they

25
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:57,519
go and um so there's another approach to what meditation can do rather than

26
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:07,599
changing us or changing some aspect ECT of fixing something inside what it does is to expand our

27
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,760
capacity to be uncomfortable now we don't advertise

28
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:23,159
this come to IMC and learn how to be more uncomfortable than

29
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,560
you but in fact this is actually an important part of it if you want if you want the meditation to be realistic

30
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,760
if you want to be a practice that supports you in all the different facets of your

31
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,560
life and um the um because life will change life will have challenges you

32
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,360
never know what's going to come the um this is one of the wonderful

33
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,319
or very significant teachers in kind of in the 20th century for many people here

34
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:00,239
in the west America was um man named ramdas

35
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:07,799
and he went around uh teaching spiritual practices and spirituality and practicing himself for decades and then

36
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,040
nearby here he had a um stroke I think he was in one of the local hospitals

37
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,519
here afterwards for that and uh and he said that when he had a stroke he was

38
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:27,639
kind of dis discouraged because his practice no longer worked so how what was going to support him then

39
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:33,000
so so to find something thing which we can rely on and one of the things we can

40
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,960
rely on is increasing our capacity in modern psychology sometimes they call this uh increasing the window of

41
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,520
Tolerance that uh we can tolerate more and so part of what mindfulness is

42
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,240
is increasing that window of tolerance so that we're less troubled or disturbed

43
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:00,600
or stressed by what happens we not less we're less overwhelmed we're developing our capacity to hold increased degrees

44
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:08,080
of challenges so that if we get sick if we have an accident if some tragedy happens

45
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,880
in our life not to take away the idea that it's unfortunate not take away the idea it's

46
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:23,000
a tragedy or loss and things like that but to not be pushed around by it or entangled with

47
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,240
it or limited by it but to be able to have a wide capacity and open heart and

48
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:36,680
open mind that has space for it that can hold it so we can have a chance for for

49
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,759
wisdom I have a chance to see clearly we have a chance to kind of relate to it in a different

50
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:49,280
way and um and so part of what we're doing in meditation practice is in fact

51
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,440
learning to be uncomfortable learning to be comfortable with

52
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,120
discomfort now don't go make yourself uncomfortable so you can learn this lesson

53
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,560
when I was a a Zen monk I noticed that if I had pain while I meditated I could

54
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:13,800
get more concentrated and so I went to the Abbot and said I noticed this now should I sit

55
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:21,960
in full Lotus so that I could have more pain and he said

56
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:32,560
no don't don't look for pain don't make pain but when pain visits you when it

57
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,639
comes then sit with it some then practice with it but don't you know rely

58
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,919
on pain for your concentration or for anything so don't go look for to be uncomfortable when you meditate it's

59
00:06:44,919 --> 00:06:50,319
actually wise to kind of make yourself as comfortable as you can when you're going to meditate within reason

60
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:57,280
comfortable and alert but sooner or later uh you'll be

61
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,800
uncomfortable and for many of us it sooner rather than later the body gets uncomfortable

62
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:09,800
especially if you're a new meditator um you know you're uncomfortable with how much rumination

63
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:17,280
your mind is making how much you're caught up in spinning stories and ideas and plans how much you're still caring

64
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,599
resentments and challenges and um and um and so when

65
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:30,240
those things are there the idea in meditation and mindfulness meditation is not to see them as problems

66
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,599
not to see them as wrong or you're not meditating properly but to see with have

67
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:42,199
the idea okay this too I have to learn to open up to this

68
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:48,400
too I have to make space for how can I expand my window of tolerance so that I

69
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,080
can allow this to be here without being caught in it without being reactive to

70
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:02,319
it and so that's kind of an exploration like what what does it mean to give breathing room to our mind to our hearts

71
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:09,639
to our feelings what does it mean to make space for it and then stay present

72
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:15,919
for it stay with it without reacting to it

73
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,000
and the the image that I love for mindfulness practice that what we're

74
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:28,919
doing is we're cupping our hands together like this so the two hands are making a cup kind of and then uh they

75
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:34,159
they come underneath and hold whatever is happening for us whatever is

76
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:42,919
happening whatever challenge we're having we're just holding it and um and it's a little bit like um

77
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:50,240
uh you know if uh if um I'm troubled by the world and

78
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:56,920
you know I'm kind of trying to resist it all and the resisting of it all starts to be tiring but I have to resist the

79
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:03,720
world right I can't stop because the world's going to do something terrible to me and I'm afraid to kind of let go

80
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,279
and then I think I'm supposed to meditate and so I go there with you know go and meditate and try to deal with

81
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:15,760
these hands these fingers try to relax and all that but nothing really works but what does it mean to come underneath

82
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,839
and hold it what it means is something like discovering what's

83
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:28,720
deeper and then come and hold that so it can rest and if the elbow can rest then

84
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,920
the hand can rest but as long as the elbow is uncomfortable being like this it's kind of trying with its hand to

85
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,480
find an answer to something so to begin to one way we find

86
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,640
our capacity to hold things is to really be present and find what it is that

87
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,480
needs to be held in the field in the in the lap of awareness hold it just let it

88
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,680
be there and um and then to be able to have

89
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:05,399
more and more more capacity to be uncomfortable I was uh told something

90
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:14,920
disturbing this week and um and I heard it and um I thought to myself wow this

91
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:20,519
is quite something I think Gil this is the time

92
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,880
to just make space for it uh I've been in situation like this

93
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:32,839
before where I react where I took it person personally where I felt like I had to do something immediately send off

94
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:38,240
emails or you know whatever and no I don't think so I think this is the time

95
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,880
just to let it be not to ignore it but to make space for it and let it be and

96
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:51,920
see what happens let's just kind of hold it and I'll address it when the right time comes rather than rush to put out

97
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,000
the fire that was no fire it was just kind of it was just kind of a difficult

98
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,920
statement someone made and that made it so much easier to go through this that I had the capacity the

99
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:12,160
willingness to just be uncomfortable with it make space for it breathe with it not not not kind of react to it

100
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,959
immediately and fully so to increase our

101
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,519
capacity so I want to give you uh provide a um imag that comes from the

102
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:30,880
Chinese Buddhist tradition the Chan tradition in China that has all kind of wonderful

103
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:38,360
implications and um and hopefully use it as an example of what I'm talking about

104
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:44,000
and um apparently there was uh like a wizard in

105
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,680
town who uh had the ability to read people's minds and so he was kind of you

106
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,240
know kind of impressed people by his ability and and so there was a Zen student who

107
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:06,320
said well I don't think you can read my zen Master's mind I can read anybody's mind so the

108
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:13,079
Zen master was out for a walk on in town one day and there was a river running through the middle of the town and uh

109
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:20,000
and this and may imagine kind of the most idic river through an idic town in

110
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,320
the springtime or something really nice blue sky and just really nice and

111
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:32,040
there's this nice River and there's a prominade or something along the river and um and in the river there's a few

112
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,120
sailboats that maybe little cargo boats with sails that are gently moving across

113
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:42,320
back and forth across the river or down the river it's kind of idic and peaceful

114
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:49,519
setting and so those end Masters walking down this prominade and looking at the river and the boats and just out out for

115
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,720
a little walk and um that he runs into the

116
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:01,680
wizard and The Wizard uh now stops that stops in front of him and like like

117
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,560
maybe I don't know what Wizards do it pears into his eyes or you know in order to read his

118
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:13,560
mind and after a short while the wizard got very

119
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:18,720
disturbed and spun around and R away and left that town never came

120
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,199
back but someone stopped him before he actually left and said what's where you going what

121
00:13:25,199 --> 00:13:34,399
happened well I I looked into the Zen Master's mind and all I saw was the river and

122
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:43,160
some sailboat sailing in it is that what his Zen mastered mind is

123
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:48,959
like and um and how I understand this story is that he was reading the Zen

124
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,240
Master's mind in a sense but there was nothing about the Zen master to be

125
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,079
seen it was just the Zen master was just there present for the environment around him seeing the river and the boats and

126
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:07,000
that's what was in his mind because that what was happening in the moment but there wasn't any like wanting to be on

127
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,240
the boat or you know thinking that you know I should have been a captain boat captain rather than a zen

128
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:20,320
master I must have chosen the wrong job and or you know you know I have to give

129
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,759
a Dharma talk and I should be thinking about that Dharma talk and worrying about what I'm going to say and you know

130
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:36,600
he was just kind of walking down and taking in the moment for that and um and uh a similar idea to

131
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,240
this is uh goes back to the ancient Buddhist tradition the ancient text

132
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,079
there there they have not a wizard but they have this idea of Mara Mara is the

133
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:54,680
personification of everything that'll tempt you to be caught in the world of

134
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:59,920
the senses so whatever you know sense pleasure whatever ever kind of

135
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:08,560
absorption in with you know the whole world of sensual pleasure just imagine the ideal world would be a casino with

136
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,839
naked dancers and every drug and alcohol possible and you just kind of would be

137
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,000
wonderful [Laughter]

138
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,800
right so that's Mara's world and so so Mara is trying to and last thing Mara

139
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,839
wants is someone to get enlightened because then they're not going to go to the casino you know they're going to you

140
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:36,399
not going to get caught in that realm and so um so this ancient world

141
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:44,000
this this personification of Temptation um U when it when uh when the

142
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,000
mara looks into the mind of someone who's awakened they don't see

143
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,279
anything because what defines someone what for Mara is their attachments is

144
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:03,000
their clinging so whatever you're caught in that's kind of what you become in

145
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,399
Mara's eyes and then Mara can get you but if you're not defined by your

146
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,720
attachments because you have no attachments then there's nothing that defines you there's nothing to H hold on

147
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,920
to there's nothing to grab a hold of that Mara can kind of convince you to

148
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:24,120
you know to get caught so both of these examples are

149
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,279
examples of Minds that have great capacity because they're not getting

150
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:36,079
attached to anything they're not holding on to anything and that's what limits the mind that's what contracts it and

151
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,880
makes it small and some of us can feel that if you have a busy day running around doing

152
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:48,120
lots and lots of things and even multitasking and and um and just kind of

153
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,480
doing doing doing the you can feel like the mind gets very small and tight and

154
00:16:53,480 --> 00:17:00,000
stressed and and it's kind of like you know claustrophobic in there and by the time you stop sometimes I've SE I've

155
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,160
noticed sometimes after doing a lot even like sometimes cleaning my house a lot just going to do cleaning cleaning

156
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:12,640
cleaning cleaning that I finish kind of do you ever finish you I finish kind of and I could

157
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,558
see my mind is still reaching out for something to do I don't know what it is I don't know what I'm I'm not supposed

158
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:27,079
to do anything but but the mind is still looking for something right it's a caught and um so careful be careful

159
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:33,799
because Mara can read you now can see you knows exactly what you're about you're you're that wanting wanting and

160
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:39,720
so that's the ideal situation where you want but you don't know what you want Mara will come

161
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:46,960
with all the Temptations and so um so this pass this

162
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:54,559
ability to let the mind be a open wide field a open space like this River with

163
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:02,000
the boats kind of great great sky and everything like makes space for everything make space for something

164
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,440
rather than fix it make space for something rather than changing it and

165
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,159
make space for something rather than defining Yourself by it and that's one of the Temptations

166
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:21,159
that Mar as a personification of ourselves where we're tempted to Define ourselves by our attachments by our

167
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:28,840
desires by what we want what we don't want um our opinions about these things becomes Who We Are

168
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,880
and so rather than doing that the the the IM the imagery the kind of

169
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:40,280
alternative is this idea of make room make room in Awareness make room in

170
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:46,880
the mind make room in the heart we can hold this and one of the reasons why this is

171
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,080
so useful is that any room and space we can

172
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,640
make to hold ourselves and what goes on within us translates or inter as as also

173
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:03,000
a capacity to hold the suffering of the world the difficulty around us of our

174
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,280
friends or family our communities the world itself and I think this is a great gift

175
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,960
that we give to not be not be not drowned in the suffering

176
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:22,679
around us not be distressed by it not be afraid of it or angry by it but have the

177
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:29,640
capacity to open wide to hold it all so in a sense the suffering of the world is

178
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:35,480
the sailboats on the river not to diminish the suffering not

179
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:42,440
to ignore it or make it some kind of polanish kind of thing rivers on the you know boats on the river but rather to be

180
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,600
able to see it clearly so that then we can respond

181
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:55,200
appropriately in a good way and we see lots of things and that's

182
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,799
things that are very Troublesome in this world and things that hopefully we will respond

183
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,840
to um you know what you know what do you do

184
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:13,080
if you witness an act of racism do you react to it and close down

185
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:19,320
do you get angry do you get afraid do you say it's none of my business I saw one right down the street

186
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:27,159
here by the high school someone yelled out of a car a

187
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,679
racial um kind of terrible thing to someone walking down the

188
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:40,600
sidewalk what do we do when this Happ these kinds of things happen can we open our

189
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:46,320
capacity not only to hold it and be aware of it without reacting but also

190
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:54,400
even more better is to allow the welling up of an appropriate

191
00:20:55,320 --> 00:21:02,520
response that too can arise as space for that and when we have the capacity to be

192
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:07,799
uncomfortable that also translates to our capacity to act when it's

193
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:13,679
uncomfortable to act oh this is difficult one of the one

194
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:21,120
of the things I've learned I feel through this Buddhist practice is to

195
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,720
um I think I think the expression is counterphobic so I've learned to when

196
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:36,400
I'm a afraid of something to turn towards it okay what what's this what's this and

197
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,799
um I was with someone recently and I told her that I this is something I've learned to do in this practice of mine

198
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:47,960
is step towards things which are uncomfortable a little bit frightening and so I told her we were

199
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:56,000
walking we're in a little walk together and I said um scare [Laughter]

200
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,760
me and um and she um she used to be an actor actress so I guess she has some

201
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:08,480
capacity to so she took it on so she kind of suddenly kind of

202
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,640
roared at me it I was I was slightly surprised how quick she she respond how

203
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:20,080
quick she did it and and strongly she did it but sure enough because I knew I knew what was

204
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,159
coming kind of sure I just turn towards her and step closer like this like you

205
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,000
know I got within a foot of her or something and boy was she

206
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:36,639
surprised she was like she like she's the one who got it

207
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:43,039
sprayed so this you know to be able to to to be willing to be so to be

208
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:48,400
uncomfortable to be willing to have capacity allows us sometimes to do

209
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:57,400
things in the world that to help in situations that are difficult or uncomfortable it's not a drag to develop

210
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,600
greater tolerance for discomfort it allows us to take care of the world much

211
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:12,159
better I can't tell you how much I learned about being uncomfortable being a parent of young

212
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,450
children that's a great training okay this

213
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:22,679
[Laughter] too and the one of the representatives

214
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:28,520
representative kind of high points of that kind of learning to be uncomfortable with discomfort

215
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:35,159
maybe you want to cover your ears or something but was um when I did this thing I cuffed my hands right like just

216
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:41,880
hold hold everything in your mindfulness like cuffed hands my son my little son when he was a

217
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:47,679
a toddler or something maybe younger than that even um I kind of quickly put my hands

218
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,200
in front of him like this um to to catch his

219
00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:01,600
vomit and it was just an act of love love you know like of course you

220
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:07,120
know if ID said this if I'd heard this idea before I had kids I would have thought

221
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,640
yuck I'm sure some of you did hearing it sorry about that but you know oh this

222
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,679
too there this this window of tolerance to hold in big space and to be with

223
00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:23,760
what's here such a powerful skill one of the ways we learn this in

224
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,880
this mindfulness practice is not to do it automatically it's kind of the ideal is

225
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:35,440
to have the ability to make space and be uncomfortable to have a great capacity for

226
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,679
whatever um it's the ideal but one one of the principles we have in this

227
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:47,799
practice is don't go directly for the ideal rather study what gets in the way

228
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:55,919
of the ideal so that means study how you are uncomfortable with discomfort study what

229
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:02,640
the reactivity you have is the beliefs you have the notice study of what you do with your body rather than stepping

230
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:08,720
towards something you shut down and you pull away even with your posture study

231
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,919
what you how you are when things are difficult get to know it well it's by

232
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:20,399
understanding yourself and your reactions and all that that wisdom and capacity

233
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:26,799
grows because if you go directly to the ideal I'm supposed to just kind of be now counterphobic and open up to

234
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:32,960
everything uh you might actually be doing yourself a disservice you might not have the

235
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,799
capacity and also the the the Tendencies to be reactive are still there Lodge

236
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:46,279
deep inside and ready to come out and you can sometimes cause more harm to yourself and others if you kind of in a

237
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:51,440
naive way make yourself open and available kind of vulnerable in a sense

238
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,880
and you're not ready because the reactivity is there to kind of bite you come up and rear its head or do

239
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,919
something so we're very interested in this practice is how do we

240
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:10,120
react how do we get caught how do we push away how do we succumb to fear or

241
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:16,399
succumb to beliefs or judgments or about ourselves or others how do we limit

242
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:22,720
ourselves and as we study that that's what we hold in the palm of

243
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,080
mindfulness okay this is how it is for me what it's like just to let me with it

244
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,440
for a while let me be with my reactivity rather than thinking I'm not supposed to

245
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,799
be reactive let me be with my fear rather than believing supposed to be

246
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:44,760
afraid now Gil is counterop phobic I'm supposed to be counterop phobic no

247
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:50,039
you're supposed to be Pro

248
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:57,880
phobic in the sense of you know be with be it and hold it until you learn learn

249
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:03,440
something until something shifts in you something relaxes or something you start

250
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:10,559
understanding what's further deeper down like the elbow is that what really needs to be relaxed or you still or you simply

251
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:16,240
develop a capacity wow I am really afraid right now but

252
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:22,679
this is a new world I'm living in usually when I'm afraid I'm running around like a chicken Rel at its head

253
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:28,840
but look I'm just sitting here calmly meditating and I have all this fear coursing through my body and I had no

254
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,000
idea it was possible to sit calmly and have so much fear at the same time they

255
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,399
two can coexist maybe now I'm ready next time I'm afraid to not get

256
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:46,158
caught by the fear but rather make space for

257
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:53,559
it and I'll end with this story that I've told a few times

258
00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:01,000
now of a of a a person who was in a retreat many Retreats with me and had a

259
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,080
very very difficult time lot of suffering lot of like like you know just

260
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:12,240
just everything was challenging and I had the thought that I've

261
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,640
um that maybe a Dharma teacher should never have when someone sincerely

262
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,000
practicing and trying and keeps coming back and even though it's challenging I had the thought maybe I should tell this

263
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,200
person to stop practicing so but I did

264
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:35,640
and then 6 months later the person came to me and said remember that Retreat where I had such a hard time I said yes

265
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:41,000
I sure did and I didn't tell him what I was

266
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,799
thinking and then I said well that was such an important Retreat for me because

267
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:54,519
after that I had a lot of challenges in my life and I was

268
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:59,399
prepared I knew how to be I knew how to be with

269
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:07,760
challenges so I didn't see that coming I just thought the person was challenged and it wasn't like quit you know hitting

270
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:15,240
his head against the wall over and over again but in fact he was learning how to be with such difficulty uh in a way that

271
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,600
he could be with it when it really arose for him in his life he had the capacity

272
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:26,000
to to not have it not be there but make space for it and hold

273
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,880
it so um part of what we're doing here in this

274
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,320
practice is expanding our capacity to hold

275
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:44,080
discomfort and I would hope that we never think

276
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,640
that there's an end to that process because if we do then it's too

277
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:55,919
easy to believe I after we act here I have to be angry I have to somehow

278
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:04,080
attack or blame or do something but okay let's open let's open and then let's see

279
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:11,399
what wisdom arises in that capacity in that openness the last thing I want is this

280
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:17,039
kind of great capacity to be open to unvailable and be uncomfortable to mean

281
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:22,399
that we don't respond to the world that is not what we're looking for here but

282
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:27,840
the idea is to respond from that place

283
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:35,840
so that it's more effective it's maybe giving the world the gift

284
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:42,720
of space for people to be who they are so they can see and they can relax and

285
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,200
they can soften but if we react in response to other people's

286
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:54,640
reactivity maybe it just becomes more more worse and worse it doesn't help

287
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:00,360
anyone one of the great gifts we can give the world and others is to be a

288
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:06,320
safe person for them this is what the Buddha said he said he said make yourself safe for

289
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:13,480
others isn't that great so those are my thoughts

290
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:21,200
today and um so we do have this we have 15 minutes before the end maybe if some

291
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:27,320
of you would like to ask maybe it will take about five minutes for questions if anybody would like to ask anything or

292
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:33,278
any testimonials you have about developing greater

293
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:41,600
capacity Gil uh I'm curious about how you handled that situation nearby when

294
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,159
when someone yells a slur you know I didn't do anything which sounds pretty

295
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:53,360
bad but I was inside the high school and there was a big fence and so I heard

296
00:31:53,360 --> 00:32:00,480
this terrible thing being said and I didn't see who they were talking to I was like wow what was that and um and

297
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:07,080
the car car drove off and so I kind of kept walking along the high school until

298
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:12,919
I could see who it was that it was I I wanted to know who it was I because I felt that was important to know what was

299
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:18,399
this about but so maybe in retrospect I could could have gone found the person

300
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:23,519
that it was the yelling was done to and done something supportive or something I

301
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:32,320
don't know what I could have done but because of the distance in the big fence and all that that I didn't do anything but it it it

302
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:39,120
really have had a big impact on me and like right here in our neighborhood just like there was this uh

303
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:45,840
I was a little bit stunned last week to read about the police officer in San

304
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,240
Jose who was laid off because of his racist texts you know right here this

305
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:59,120
like feels like this is right in our neighborhood and so this is something we have to kind of you know care

306
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,120
about

307
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:12,480
yes uh Gil I have a question somewhat weird question but nonetheless it's a

308
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,279
genuine question so my dad has been diagnosed with uh metastatic prostate

309
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:24,760
cancer like week and a half ago so it's been difficult so as you know I've taken

310
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:31,039
Chaplan C Core so I and I've been to two maranasati

311
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:39,240
Retreats even before that so I had an opportunity um to relate to this part of

312
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:45,120
life that normally people don't give themselves an opportunity too so my

313
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:53,120
particular challenge right now is um when I'm talking for instance to my

314
00:33:53,120 --> 00:34:01,000
husband uh about what's happening to my dad is that um in that discourse I also

315
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:09,839
include you know and his 5 years survival rate is 33% but it's uh being taken by my

316
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:17,440
husband that I'm being pessimistic I'm not again it's taken by your husband uh as being pessimistic

317
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,000
uhhuh or overly negative but I'm not there is just

318
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:30,240
certain big data that points that that's the case is and this is one of the

319
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:36,599
things that um are happening and one of my reactions

320
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:42,760
so right now I'm stuck in the polarity with my husband that he's like oh yeah let's be optimistic you're too

321
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:50,000
pessimistic but I'm not and I understand that with a

322
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:57,200
Buddhist with great amount of respect we weird bunch in how we relate to things like

323
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,680
like I get that so I don't know

324
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:09,320
um just what to do about that because it adds extra level of

325
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,400
misunderstanding extra what extra level of misunder understanding because it's

326
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,560
not optimistic versus pessimistic like like I'm not being pessimistic but by acknowledging that this is realistic

327
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:27,200
prognosis I'm really not so my question is how to handle fam

328
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:32,330
relationships when our Buddhist discourse is being

329
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:37,720
[Music] misunderstood well I don't know what to

330
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:43,359
say but uh was you know it's fascinating my my my uh I'm getting poor hearing

331
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:49,359
right and I don't have my hearing aids in so I heard almost everything you said but I misunderstood one word when there

332
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:57,079
was some degree of misunderstanding you said the first time you said it I I I thought you were saying um uh uh a

333
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:02,960
higher degree of me me misunderstanding you know you know no no you didn't say

334
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:09,480
that but uh but oh there's too much me here yeah and I thought maybe that's a

335
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:16,400
clue that um and since you did the chapy training maybe your job is to be

336
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,599
everyone's chaplain oh I know that that's

337
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:28,319
did I know it's not the novel s like totally because I'm like okay my husband

338
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:36,000
cannot take care of me maybe I can take care of my husband like I totally get that but uh sure I mean because it's my

339
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:45,040
dad it's not my husband that's that's fine uh but so so you want someone to take care of you no no no no I don't

340
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:50,880
want a fictional problem to be there because the fictional problem that it's

341
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,440
not really there that it is in my husband mind that he's optimistic and

342
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:04,079
I'm pessimistic I'm not pessimistic I'm just acknowledging different realities around

343
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:11,440
my husbands uh around my dad's cancer and like and like

344
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:17,680
I don't feel the need to recoil at Green

345
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:24,640
prognosis but that does not mean that I'm being pessimistic so I just like to like so the question is why do you care

346
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,560
so much what your husband believes ah I care so much about my husband's beliefs

347
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:40,040
well first of all because I love my husband very very dearly he's a phenomenal being but but aside from that

348
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:47,000
um the times when my dad is diagnosed and he will start treatment soon is a

349
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,760
time of great stress for the entire family for obuse reasons so because

350
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:58,400
there is this important misunderstanding it creates conflict and

351
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,839
it creates difficulty talking about my dad's cancer that is affecting

352
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:11,480
everybody in the family yeah so so if your husband is accurate his assessment

353
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:18,400
of you then you have one issue if he's not accurate which you're saying then one possibility is

354
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:24,440
to is um is to agree to disagree another

355
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:31,119
possibility is to say I'm neither pessimistic or optimistic I'm just trying to take it

356
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:38,119
take into account all the possibilities so we can be ready for whatever happens and if that's if you think that's

357
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:44,920
pessimistic then let's just agree to disagree I think that's what we end up doing but I was just you know because I

358
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:51,400
respect your opinion so highly and I know you have so much experience I was just like wondering if there is a

359
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:58,480
particular angle that we're missing because what we end up doing is a is a great much respect for me then I'll then

360
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:05,800
then then I'll kind of air on the side of my [Laughter]

361
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:12,720
preference and that is um you know

362
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:18,640
uh taking care of yourself and how you are so important for this and be have

363
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:24,000
have a capacity to relax and accept yourself as you are and all this and by

364
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,520
doing that also maybe your husb hband needs some care as well sometimes when people want to be

365
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:36,280
too optimistic around like that something like this it means that they're afraid exactly yeah and so you

366
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:42,720
don't you know him better than most people so it might not be the case but uh but you know no it is the case very

367
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,680
much so then so then as the as the family

368
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,440
chaplain all right okay I got it and in a family you have to be a stealth

369
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:00,119
chaplain you because you you don't want to kind of show show up and Qui okay sit down I'm going to be your chaplain you

370
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:06,520
you want to just you know what's his fear what what kind of reassurances he need what kind of presence does he need

371
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:14,319
and if he gets that then maybe it's easier for him to accept and understand your your position thanks so much I hope

372
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:20,720
that was okay thank you yeah we're the one way you come and talk to me afterwards because what I'd like to do

373
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,760
because there's a tea time today I would love it if you would all of you you don't have to if you don't want to but

374
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:33,119
um just turn to someone near you maybe you know one or two people near you look around so no one's left alone and just

375
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,160
say hello and if this idea of kind of increasing your capacity is evocative of

376
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:43,680
something for you interesting for you what what did devoke and then just doesn't have to be more than a couple of

377
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:51,040
minutes but also since we have tea and everyone's invited it actually kind of breaks the ice a little bit so you get to meet someone it's kind of nice so so

378
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,000
please
