1
00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:07,140
so now I think you can hear me um

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:14,300
so welcome I find it very

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,279
um I don't know delightful and and uh

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,519
kind of homey to be sitting here Monday morning to be able to speak to you all about the

5
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:36,000
Dharma and and for me to I speak to him speaking to myself as well

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,640
um this is as much as Dharma exploration for me is it is offering you things to

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:50,420
explore so um in this Dharma practice that we do

8
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:59,100
there's a wonderful way in which contrasts support us to

9
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:06,060
find our way to deepen the practice to help us use this practice to become more

10
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,780
free and uh and to be able to be aware of

11
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,780
two contrasting States kind of at the same time or have

12
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:24,600
them in mind at the same time or evoke our connection to it or

13
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:29,939
intuition of them at the same time can be very significant way

14
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:37,259
of the heart the mind kind of finding the beacon finding the

15
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:44,939
the the path forward so uh one example of this is the

16
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,600
contrast between agitation and calm

17
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:56,579
agitation and calm there's always I'd like to propose

18
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,299
there's always going to be some degree of both

19
00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:07,500
present for us short of Awakening sort of enlightenment

20
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,379
and when all agitation disappears but otherwise there's going to be a

21
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:18,959
little bit of both sometimes we're more on the agitation side sometimes we're less sometimes we're

22
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,420
more on the calm side and sometimes or less but the two are there and the

23
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,599
degree to which you recognize sitting down this morning you're maybe a little bit agitated

24
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,760
or already a little bit calm you've already beginning to find yourself on

25
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,700
that spectrum between the two and uh

26
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,280
and it's not really so necessary to have the idea that you should be

27
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,360
anywhere else in the Spectrum if you find yourself much more on the agitation side of the spectrum

28
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,680
for the purpose of this meditation that's fine that's the door that's the

29
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,560
where we practice uh mindfulness and the mindfulness can developed wonderfully

30
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,900
with agitation I've had wonderful meditations with

31
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:16,019
restlessness we just felt like this energy of like ping pong ball energy bouncing around

32
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:21,720
inside and at some point it became even entertaining to feel all the energy in

33
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,800
the body just that bouncing inside

34
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:35,519
and um and so but if you can kind of be aware of both at the same time

35
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,459
the chances are that your heart

36
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,900
will or your agitation will be reassured by

37
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:51,299
the calm somehow the calm will more and more

38
00:03:51,299 --> 00:04:00,440
be a companion to the agitation so the agitation can quiet can settle

39
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,819
and that's one of the ways to use this this uh the wisdom of contrasts

40
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:12,480
to help us along this way so to take assume that meditation

41
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,320
posture and

42
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,040
lower your gaze down towards the floor

43
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:33,780
without closing your eyes and soften that gaze

44
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:39,120
so you're not really focused on anything in particular but a broad Focus as if

45
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:47,418
looking at a mountain far in the distance soft relaxed

46
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,000
and now gently close your eyes

47
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:05,520
and feel in this body of yours and the posture

48
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,860
where there is agitation and where

49
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:15,138
there might be some modicum of calm

50
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:37,160
now as I sit here I do feel a little bit of agitation in the area of my front of my chest

51
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:42,919
but in the back of my chest it's calm

52
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:55,340
I feel some energy maybe agitation a little bit in my hands and fingers

53
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:04,020
but they rest on my knees and thighs which are

54
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,759
feel calm and settled

55
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:23,940
I feel a teeny bit of tightening and

56
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:28,740
restlessness in my eyes tension

57
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:33,500
but behind them in the back of my head

58
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,720
it feels peaceful and quiet

59
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:46,520
so where is this contrast found for you

60
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,940
feeling your whole body

61
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:16,860
and recognizing the degree to which it might be calm or agitated

62
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,900
on the spectrum between the two

63
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:32,539
and then gently calmly take some deeper breaths

64
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:50,900
even in the breathing there might be ways in which there's agitation and come

65
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:03,360
and see if you could know agitation and calm calmly peacefully

66
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:24,840
noticing which parts of breathing feels more on the calm side what part of

67
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,139
the cycle feels more in the agitated side

68
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:36,140
at least relative to itself

69
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:53,839
letting the breathing breathe naturally continue to feel

70
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:03,000
the contrasts and breathing maybe it's

71
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,860
more agitated to less agitated and more calm and less calm

72
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:15,500
or the two sides calm and agitation

73
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:39,720
and if while being with your breathing you feel agitation or tension in your

74
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:47,899
body maybe on the exhale

75
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:57,300
bring a wave of calmness to hold to touch

76
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,700
the places of the agitation

77
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:17,300
and you're thinking behind is it more agitated or more calm

78
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:30,839
if it's agitated it might be you know pushing itself out of the body

79
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:37,940
or upward or just spinning unconnected to the body

80
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:47,820
maybe you can allow the thinking mind to settle back and rest

81
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,720
in the body

82
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:13,680
perhaps you can think calmly

83
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:21,620
about how to bring attention to the agitation

84
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:28,220
attuning yourself to The rhythms her breathing

85
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:37,500
maybe as if the breathing is like the tide moving up on

86
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:43,459
the beach and back coming and going

87
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:52,620
as if the breathing comes and goes across the calm and agitation that's in

88
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,500
you gently

89
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,920
agitation and calm it touched

90
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,940
by your breathing

91
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,580
foreign

92
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:56,460
after these minutes of meditating is the balance of agitation

93
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:04,580
and calm shifted for you either direction is fine

94
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,919
not being troubled by anything

95
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:18,380
even agitation is a support for calm

96
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:45,500
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

97
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:54,840
to gaze upon your experience calmly

98
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,880
to have a kind calm awareness

99
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:12,980
whatever you're thinking about whatever you're aware of Here and Now

100
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:23,039
and then to let that calm attention

101
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:28,140
calm thinking be directed towards

102
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:33,860
the people you might encounter in next 24 hours

103
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:40,980
whether foreign people you know or people you don't know

104
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:48,299
strangers on the street neighbors colleagues

105
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:54,480
people you'll read about in the news or see

106
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,260
on the news anywhere

107
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:07,919
and imagine gazing upon them being present for them

108
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,919
calmly

109
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,480
free of agitation

110
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,740
so that you can take them in be aware of them

111
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,700
from your heart

112
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:36,299
and we from that heartfelt place within

113
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,899
wish them well

114
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:55,440
may all the people that I have some awareness of today

115
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,679
may they be happy May the people that will have contact

116
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:07,460
with may they be safe

117
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:15,380
May the people that I'll know about may they be peaceful

118
00:29:17,159 --> 00:29:21,919
may all beings be free

119
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:29,299
and may my ability to stay connected to calm

120
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,860
while I'm also on the Spectrum from agitation to calm

121
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:41,659
May that come support the welfare and happiness of all

122
00:29:49,130 --> 00:30:03,780
[Music]

123
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:16,039
all right

124
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:25,500
so this will be the first talk in a series Following last week's on consciousness

125
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:30,539
where I'll attempt to talk about how different factors of the Mind mind

126
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:35,820
activities can affect the quality or the

127
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:42,659
characteristics of Consciousness how we are aware of being conscious

128
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:45,679
and if

129
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:54,120
overall if that purpose of these talks don't quite work for you

130
00:30:54,120 --> 00:31:02,539
don't worry too much about it I think what I'll be teaching about will have other value in addition

131
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:10,140
so what I'd like to do is to set up the idea of contrasts that different contrasts of different

132
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:16,140
mind States will have different effects on how we feel aware how we have a sense

133
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:21,480
of what being conscious is and to the degree to which we have a

134
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:29,159
sense of being of consciousness that that sense of Consciousness can be affected by these different contrasting

135
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:35,760
mind States and so for today that talk is about agitation

136
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,279
and calm agitation is uh

137
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:47,279
it can be coarse and many people associate meditation with becoming calm

138
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:55,500
and uh but one of the not known recognized is that as we become calmer in meditation

139
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:00,779
we start uncovering deeper and deeper layers of agitation

140
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:06,779
maybe quieter more subtle layers of it that are invisible to us in the ordinary

141
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:12,240
states of mind that as we go and in fact some of the

142
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,940
places that we feel is recognize the deeper very subtle agitation

143
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:25,860
is in contrast to ordinary states of mind when we're agitated it might seem like a calm state

144
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:31,200
but when we're deeply calm we still see there's a little bit of agitation that

145
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:38,820
tension pressure so learning to recognize the contrast between common agitation learning to be

146
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:45,659
accepting of agitation so that we can be aware of it carefully and fully is important part of this path to

147
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:54,799
Freedom and to emphasize this part of the classic teachings of Buddhism is that

148
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,480
agitation sometimes is explicitly that word sometimes restlessness it's that

149
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,980
word that's used are the last attachment the last hindrance last

150
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:13,559
piece of of Duke ouch suffering that remains before a

151
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:20,580
person becomes fully liberated in fact you have to be fully liberated to let go of of the last vestiges of

152
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:26,640
restlessness and agitation and um so if you have some agitation in

153
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:33,179
your meditation um then it certainly means you're not fully awakened but it also means that

154
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:39,779
you're human and this is part of parcel of Being Human that we're working with and becoming wise about how to be with

155
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:47,039
agitation um the

156
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,919
so um and com can set it in all kinds of

157
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:59,519
different stages of meditation or all kinds of kind of qualities of it there

158
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:05,460
can be a the first really palpable and impactful experience of calm that I

159
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:11,700
experienced uh it needs to kind of been my spiritual life especially before I kind

160
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:16,740
of was interested in spirituality was when I was 18 and I went into a little

161
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:25,200
chapel for a Catholic Chapel in France and and this immediately this calm

162
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:32,940
descended and the cool kind of Ancient Ancient Chapel the stone walls and there was something about the cool

163
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,980
clear crisp air the history of the chapel maybe in

164
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:46,980
the atmosphere there or the associations I had with it who knows but I felt this calm settle into my body that uh was was

165
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:52,500
uh I just found so stunning and I kind of stayed lingering with it for a long

166
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:59,880
time and then I found myself being agitated in rush hour traffic here in the Bay

167
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:06,839
Area freeways and then decided Well I'm here for a while and I have better things to do than be

168
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:13,560
agitated and then finding some simple modicum of calm to settle into and to

169
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:19,140
settle in the chair in the seat in the car and and be still and look around the

170
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:25,619
other drivers wish them well and nothing that too dramatic nothing

171
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:30,660
that I would want to linger in or or feel that was you know something

172
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:37,500
spiritual but um it was what was available and content with that

173
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:42,900
part of the advantage of com in the path of Liberation is that as we become

174
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:48,839
calmer we're able to see more clearly as we become calmer we have access to

175
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:55,020
more wisdom and and skillfulness and understanding of where

176
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:02,579
to go from here including how to not feed the agitation how not to get

177
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:08,040
agitated because we're agitated um but rather to support to nourish the

178
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:16,560
calm to feed the calm is the language of the Buddha the nourishment and he says the nourishment for calm is calm

179
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:23,640
so um if you don't have any comment can't nourish yourself with it but if if you

180
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:29,880
recognize some degree of calm within even a small degree then that calm

181
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:36,720
can as the food for becoming more calm in the same way agitation is the food

182
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,820
for more agitation so to be able to see the contrast between calm and agitation

183
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:48,599
it gives us the wisdom to know which one to attend to the most not to ignore the

184
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:55,500
agitation but to learn to tend to the calm enough that we can be calmly aware of the

185
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:03,780
agitation and that way we're not feeding the agitation and each of these common agitation has a

186
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:09,240
different effect on how we experience Consciousness how we experience being aware

187
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,520
that agitation can make the awareness agitated

188
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:20,880
it can agitation is a kind of a movement that feels uncomfortable and so it's

189
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,460
localized you can feel it's a certain place and it tends to ground or settle

190
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:34,579
or or gather or kind of tie Consciousness to a bounded smaller

191
00:37:34,579 --> 00:37:40,140
tighter place within and uh sometimes it's so agitated it's

192
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:45,300
really hard to even know we're aware or to be you know to tune into what Consciousness is like when we're

193
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:54,060
agitated it's impossible it's almost like it's absent um but as we become calm calm I can have

194
00:37:54,060 --> 00:38:02,040
a location in the body but it tends to have soft boundaries it tends to be not moving and jumping around so much and it

195
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,400
tends to kind of uh have a smooth or relaxed or porous

196
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,740
boundaries it spreads out through the body um and sometimes the calm especially

197
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:19,500
mentalcomm can feel the same way that it just uh has no boundaries

198
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:26,760
so much so that the calm can feel like it's in the room even though the room conventionally is agitated

199
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:34,200
um because our calm is so strong it kind of spills over into our sense or feeling of the room at least at least how we're

200
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:41,820
aware of the room the awareness that is there and um and so

201
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:48,599
one of the most precious resources we have is our capacity for attention for

202
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:54,960
awareness of being conscious and this amazingly precious resource

203
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:02,460
amazingly precious kind of treasure that we have its characteristics and its availability

204
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:08,400
and its um it's a way in which it supports us

205
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,740
can vary a lot depending on how agitated we are or how calm we are

206
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:22,560
and one of the things that you might consider doing today in the next 24 hours is there are two things one is just

207
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,740
become attuned to the presence of agitation and calm

208
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:34,440
and just that Attunement that a recognition of them it might be enough you don't have to fix

209
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:40,740
anything but just what happens when you see it clearly you might find yourself shifting even

210
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:47,520
unintentionally in a positive direction by that clear awareness of it

211
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,820
and then if you can be calmly aware of your agitation what happens then

212
00:39:53,820 --> 00:40:00,180
what shifts then and I'm not going to suggest that you become aware of the calm in an agitated

213
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:06,900
way but that if you did that that would have a different kind of effect

214
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:14,520
but then also a second thing to do is to be aware of what kind of see if you can

215
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:20,160
notice what is your sense of being conscious like

216
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:27,300
being aware like at the times you're more agitated and at times that you're more calm does your

217
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:34,099
sense of what awareness is or its location or its qualities or its characteristics shift and change

218
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:41,040
depending on the uh you know where you are on the agitation

219
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:47,940
com Spectrum and um

220
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:54,240
so um finally I'll say that uh

221
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:00,720
the the the deeper we go in this exploration of calm

222
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:06,599
uh and agitation one of the things we can discover is a lot of the

223
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:12,599
agitation that we can experience is connected to our idea of self

224
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:18,480
our idea of Me Myself and mine and um and that's one of the ways to get

225
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:26,520
a handle on or to put a big question mark next to our agitation not to make it as such a rarefied thing but to

226
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:31,619
realize that what's agitated is our sense idea of self

227
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:37,320
and that as we get calmer our idea of self shifts and changes as well

228
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:46,040
and the relationship between Consciousness and self is um one of these fascinating kind of um

229
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:52,500
things to discover and so

230
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:58,560
um one saying we could say to assert the self

231
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,940
is to be agitated to forget the self

232
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:12,960
is to be calm and wise to assert the self is to be agitated and

233
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,540
foolish to forget the self

234
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:27,540
is to be calm and wise so thank you very much and um

235
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:35,300
I hope your exploration of calm and agitation makes you wiser
