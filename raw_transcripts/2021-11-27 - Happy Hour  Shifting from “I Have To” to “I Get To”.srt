rendition of happy hour practicing together so

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,480
so this week we have dedicated happy hour to the practice of appreciation

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,400
um gratitude giving thanks appreciating such a

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:34,880
beautiful lovely practice and as i shared with you on wednesday of having practiced it for me

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,879
with with you and also throughout the week with the theme of thanksgiving giving thanks

7
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,079
this this appreciation has been coming up not just on the question not just in

8
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,079
the formal practice for me but also in the informal moments which has been

9
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,399
lovely this is really and i hope that has been the case for you and in case in fact you know what let's do this a

10
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,320
little untraditionally if anybody would like to raise their hand and and share you know the moments they

11
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:10,080
have realized they've noticed in this past week appreciation gratitude coming up in

12
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,880
informal moments and the significance of that let's if you feel like let's take maybe one or two

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:25,360
reflections if not we'll move on yes bill please

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,720
um we before we were talking about you know thinking of

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,600
what if we didn't have an advantage and what that would feel like and i didn't it consciously planned to do that but in

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:45,600
an awful moment for some reason i started to think of grade school and of a girl i knew who was mentally

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,360
and it just struck me how different my life would be if i didn't have mental capacities that

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,200
i have now and so i felt grateful for that

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,119
and all kind of sad for her thinking of her so um yeah

20
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,319
yeah thanks for bringing this in this this spontaneous bringing up of of

21
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:14,879
gratitude and appreciation for a gift that you've had which is your mental capacity which you've taken in many ways

22
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,160
for granted recalling someone who didn't have this gift and of course with compassion for

23
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,440
them ouch and how challenging many ways life can be and of course

24
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,120
not to also undermine the strength and the the grace that

25
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,160
that many of us with challenges all of us have different kinds of challenges

26
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:42,319
and and mental challenges including not to completely undermine that for people who have that

27
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,519
us included any challenge we have and and holding that with compassion and

28
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,920
and turning to gratitude for for what is here so thank you thanks for bringing that in bill yeah

29
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,360
and the other reflections that spontaneously came up for you

30
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,319
i realize i've turned off the chat already so if somebody wanted to type in chat they could okay i don't see in the

31
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:26,239
other hand so so um oh yes one more hand jerry please

32
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,959
so uh spare me if i've said this before uh

33
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,000
but i read an article this week and it really helped me think about

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,840
rather than think about how much i have to do every day i have to do this i have to do that

35
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,519
it transformed it by saying i get to get up and help people each day i get to go for

36
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,560
a run i get to uh see the snowfall as it's did today in

37
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,680
toronto uh so that's a framing it that way

38
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,799
helped me recognize gratitude in so many different ways enough for me

39
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,840
nice i get to i get to yeah wow what a gr

40
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:25,520
amazing wise shift in perspective instead of i have to i have to i get to

41
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:32,479
what a great invitation yeah like all of us to to explore that yeah let's bring that let's bring that

42
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:38,160
into the practice thank you jerry for for planting that seed bringing that in thank you

43
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:45,440
claire this will be our last reflection before we get into it so please claire

44
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,199
sorry having a little muting problem for okay

45
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,800
got all sorts of sound problems but anyway um i've just been wanting to share since

46
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,320
we've been on this topic for a while that one thing i started doing about

47
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,080
six or seven years ago now i have two friends who are interested in the

48
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,280
issue of gratitude also so we circulate an email every day

49
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,600
of three things from the day before that we're grateful for and it goes among the three of us so it

50
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,080
sort of allows us to stay in touch also in switzerland for example so i wouldn't

51
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,000
pick up the phone and call her all the time but i know exactly what she's doing and what the good things are that are

52
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,680
happening for her and it's been a wonderful it really changed a lot of my ways when i first started i

53
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,960
thought i was grateful but i realized after day two i couldn't think of anything

54
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,440
i really had to focus on the good things that were happening in my life i didn't do that normally i

55
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,800
always saw what was wrong that was right so i just wanted to share that with

56
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,919
others because it's been so helpful to me so thank you claire thanks so much for

57
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,120
bringing that in and uh i also appreciate you um really giving the

58
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,240
nuance of how you know after a while it feels like okay i'm out of things okay

59
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,919
and now i need to pay attention so actually the mind really instead of saying well this is a stupid boring

60
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,199
practice i'm done like oh wow and then your curiosity actually your interest

61
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,400
you stayed with it was which is like any other practice we after we scratch the

62
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,440
surface then it gets juicy it gets really juicy

63
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,919
and that's what i'm hearing you you say and how transformative it has been to actually turn to the good

64
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:47,520
lovely so you know what let's let's actually bring that in too that seed into our small brew practice

65
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,560
later uh today when we get into groups maybe there would be

66
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:59,039
groups of three or two or whatever forming from this and and this to share the gratitude practice

67
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,960
that would be fun thanks claire thanks for being here and i've done that before by the way

68
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:11,280
with someone it's it's it's yeah it's such a great practice oh my goodness yeah so

69
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,160
thank you for that well i think we are warmed up now for practicing appreciation and maybe i

70
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,759
won't say more about it it's it's i think the topic is very well framed but maybe i'll

71
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,919
just say one more thing and that is um

72
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,319
one thing that can also happen with this practice which is uh entering into

73
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,599
another dimension of gratitude um

74
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:47,360
and also generosity and as we talked on wednesday generosity and gratitude

75
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,560
really are a pair they go together um

76
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,680
and and these two generosity and gratitude

77
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:05,199
what if we entered into a dimension of holding whatever gifts we have given we have

78
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:12,319
been given whatever challenges we have been given

79
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:20,479
oh what is she talking about what every gifts whatever challenges we've been given

80
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:27,520
that we hold them with a stance with an open spacious

81
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,880
stance of generosity generosity is an open hand

82
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:38,839
that doesn't hold tightly it's with an open hand that receives and

83
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:44,640
releases receives and releases gifts are received

84
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:53,200
they're released challenges are received they're released this hand open hand of generosity

85
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:00,959
with the sense of gratitude ah can we be grateful also or or appreciate

86
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:07,120
maybe the word appreciation is more appropriate can we be can we appreciate

87
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,040
also what is challenging what pushes us what

88
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:20,480
what stretches us what stretches us can we hold it with appreciation

89
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,600
with an open hand that receives and releases

90
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,120
doesn't hold on so with those

91
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,880

moment

appreciating and non-attached appreciation

not a clingy appreciation an open-hearted appreciation

150
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,440
and if you wish you're welcome to open up

151
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:28,640
to perhaps reflect bringing on a couple of things

152
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,159
that perhaps you've had an attitude of oh i have to do this

153
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:43,559
what if you turn and shift that into i get to do this i got to do this

with this open-hearted stance

155
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:08,240
of non-contracted appreciation i get to do this

156
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:11,240
wow

157
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,360
i got to do this

158
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:10,158
inviting your heart your mind to open up to below scratching the surface

159
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,840
when you shift this perspective i get to do this

160
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,880
things you never imagined

161
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,799
well open up if you stay with it if you continue to stay with this stance with

162
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,039
this attitude

163
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,600
i get to serve in this way i get to serve myself

164
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,960
or others in this way

165
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:13,840
are there any difficult challenging aspects of your life

166
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:22,320
that open you up to grace to beauty to service in the

167
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:29,039
ways that if they weren't there it wouldn't be

168
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:35,919
possible i get to do this because of this i get to do this i get

169
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,960
to grow i get to be more

170
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:48,520
i get to be wiser more compassionate i get to do this

171
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:00,880
see if that's available if not don't push it

172
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:07,240
don't push it it's an attitude of inspiration

173
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,278
[Music] not expectation

174
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:22,600
hold it all rightly i get to do this hold it lightly

175
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,840
hey

176
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,560
okay

177
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:20,040
i get to do this i get to do this

178
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:38,880
instead of i have to do this i should do this i must do this

179
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:46,160
i have so much heaviness obligation i get to do this as uplift

180
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:55,359
aspiration inspiration sort of the heavy weight of expectation

181
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,240
i get i get to do this

182
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,838
breathing in breathing out

183
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:23,880
with the goodness the goodness of this gift whatever it might be

184
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,880
even if it's a gift of darkness i get to explore it

185
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,240
i get to explore this gift of darkness

186
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:38,480
which i know and trust opens up opens up

187
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,560
this gift of dukkha suffering

188
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:52,880
that opens up compassion to wisdom

189
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,759
i get to do this

190
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:13,319
it's completely shifting and turning changing the frame

191
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:25,200
exploring expressing my full humanity i get to do

192
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,200
this

193
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:56,160
may all beings everywhere including ourselves appreciate all the gifts

194
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:03,760
all the gifts of grace however they come

195
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,400
may all beings everywhere wake up

196
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,880
and be free

197
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,310

202
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:11,680
as a gift for the benefit of other practitioners

203
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,880
friend please

204
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,440
just want to thank jerry for bringing that up uh turning the have to into get to

205
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,480
it's so applicable to almost everything in my

206
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,960
life everything that i usually use the construction i must i have to

207
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:41,839
you know some parenthetical uh damn it i now will and it's um

208
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:47,760
there's so little that's really onerous and so much that's uh

209
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:54,319
that's a that's an opportunity if not a pleasure i i was just i was thinking of

210
00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:00,400
oh many years ago right around the season i had had some surgery and um and i

211
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:08,480
couldn't walk for you know for a little while and then when i could walk it was every

212
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,760
step was i get to walk i get to walk down to the store i get to walk around

213
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:19,040
the block on my crutches and

214
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:25,200
because it made such a deep impression i've kept some of that so some days you know two decades later i'll still walk

215
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:32,400
down the street and think i get to walk how delightful so thank you

216
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,880
thank you friend well said

217
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,319
lovely

218
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:49,599
and yes with appreciation to jerry for bringing his practice in so that we could all

219
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:56,319
benefit from it [Music] and spend this time really sitting with it

220
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:01,520
lovely any other reflections

221
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:07,640
that came up for you you like to share

222
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:25,760
greg i'm not sure if you're trying to raise your hand that's the the clap but if you're trying to

223
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,960
raise your hand you're welcome to unmute yourself and if not

224
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:37,280
uh yeah i guess i hit the wrong little icon um

225
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:44,720
i was really taken by uh when you said i get to experience

226
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,839
the uh sort of paradoxical nature of that

227
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:58,160
assessment that this is an opportunity to to grow to learn how to cope to learn

228
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:06,319
how to flow to learn how to turn loose a bit to see the insubstantiality of it etc etc etc but it's so counterintuitive

229
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:12,000
and strikes against the traditional conditioning of

230
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,160
constraints and challenges i have and and remolding my mind to think that way so it's

231
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:23,200
it's great stuff and uh i love paradox and i love uncertainty and i love the

232
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:29,359
mist and this this is a great opportunity to influence all of those things or to experience all those things

233
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:36,400
so thank you for that yeah thank you for for bringing that in and how that

234
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:42,319
impacted you this shift in perspective really and this shift is

235
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:47,920
um you know awakening freedom nibbana whatever you call it it really is about

236
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:56,319
a shift in perspective when we see and relate to things differently and it's just this in so

237
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:02,880
many ways that is what awakening is so so thank you and it can happen in so

238
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,240
many ways it's not necessarily just tata waiting for that final moment but it can

239
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:14,800
happen in so many ways this shift and practice little chef shifts in perspective little by little by little

240
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,960
by little yeah thank you and and one thing that i'll share with

241
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:28,079
what was something that came up for me this has come up before but tonight um

242
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:35,040
you know when many of you know that i have chronic illness and and you know many

243
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:42,800
symptoms and and one thing that came up was oh i get to be sick i get to to experience pain i

244
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:50,480
i get to do this i get to do this because that's when really i slow down i really

245
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:57,680
slow down and my mind meets whatever challenge and difficulty pain

246
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,599
fatigue slowing down just i get to be sick i get to do this the sense of

247
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:10,400
delight because i would probably not be sharing the dharma or a dharma teacher

248
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:16,960
if it wasn't for the gift of this illness i would continue to be a computer scientist so

249
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:22,800
so i get to be sick i get to do this yay so with that

250
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:30,079
marianne says i also appreciate um this tonight very much i thought i get

251
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:35,440
to be a mother and the difficult times opened my heart more than it ever would

252
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,119
have done yeah nice thank you mariah

253
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:46,400
yeah and another reflection comes in thanks

254
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:52,240
the gift of dukkha which seems inescapable is a challenge for me yes

255
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:59,839
it can be and slowly slowly the shift of perspective can happen little little

256
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:05,280
in small ways in small ways so

257
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,200
um not to expect that all the time

258
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:17,440
jerry says i recently have had a cancer scare and missed this bullet gratefully

259
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:24,000
and this dukkha has helped me help others ah wow thank you jerry thanks for sharing

260
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:31,839
that yeah that deepening us whether we miss it or not

261
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:36,720
it deepens us to to serve and support others

262
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:50,640
so let's say it's oh 6 49 yes this is the time to turn

263
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,920
into small group practice so so i have an invitation before you jump often like

264
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,200
those of you who might want to jump off please don't just hear this first so the

265
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:06,400
invitation for tonight is to take um

266
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:13,440

269
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:33,520
you're up for doing this gratitude practice with another person another two people for a

270
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:39,599
week just commit to it for one week not for the rest of your lives you commit to

271
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:45,520
for one week to do it with people you might find yourself in the group

272

276
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:16,400

277
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:23,280
um whoever wants to renew the commitment you would for another week and if not

278
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:29,920

284
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:07,599

285
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:14,319
from david on youtube who said that um thanks sharon says i learned to do that

286
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:21,520
years ago one day all at once i lost a job and a beautiful apartment becoming jobless and homeless at once ever since

294
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:15,040
rebuild um it seems like you know not too many people get get the opportunity to

295
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:21,520
start the concept i guess you could say of like a rebirth of the mind and just be able to

296
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:28,880
just just learn from a very a very respectful perspective and i'm

297
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:35,520
very grateful to have this mindfulness i'm very grateful to have the sangha and and to just be part

298
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:42,160

299
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:48,640
