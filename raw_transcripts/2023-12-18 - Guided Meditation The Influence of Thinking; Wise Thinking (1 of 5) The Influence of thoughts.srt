00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,760
I have this opportunity to be with you in this way and and it's pretty special that there's

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:41,160
such a wonderful Rich sense of community that's forming just from the chats and for those of you

7
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:48,520
not reading or writing in the chats I just know that uh this is a very that

8
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,879
those chats kind of um exhibit they're very

9
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,760
warm um Community kind of

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,040
warm-hearted supportive community that gathers for these

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:14,640
meditations so probably for some of you maybe for

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:22,439
many of you one of the challenges of meditation is having a wise relationship

13
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,720
with thinking and some of you maybe think a

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,119
lot in meditation and and it

15
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:40,119
becomes more time for thinking than it is time for

16
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:48,520
meditation some of you might struggle with your thinking and maybe even think have think

17
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:54,200
that you're thinking is an enemy and something you have to fight

18
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,320
against for this meditation I would like you to be

19
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:05,920
allowed to think and I'll offer some

20
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,480
guidance through the sitting around

21
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:19,200
thinking certainly you can be centered in your

22
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:26,160
breathing while you're aware that you're thinking you don't have to let go of

23
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,640
your thoughts but to be curious about

24
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,959
them to see them clearly for what they

25
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,800
are to in a sense stand away from them and look back at them oh this is

26
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:53,000
thinking yes this is what my thinking is about get to know your

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,159
thinking but may be a little bit like getting to know someone who's speaking a foreign language you don't understand

28
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:07,599
and what are some of the things you can pick up to this person who's

29
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,400
thinking all along breathing in breathing

30
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,239
out almost like breathing is the beat to the

31
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:29,760
music and the music is your thinking so to begin by assuming a a

32
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,799
apprpriate posture for you that supports your ability to be

33
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:45,360
both relaxed and alert alert and

34
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,840
relaxed and no matter what posture you normally take is there some way

35
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:58,640
of straightening out the spine adjusting so that your shoulders a

36
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:06,360
little bit shoulder blades are a little bit going down your back so that your chest comes out a

37
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:15,400
little bit in a way that might even look like a posture of

38
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,919
confidence gently lower your

39
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:33,840
gaze and feel the effect low that lowering your gaze

40
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:47,919
has and then seeing what effect closing the eyes has close the

41
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:05,440
eyes and then seeing what effect effect it has on you to slowly take some deeper breaths

42
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:13,360
comfortably deep with comfortably long

43
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,560
exhales continue taking some deeper

44
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:42,720
breaths and now on the exhale relax your

45
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:48,440
body relax particular Parts the whole or the whole

46
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:55,400
body and see what the effect is on you in that part of your body that relaxes

47
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:03,319
on your whole body on your heart on your

48
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:29,759
mind and then noticing what shifts and what happens to you let your breathing

49
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,720
return to normal be with your normal

50
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:43,240
breathing and see what's happening now as a consequence of normal

51
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
breathing

52
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,560
and then with normal breathing continue the process of relaxing your

53
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:23,000
body but maybe almost imagining that relaxing as a a door that opens or a slide you slide

54
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,319
down and as the doors fully open or they come to the bottom of the

55
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:37,400
slide how are you what's shifted and

56
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:44,800
changed being open and receptive to what effect the relaxing has

57
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,159
had so as you exhale relaxing the

58
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
belly

59
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,759
as you exhale relaxing the

60
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
chest

61
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,000
relaxing the

62
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,040
shoulders relaxing the muscles of your

63
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
face

64
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:27,600
and again seeing what effect it has on you on the exhale Relax The Thinking

65
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:36,079
mind calming the thinking

66
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:57,320
mind support for calming the Mind thinking mind is to be reassuring for

67
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:03,440
it be in reassuring attention a

68
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,640
reassuring attendant to how the thinking mind might

69
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,000
be anxious or

70
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
upset

71
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:47,639
and then settle centering yourself on the body

72
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:53,000
breathing maybe the movements of the belly or the

73
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
chest

74
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:11,079
and even following W one full cycle of breathing in and breathing

75
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:17,760
out resting with it being receptive to

76
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,399
it what effect does it have on

77
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
you

78
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,639
feeling their rhythm of breathing in and breathing

79
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
out

80
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,360
and with Brea breathing is the rhythm is the

81
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,480
beat also be aware of your mind

82
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:57,839
thinking you're allowed to think but know you're

83
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,000
thinking as if

84
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:12,160
thinking is happening between your breathing around

85
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
it

86
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:45,079
just as you can hear the drum beat together with the other

87
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,120
music know the beat of the

88
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:57,480
breathing together with the music of

89
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
thinking

90
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:33,880
and as you're aware of thinking what effect does the thinking have on

91
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:44,240
you does IT project the mood or a tone does it contribute tension or

92
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:52,360
relaxation are your thoughts harmless

93
00:14:53,279 --> 00:15:00,680
Whispers or are they intense demands for attention

94
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:19,880
and whatever way you're thinking it's fine breathe with it breathe through

95
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:26,920
them keep the beat going a steady

96
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
beat

97
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
e

98
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
for

99
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
for

100
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
for

101
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
e

102
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
e

103
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
e

104
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
e

105
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

106
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
for

107
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
for

108
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

109
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

110
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

111
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:59,159
if you find yourself thinking it's fine breathe with it allow your thinking

112
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:05,760
to be there as if breathing is a gentle wind

113
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,360
blowing through the thoughts and

114
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:20,799
notice what influence impact mood does thinking cast upon

115
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:29,600
you and how might that change if you see See

116
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,600
Clearly thinking and the influence it

117
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
has

118
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
e

119
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
e

120
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:04,039
e and then the last couple of minutes here

121
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:07,480
before starting to

122
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:18,559
end how have these minutes of meditation affected your

123
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,640
thinking as the nature of your thinking

124
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:34,240
changed as the mood behind your thinking

125
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:41,960
changed as the strength of thinking

126
00:26:55,200 --> 00:27:02,000
changed as this space or the Stillness or the silence around

127
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,480
thoughts become

128
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
bigger

129
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,519
e

130
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
e

131
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:05,480
and then as we come to the end of the

132
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:14,880
sitting to think now about the people in your life the people that you care

133
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,840
for the people for whom you have friendly

134
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:29,320
regard friends family Neighbors

135
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:36,919
co-workers people you know about from books or talks that you've

136
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:39,278
listened

137
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:49,398
to in whatever friendly regard you have for

138
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:55,640
them think about them and how the how what elicits

139
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,320
friendliness what you appreciate

140
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:08,559
apprciate and feel the influence of those thoughts on

141
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:25,120
you and then letting your kind regard open now as wide and expansive as

142
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:33,640
possible wishing that any benefit from this meditation can be for the welfare and

143
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:41,880
happiness of Others May others be

144
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,919
happy May others be

145
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,159
safe may others be

146
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:59,240
peaceful May others be free

147
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:08,120
may all beings be safe and may we

148
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,720
contribute to that

149
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:26,159
[Music]

150
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,159
possibility

151
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:37,650
thank [Music]

152
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,159
you

153
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,919
so hello and welcome on this Monday when I begin we

154
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:44,360
begin a new series of to of new topic for the

155
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:53,399
week and um maybe because I just came from meditating for a week or teaching

156
00:32:53,399 --> 00:33:00,480
for a week on a retreat somehow what's surfaced for me is to want to talk about

157
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:10,720
is thinking and um a very important part of a wise life is becoming wise about our

158
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,080
thinking often enough I think for many people thinking happens Auto on

159
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,880
automatic pilot and we just take our thinking for

160
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:28,399
granted that this is how it should be and thinking just churs out whatever thoughts it does and we just go along

161
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:36,399
for the ride and the thoughts that we have can have a huge influence on us and uh and

162
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:43,159
if we just an automatic pilot just allowing those thoughts to be there and have that influence on us they can it

163
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:49,679
can be quite detrimental as I like to say that some psychologists believe that one of the

164
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:56,399
leading causes for depression is rumination if we are thinking thoughts

165
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,480
which are not Pleasant that having one of those thoughts might be just you know a small

166
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,840
little drop of unpleasantness or unpleasant effect on us but if we have

167
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:14,079
the same kind of thought over and over and over again throughout the day it begins wearing us down it begins filling

168
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,398
us with with the unpleasantness of that

169
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:26,358
comes along with them so if th those thoughts are self-criticism of any kind if we're

170
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:33,720
constantly having thoughts about our shame or our guilt or our inadequacy or

171
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:40,560
our whatever it might be um the frequency of those thoughts are

172
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:47,398
never questioned maybe may maybe to some degree all those might be

173
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:52,878
true so that they warrant a few thoughts and reflection and

174
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:57,960
consideration but there's no need to have thoughts like that repeatedly over

175
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:05,240
and over and over again it's uh if anybody talked as repeatedly as we might be talking to

176
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:11,880
ourselves we would wonder about uh their mental health or they they seem like

177
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,640
they're quite foolish but we don't question the foolishness of ourselves having the same

178
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:25,240
thought it's you thinking can be automatic it can be uh we take it for granted this is what how thing should

179
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:31,359
be so to uh start becoming mindful of

180
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,400
thinking is hugely important some people have no clue how

181
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:41,680
to do this and some of this might be because we have variet variety of

182
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:49,440
different cognitive abilities ways in which the Mind cognizes understands uh our

183
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:58,799
life and uh and some of those are almost can be kind of um um

184
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:07,440
um preverbal they're kind of preverbal or nonverbal ways of understanding and

185
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,560
processing there's uh however there's also verbal ways there's the inner voice

186
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:17,920
that the inner speech that we have some people don't have an inner speech they

187
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:24,680
have uh inner images that they produce but whether it's images

188
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:31,240
or inner speech uh it tends to follow uh the rules of

189
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:37,200
our language it tends to follow the story The Narrative that uh that's that

190
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:44,040
U uh inner speech can make and so to become aware of how this works for us

191
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:50,040
and one one interesting Discovery is do you think mostly in images or mostly in

192
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:58,400
words when you're actively thinking and and then as you think

193
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:06,520
what influence does that thinking have on you is it uplifting is it energizing in a nice way is it

194
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:13,640
agitating uh is it make you sad does it make you feel shame or embarrassment or

195
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:22,160
or deflated what's the influence that the thoughts have thoughts do not need to influence

196
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:28,880
us they do not need to come along with a mood that sets sets the mood up for how

197
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,560
we have to feel um and they but it's hard to tease those

198
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:41,319
apart uh I've had um I've sat you know quietly and and then I've thought about

199
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:47,359
when my kids were young you know my thought would come up about some danger they're in you know there's they might

200
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:54,640
something might happen and uh and sometimes it would come up this image or idea would come up Suddenly and I could

201
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:02,079
feel the influence would have had was fear throughout my body and um but there was no they

202
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:08,359
weren't any imminent danger they were um but those thoughts

203
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:14,720
those images that I had had cast this incredible spell on her my

204
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:22,680
body and um it doesn't have to be that way it's possible to have uh clear

205
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:28,200
enough attention recognition that in a certain way is

206
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:34,680
stronger than the influence of the thoughts it's um you know it's uh like

207
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:42,839
going to a horror movie and we feel afraid there's fear but if you you know

208
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:51,440
look around the maybe if you look around the the theater and see there's people eating popcorn and and U falling asleep

209
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:57,240
or doing what they do in theaters then um you know you not absorbed in the

210
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,280
images on the screen and maybe the images don't affect you as much or if

211
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:10,119
you start looking at the cinem cinemat graphic techniques used with uh with the

212
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:16,079
movie then you're not so caught in the story and you're not lost in it and it doesn't have such a big effect so to

213
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:24,040
step back and kind of look where does what influence does thinking have so the the kind of inner voice the

214
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:31,160
images the way of thinking might be discursive and um the word

215
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:36,240
discursive the which way I use it I might not be quite what the dictionary

216
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:42,319
says that one is just rambling thoughts kind of going this way and that way and

217
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:47,680
uh running around and do this and that thought and just kind of Maybe Maybe

218
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,640
random but I also think of it as carrying on a discourse carrying on a conversation in our

219
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:01,400
mind and it could be a conversation that we're um uh judging ourselves and

220
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:07,319
thinking about all that's bad it could be a conversation about planning what's going to have Imagining the future it

221
00:40:07,319 --> 00:40:12,599
could be a conversation about what happened in the past repeating it over and over again it could literally be a

222
00:40:12,599 --> 00:40:18,079
conversation that you're imagining with another person and you're even filling in their part of the

223
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:24,960
conversation and um so it's a relatively active and energetic way of having a

224
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,640
conversation in the mind or disc jumping around from one topic to another U but

225
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:37,839
still kind of carrying on a conversation so the inner voice is speaking or the inner projector is projecting images of

226
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:45,440
all this kind of stuff and um and if these are taken for granted this is the way it has to be

227
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:53,319
then we're really limiting uh our the the capacity limiting the full richness

228
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:59,640
of what our inner inner life mental life can be about so to recognize oh I'm having a

229
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,760
conversation I'm having a movie of what's going to come and this is the

230
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,440
influence it has wow look at that influence and what difference does it

231
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,720
make to you when you recognize you're having a conversation recognize your

232
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:21,359
inner voice is kind of going along and it has an effect on you the mood on your

233
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:27,480
mood your your energ energy your even how you understand

234
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:34,760
yourself and is that influence necessary do we need to believe every

235
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:40,599
thought do we need to be affected by every thought like we do we need to you

236
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:46,599
know go to horror movies all the time do we need to go you know to be not not

237
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:54,520
that all thoughts are scary but they can be angry and they can be critical or what influence do they

238
00:41:54,520 --> 00:42:01,440
have and um and what difference does it make when you know and recognize that

239
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:10,240
influence so this can be subtle it could be um very very strong the subtle as I

240
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,240
said um to do it for a long period of time for hours repeatedly coming back to

241
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:22,160
it can have a huge impact on our life and how we understand ourselves and

242
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:30,599
affect ourselves and we don't have to believe every thought

243
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:38,119
we have we don't have to be under its influence emotionally mood-wise we don't

244
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:44,119
have to or what we think does not have to um agitate us

245
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:51,640
or depress us we can just breathe with it breathe through it breathing is a bit

246
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:58,400
of a protection not the way to stop thinking it's a bit of prot protection so that we

247
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,680
have a more balanced perspective of thinking and our involvement with them and how they

248
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:12,880
influence us and so to learn the art of breathing with through the thinking mind

249
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,200
to breathe alongside of breathing that way the mental energy

250
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:25,119
doesn't go all into the thoughts there's something else another perspective another balancing Force while we're

251
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:30,359
thinking I think this is one reason why some people like to go for a walk when

252
00:43:30,359 --> 00:43:35,599
they're really troubled uh it's kind of like you go for a walk with yourself it's like almost

253
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:43,400
like having a friend it's kind of like something else is going on rather than being caught in your in your mind so uh

254
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:48,520
to gives it a fresh perspective it breaks up the Hony of of thinking that

255
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:54,760
it has on us so the same thing with breathing breathing can be like kind of like going going for a walk with oneself

256
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,880
accompanying it breathing through through and then uh maybe a little

257
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:06,400
Shield gentle Shield or a gentle uh wind that blows away that

258
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:12,920
influence that the thoughts might have on us otherwise and does that help us to see

259
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:19,280
our thinking in a wiser way does that help us to reconsider to question are

260
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:25,079
these thoughts true are they useful and is there a better way to

261
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:32,000
think are there better thoughts to have and what might those

262
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:38,920
be and if there are better thoughts to have consciously

263
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:46,880
deliberately begin having those thoughts you're allowed

264
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:55,800
to have a sense of deliberateness with what you think as opposed to just being

265
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:03,200
the the victim of whatever the mind wants to spew out or run you can actually

266
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:10,040
choose maybe not for a long time but you can break the chain and think about things which are

267
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:16,640
reasonable and true and things which are uplifting and supportive things that are

268
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:23,359
wise and uh take your mind for a walk so that the thinking mind the discursive

269
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:29,160
mind doesn't have the upper hand and then the next few days I'll talk

270
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:34,319
about different kinds of thinking different ways of thinking because if we

271
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:40,520
only know if we never thought about it never really understood all the

272
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:47,720
different aspects of thinking then we might be very limited in how we think

273
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:55,480
and therefore more likely to be the victim of how we think so as we learn

274
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:00,960
new ways of thinking uh that can set us free in many

275
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:09,680
ways so thank you for this and uh I look forward to continuing

276
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,400
tomorrow
