7
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:48,640
so for this week um given that you have been practicing

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:55,039
uh the sati patana sutta in a very methodical and slow way

9
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,320
with gil over the past few weeks and weeks also remaining

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,960
what i would like to share and support and offer in the support of

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,119
your practice our practice is [Music] delving into the refrain of the

12
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,560
satipatana it's not the specific sections about the topics but it's the

13
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,720
refrain that actually years ago as i was studying the satipatana suta blew my

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:33,280
mind how significant the refrain actually is for all of the practices so

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,560
and also i'll bring in a little bit of the introduction um phrasing and suggestions for setting the

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,439
frame so basically this week these five days it's about how to practice the

17
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,600
satipatana not what to practice gil is very slowly thoroughly going through the

18
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,640
the topics of the establish establishments of the foundations and

19
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,240
the refrain really has to do and the introduction has to do with how to practice how

20
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:11,599
the way the scope the attitude so that's what i like to bring

21
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,000
in to offer to support your practice maybe of service so and i'll say more about this in

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,239
the um darmit afterwards and um

23
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:32,640

24
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,920

150
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:42,960
the structure of the satipatana sutta for some of you this might be new for some of you this might be review

151
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,440
and it's always fun even if it's review so and i have one slide and if you have

152
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:56,480

is divided to four different sections as you see i you can you can't see my oh yes you can see my cursor that's good so

168
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:40,079
on the left as you see from the bottom if you look from the bottom you see there's a section called the body right

169
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,520
there are six sections in the body and you've covered them you've studied them with guilt

170
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,640
breathing postures activities anatomical parts

171
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:56,079
elements and corpse and decay then the second section of the

172
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,440
satipattan the second foundation second establishment

173
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,480
is feelings or vedana or feeling tones which you

174
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:12,480
practiced with gil last week and next week i trust he will be

175
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:22,319
covering the third satipatana mind here you see it and then the last foundation is damas

176
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,440
and which again there are five parts hindrances aggregates sense fears

177
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,880
awakening factors noble truths so so right now you're kind of in the

178
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:43,280
middle here of having covered half of the satipatana sutta with gil and the other half remaining

179
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,599
so this is the structure of the satipatana sutta and um

180
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,520
and what i'd like to bring your attention to is that in between each section

181
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:02,320
where specific teachings are given about say breathing starting from the

182
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:09,760
bottom the first teaching is about the breath the second one about body postures etc the way the sutta is

183
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:16,800
written at the beginning it talks it says you see this box that says direct path

184
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,560
so the suta talks about how this is the direct path

185
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,160
how these teachings are the direct path to awakening

186
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:35,839
and which i can also read that for use if i'm talking about that so i'll just read it so that we have some so it's a

187
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:43,280
short paragraph practitioners this is the direct path for the purifications of beings

188
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:51,680
for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation for the disappearance of dukkha and discontent for acquiring the

189
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,839
true method for the realization of nibana namely the four satypatanas

190
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:03,040
so here it's the declaration that this is the direct path this is the direct

191
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,640
path and of course this this is repeated at the end and it's it's actually i love this

192
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,640
because um you know in as an academic as an ex-academic

193
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:21,520
whenever i gave talks i was told at the beginning say what you're going to say then expose it

194
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:28,800
give the details and at the end say what you have said so here buddha is doing that the buddha is as supreme academic

195
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,880
is like this is what i'm going to tell you i'm going to tell you about the direct path then he goes all through all

196
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,000
the details lays it out and at the end again on top as you see the direct path

197
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,480
this fret this paragraph is repeated again so it's a beautiful

198
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:55,200
mirror image in that way so and then there is a definition so this definition

199
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,520
here which i will read for you in a minute is also a way of you know offering how

200
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:08,720
offering how to practice again gives a definition but what i really want to bring your attention to which we'll go

201
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:16,320
over this week is the refrain do you see the refrain shows up after every

202
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,920
teaching and it for those of you who have read the suta

203
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,160
sometimes ruta sutras can be repetitive and when you see something repeated sometimes like okay okay i've seen this

204
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:35,040
before i want to see the the actual you know the new part the teaching and yet and yet

205
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:41,680
the refrain here is repeated 13 times if it weren't important it wouldn't be

206
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,040
repeated 13 times each teaching is repeated once the

207
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:54,000
refrain is repeated 13 times wow and years ago when i was studying the

208
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,280
sati patana sutta realizing this through

209
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,400
through actually the pointing out of biku analia so his thesis his

210
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,599
phd thesis he's a venerable monk a respected monk and and

211
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,720
he did his thesis on the sati patana sutra which became a book

212
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,720
called sati patano the direct path to realization and when i read this and noticed wow the

213
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:27,359
refrain is so important and then he exposed the nuances of the refrain it

214
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:34,560
it made so much sense given my own practice with uh paak sayadaw and the various things

215
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,920
that he had taught me that had blown my mind yes they were in the refrain they were

216
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,040
in the refrain and i hadn't seen them pointed out clearly by others so the

217
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:51,359
refrain is so important that i would like to bring that to our attention to your

218
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:57,200
attention this week so so with that

219
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:03,839
i'd like to i'll read the definition because i borrowed from it the

220
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:11,520
intern in the uh guided meditation and then read the refrain then we'll go through it more this week so

221
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:18,480
so the definition goes so after the direct path it says the

222
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:25,599
four satipatanas it ended there and then continues what are the four

223
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:30,720
and here practitioners in regards in regard

224
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:35,760
to the body a practitioner abides contemplating the body

225
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:42,880
diligent clearly knowing mindful free from desires and discontent in

226
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,920
regard to the world and then he goes through and points out

227
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:55,520
the other uh the same phrase repeats in regards to feelings in regards to mental objects

228
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:02,480
i'm sorry in regards to the feelings mind mental objects a practitioner abides contemplating the

229
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:08,240
body diligent clearly no or contemplating say mind or

230
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:16,640
mental feeling mental feelings or or or sorry mental objects or feelings

231
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,400
diligent clearly knowing mindful and free from desires and discontent in

232
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,920
regard to the world so basically the buddha is telling us in the

233
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,839
definition at the very beginning like hey i'm going to tell you about these four i'm going to tell you about the body

234
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:40,240
feelings mind and the mental objects

235
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,520
and the way i invite you to reflect on them

236
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,880
is this four ways with with diligent with diligence with

237
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:58,400
the sense of energy balanced but sustained application of energy which is this beautiful word

238
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,039
called atapi which i mentioned before

239
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:12,800
so atapi clear knowing it's sampana mindful sati free from desires and

240
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,240
discontent in regard to the to the world vinaya abijah

241
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:25,359
nasa so these four like oh yes have these have these and in the guided

242
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:30,400
meditation i invited for us to bring this atapi this this

243
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,400
sustained application of energy balanced engagement i call it ener engagement or

244
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:42,240
energy atapi which i love atapi by the way when i learned about it wow what what a

245
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:50,480
beautiful concept you can just drop it into your practice now and then atapi atapi let it light light up your energy

246
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,640
and the letting go this letting go this which is also a fact of concentration

247
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:03,440
free from desire and discontent in regards to the world and then some pagania clearly knowing and mindfulness

248
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:09,760
which is sati which we've been practicing so so the definition

249
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:16,000
so i'll just briefly read since i've talked about the refrain i'll just read the

250
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:22,400
refrain um actually i can stop well i'll read the refrain and of course

251
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,560
we'll go through it more there's so much more about the refrain so here goes the refrain

252
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:36,400
um actually i have it up on my screen i can read it so so after say breathing has been taught

253
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,920
the buddha says in this way in regard to the body one abides

254
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,200
contemplating the body internally or one abides contemplating the body

255
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:54,319
externally or one abides contemplating the body both internally and externally

256
00:44:54,319 --> 00:45:02,240
wow okay so we have this internal external concept it's we've just expanded the spatial dimension it's not

257
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:07,680
just internal okay then he continues one abides

258
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:12,960
contemplating the nature of arising in the body one abides

259
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,720
contemplating the nature of passing away in the body or one abides contemplating the nature

260
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:25,359
of both arising and passing away in the body okay so we're not just

261
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:31,359
contemplating the breath itself anymore it's not the object but we've now added

262
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:36,560
a temporal temporal aspect time arising

263
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:42,319
passing arising and passing okay we've just expanded

264
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:47,760
this teaching of breathing in the satipatana to have both spatial internal

265
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:54,640
external as well as temporal aspects wow okay what else is there in the refrain a

266
00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:01,440
couple more things mindfulness that there is a body established in him

267
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,760
to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and continuous mindfulness i'll say more about this later we just

268
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:16,720
want to read it and lastly oh this is this is my favorite line and one abides independent

269
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:21,920
not clinging to anything in the world one

270
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:30,400
excuse me and one abides independent not clinging to anything in the world

271
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,839
and the last finishing line and this is how in regard to the body one abides

272
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:41,520
contemplating the body like okay you get it practitioners this is how in regards to the body

273
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,560
wonderboy it's contemplating the body it's just so beautiful i'm going to stop share

274
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:52,400
it's just so beautiful this teaching is so beautiful and i can't wait for us to

275
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:58,800
uh to discuss it and explore it in practice together this week so so thank
