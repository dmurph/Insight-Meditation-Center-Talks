1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:16,200
good morning everyone and welcome and um

2
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,199
so we're continuing with our satipatana series the practice of mindfulness

3
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:35,280
and mindfulness gets pretty this is a very simple capacity for being

4
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,079
aware becomes pretty revolutionary after a while and

5
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:48,559
one way to maybe mention this is um to look at the way the buddha referred

6
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,640
to himself others people sometimes called them

7
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,320
gotama sometimes they called him very common they called him the bhagavan the blessed

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:07,840
one sometimes people it's translated into the lord in some translations but

9
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:14,799
and uh but when he talked about himself he's most commonly referred to himself as the tatagata

10
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,600
t-a-t-h long a g-a-t-a

11
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,439
and it's a kind of enigmatic title for someone it seems to have been

12
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:34,720
a title used in india before the buddha there's many ways of

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:42,960
describing what it means that word most commonly one is to say it means the one who is thus gone or thus come

14
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,079
it can also mean the one who is thus the one who is such

15
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,759
so imagine that you go to see someone and you ask someone who are you

16
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,079
and the person says i am thus i am such

17
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:05,360
the person doesn't highlight any particular characteristics

18
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:12,480
of who they are they don't define themselves in any of the usual way you think wouldn't be fine just say i'm i'm like

19
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,160
this so what you kind of like what you see is what you get

20
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,680
uh but maybe you know just so the suchness that just thus

21
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,440
and so when we often in our lives we are defining ourselves by different

22
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:38,560
characteristics different ideas different values that we have i am this i am that

23
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,400
and when the buddha said i am such i am thus he was not defining himself by any

24
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:50,400
particular thing so this is one of the revolutionary aspects of mindfulness

25
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,920
it is possible to sit and be present for the details of experience

26
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:03,680
but in no way define ourselves by them no way judge ourselves by them or no way

27
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,120
build up itself around it to simply be thus

28
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,800
be such each thing is allowed to be its own suchness each thing is allowed to be its

29
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,760
own experience the in-breath the in-breath the out-breath the out-breath the itch

30
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,080
an itch sound the sound an emotion just the emotion

31
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:34,239
a thought just a thought and uh

32
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,280
the um

33
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,640
so we will just sit here today and maybe this idea of sitting in your suchness

34
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,200
just as you are you're thus just as you are without needing to define anything about yourself or

35
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,680
judge anything or be anything except being present for the details of

36
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,879
experience that arise so

37
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:12,080
assuming a a meditation posture that allows you to be

38
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,720
alert and relaxed

39
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,720
and to gently lower your gaze maybe to 45 degrees

40
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:33,599
with your eyes open let your eyes gaze at nothing in particular

41
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:42,680
let me lose focus letting your eyes be cool and relaxed

42
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,680
and then if you'd like you can gently close your eyes

43
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,600
letting yourself take a few long slow deep breaths

44
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,280
maybe in a gentle rhythm of breathing in three quarters full breaths

45
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,400
as if you're gently swinging on a swing

46
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,639
safely relaxedly enjoyingly

47
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:32,199
breathing in breathing out

48
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,199
and letting your breathing return to normal

49
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,320
and as you exhale

50
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,720
relaxing the muscles of your face

51
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,840
softening the face

52
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,240
letting the face be the face without needing to identify whether

53
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,360
make a self out of it

54
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,080
defining yourself by the face

55
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,919
softening the shoulders maybe feeling the tension in your

56
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,560
shoulders relaxing

57
00:06:52,240 --> 00:07:00,000
and if there is tension in the shoulders let it just be in a relaxed way without

58
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,840
it to saying anything about yourself

59
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,520
the suchness of shoulders being tense

60
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,840
and as you exhale softening your belly

61
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,680
as you're exhaling softening your whole body

62
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,680
relaxing into your body

63
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,160
and feeling this body without making it a self without

64
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,759
defining yourself by it

65
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:59,199
without identifying who you are or judging who you are

66
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:06,520
just the body from the inside out feeling the suchness of the body

67
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,120
and then centering yourself on your breathing

68
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,640
maybe as if there are gentle waves on a wide long

69
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:46,640
ocean and you're you're gently floating

70
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:53,959
on the rising and falling of the of breathing

71
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,080
for a gentle wind

72
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,480
that comes and goes

73
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:32,880
letting go of thoughts as you exhale maybe at the very end of the exhale for

74
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:39,200
a moment beware of

75
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,040
your experience when there is no thinking

76
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:49,880
even just for a moment

77
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,760
beyond your thoughts what is the experience

78
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:18,200
as the inhale begins allow it the suchness of the inhale

79
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:27,760
an inhale that exists whatever way it exists

80
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,839
without defining yourself by it or

81
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,240
relating it to your idea of self and your your idea of the doer

82
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:47,839
just the inhale the suchness of the inhale

83
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,680
as you're breathing if you become aware of any feelings of

84
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,360
pleasant or unpleasant let it just be

85
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,920
in the suchness of pleasantness the suchness of unpleasantness

86
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,760
without defining yourself by it or

87
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,959
relating it to yourself what it means about you

88
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,120
your preferences let the pleasant and unpleasant and just

89
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,360
be there in the suchness the simplicity of each

90
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,839
thing by itself

91
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,679
so

92
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,440
whatever emotions you're feeling mood or state you're in

93
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,600
can you let that be in the suchness of the feeling without

94
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,919
appropriating it to self relating it to self

95
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:03,840
without it having any definition or connection to any idea of self yourself

96
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,320
just the emotion existing by itself maybe you're breathing through it

97
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,039
breathing with it

98
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,720
not doing anything with it just allowing it to be there

99
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,480
as you breathe mindfully

100
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:21,760
in whatever you're thinking to leave it alone the simplicity of a

101
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:28,720
thought without it having any

102
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:36,720
role in how you define yourself characterize yourself

103
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:45,240
have any role of judging yourself

104
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:59,960
even in the evaluation of yourself as a meditator that you should or shouldn't be thinking or

105
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,360
just let the thoughts exist in their own simplicity radical simplicity

106
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:12,640
without any real bearing on

107
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:19,039
who you are what you are just thoughts

108
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:27,799
maybe this way you can easier to just be with a simplicity of breathing

109
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,840
and thoughts can just be in the background

110
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,000
nothing to be concerned with

111
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:50,240
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

112
00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:00,559
to take a few breaths to breathe in the simplicity of just being alive just

113
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:06,320
being here simplicity

114
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,759
of being present

115
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:17,120
beyond the ideas thoughts judgments

116
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:23,759
associations the mind makes about being alive being here

117
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:37,440
breathing into the fullness of our simplicity the suchness of just being here

118
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:44,559
and not narrowing ourselves down to some particular

119
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:52,760
aspect of our life suchness of just being

120
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,200
in that suchness of being to welcome in now

121
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:10,559
thoughts and images ideas of other people people you know

122
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,559
people that you'll encounter on the neighbors hood communities places of

123
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:23,919
work people you don't know around the world

124
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:30,240
people who struggle and suffer around all kinds of things including this idea

125
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,480
of self and minds racing and

126
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,840
minds that don't rest in the suchness of their being

127
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:52,840
and then let your care your love extend out

128
00:29:52,840 --> 00:30:00,799
into the world of other people and may your ability to be calmly simply

129
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:07,039
present be a source of kindness

130
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:13,440
care for others may all beings

131
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:20,960
be happy may all beings

132
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:28,000
be safe may all beings

133
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:35,559
be peaceful and may all beings be free

134
00:30:45,570 --> 00:30:49,250
[Music]

135
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:07,600
so good morning again and welcome to our series on this

136
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,440
patana suta discourse on the establishment

137
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,880
establishing of awareness and

138
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:26,000
there's many ways in which awareness is lost or subsumed or collapses into our preoccupation with

139
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,518
our lives and one area is with

140
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,240
all the different aspects of our beingness who we are whatever that is

141
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:45,039
that we can identify and cling to as me myself and mine

142
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:51,919
and and we now we get to this next exercise in the sattipatana suta

143
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:58,159
it has to do with five different areas in which we cling

144
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:05,120
especially clinging to me myself and mine but five prime when we one night one

145
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,760
idea is these five areas are areas which we if we cling we're clinging to one of these five areas and

146
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,279
the kind of the literal meaning of the poly word for this is heaps big heaps of

147
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:22,880
stuff so it's not a very technical idea though because it's

148
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,880
it became kind of enshrined in buddhist philosophy psychology it's kind of took on it or

149
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,480
technical feeling the word is an a usual translation into english is aggregates

150
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:40,320
the bollywood is kanda k-h-a-n-d-a and um

151
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:45,679
it is um five heaps of stuff

152
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:52,799
and sometimes we'll find in the modern dharma teachers will say something like

153
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:57,919
the buddha taught there is no self but what there is it are these five

154
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:04,159
aggregates these five heaps the problem with that is that the buddha never said that

155
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:10,240
and in fact the buddha if anything

156
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,398
saw the five aggregates of five heaps as problematic something which was

157
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:24,240
burdensome that they did us to kind of overcome this burden of the five heaps

158
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:31,200
so to try to explain so this next exercise has to do with these five heaps and the way it's uh

159
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:38,000
described is the five heaps of clinging so the word of clinging is added to it

160
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,158
and so these are five areas in which we cling five areas from which we cling that the five areas in the world of

161
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:51,760
clinging and so we're looking uh deeply into this area of clinging to these five things

162
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,440
and uh and seeing deeply into its nature in a very particular way in this

163
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:05,039
this exercise in the third fourth foundation of of mindfulness of awareness

164
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,640
and so i want to give an analogy

165
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,880
so imagine that it's a beautiful peaceful day and

166
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:25,040
you're out maybe on the beach or if you don't live near the oceans maybe some cup make up some place big

167
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,160
big big beautiful meadow or field that goes on for a long while but

168
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:36,720
imagine a beach wide longs beautiful sandy beach with very clean sand

169
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,640
maybe very soft fine textured sand and walk barefooted just feel so

170
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:49,359
nice and comfortable to feel the warmth and of the sand and the softness of it and

171
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:56,640
the the beach there is a very gradual grade so it's kind of easy to walk on and

172
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:03,440
and it may be many hundreds of yards and from the water up to the wherever the vegetation begins and

173
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,640
you can see up the coast for a long ways

174
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:15,760
and that's just an inspiring day with lots of sky lots of beach and you feel see the suchness of the

175
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:22,320
beach it's just a beach it's just the suchness of it it's inspiring it's nice you can wander freely the sense of

176
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,760
freedom is wandering aimlessly up and down close to the water away from the water

177
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,680
and just to feel so comfortable and so nice and you have such a wonderful day maybe

178
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:40,640
a picnic at some point you can turn around come back and just being in the beach you come back a

179
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,320
week later to thinking you do the same thing because it was so nice but now

180
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,359
the local [Music]

181
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:58,240
beach authorities have made a decision to give easier access or they thought to

182
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,079
the beach to everyone so that everyone would have equal ability to kind of just walk the beach

183
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,200
don't have to worry about people kind of getting in front of them or

184
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:15,040
you know blocking their way or something so they've decided to put

185
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:21,599
fences down the whole length of the beach that maybe are maybe you know

186
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:27,280
it could be ten feet wide or five feet light wide and so they're they're making lanes

187
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,480
and so you have to get a ticket and and uh and reserve a spot beforehand and

188
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,880
you're assigned a lane and now there's these like you know 10-foot or something fences on either

189
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:46,240
side of the lane so people really stay and they have their privacy in their lane because they you know the privacy is important

190
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,280
and so you're given your lane maybe you're lane 38 and now you can just kind

191
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,640
of uh and you're free to walk straight on that lane

192
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:03,520
for as long as there's the beach and so and everyone is free to walk their lane and this way it's equal and

193
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,599
everyone kind of equal access and though you can pay a little bit more to be close to the ocean

194
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,520
and um and so what you're lost then is a suchness the vast freedom just the beach by

195
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:21,440
itself now it's been defined and laid out this is you know

196
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,200
so it's a kind of ridiculous analogy but uh this is what we do to

197
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,480
ourselves uh we are like a vast open beach without

198
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,839
any definition in the sand but we make lines in the sand

199
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:45,200
and we say that um you know that define one thing over another

200
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:52,160
and the five lines that these five heaps are the five kind of lines that we make

201
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:57,838
and so they are uh the word

202
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:05,680
often the first word is called form or sometimes body that people say but form

203
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:12,880
um i prefer the word appearance the physical appearance but form or physicality but not our physical

204
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:19,839
physicality but rather the way it appears to us the second is the feelings of pleasant

205
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:25,359
and unpleasant the third is the basic perception sensation of sensations that

206
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:32,400
occur uh the the fourth is um the kind of mental world of other mental

207
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:38,640
activities concepts ideas wishes aspirations memories

208
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,880
and the and the fifth is consciousness and

209
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,520
it makes some sense maybe to divide up our experience this way but the buddha is suggesting you don't

210
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:59,440
have to divide them up this way once we divide them up this way we cling to them and hold on to them in particular ways

211
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:06,160
and now if we cling to them it's like making a fence making a line making a lane in our experience

212
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:12,640
and we're selecting part of who we are to cling to at the expense of a disconnection with

213
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,560
the rest of it some people cling a lot to their body some people to their comfort and

214
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:24,880
sensuality are pleasant and unpleasant some people to their perceptions their sensations their

215
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:31,520
ideas of things some people to the whole inner landscape and psychology and

216
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,040
and you know all the i think it's a particular special speciality of the

217
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:43,280
psychological modern world where we're so hypersensitive to the little nuances

218
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:49,440
of what we think and what we feel and and

219
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,240
how we judge and how we operate psychologically and there's a lot of clinging there

220
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:04,800
and then there's also this idea of clinging to consciousness to awareness itself as being ultimate as being special

221
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:10,000
and um and so these are five areas of clinging so rather than saying that that

222
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,680
the buddha taught there's no self but rather these five aggregates the buddha said

223
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:20,880
that there's no need to cling but these are

224
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,160
the five areas in which people cling these are five areas in which we divide

225
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,839
ourselves up and then get attached to those divisions and

226
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:38,400
and the idea is to be able to let go of those clinging to allow things to return

227
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,520
to the suchness of our experience the simplicity of just the beingness of

228
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:49,119
things that arise and pass and come and go in fact that's the exercise is in fact

229
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:55,920
to see the arising and passing of each of these five heaps and as we see the arising and passing

230
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,960
then at some point the sense of the division the lines the fences and and sand fall away

231
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,400
and we start being able to see then the rising and passing of all all phenomena

232
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,000
and the suchness of things that occur and um

233
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,240
so we are in the simplicity pristine simplicity of who we are

234
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,839
we don't make any lines we don't make any fences and divisions everything is allowed to exist in its

235
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:32,640
own naturalness its own as it appears and there are sensations in the body there are pleasant and unpleasant and

236
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:38,400
all these things but they exist in this wider broad peaceful

237
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:44,880
uh you know beach and now that there's no lines in it you're just all it's allowed to exist

238
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,960
without clinging to any of it and the first of them is appearance

239
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,079
which is um the physical appearance of how we are and

240
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:01,920
so it's not literally what our physical body is the physicality of it but it's

241
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,520
um the concepts ideas projections um

242
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:13,119
ways of selecting out our physical experience that we get attached to

243
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:19,599
so for example our physical you know physical appearance of our nose our skin or

244
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:27,520
our height or our size it's all these physical ways in which we appear to ourselves and to others

245
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:33,119
and that is not just um kind of the way things are

246
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:39,920
but has something to do with how we select out this is important to judge people by or comment people or

247
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:45,760
notice about people notice about ourselves and the tremendous amount of suffering occurs

248
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:52,560
in the clinging to appearance and to this you know how things appear to us

249
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:58,319
in our body and and the buddha's suggested suggestion is

250
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:03,359
that instead of focusing being caught in the

251
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:09,119
the appearance and concerned and preoccupied by it step back with mindfulness

252
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,680
and see that the world of appearance physical appearance belongs to the world of things

253
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:21,680
that are inconstant changing moving partly because

254
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,880
the uh one form of clinging to the appearance

255
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:32,880
is to think that our appearances are constant or permanent this is who i am

256
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:38,240
the world of appearance is a interactive world between

257
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:43,359
our physicality in the minds values perceptions

258
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:49,839
concepts judgments selectivity project projections that mind makes and if we pay careful

259
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:55,359
attention we see that there's a kind of reconstruction of appearance reconstruction of what's

260
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:00,400
important by selecting what's important and clinging to it and judging it and

261
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:07,920
building up ideas around it and that is what begins to relax and soften as we begin seeing that

262
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:14,720
appearances um both in some way one way or the other as we rest back into the appearance of

263
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:21,760
things that uh there's a flow of inconstancy of a rising and passing that goes on

264
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:28,960
and then the clinging can begin to relax the the the prioritization of certain kind

265
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:36,240
of um projection or certain kind of judgments or commentary can begin letting go

266
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:42,480
and we can begin experiencing the suchness just or the simplicity of being

267
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:49,119
the beingness or the or just be at peace and at ease

268
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:53,760
with how things are with ourselves here

269
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:59,520
so the five aggregates the five heaps and now so that'll be the topic for this

270
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,520
week and so each day i'll take one of the heaps and discuss it some and today was

271
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,800
the appearances got kind of short discussion because it was introduction to the five

272
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:17,440
so thank you and i wish you well and

273
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,480
look forward to being back tomorrow
