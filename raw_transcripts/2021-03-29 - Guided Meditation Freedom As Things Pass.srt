1
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,280
so good morning everyone good day

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:20,720
and uh welcome to this meditation and your meditation where you have the opportunity to

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,400
meditate both to both

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:34,079
with yourself and with a large community and the large community is meant to

5
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,800
support us so that we are more inspired more content

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,600
to really sit here in our own direct experience knowing that there's a wide field of

7
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,879
support of mutuality of companionship

8
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:59,840
on this path and that you're not alone but

9
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,360
and no and knowing you're not alone the willingness to

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:14,240
put everything else aside the best you can to be right here not so much with

11
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,920
yourself but with the experience that's immediate

12
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,000
and current and i love the word current because it

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,600
means both in the present moment and the current of a stream a river and so here we are in the

14
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,720
current of time in that little window of it that's always moving

15
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:45,438
always changing always flowing that we call the present moment

16
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,799
so to

17
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,640
assume a meditation posture

18
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:09,119
and close your eyes and to give some

19
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:17,280
nice attention to the body to adjust the posture

20
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,800
it could be large adjustments small adjustments

21
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,959
just kind of get everything as best you can lined up in harmony enough to what's available to

22
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,319
you in your body to support being here

23
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:43,120
in the current of the present moment through the experience of the body

24
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:52,480
your body is always in the present moment your mind in a sense

25
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,519
seemingly wonders often thoughts about the past and

26
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,519
future and fantasy and in a sense is not so then grounded

27
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:12,480
here in the present moment and so here to bring the mind

28
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:20,560
into harmony with a body with your capacity for attention

29
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,720
with awareness not so much awareness brought to the

30
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,840
body but allowing for the awareness which is in the body

31
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:50,239
and then within this body taking a few long slow deep breaths to begin

32
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:58,080
attuning yourself to the rhythm of breathing the coming and goings of

33
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:06,480
the in-breaths the comings and goings of the out-breaths that here this body breathing

34
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:15,280
is where you'll be centered

35
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,000
and as you exhale relaxing your body is a way to

36
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,840
continue to center yourself here now

37
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,840
letting your breathing return to normal

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,080
and from the inside of the body

39
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,840
noticing where there's tension and holding in your body

40
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:10,720
almost as if you're do you discover the awareness that's inside the tension

41
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,840
and gently as you exhale to continue relaxing the body

42
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,840
relaxing the belly

43
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,560
the more relaxed the belly is the more it's part of the river of

44
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:42,000
change with no sensations frozen in time

45
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,639
the sensations of the belly just move and

46
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:57,280
appear and disappear flow by making room for the next one

47
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,240
relaxing the shoulders maybe a deep relaxation of the shoulders

48
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:21,840
the top of the shoulders shoulder joint down the arm

49
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:29,840
and feeling the vitality the pulse of life the energies that are

50
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:38,400
a little bit freed up when the muscles are not so held tight

51
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:49,840
in relaxing the muscles of the face

52
00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:03,840
as if the face could sit back in an easy chair and just take a break

53
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,240
rest and then within this body as part of

54
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,720
this body become aware of how the body

55
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,840
experiences breathing

56
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:45,840
breathing in and breathing out

57
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:30,400
and to bring a little more careful attention to the breathing so the awareness is more continuous

58
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:41,279
with each inhale and each exhale

59
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:49,440
stay stay stay right there with the whole length of the inhale

60
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:58,480
and notice how the sensations that come into play are changing during that length of time

61
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:13,279
stay with the full length of the exhale and notice how there are changes in the

62
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:23,839
sensations connected to exhaling

63
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:37,680
and not that you're leaning into it or staring at your breathing

64
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:45,519
the more you're settling back and opening allowing receiving

65
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:54,480
the full length of the inhale the full length of the exhale it's the receiving of all the changes

66
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:05,839
that come into play as you breathe

67
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,320
and then notice

68
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:29,600
the path that some sensations pass away

69
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,680
the sensations of inhale come to an end

70
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:45,920
as we begin to exhale some of the sensations within and inhale

71
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,680
pass away come to an end before the end of the inhale

72
00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:00,959
just settle back and without trying too much or straining just receiving

73
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:08,880
appreciate the health how sensations pass away

74
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:17,839
and if they don't don't worry about it just notice the ones that do pass that are no longer here

75
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:24,160
they might return but just noticing noticing their passing

76
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:29,839
or noticing that they're now gone

77
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:33,360
without thinking or reflecting on it you can also open your awareness more

78
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:40,880
widely to be aware of any sensation

79
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:47,279
in how it passes notice what comes to an end

80
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:58,639
passes away and maybe it starts again but just noticing the passing of it

81
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:05,600
or notice the passing of our attention on it because we attention is on one thing and

82
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,760
then it pulls to something else

83
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,160
i appreciate all that is passing away

84
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:35,839
coming to an end

85
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:58,000
as you notice that things are in the process of passing away

86
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:06,080
whereas you notice they have passed away they appreciate

87
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:12,080
that then at that moment those moments it doesn't make sense to cling to

88
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:18,720
anything to depend on something which is fading away which is gone

89
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:29,360
and see if you can appreciate that openness that non-clinging to it

90
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:42,559
the freedom and space that that provides

91
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:51,039
that in and of itself when things pass away in the passing there can be

92
00:18:51,039 --> 00:19:00,720
a feeling of freedom spaciousness peacefulness

93
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:08,240
in and of itself settle back into the flow of present

94
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,320
moment experience appreciating all the things that are

95
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:21,039
passing sounds sensations thoughts

96
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:39,840
anything that changes is also there's part of it that's passing away

97
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:49,360
chances are the thoughts that you had at the beginning are not the same thoughts you have now

98
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:55,840
those thoughts have passed away some of the sensations of your body that

99
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:03,679
were current at the beginning of the meditation may no longer be current something else

100
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:11,679
is what you were feeling has maybe changed

101
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:19,840
it's no longer here

102
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:41,039
appreciate the absence that's left behind

103
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,640
when something disappears or

104
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,679
no longer present

105
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,640
don't be a hurry to feel the absence

106
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:04,400
appreciate the openness the spaciousness the

107
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,760
freedom that comes when there's nothing there to cling to

108
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:29,840
to hold on to or to resist because it's no longer present

109
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:07,039
and as we come to the end of the sitting if you have some sense some feeling for

110
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:12,960
the openness or freedom that comes when something passes away

111
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:20,240
and how it doesn't make sense to cling to something which has passed away in the process of

112
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:27,520
passing away will pass away and even if it's inconstant it comes and

113
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:34,159
goes and comes and goes it's going can teach

114
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:40,880
us the value of not holding on

115
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:49,840
not expecting demanding wanting but allow it to pass

116
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:58,000
and to remain open and free

117
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,840
for the next thing to arise

118
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,480
and if the next thing to arise is another person

119
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:17,760
as you go up through your day and you meet a person you communicate

120
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,559
with a person you think of a person

121
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,840
to become aware of that person in that

122
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:41,360
way of the way of non-attachment the way of openness receptivity

123
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:50,320
the freedom that can come when we don't cling to what is passed away

124
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:59,840
and then maybe we don't cling to what arises we stay open

125
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:12,000
non-clinging non-contentious without need or demand

126
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:20,080
and this can become our gift to others that we receive them and know them

127
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,799
without the filter of our attachments and our demands

128
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:31,919
expectations bias prejudice

129
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:36,000
that in the freedom that we learn

130
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:45,679
we meet people with an openness a peacefulness

131
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,640
and maybe this is one of the gifts that we can offer the world

132
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:01,360
from our meditation practice because may it be that our meditation

133
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:08,000
practice not only benefits ourselves

134
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,440
it benefits others maybe at some point it's even more

135
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,640
valuable for us to meditate when we know we do it

136
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,840
for the welfare and happiness of others

137
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,039
what a gift to be attentive and aware and present for

138
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:37,840
others without any filters of attachment

139
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,840
may all beings be happy

140
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,840
may all beings be safe

141
00:30:52,799 --> 00:31:00,480
may all beings be peaceful

142
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,840
and may all beings everywhere be free

143
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,360
you
