1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,120
so welcome welcome everybody

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,280
and happy new year it's uh nice to be starting the year off in this

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,560
way the first monday of 2022

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:24,480
with sitting together practicing together thank you thank you for this

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:33,200
so maybe i'll just say i said this at the beginning of the guided meditation

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,320
that a good idea to keep an eye on the calendar we may be at the last minute to

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,239
be making some changes on whether individuals will be here at

8
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:51,120
imc for these monday nights for tonight and next week i'm just here by myself

9
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,760
but on the 17th technically right now it'll be open for people to attend but

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,158
that might change depending how the covet goes in this omicron variant so

11
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:11,119
just keep an eye on the calendar okay so back to

12
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:17,759
the dharma here that we're talking about maybe covet is just as much the dharma as

13
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:25,200
anything else but just to say a few words about new year's

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,360
right it's that time of year when we make new year's resolutions

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,960
i didn't know this that there's even a um a technical term for this it's called

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,560
the fresh start effect that people tend to

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,680
want to make big changes in their lives that have a fresh start at particular times

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,719
obvious ones this is the new year but you know i'll start on monday right is kind of a famous thing that we hear

19
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,240
all the times when we have these good habits we want to start we often think okay i'll start on

20
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,520
monday so fresh start at the beginning of the week or beginning of the month or after

21
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,680
our birthday after labor day and for me i there are some things i

22
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,160
like to do and i'm thinking that um the chinese new year which this year is february 1st

23
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,000
i think yeah i'm maybe we'll start some [Music]

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,640
new habits i'd like to incorporate or more incorporate embed

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:40,720
more deeply or something into my life but perhaps you've already started with some new year's resolutions

26
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,560
and i'd like to just uh talk a little bit about this and how in some ways some of

27
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,400
the buddhist teachings have things that can support us as well as modern psychology

28
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:58,239
and how the maybe there's a kind of a meeting of these two

29
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:07,040
but i'm influenced by this youtube video it's had a tremendous

30
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:14,879
number of uh views i don't know how many more than 75 million views

31
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:22,319
and it's about these squirrels who have this real determination this tenacity

32
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:29,680
this perseverance and it's this video by mark rober a former nasa scientist and apple

33
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,760
employee i think he lives here on the peninsula or in the south bay or something like that

34
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:43,680
and the story is is that he had a bird feeder and that squirrels found a way

35
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,519
to get to the bird food despite it being squirrel proof bird feeder

36
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:57,040
and so he decides to have some fun with them i guess and he built a eight-part ninja obstacle

37
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,159
course that these poor little squirrels have to go through um to get to uh food

38
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:09,280
that they wanted and so this video is about that so we might have this idea that like oh

39
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,319
okay well i'm gonna start something new and i wish i had what i'm calling this

40
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,959
squirrel determination you're like if you've ever seen bird feeders and squirrels trying to get to bird feeders

41
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,560
in your own house in your own yard then you know what i'm talking about

42
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,360
this determination they they find a way and maybe i'll say that um

43
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,960
mark rober isn't the only one that has noticed this but there's um last year at the end of 2020 december

44
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,120
31st 2020 rosemary trauma who's this wonderful beautiful poet

45
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:53,680
and she publishes a po a poem every day online

46
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,040
and for new year's eve last year she

47
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,919
published this poem that's called again again and it goes like this

48
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,039
on a day when the world asks too much of me and i don't know how to give it

49
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,960
i think of squirrels at the feeder when i was a girl

50
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:25,919
dad hung the feeder on a squirrel proof wire dad set the feeder on a squirrel-proof

51
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:32,000
pole squirrels found a way surely there's some squirrel

52
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,600
in me some chattering tenacity some bushy-tailed resolve

53
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,560
if i can't be courageous and brave then let me at least be stubborn

54
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,720
surely inside this aching heart is a scamperer willing to

55
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,960
try again to try again to meet disappointment

56
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,560
and failure and exhaustion and try again

57
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:12,319
again so rosemary trauma she also is maybe inspired by these squirrels and somehow

58
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:19,280
we might have this idea that uh if only we could be like that just you have this tenacity or we need it this

59
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:26,479
will power this determination this stubbornness to make these changes in our lives that we want to make happen

60
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,759
but making changes difficult for example

61
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:38,720
if you wanted to have a meditation practice have a more regular meditation practice

62
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,800
it's not so easy i'm sure we've all have notices this i don't think there's

63
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,639
i don't know anybody in which it was just easy from the very beginning well maybe i do know one person but

64
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,479
for the vast majority of us it's not so easy and just making changes part of the

65
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:02,400
reason why it's difficult is because we have to overcome some of our deep rooted

66
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:10,319
instincts that is our tendency to want instant gratification

67
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:18,639
this tends to work against our long-term goals and our change objectives that we might have

68
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,639
also humans have this tendency to be forgetful that sometimes we don't remember oh yeah i was supposed to do

69
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,080
that i was gonna meditate every and every morning first thing in the morning and

70
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,919
here it is already lunch time and i'm only now remembering

71
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:42,000
or it's just natural humans also have this tendency to take the path of least

72
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
resistance and it takes energy and effort to

73
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,919
modify our patterns to make changes in our behaviors or make changes in our

74
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,840
thought patterns anything new that we want to do it takes energy

75
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:06,639
and lastly one other reason why some of the making changes may be difficult is that our

76
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,960
social networks the people that we spend time with in our personal life and our professional

77
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:20,800
lives may not have been constructed with change in mind that is there might be a certain external pressure for us to stay

78
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,000
the same and not change so there's lots of reasons why change is

79
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,560
difficult and the buddha i believe recognized this and

80
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:38,159
he pointed to this quality

81
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:44,479
of determination perseverance tenacity

82
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,320
resolve which in poly is called aritana

83
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,600
and it's this sticking with things even when it is difficult so a certain amount of stick-to-itiveness and

84
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,600
but maybe it's more like this gentle and persistent wind

85
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,720
that keeps blowing and we feel at our back that's encouraging us to

86
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,279
take the next step however small it might be but not to give up but to

87
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,240
take the next step to try again again

88
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,560
and to be sure for some people being steadfast is one of their strengths

89
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:34,800
and the edge of their practice may be something a little bit different maybe for them it's to not push

90
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,440
doing the same thing this perseverance maybe not push it to the point of drudgery

91
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:47,279
or to not cut oneself off from others because they're so focused on finishing a task there's a kind of like

92
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,320
go away don't disturb me i'm have something i have to do here

93
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,160
or maybe they to choose the

94
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,279
edge of their practice maybe is to choose those endeavors those changes

95
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:09,600
those habits that will make the most difference in their lives and the most enriching nourishing and

96
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,760
supportive so resolve aditana is one of the pyramids

97
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,959
and i talked about this i gave a talk about it in november

98
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,680
and so i'm going to talk about something different here but it's the similar

99
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,760
idea this if we want to start a meditation practice for example because it's new

100
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:40,800
years what are some things that we can do we recognize that we there's this what i'm calling

101
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:47,839
squirrel determination those girls who want to get the food in the bird feeder they find a way

102
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,440
but humans aren't like that we well let's say that sometimes we are

103
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,200
that way but we're not all that we're not that way every time for everything we want to

104
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,240
do otherwise there wouldn't be this i don't know how big this

105
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:14,079
diet industry is or the exercise industry is but it's big right how many books and

106
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:20,959
gyms and youtube videos probably too

107
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,480
apps all these things right it's a huge effort to try to support people

108
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,240
to pursue their habits these changes that they'd like to

109
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,480
make so what can our practice do to support us

110
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,519
what can the buddhist teachings do to support us and also how can we

111
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,320
use what we learned to help support our buddhist practice

112
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:57,480
so one thing i'd like to point out is aditana is not the same as stubbornness

113
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:04,880
even in that poem rosemary trauma describes the squirrels as being stubborn

114
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:12,639
and stubbornness is has this uh quality of this um unyielding

115
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:19,279
just no matter what just going straight forward even if it might be harmful or

116
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:27,200
deleterious or not the wise thing to do but doing it anyway so as this really limited view

117
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,959
if i'm just going to do this get out of my way kind of a thing and that's what not

118
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:38,240
that's not what aritana resolve perseverance determination is about in

119
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,920
the buddhist tradition as a parame it's linked to freedom

120
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,600
it's linked to efforts that have a quality of warmth and care

121
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:55,440
and nourishing for ourselves and for others and support for ourself and others but

122
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:02,639
it's like a an integral part of moving towards greater freedom where stubbornness has this way in which

123
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,160
we might feel stuck like no i have to do this even though

124
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,920
it all the pointers might be that um it's not the wise thing to do or the

125
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,720
best thing to do so it's not this type of tunnel vision

126
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,639
nor is aritana this way in which we have to prove ourselves either to ourselves

127
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:32,000
or to others it's not that we're just striving to become the best just so that we can be

128
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:37,440
the best we're striving to become the best versions of ourselves

129
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,560
so that our best wisdom can be offered to the world it can be

130
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,279
and play a role in everything we do

131
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,079
and it's also aritana this resolve is also

132
00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:01,279
not about focus on everything that's in our way with the barriers with the difficulties

133
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:07,040
that we have in our lives the restrictions that we might have in our lives

134
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:14,160
so it's not about trying to obliterate anything that gets in the way

135
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:21,920
because that that type of thinking we tend to fall into well if only x didn't happen

136
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:27,120
or i should have done x it's kind of it's a way in which that type of

137
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,959
thinking can have our will looping quality and doesn't really go forward

138
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:40,079
and of course takes a lot of our energy so i just wanted to clarify a little bit about what odatana

139
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:46,800
resolve isn't so what are some ways

140
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:55,519
in which we can use oritana resolve that recognizes our humanity

141
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,600
that we have limited energy some of us have more

142
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,839
energy than others but we all just have to work with whatever energy we have

143
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,639
and how can we recognize that this how aritana can be a part of

144
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:20,959
our life instead of something that is a

145
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:28,639
we feel like has to be the foundation for every change that we make what i mean by this

146
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:34,079
is often the people who we think of as having the most

147
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:40,639
self-control or the most willpower maybe those people who

148
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,480
talk about how much they meditate every day or how they haven't missed a day of

149
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:53,839
meditation for x amount of time or how many retreats they've done or

150
00:15:53,839 --> 00:16:00,560
something like that we might be thinking that they are exercising willpower you know to make

151
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:08,120
themselves do it or self-control to make themselves do it but actually

152
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,240
will power is overrated that humans we only have so much of it

153
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,160
and it can't sustain us through to help us with some of these really

154
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,160
important qualities to have the best version of our lives

155
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:33,839
and those people who we think are or appears that they are exercising a lot of

156
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:41,839
willpower or self-control is most likely that they've built habits they've built

157
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:49,120
routines they've built systems they've created conditions

158
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,320
to support what these habits for example

159
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,079
meditating every day so they've done this way in which these

160
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:06,240
good behaviors are more on autopilot than requiring willpower

161
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,400
and that's part of the secret here so to be sure it takes energy to start

162
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:19,760
to do anything new and different and to have some perseverance so aditana

163
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,918
resolve is an integral part of buddhist practice integral part of any time we want to

164
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:32,880
make a change but it's not the same as relying on it

165
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:39,520
because it's not always available sometimes we don't feel well

166
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:46,960
sometimes we have emotional difficulties we just don't have the energy

167
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,480
towards some of these new behaviors we're trying to develop sometimes we have physical

168
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,720
difficulties we don't have that energy or the result maybe we get disappointed there's

169
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,960
so there's countless reasons why we can't just

170
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,600
believe the commercial the nike commercial which was must have been a pretty successful commercial

171
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,120
that all of us or many of us know it this idea of just do it

172
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:24,960
i think there's a part of us that thinks that oh yeah i should be able to just do it like everybody else is

173
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:31,280
but chances are that they have created the conditions

174
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,760
in which these new good behaviors makes it more likely that they will

175
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:44,160
happen so to change our behavior to do a new

176
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:52,160
habit to fulfill our new year's resolutions to start a meditation practice

177
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:58,640
we can focus on maybe systems or processes or conditions

178
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,919
rather than specific goals to be sure it's helpful to have goals

179
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:10,720
and it's helpful to have specific goals but goals are about the results we want

180
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,160
to achieve for example having a regular meditation practice

181
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,480
whereas systems are about the processes that lead to those results

182
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,520
and when we're stressed not feeling well don't have a lot of energy

183
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:32,799
these systems these processes can support us

184
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:39,360
and can help us still make movement towards these outcomes we would like these goals

185
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:47,760
without relying on willpower without relying on tremendous amount of resolve

186
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,000
so to change our behavior we can focus on conditions

187
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,520
processes systems and the buddha to be sure taught a lot about this too

188
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,559
so when maybe i'll just say this of course there's a big emphasis on cause and effect the consequences of our

189
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:15,039
actions i recently gave a dharma talk on this topic also and we might say that this is one of the

190
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:21,039
key teachings of the buddha that everything

191
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,320
is a consequence of something else it's um

192
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:31,679
it's just causes and conditions unfolding everything is

193
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:38,640
there isn't anything that arises without a some underlying cause or condition

194
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,280
we know this it's obvious but maybe kind of the

195
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,280
buddhist teachings is just how thorough that is and

196
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:57,600
how there are no exceptions and it's until we have kind of this deep

197
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,000
insight this deep type of knowing can be really transformative

198
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:09,919
but can we knowing having this information can we use it to support our

199
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:17,440
changing our behaviors or starting a meditation practice so one thing that psychologists use this

200
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,200
expression temptation bundling temptation

201
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:29,120
bundling that is to link something alluring

202
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,480
attractive something that we want with something that

203
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,400
takes a lot of energy maybe we're dreading doing don't really want something we should do

204
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,760
to link these two things together an obvious example

205
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:54,000
is some people listen to so common now write podcasts or books on

206
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,840
tape with audible to be listening to have this something that's really engaging

207
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:08,320
and fascinating and interesting really enjoyable for you and uh give yourself the rule

208
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:15,360
i'm only gonna listen to this while i'm out for a walk while i'm at the gym while i'm

209
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,440
doing cleaning the kitchen or you know some something that we feel like we should do

210
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,880
but we're finding a little bit um resistance to doing it we link it with

211
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:34,240
something that we want to do and is fun so this idea of temptation bundling

212
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:42,159
so how can we take this idea of temptation bundling and having to work with our starting a

213
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:48,240
meditation practice one thing is maybe

214
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,520
to reflect on what does the heart love

215
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:02,080
what is what is is there a part of practice that makes your heart sing

216
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:10,320
and is there a way that in a way that makes sense that this can be linked with meditation practice

217
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,080
maybe it's something really small but it's kind of delightful or

218
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,600
meaningful or it touches you in some way and to

219
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,039
have that as part of the meditation practice or the support for

220
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:35,120
practice or so bundling something that we feel like we should do we want to do but

221
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:41,840
have some resistance or difficulties can we link that with something that is delightful

222
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,200
here are some examples maybe there's something

223
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,490
in our heart and our mind that wants to

224
00:23:52,490 --> 00:24:00,640
[Music] have uh express appreciation love gratitude

225
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,960
a way to tap into those individuals who

226
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,720
support us or to feel appreciative that we have a practice or

227
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:18,480
whatever it might be so maybe there's a little bit of we start our meditation practice with just

228
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:24,480
with gratitude or maybe even if that feels like okay that's a little bit too much work maybe

229
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:31,600
there's just this devotional aspect that doesn't have words

230
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:38,480
maybe there's something about i know some people that like to bow before they sit

231
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:46,000
some people bow um just from the waist some do about on the floor but there's something

232
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,120
about this act of bowing

233
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:58,240
that can help us get out of our own way or maybe chanting

234
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,520
i know people who chant the meta suta when they first sit down this is their

235
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,120
practice they chant it out loud or they chant it in their minds i certainly have done

236
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:14,880
this chanted the metasuta i found it uplifting and

237
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:21,919
also a way of kind of get out of my own way or maybe there's

238
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:28,799
reading a suita passage maybe there's some passages that are really uplifting and meaningful for you

239
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:34,000
the dhammapada tariqata terra gata some

240
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:41,919
passages from the suta napata so maybe to say i'm going to do this

241
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,960
practice reading a suta passages chanting bowie

242
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,240
before i sit and then i'm going to sit for

243
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,880
i don't know how long you know some people say you should sit 15 minutes and some people say

244
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,400
well when you're first starting just get into the meditation posture

245
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:11,039
just get into the posture for 60 seconds

246
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:16,960
so temptation bundling maybe there's this part of your

247
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:23,200
practice that you feel fascinated by or curious by

248
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,480
and there's a part of you that likes to learn so like okay i'm only going to read

249
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:36,159
these dharma books after i've sat so i have to sit first so that partly so

250
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:44,080
that the dharma doesn't become just some analytical thing but that it becomes an embodied practice

251
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,919
maybe you could say you know i'm only going to read this book after i've done a set

252
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:56,000
or maybe there's something about ritual that is

253
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,840
comforting soothing maybe not in a way that you can explain

254
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:09,520
to anybody else but maybe there's something about um ringing the bell

255
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:17,279
having a bell especially these days when we're on zoom so often the bells are not satisfying

256
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:23,120
right zoom with its noise cancellation doesn't feel

257
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:29,039
as good as especially this like this spell here is really beautiful and imc i think it's

258
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:34,159
beautiful bringing a bell lighting a candle

259
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:40,480
lighting incense maybe there's something some gesture

260
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:46,799
some activity that makes your heart sing

261
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:51,440
that can be linked to your meditation practice

262
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:59,600
so this is one way this is one support to start meditation practice

263
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:06,320
and then maybe i'll mention this this isn't exactly temptation bundling

264
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,679
but it is highlighting the link between having a settled mind having a collected

265
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:18,640
mind and having the heart sing and that is it's called the gladness

266
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,720
pentad and we see this showing up in all kinds of sutas in so many different ways

267
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,799
and it starts with gladness pented as the name suggests starts with has five elements

268
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:37,039
and starts with gladness gladness joy tranquility

269
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:42,960
happiness concentration maybe that last word i could say samadhi so rather than

270
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:51,360
concentration we can think of it more of a settledness or a collectedness non-distraction

271
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,480
gladness joy tranquil tranquility

272
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:03,039
happiness samadhi there's a real connection allowing our

273
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:08,640
heart to sing to have this happiness of this joy this

274
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,919
gladness that allows there to be some settling it could be a

275
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,158
real support for meditation

276
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,440
so psychologists are using this expression temptation bundling as a way to help us

277
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:33,279
start new habits new year's resolutions and as a support for meditation practice

278
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:41,200
we can think of this idea of temptation bundling what i just described but also this recognition of the gladness pentad

279
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:47,200
what is it that supports gladness and in the buddhist teachings this

280
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,799
cascade goes naturally from gladness down to samadhi

281
00:29:52,799 --> 00:30:00,480
so that's one support for our new year's resolution and next week i'll talk about some more supports

282
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,000
for new year's resolutions or anytime we're making resolutions to support our

283
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,200
meditation practice and maybe i will end with just an

284
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,360
appreciation of practicing with others right now i'm alone in this room but i

285
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:26,399
see some of you on the chat for youtube and just for myself

286
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:33,520
how wonderful it is to practice together makes me glad

287
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:41,880
so with a warm-hearted happy new year thank you
