1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,600
okay so good evening or morning or whatever time it is

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,240
why don't we go ahead and get started welcome to the monday imc sit

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,439
and dharma talk i'm kim allen i think many of you know me so

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,800
please find a posture we'll start with the meditation now finding a posture that's upright

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,160
and also relaxed

6
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,000
really allowing yourself to feel like you've arrived

7
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:50,480
sometimes we've rushed around a bit before turning on the computer

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,960
or we've just been looking at something else on another window so just

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,920
taking a moment to sense that now you're here

10
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,760
now you're with this meditation and allowing the body and the mind to

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,439
come into harmony with that if you're comfortable doing so you can

12
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:27,840
close your eyes bringing the attention inward

13
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:35,200
i'm beginning by connecting into the body grounding in the body

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
so feeling the sensation where you're sitting your seat against the cushion or the

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,640
chair or the bench in your legs or your feet

16
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,840
against the floor

17
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:04,399
having that sense of stability of being supported

18
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,200
and also softening and relaxing and allowing yourself to be supported

19
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:23,680
by what you're sitting on

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:37,680
and then rising up from this stable base is the body with the spine in the middle

21
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:45,599
we may even feel like it is buoyed upward or pulled upward like a sea plant

22
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,560
rising off the c4 it's anchored at the bottom but then can float upward

23
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:59,680
could the body be like that letting the arms float like the front of

24
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,840
the plant letting the head float on the spine

25
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:19,680
finding in these images a way to be upright and also relaxed

26
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:33,840
some degree of ease sitting here

27
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:55,360
i'm deliberately softening the body releasing various areas of tension

28
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,519
so perhaps beginning with the face and the head softening

29
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:08,239
the muscles of the forehead around the mouth

30
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,840
softening the eyes and the eye sockets

31
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,560
the jaw the throat

32
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,919
down into the shoulders shoulder joints

33
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:43,840
letting the shoulder blades slide down the back

34
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,720
down into the chest area

35
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,000
softening the ribcage

36
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,840
releasing the diaphragm

37
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:39,840
down into the belly letting that be soft round

38
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:53,840
finding some ease in the hip joints softening a little farther into the seat

39
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:07,840
and letting go of bracing in the legs all the way down to the feet

40
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:18,840
so having a sense of inviting ease throughout the body without needing it to be any particular

41
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
way

42
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:31,520
this sort of simple usefulness at the beginning of a sit

43
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:38,560
helps set a good tone where the sitting brings in the

44
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:49,840
different parts of the body and mind

45
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:03,759
allowing the attention to connect with the breathing simple sensations of the breath coming

46
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,880
in going out

47
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:17,440
not trying to do it a particular way

48
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:25,360
having a sense of beginning fresh is if you don't know anything about the

49
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
breath

50
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,919
you

51
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,480
we may notice that the mind is caught up in thoughts

52
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:52,480
concerns emotions of various kinds

53
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,240
this is normal

54
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:07,519
when we notice that just gently reorienting to

55
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,680
present moment experience body

56
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,600
mindfulness at the beginning of a sid it may take

57
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:37,839
a little more attention [Music] to steady the mind

58
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:52,240
and then as it settles more there can be a lighter touch

59
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,760
so perhaps noticing in this portion of the sit

60
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:07,839
how we touch the mind to help bring it back

61
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:15,279
how frequently how strongly could it get gentler and quieter

62
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,839
in line with the mind settling a bit

63
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:41,839
as the mind continues to settle

64
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,839
even if it's just a little bit

65
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:56,320
if it's of interest you may wish to direct your mindfulness toward the

66
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,360
beginning of experiences

67
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:07,839
can you notice the very beginning of the in-breath

68
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,839
beginning of the out breath

69
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,840
the beginning of a sound

70
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:47,840
or a body sensation what is it like when you first notice it

71
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,840
maybe even the beginning of a thought

72
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:14,400
it's meant to be done usefully not tightening up the mind ready to

73
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,600
pounce on something that's arising

74
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,880
just gently within your regular mindfulness practice

75
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,840
inclining toward beginnings

76
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
uh

77
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
okay

78
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,660
[Music]

79
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,840
uh

80
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
oh

81
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:43,039
and for the last five minutes of this meditation

82
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:50,240
just release any effort to practice

83
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,919
just allowing the mind to be natural

84
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,520
letting things arise pass

85
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,520
i'm just aiming to rest in the present

86
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
moment

87
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,039
resting the mind in what is already happening

88
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:59,840
beginnings endings we don't have to create either one

89
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:16,399
okay so good evening i wanted to talk tonight

90
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:24,000
about beginning well so wherever you are in the world it's

91
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,840
clear that this pandemic that we're all living with

92
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:36,960
is entering a new phase there's an increased availability of vaccines and all the

93
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,480
complications that come with different variants

94
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:49,760
but nonetheless it's clear enough that things are starting to shift a bit and

95
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:57,919
sometime later this year will be will be different so as we move toward

96
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:04,880
whatever post-pandemic life looks like it is helpful to consider

97
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:13,760
how to pick up new activities well so in this case we actually have

98
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,039
the luxury of time of considering what it is and how it is that we might

99
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,159
want to pick things up as we go forward in some sense we don't

100
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,919
ever really have this time it's just an illusion because every moment right

101
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:37,519
experience is arising it's arriving and arising and we're meeting it and so there's

102
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:44,960
always beginning every moment there's a continual process of beginning but nonetheless there are some times

103
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,559
when we can imagine that we have a beginning that we can think about or move toward in some

104
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:57,919
intentional way so it is worthwhile when we have this time to

105
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,919
begin things well to begin things well so when this is done when we begin well

106
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:10,080
then experience unfolds more naturally and also we're in a better position to

107
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:16,640
learn from experience as it comes and also to make uh the the necessary adjustments to to

108
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,000
staying on course all of that a lot of that depends on beginning well

109
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,279
in some way so what is this you know what does this mean what do the buddhist teachings say about

110
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:36,240
beginnings we hear a lot about endings about cessation and letting go

111
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,519
and being free you sort of imply something dropping

112
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:47,440
away maybe ending suffering the end of suffering is the aim of the path

113
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,279
but what about the beginnings the buddha did talk about beginnings and

114
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:59,120
how to do it well and the teachings mostly focus in three areas

115
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:06,799
our understanding our intention and our effort so we'll talk about

116
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,840
those things tonight

117
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:22,880
i think it's no surprise that we are instructed to pay attention to the mind

118
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:30,159
as we are beginning things you know that's considered a really important place to to notice as we go

119
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:36,320
forward there's the well-known opening stanza of the dhammapada that begins

120
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:42,799
mind is the forerunner of all things so that's pretty clear that

121
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:48,720
how we are in the mind is going to have a major impact on what happens as things go forward

122
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,480
and then more specifically there are other teachings there's one in the majima nikaya that

123
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,240
says quite directly right view comes first right view comes

124
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,679
first so this is about our understanding it doesn't mean let me unpack that a

125
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:11,520
little bit the right view doesn't mean that we are sort of

126
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:18,240
passively applying the view that we receive from the teachings or from our teacher or something

127
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,520
and just sort of sticking it on okay here's the here's the belief i need to apply

128
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:30,320
in order to begin uh it's actually more subtle than that so whatever view

129
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:38,800
we're using and there always is one we always have some kind of a view coming in that's going to provide the context or

130
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,480
the orientation for what follows so then

131
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,079
what right means about right view is that we should adopt an orientation or a view or an

132
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,919
understanding that is appropriate for the task at hand for what it is that

133
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:03,440
we're beginning so in practice and this is the context for that quote right view comes first

134
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:10,240
if the task is walking the buddhist path to the end of suffering to peace to

135
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:15,440
liberation then what we would choose is what is called right view

136
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:22,560
which means an appropriate view for doing that and you know this generally has two

137
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,839
forms because it's this right view is useful for whatever we undertake to make it

138
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:33,119
part of our path so the two forms of this appropriate

139
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:40,000
or right view the first one is the understanding that

140
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:48,160
actions have results and that we have some choice about that so we live in a world that has laws of

141
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:55,119
cause and effect in going on you know they may be more complex than we can exactly see all

142
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:03,040
the details of and they may operate in different ways at different times but generally speaking actions will have consequences

143
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:10,480
and we have some choice about that so in particular actions that come from

144
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,320
a mind that's oriented toward harm will lead to our own

145
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,760
suffering our own dukkha and in contrast actions that come from a

146
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,599
mind oriented toward peace or toward non-harm will tend to bring happiness to us this

147
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:35,440
is one of these of these some of these basic laws of action and consequence so even if we have kind of no idea about

148
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:44,000
the long-term or large picture of what we're doing we can at least in this moment choose to

149
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,480
do actions from an orientation of non-harming and that will be good in some sense

150
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,960
and so people can feel great relief and having this at a as a guide you

151
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,560
don't actually have to have it all figured out in the whole big picture because things are complex especially in

152
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:09,280
something like this pandemic or in a complex interconnected world like we live in so we can you know make some

153
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:14,640
attempt to think about our views and our orientation in the bigger picture but

154
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:20,000
what matters really is that right now we come from a place of non-harming that

155
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:27,280
will have good consequences for us for our happiness and and those around us

156
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:33,839
so that's one wise orientation wise view and then the second dimension

157
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:39,359
of of right view or appropriate view which is actually not so different

158
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:46,640
is to see things specifically in terms of dukkha and its end or suffering in its end

159
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:55,359
or stress in its end so we can notice in a situation what feels stressful or

160
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,960
tense or somehow unsatisfactory we can notice that attune to that

161
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:08,160
and then move toward its release so if i'm entering a room and i feel

162
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,200
some tension in my chest i can notice that and then

163
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:20,240
take care of that in some way notice all my feeling afraid in some way or and what you know what might i do

164
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,920
maybe just being mindful of the fear sufficient or something else but

165
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,359
tuning toward dukkha and its end is a way of orienting toward the four

166
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:39,520
noble truths toward what is it that's challenging right now how am i somehow holding on

167
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:45,599
wanting something in order that that's coming about how could i apply something i know from

168
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:52,720
practice to somehow ease or release some of that suffering you know without making it complex but

169
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:59,280
this orientation of dukkha and its release is very much in line with what we're doing on the path so that's

170
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:07,359
a good guide for our actions as we as we undertake things so even

171
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:13,760
you know just another everyday example is if i'm beginning a work project with somebody

172
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:21,760
and i'm going to talk with them about this project so it's a beginning how do i orient i could orient

173
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,520
toward cultivating kindness active listening a healthy relationship with this person

174
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:33,200
that i'm going to be working with or i could practice mindfulness of not

175
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:39,920
drifting off into my own thoughts but actually staying on task and being clear about

176
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:46,240
what's happening in the conversation those are both forms of this appropriate view that i just talked about

177
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:53,520
and those are very different than say orienting toward okay i've got to convince this person to

178
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:59,359
do it my way i've got to get my point across and make sure that i stay in control of this

179
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,640
thing as it's starting that's very different right so that's going to have a major impact

180
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,839
on how things unfold so and this works on the cushion too we

181
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:14,960
did it in the guided meditation he said if we sit down and we orient toward uh bringing some

182
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:21,359
ease to the body some ease to the mind some sense of what we're doing that will have a different effect than

183
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:27,839
if we don't do those things to orient at the beginning of our sit these simple acts can have very

184
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:32,960
important results for how the meditation proceeds

185
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:39,839
so in general we're asking how can this be wholesome or supportive of the path as i go forward

186
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:46,160
now how can i reduce stuka through this beginning so all of this amounts to right view our

187
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:52,319
understanding and our orientation as we begin a task go into something

188
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:57,440
so right view as you may recall from the steps of the eightfold path

189
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:04,079
it feeds into the next step which is called right intention and that is actually the crux the sort

190
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,319
of key point the crucial point of how we engage skillfully with beginnings i would say that's

191
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:17,359
the key one so classically there are three wholesome intentions that we

192
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:25,119
orient around as we go forward each of which is set up to counteract

193
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:32,800
some kind of unwholesome intention that we might have in the mind some sort of tendency so the intention

194
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:39,280
the first intention is typically called renunciation people don't always connect with that

195
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,720
word so we could also call it letting go or

196
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:51,280
even being at ease if we you know wanted to extend it a little bit so it counteracts

197
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:57,280
the unskillful pursuit of sense pleasure you know just wanting to grasp with the

198
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:03,200
pleasant part wanting to get things that are good and pleasant and useful for me

199
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:11,520
you know these sorts of graspy kinds of orientations the the intention of being generous or

200
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:17,920
renouncing the need for those things is is this first orientation and it's it

201
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:25,280
has a an effect of coming in with an open hand with an open heart with an open mind

202
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:32,400
and then the the second and third of these right intentions or wise intentions are

203
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:39,760
stated as clear counteractions so they're stated as non-ill will and non-cruelty

204
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:46,880
so we also come in with a mind that isn't oriented in a negative or aversive or

205
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:54,079
oppositional way as we move into things or if they're named more in the positive

206
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:59,359
they could be named as good will or as compassion

207
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:07,040
so these are um essentially these three set the tone of our engagement with

208
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:14,640
things so um and the tone the tone that we're setting in life matters so much that's

209
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:21,599
worry that's based in our intention so i guess i'm thinking about work projects today because another

210
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:27,280
i'm thinking of another time that i was beginning a work project and i was

211
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:35,520
sending an email to one of my colleagues about about the project and i noticed that um

212
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:42,319
i kept wanting to include some kind of comment about um

213
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:48,240
their experience with this and a little bit derogatory like you know i know you don't have so much experience

214
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:53,440
with this or something like that i i don't know um but i noticed that there

215
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,560
was a slight feeling of tension around that and i realized that i was kind of

216
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:04,079
trying to question my colleagues level experience of experience in order to elevate my own

217
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:10,400
and therefore show that you know i was going to be able to contribute very well to this project or

218
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:16,560
something so but i i caught this you know luckily as an intention of ill will

219
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:22,240
and i um instead changed what i wanted to write to something that was more

220
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:29,440
inclusive more connecting at the beginning of this project not highlighting their lack of

221
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:34,800
experience or my experience which was a little bit delusional to think that way

222
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,319
and i'm certain that that set a much better tone than if i hadn't done hadn't made that

223
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:47,359
change would have changed the relationship right at the beginning of the project

224
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:54,000
we can also set the tone in advance of an experience or a

225
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,040
situation that we're going into and then just trust that it will carry

226
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,640
us in so for example if we're about to go into a meeting

227
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:10,160
or even a social encounter or a party of some kind

228
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,599
we can as we're walking toward the door or sitting in the car before we go in

229
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:22,240
we can set an intention of good will or of mindfulness or something like that

230
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:29,200
and just orient the mind that way and then you know you don't have to constantly think about it and bring it to mind and

231
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,960
be distracted by it during the counter you just you just set it and then walk in and

232
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:41,280
trust that it will carry through in some way it may not carry you know entirely through the entire

233
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,760
encounter or it may but generally this is a good thing to do with the mind just to orient it well

234
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,040
when you're starting i remember a friend of mine went to

235
00:45:53,040 --> 00:46:00,079
practice in asia and she was doing intensive retreat practice but even in

236
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:07,359
that setting the abbott of the monastery used to ask the people who were practicing there that in

237
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:15,280
the morning when they woke up before they got out of bed to start their day that they spend a few

238
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,960
minutes doing loving-kindness practice and the way he said it was this will set

239
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:27,520
the tone for everything else you do and then you know the rest of the day they were doing mindfulness practice vipassana

240
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:33,760
concentration you know sort of more traditional wisdom practices but he wanted them to

241
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,440
do this loving kindness at the very beginning to set the tone for the for the rest of

242
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:47,680
the day so you might try this also see what you can remember to do in the morning before you get out of bed

243
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:54,720
just to meet the day well so in general we're aiming to

244
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:01,680
act and speak and even think from a place of non-greed non-hatred

245
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:08,000
and non-delusion that's the overall picture and so the three right

246
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:14,319
intentions that i just named are very clearly covering the first two of

247
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:20,319
non-greed and non-hatred so renunciation for example would cover non-greed

248
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:28,640
and in on non-ill will and non-cruelty would cover non-hatred so it encounters

249
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:34,240
those first two you know clear defilements of the mind but then we might ask

250
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:39,599
you know where is non-delusion in terms of orienting ourselves sometimes

251
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:46,400
people have questions about the second step of the path because it doesn't seem to include non-grade non-hatred versus

252
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:55,040
the non-delusion it turns out that that is covered by right view by what we talked about first so um

253
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:02,079
you know having the correct view that we're moving towards suffering in the end of suffering and that

254
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:07,680
our actions have consequences and we have some choice that is non-delusion knowing those

255
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:14,160
things so this three-fold purity of volition if you will non-greed non-hatred

256
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:22,319
non-delusion is the fundamental way to begin and also to proceed and also to end

257
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:28,800
the buddha says very clearly in a different suta that volition or caitanya lies at the heart

258
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:36,880
of action of kama so that strongly influences the results that we experience

259
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:44,800
so that covers a lot of the territory but um all of that is kind of the

260
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:50,960
prep in the mind and so there's also the actual active beginning and what what else do

261
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:56,880
we need to begin well the third thing that i area that i named is that there's something to do

262
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:02,079
with our energy as we actually engage with the

263
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:09,760
beginning of a task and so let's let's talk also about this area of energy

264
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:16,160
the buddha talks about the importance of generating wholesome energy or iberia

265
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:23,119
that's the word for energy or effort as we undertake a task so in particular this is a very stock or

266
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:30,720
standard phrase you'll find in sutas like it goes like this one generates desire makes an effort

267
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:37,680
arouses energy applies one's mind and strives so

268
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,960
i know that that sometimes sounds a little too energetic for those of us in the west who are a little

269
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:48,720
bit uh action oriented and result oriented in some word we're told not to strive quite so

270
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:55,520
strongly but that phrase is very common in the pseudos one generates desire makes an effort

271
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:01,040
arouses energy applies one's mind and strives so we might just encapsulate all

272
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:08,880
of that into that middle phrase arouses energy so that's a viria a roboty that's the poly phrase

273
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:15,680
and arabity means to engage with or to undertake in a sense

274
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:21,520
so we should be willing to put forth some effort for things to go well as

275
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,960
we're beginning so we orient our mind and then we bring forth this kind of wholesome

276
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:32,880
energy to get it going in a sense so instead of being a little bit more passive or

277
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:39,839
lackluster about how we get started on things later when there's momentum then we're

278
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:46,240
encouraged to back off and be a little bit more effortless you might have heard that phrase effortless

279
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:53,200
effort and we did that a little bit in the meditation where at the beginning we were a little bit more attentive and

280
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:58,240
then at the end relaxed our effort and just allowed

281
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:05,200
experience to unfold that's often a good way to think about the energy in a project so

282
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:11,440
why is effort means the right amount of effort and

283
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:17,760
that's one aspect of it is to bring the right amount of effort not too much and not too little and at the beginning

284
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:23,359
when we're just starting things out sometimes for beginnings a fair amount of effort is needed because we're trying

285
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:30,160
to generate momentum or else change direction of momentum that we already had so you

286
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:36,559
might think of beginnings as requiring a little bit more energy a little bit more focused effort

287
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:43,040
to get going in a good direction so

288
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:51,838
considering beginnings i've been kind of orienting us around beginnings in daily life

289
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:58,480
particularly also in this bigger picture of beginning what's going to happen as things start to open up and

290
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:04,720
people come into more contact with each other and maybe we start interacting with more people than we

291
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:11,839
have been these things would be very good to keep in mind but actually there is um quite a bit

292
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:17,680
about beginnings that happens on the cushion too and i also alluded to this in the

293
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:24,480
meditation there's a stage of insight practice where we become very attuned to

294
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,599
beginnings i asked you to do it consciously during

295
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:36,800
the sit but it there's a time when it just comes um without needing to be deliberate about it so the

296
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:42,319
mind um gets really interested in beginnings it's a very it's an interesting

297
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:48,160
fun time of practice because mindfulness gets really sharp because you're you're catching the first

298
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:56,160
moment of things it's like oh you see the the breath um come into being from a moment before

299
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:02,960
when there wasn't one and you see uh you know the in-breath tails off and then the out

300
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:08,559
breath begins we see that first moment when there starts to be uh the air exiting instead of

301
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:15,520
entering and it's exciting and maybe we see um the first shift in a mood you know

302
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:21,200
where we're feeling angry or irritated and but we're we're don't get caught up in it

303
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:26,400
we're mindful and then there comes a moment when it's like it's like the mind sort of

304
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:34,880
turns away from that and we feel something else come in a sense of relief or or joy or peace or many other things

305
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:42,720
we see that first moment we know ah there's the moment where the anger turned and we might also see

306
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:48,720
um the first moment of a thought you know we're sitting it's not that

307
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:54,880
there's absolutely zero thoughts but we're kind of between thoughts and we're not really noticing thoughts

308
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:01,599
at that moment and then we'll see a little spark like the mind starts to form an idea and we see it

309
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:07,119
kind of arising out of the matrix of the mind this idea we can see oh that's going to be a

310
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:12,960
thought in one more instant it's going to break the surface and i'm going to know what those words are

311
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:18,400
and every once in a while one of those will come and we'll be mindful of it and it will just

312
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:25,200
dissipate before it ever forms into the image or the word and we wonder what was that thought

313
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:30,480
going to be you'll never know but it's a fun time of

314
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:37,359
practice seeing these beginnings the wiz there's a lot of wisdom in this to see

315
00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:44,160
and feel um beginnings means that we can also see and feel the very first moment of

316
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:49,280
clinging we were peaceful calm mindful

317
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:55,680
and then the mind started to uh form an identity or attach to something

318
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:01,119
or hold on no don't let that go and we see that we see that little grip and we

319
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:07,200
can feel that the moment that we begin to cling is the moment of the arising of

320
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:15,200
suffering we see the second noble truth is that clinging and suffering are identical and we can only be sure of

321
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:20,960
that if we see them begin and end together so it's important

322
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:27,200
and so then we can start to get wise about how we engage with beginnings because stuff is coming every moment

323
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:34,720
we see if we grasp it we're going to suffer so we learn not to we learn to let it arise as it is

324
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:41,680
to let it be itself as it comes into being without grasping it as mine without

325
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:49,119
putting it in a box so i know what that is and immediately labeling it without controlling

326
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:54,799
letting it arise and have its life whether it's going to be big or small can we just trust that it can come into

327
00:55:54,799 --> 00:56:01,040
being as it is so we start to we start to see this and

328
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:06,960
there's a lot of wisdom that comes from getting intimate with beginnings and with how we relate

329
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:12,720
to beginnings on the cushion and then that will of course feed into

330
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:18,400
how we do it in life also when things come in that are surprising as happens all the time our

331
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:25,599
partner we don't know what her partner is going to say next can we meet it can we just let that be there

332
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:33,520
we turn the corner and see something unexpected can we open to that or do we close off or get scared

333
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:39,119
or try to control it or try to make it what we want it to be we'll see again and again how we're

334
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:45,760
relating to life when we start to see on the cushion how we relate to things coming in beginnings coming into our

335
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:51,520
mind and our body so this is an important area of practice

336
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:58,559
beginnings and as we learn to begin well and engage in ways that are

337
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:03,680
open and connecting and filled with peace good will all those

338
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,960
right intentions that too will help us learn to end well to let go

339
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:16,400
to let things cease to let them end to not clean so

340
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:21,520
all of this is feeding into our wisdom

341
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:28,559
and our compassion so i wish you well in exploring beginnings

342
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:33,920
a very interesting area and also with whatever is beginning in your

343
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:41,200
life beginning in this springtime maybe it's autumn if you're in the southern hemisphere

344
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:46,880
beginning with things opening beginning with seeing more people

345
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:53,200
whenever that occurs you might consider how to meet that well

346
00:57:53,200 --> 00:58:03,359
so many blessings for your practice take care
