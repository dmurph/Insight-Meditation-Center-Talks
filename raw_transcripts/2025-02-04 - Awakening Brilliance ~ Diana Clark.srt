1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,440
good evening good evening welcome

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,480
welcome nice to see you all I was just uh reflecting at the as

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:20,400
Jim rang the bell like it's so nice to sit together I I appreciate it very much so if nothing else thank you for uh

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:27,279
sitting with me for this uh 30 minutes it's there's something lovely about that it's different than when you're

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:36,879
home alone right so I was um earlier ear a number of days

6
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:42,440
ago I was uh reading some of the sutas and preparation for a class I'm going to

7
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,600
teach with some of my friends in a few weeks and reading something that I've

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,000
read many times before and looking at it again and like oh H I hadn't really

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,320
noticed this before this is often how it is I think with the suit does and so

10
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:06,159
many things we look at him again and again and there's always some richness or some depth or some novelty or

11
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,479
something new that shows up it's partly why I like to uh look at them and study

12
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:18,119
them and practice with them but uh one thing that I had just

13
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,439
overlooked before was this whole notion that was in this one little tiny passage

14
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,439
not the main thrust of the suta but just this one little passage this mention of

15
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:37,320
purific ification they're like I don't really like this word like

16
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,920
purification right it kind of like implies that we're impure and I don't know it just feels heavy-handed and

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,200
oppressive and I don't know I just I almost kind of you know ignore it and in

18
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:56,039
my teachings I don't talk about uh this process as one of

19
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:04,200
purification but some of you that might be familiar with this tradition you'll know that there's some lineages not this

20
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,760
one but there's some lineages who put more emphasis on this idea of purification and partly because they are

21
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:19,959
using as a text um something to be authoritative and this book that was written composed

22
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:26,080
maybe about like a thousand years after the Buddha but that's still 1,500 years

23
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,319
ago right so it's still a long time ago but certainly sometime after that

24
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:39,319
Buddha and this book is called the vudi Maga maybe you've heard this kind of gets batted around sometimes vasim

25
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:47,360
Maga this book translated means path of purification and it's a big thick book

26
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:55,000
and purports like how to uh get oneself purified and so it it talks about uh

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,519
this entire path of practice in this context of uh purification

28
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:07,799
it doesn't talk so much about purification it has a lot to do in there about meditation so this idea of purification

29
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:15,200
it certainly isn't um unheard of in this tradition but in the this particular

30
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,560
lineage it's not emphasized and maybe I'll just not to go on and on and on about this I could give

31
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,879
a whole lecture about this right but that's not what we want um this whole

32
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:34,200
notion of purification shows up in the later parts of Buddhism the closer you get to the Buddha as best we can tell

33
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,920
there's not that much about purification so it's something that kind of um came a little bit later and there's a whole

34
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:49,319
reason about that that I won't go into purification I'm not so keen on this

35
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:56,720
idea just because it implies that we're impure and I don't know that just doesn't feel very good so I thought well

36
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,599
why don't I look this up in the PO English dictionary maybe there's another way to understand

37
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:09,000
this maybe there's another way in and you know how like when you look things in the dictionary often like the

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,159
first definition is the most common and then there's a second and third and as

39
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,000
it goes down the list right it becomes more and more obscure well here so the word is vudi

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,440
that's getting translated as Purity or purification the first definition

41
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:34,039
brightness like oh the path of brightness or brightening oh I like this and then

42
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:41,560
the second definition Splendor oh I like this a path of Splendor of Awakening

43
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:48,639
Splendor allowing splendor splendor rizing we can make a new word out of this path of Splendor

44
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:56,400
rising or Excellency is the third definition path of Excellence of

45
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,800
becoming excellent or discovering Excellence or having Excellence around r or something like

46
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:09,360
this the fourth definition is purification so it's interesting that as

47
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:18,840
translators are taking what's the fourth definition and kind of using that as the definitive one so I'm going to use

48
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,199
brightness I like this idea of brightness and this idea that this is a

49
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:30,440
path of brightness or brightening and I what does that mean

50
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:37,240
even this idea of uh brightening there's a few ways we might

51
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:43,960
understand this but one could be like to see things clearly you know like if there's a certain brightness then you

52
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:49,039
can see things clearly they're they're not uh behind some Veil or they're not

53
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:55,080
obscured with Darkness or something like this if there's some brightness you can see things

54
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:00,120
clearly and that's so much what this path of practice is about is being able

55
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,639
to see things in a way that is closer to maybe what's actually happening when

56
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:13,280
we're not overlaying on top of all our ideas or our Notions about how things

57
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,440
should be or what we want or what's mine and yours and all these extra things

58
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:25,120
that we put on them and I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment but this idea of brightening is to see

59
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,520
things clearly to no longer have illusion to no

60
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:38,599
longer be obscured so another way we might think about brightening is like when somebody

61
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:44,680
has a sense of brightness we might say that they have this sense of aliveness or a sense of

62
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:52,120
Vitality or a sense of uh I don't know Joy or maybe Joy is too strong of a word

63
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:58,560
but this not a sense of you know kind of closed down but you know bright is like

64
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,000
meeting the world just looking clearly okay what's out there and this sense of brightness a

65
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,039
sense of uh not being stuck some kind of

66
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:19,039
way so this path of practice is a path of having some aliveness and enthusiasm

67
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,360
maybe we might say or there's a way in which brightness

68
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,560
also can have this sense of creativity this sense of like oh yeah it

69
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,759
a new way seeing things clearly and having some aliveness often brings

70
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:41,759
creativity so seeing things in a new way not just the usual way our habits our

71
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,960
reactions that our patterns that are we become so accustomed to that sometimes

72
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,520
are not so helpful but we're stuck in them so maybe this way of brightness is

73
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,080
of the create creativity like oh to see things from a different perspective or

74
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:05,759
maybe combine things in a new way they had thought of before or something like

75
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,479
this and then maybe there's this way that I also say some brightness we might

76
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:20,360
think about this as some a certain amount of resilience a certain amount of not you

77
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:25,800
know collapsing in the any um sense of difficulty

78
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:31,520
arising but instead with there's seeing clearly and having a sense of Vitality

79
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:36,680
and maybe some creativity then there's this way in which difficulties don't

80
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:42,200
push us around as much or Bowl us over or cause us to collapse or if they do if

81
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,519
it's a big difficulty then if there's some brightness then there's a way that

82
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:55,320
we can find our way out of them or not be uh have the setback quote unquote

83
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:01,720
that lasts as long so this is a this is not a canonical list this is a list that I

84
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,560
made up talking about brightness but this is some of the ways that I think about brightness and I also think about

85
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:13,040
uh this path of practice as one of that helps support these

86
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:18,160
things and so I also want to say just a few words about this whole idea of

87
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:24,279
dullness what what if if brightness or these things well what is dullness like what's the opposite if we don't have

88
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:30,320
this path of brightness path of brightening

89
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,760
I think there's this way in which dullness can have this uh like we're not

90
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:44,200
quite present there's like this uh um overlay like you're not quite meeting

91
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,959
what's there this dullness has a maybe there's a veil in some kind of way

92
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:58,519
between you and experience or you and um other people or there's this not quite I

93
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:05,519
mean there you're there it's not that you're somewhere else but there's this maybe be kind of like a a hesitation or

94
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:12,200
a stepping back or something like this dullness right there's this way of maybe just going through the motions or

95
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:19,000
something like this there's also this way maybe some of you have heard this uh that we talk

96
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,480
about in this tradition about the sword of wisdom you know the sword that can

97
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,000
just cut through delusion when you uh after the sword goes you can see like oh

98
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,680
I see now clearly and dullness right we think that things have not been sharp so this sword

99
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:46,839
of wisdom not being able to show up kind of in a way that could provide some clarity or help us see things in a new

100
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,480
way so I've been talking about this definition of brightness and this

101
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,880
definition of dullness but maybe more specifically what is it that's getting

102
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:05,200
brightened if we're talking about this uh path of

103
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,440
brightening I'll say that one thing that's getting brightened or purified if

104
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:18,360
we want to use that kind of language is our capacity to

105
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:23,800
notice with this mindfulness practice with this practice that we're inside

106
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,560
practice and maybe some concentration practice is our ability to notice

107
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:35,920
and chances are all of you have had this experience that uh when you started a meditation practice a mindfulness

108
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,519
practice this is not uncommon and it was certainly the case for me like wow I had

109
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:47,600
no idea how my mind was like all over the place doing everything except to

110
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,040
being like on the breath like how I wanted it to be like this was kind like the first big Insight that people often

111
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:59,880
have like wow I had no idea that my mind was doing this we just hadn't noticed

112
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,000
and then when we start to like set the intention okay I'm going to do sitting

113
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,720
meditation on the breath we we start to kind of like hone that skill of coming

114
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:18,639
back to those sensations of breathing and then we just start to notice all the things that our mind does the planning

115
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,199
the fantasizing the uh reminiscing you know

116
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:29,600
these types of things but it's not only on the cushion

117
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:37,399
that are noticing kind of like takes up a a notch if often that we can um just

118
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:43,000
start to notice how impatient we get sometimes when we're standing in line at

119
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,360
the grocery store and it's a really long line or how we start to get irritated

120
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,480
with drivers on the road that are going too slow that are going way below the

121
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,440
speed limit or maybe they're not paying attention and swerving around and maybe

122
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:07,440
they're texting while they're supposed to be driving or something and in the past we wouldn't have just noticed our

123
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:14,000
irritation or our impatience we would have just thought well of course I'm irritated or impatient that's the

124
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:20,600
natural order of things but as we start to do this practice we start to notice like oh yeah

125
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:26,440
okay I'm actually irritated and it's possible to not be

126
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:33,399
irritated we start to feel like there's more more of a that things don't have to be that the

127
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:40,600
way that they are that they can be other ways too we're not we don't fall into the Trap of the usual

128
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:46,440
way so maybe that's one of the thing that gets brightened is our

129
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:54,040
noticing and I uh well uh this I had had an experience and I'll say that my

130
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:02,160
experience was not uncommon many people have reported this to me when I'm a teaching a retreat and uh people are

131
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,600
coming in for a practice discussion but I don't know why for some reason this particular Retreat uh these experiences

132
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:14,199
really stick in my mind I don't remember how far in in the retreat it

133
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:20,759
was near the beginning and just going out for a walk doing some walking meditation and

134
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:27,720
uh wanting to go find like the perfect spot for walking meditation and just noticing like oh

135
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:34,279
look there's flowers here wow I never noticed them oh they're so beautiful

136
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:39,360
taking a few steps wow look at these little plant those little round Le oh

137
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:47,160
that is so great wow I didn't noticed and then taking a few steps oh wow look at this just you know the usual things

138
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:53,440
we see all the time just the plants or the flowers or whatever it is all of a sudden everything like just had a

139
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,320
certain Beauty to it a certain maybe they themselves had a certain braak

140
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:05,959
briess so there's this way that are not only do we notice things that we don't

141
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:12,839
notice otherwise but there's also a way in which there can be a like a the

142
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:19,399
beauty of things shine through including things that are not conventionally

143
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:25,560
thought of aesthetically beautiful like the little candy candy

144
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:33,240
bar wrapper like wow that red is really shiny next to the green right these types of

145
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:39,600
things so this brightening of what we notice of what

146
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:46,399
gets noticed because otherwise you know our La our life is passing Us by as

147
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:52,920
we're not really paying attention instead just being on automatic

148
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:58,279
pilot there's this uh Rob Walker he wrote this book that's um the art of

149
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:04,279
noticing he's not a Buddhist practitioner but uh he's a uh I think a

150
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:11,360
professor of design and he has all these great ideas of how to pay attention and it's so much

151
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:19,279
fun I know to think about this and um he has a blog or website or I'm not exactly

152
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:25,959
sure how this gets communicated but uh he has like the saor of the month so like things to

153
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:32,560
notice Shadows like for a month just just noticing Shadows um security

154
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,920
cameras so like spend a month when you're out for a walk just notice like oh wow there's more of these than I

155
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,440
thought or uh small flowers you know so he just identifies just things just to

156
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,199
notice as a way to keep us engaged with our life and some you know

157
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:56,800
provide from his point of view it provides uh a sense of Vitality and aliveness and creativity to kind of like

158
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:02,079
keep sharp our uh a capacity to

159
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:08,720
notice but here's something else that's getting brightened which we might say is

160
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:15,240
really important the art the the capacity to notice can then get applied

161
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:22,120
to all kinds of things whether we intentionally apply it or not it'll just naturally get

162
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:29,200
applied and to one particular area can really lead to more and more freedom

163
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:37,080
more and more ease more and more peace and well-being and that is this

164
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:44,320
brightening of our capacity to notice the view we have of

165
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,760
ourselves The View we have of our I'm saying

166
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:56,480
ourselves um but it's a little bit different than that way there's

167
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,600
this but maybe I'll I'll talk about about it this way we might notice that

168
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:13,080
there's uh different ways to consider I'll just say the self one is just our personality self or

169
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:19,919
our the ways in which we um the roles that we

170
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:27,960
have for example right now I'm in the role of the Dharma teacher I was just visiting my mother it

171
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:33,120
wouldn't go so well if I just showed up to my mom at her house and said okay I'm the

172
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,760
Dharma teacher and gave her darhat talks right this that's just not going to work you know so just this idea that we just

173
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:46,559
take on roles and then we put them down right when they're not needed and sometime we're identified

174
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:53,240
with this like the being a Dharma teacher is an obvious role but sometimes there might

175
00:18:53,240 --> 00:19:01,200
be subtle ways in the family I'm the one who's the Troublemaker or I'm the one who fixes things or I'm the one who

176
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:08,480
supports everybody else or I'm the one that keeps the glue of the family together or I'm the baby that's always

177
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:14,440
complaining and the world has to take care of me or something like

178
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:20,120
this so part of this brightening is starting to notice some of the subtle

179
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:27,320
ways in which we are identifying ourself some of the subtle labels that we have

180
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:33,760
on ourselves I just gave a whole list of things they don't show up specifically as those

181
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,679
words they're thing that we kind of feel into and just notice oh yeah there's a

182
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:46,360
theme Here of the way I'm meeting the world or the way that what's difficult

183
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:54,240
for me and a lot of it is because we are holding on to or clinging onto some

184
00:19:54,240 --> 00:20:00,640
fixed views about ourselves who we are and who we're not

185
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:10,200
so this is part of what gets brightening is maybe we just start to notice oh there's all kinds of different views

186
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:18,480
that I have about myself which one is the right one which one is the true one which one

187
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:26,000
is the real one I'm the one that difficulties following Maps I'm the one that's the

188
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,240
youngest I'm the one that uh knows how to do algebra I don't know I'm just

189
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:39,159
making these things up right so there's this way in which we

190
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:44,919
often we have this sense that there's this entity in the center that's like

191
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:53,000
this constant to which things happen and if that's true well what is

192
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,600
it in the center which view of the self which one

193
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:07,880
you might say well di di no no no it doesn't work that way it's not one I'm like all of these things like

194
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:14,440
okay well then maybe is there a um like mental

195
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:22,799
patterns or maybe habits or something that you do that's uh makes up

196
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:29,080
yourself this thing that feels like it's in the center of everything and then I could ask the same

197
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:37,400
question well which one which pattern which thing that you do often

198
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:44,200
and then you might say well wait don't bother me with that I just feels like there's a self in the center

199
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,240
here and so so much about this maybe this brightening we could say this

200
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:57,400
brightening we start to see oh yeah we're not the [Music] roles and we're not some of the ideas

201
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:04,080
that we have about our ourselves but maybe something that I can

202
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,520
uh say here and I've done this uh during a Dharma talk here before but just to

203
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:18,600
just to ask you let's say that um you could by some magical means let's say

204
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:25,039
that you could have the creativity or

205
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:30,080
intellect of anybody else living or dead

206
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:36,480
or maybe even in the future if you can think that way like if you could have like some of the creativity of some of

207
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:43,320
these brilliant artists and all these mediums or the intellect of somebody who can just solve problems like this or get

208
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:50,360
things done who would it be just take a moment who would it

209
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:03,039
be and then for a second person if you could have the physical

210
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:09,480
capabilities or the physique of any individual living or dead you could have

211
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:16,240
like the B bodily capacities or body of anybody who would it

212
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:24,639
be is there somebody you would choose just take a

213
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,440
moment so this is a trick question

214
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,400
because implicit in even imagining this is the idea like that you could be

215
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,880
yourself with a different mind but how would that

216
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:50,760
work like that's like if if there was a different mind it wouldn't be you right

217
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:57,000
but somehow you feel like there's something inside that with a different mind could still be you or same with the

218
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,240
body that some if a body had a different capacity or looked different or in some kind of

219
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,559
way that would still be you so there's often this way and it's subtle that we

220
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,679
are identifying with either our mental capacity or the body and so this

221
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:20,679
brightening is to start to see oh yeah we're not even that there's there's not even that

222
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:26,320
subtle sense of this constant thing at the

223
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:34,080
center every everything is due to causes and conditions everything I mean there

224
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:42,360
aren't exceptions well I shouldn't say it that way I should say all of our experiences

225
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:48,200
right are just arising and passing away due to causes and conditions so where would that self

226
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:55,679
be it's just this collection of experiences so this brightening is

227
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:04,000
starting to like um maybe like peel away or um help shine through some of this

228
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,240
idea of this causes and conditions is what's uh being experienced not these

229
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:14,919
different ways in which we are uh having this view of this self and then after I

230
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:21,360
say this I feel like I often want to say this is not a belief that you have to adopt this is not something like oh all

231
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:27,960
the Buddhists talk about this not self thing okay I guess so this is more just

232
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,679
have some curiosity and to plant a seed and you might have some you might

233
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:39,720
start to see more and more in your experience like oh yeah this is always changing how could that be this H self

234
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,440
that's at the center or something like

235
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:51,360
this what else is brightening this path I would say our

236
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,559
hearts they showing a little bit brighter we see this people have this

237
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,600
practice maybe you've experienced this St I certainly have as there starts to

238
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,480
be we start to notice more and we start to loosen up some of our grip on this view of who we are and how terrible we

239
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,880
are or how great we are whatever it might be we start to see how oh yeah I'm

240
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,200
not so different than everybody else actually they're struggling

241
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,760
too they have uh ups and downs just like I

242
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:33,120
do and there's this way we start to feel connected and there's much less of a US versus them me versus you and more more

243
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:40,919
of a sense of this common Humanity like oh yeah this being a human not so easy

244
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:46,760
sometimes and it's not unique to me not unique to you this idea that there's

245
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:52,399
difficulties and there's joy and there's love and when we start to see just this

246
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:57,600
common Humanity when it just starts to become evident it the heart can't help

247
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:03,399
but care care about

248
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:10,440
others want there want for there to be less suffering in the world want there to be more ease and

249
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:18,919
peace in the world it's just natural just happens and this is uh often um also

250
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:25,399
when I'm like doing practice discussions people in Retreat are often talking about this like wow I didn't realize

251
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:32,039
like there's so much warmth and love and this type of thing here and again don't

252
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:38,399
take my word for this don't just believe this because I said it just maybe I'm planting a seed and maybe you might

253
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:44,240
notice to see if your heart is like opening or softening in some kind of way

254
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:50,240
maybe a little bit less irritation and ill will and maybe some more

255
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,840
Goodwill so this idea of the path of brightening maybe we might say another

256
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,399
way to say this is like Awakening Brilliance you know just Brilliance with

257
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:12,640
things that are shining and just allow it allowing it to

258
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:18,039
arise we're not making it arise we're not forcing it to arise it's what

259
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:25,240
naturally happens as we start to just pay attention to our experience which is what mindfulness

260
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:33,399
practice is about and maybe there's Sometimes some inquiry some like what is this or is

261
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:41,000
this true or is this just something my thoughts are making up so maybe some mindfulness and some

262
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,360
inquiry can really open up just what uh

263
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:53,639
experience is about and what life is about so Awakening

264
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,559
Brilliance and if I have a poem here that I'm going to close with it's by

265
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:06,399
Rosemary traumer of course it is what would I do without Rosemary's trummer's

266
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,679
poems those you don't know I'm often quoting her poems I think she's a

267
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:18,399
fabulous poet so this poem is called a change in

268
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:24,080
the light and it was written March in the beginning of March

269
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:29,159
2020 right the beginning of the pandemic before we really knew what was happening

270
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:34,799
right right at the beginning we none of us had any idea predicted right what was going to happen

271
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:42,080
but uh here's uh here's this poem a change in the light by Rosemary

272
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:52,640
traumer now while the Moon is hiding behind the clouds now when the rain is falling

273
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,720
midwinter and now that they've told us not to hug or kiss each other for fear

274
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:06,159
of Contracting and spreading disease yes now is the time to find

275
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,640
whatever light we have been hiding inside

276
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:18,640
us whatever measure of Brilliance we've managed to conceal from each other from

277
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,519
ourselves now is the time to bring forth that luminescence and offer it freely to

278
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:32,120
the world now now when light matters

279
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:38,960
most I'll read this again this is a change in the

280
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:46,760
light by Rosemary traumer now while the Moon is hiding

281
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:54,080
behind the clouds now when the rain is falling

282
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:01,240
midwinter and now that they've told us not to hug or kiss each other for fear of Contracting and spreading

283
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:08,360
disease yes now is the time to find whatever light we have been hiding

284
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:17,200
inside us whatever measure of Brilliance we've managed to conceal from each other from

285
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:26,360
ourselves now is the time to bring forth that luminescence and offer it freely to the

286
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:31,960
world now when light matters

287
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:40,000
most light always matters this luminescence this

288
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:46,320
Brilliance this uh light always matters especially when

289
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:56,360
things feel dark especially when it feels like we can't see clearly and there isn't a way

290
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:02,518
forward there's a kind of dark often has its way of kind of like closing

291
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:09,480
down now is when we need light and Brilliance from the heart and from the

292
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:15,399
mind and I'd like to suggest that this practice can support that can support

293
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:21,720
this Brilliance this luminescence this

294
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:34,960
brightness I appreciate that in this poem Rose Mar Traer the poet she offers a number of different Nows Moon behind

295
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:42,240
the clouds when it's raining they've told us not to hug or

296
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,200
kiss but I was thinking like there's so many times in which it feels like it can be

297
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:56,080
dark terrible news from the doctor's office just terrible

298
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,200
news fires all kinds of

299
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:07,559
things and there's a way in which we might want to just like okay not look

300
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:12,679
and uh just keep it in darkness and there can be some wisdom sometimes to

301
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:21,360
like you know not allow ourselves to get overwhelmed or to not uh get feel too

302
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:28,159
agitated right that's the job of the media to get you agitated that they get paid to do this absolutely right this is

303
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:35,320
their job if you're the more agitated you are the more clicking you'll

304
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:46,638
do but now is a time for some Brilliance for some light some illumination I would

305
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,440
say light always matters and so maybe this can be a I'm

306
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:59,638
going to call it instead of the path of purification the path of brightening

307
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:09,200
and with that I think I'll close and open it up to see if there's some comments or questions thank you

308
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:38,520
what to go back to the original word purification what I thought of when you said that is like a 12-step group so you

309
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:45,800
want to meditate but you drink a lot right so another probably you would probably have to do something about that

310
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:51,158
drinking issue to really be able to really to really meditate right so I

311
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:56,760
mean doesn't matter what called brightness illumination purification but I just thought of a 12-step group when

312
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:02,240
you said that like if something is really getting in the way you kind of have to you have to do

313
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,160
something about it right or you can't you can't meditate you know if you're an alcoholic so I don't know if I don't

314
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:15,200
know maybe alcoholic could meditate but you're absolutely right though that there's the things that we have in our lives that don't really surve us I'm

315
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:21,200
sure and I'll commit yeah I'll take it back but I mean there's certain things that that we have that that we do that

316
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:27,680
really do get in the way of our you know our Clarity and I just thought of a 12-step group when you when you say this

317
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:34,160
thank you thank you for saying that yeah yeah this is just maybe a Diana ISM I

318
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,839
just don't like this word purification because I don't like this I don't know I just don't like

319
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:54,839
it than um yeah I had kind of a similar

320
00:35:54,839 --> 00:36:00,319
point I guess like uh not with alcoholism specifically but even just

321
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:07,760
like any other obstacles in life like being really busy at work or in a relationship or anything like that um

322
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,119
you know suffering from the fires as many are these days like I think there's always going to be a lot of things that

323
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,200
are getting in in your way of you know focusing on Shining that that light that

324
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:25,880
you spoke about um and something I personally realize from being here today cuz probably unlike many of you I I

325
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:31,480
haven't been in a while and I I feel kind of bad about that cuz i' wanted to but like it's just very hard to make the

326
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:37,119
time and and from being here I've realized like the value of making the time like you just have to make the time

327
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:44,079
you know like I kind of tried to convince myself that like by getting into meditation in the past you know I

328
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:50,240
I've been enlightened or whatever and like oh now now I think about things better but like it's just not that way

329
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:56,920
you just need to make the time and put down the phone and carve out time from from your work or you know solve your

330
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:02,440
other problems and life and and just um you know really allow yourself the peace

331
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:09,920
to I guess look within and and you can't really short circuit that's that's just something that I kind of realized

332
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:18,119
from I guess making the time today I think it's good that everyone else did too yeah nice nice thank you yeah yeah

333
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:24,880
but it can be also a trap because it can feel this oppressive like oh I have to go to IMC and then there it weighs

334
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,520
heavily on us and then I feel like oh all this story I'm a bad person I'm a bad meditator or something like this and

335
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,599
that that itself can just turn into one more thing that's uh oppressing Us in

336
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:43,640
some kind of way so yeah it's not so easy right to maintain things that are

337
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:51,160
supportive and let go of things that aren't so supportive yeah just recognizing that but I'm glad you're

338
00:37:53,960 --> 00:38:00,079
here anybody else have a comment or something I'd like to

339
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:15,720
say so maybe I'll close by reading this poem one more time just because I like this poem I think

340
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:25,839
it's now while the Moon is hiding behind the clouds now when the rain is falling

341
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:32,839
midwinter and now that they've told us not to hug or kiss each other for fear of Contracting and spreading

342
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:39,760
disease yes now is the time to find whatever light we have been hiding

343
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:47,400
inside us whatever measure of Brilliance we've managed to conceal from each other from

344
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:53,520
ourselves now is the time to bring forth that luminescence and offer it freely to the

345
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:00,520
world now when light Matters Most thank

346
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:07,400
you and wishing you all a bright uh rest of the evening and um if you'd like
