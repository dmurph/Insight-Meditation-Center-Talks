1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:08,519
good morning everyone welcome so glad to be here with you so I'm uh coming up today from Santa

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:15,879
Cruz where I now live I moved there in the fall to IRC in sight retreat center

3
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:23,160
and it's interesting moving back uh because I actually grew up there as a little kid uh so I was I lived there

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:31,000
until I was about 10 so most of my childhood memories are there and it's been really fun kind of read exploring

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,600
that landscape and um different memories coming up uh one of which uh is about

6
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,000
the Santa Cruz boardwalk um I hear knowing laughter um

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,559
yes it's great for those that don't know it's this great uh old amusement park

8
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:56,039
right on the beach and it has this like really rickety old wooden roller coaster

9
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,960
ancient roller coaster and I used to go with my to uh to the boardwalk with my

10
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:08,880
my little best friend Binky and um and we kind of like worked our way up to uh

11
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,360
the roller coaster you know started with the smaller rides and over the years uh made our way to the roller coaster and

12
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,560
um uh like many roller coasters there's like at kind of the the Pinnacle of the

13
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:28,280
roller coaster there's a a photograph that's taken and um there's just yeah

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:36,680
something uh really stuck with me one of the times we you know made it on the roller coaster uh one of these photos uh

15
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,399
the way it came out in it one of us was like gripping the safety bar for dear

16
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,560
life like hunkered down with this expression of total Terror uh and the

17
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,719
other one had their hands in the air just like total

18
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:59,000
Glee um and it struck me there's just something interesting to me about that

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,399
because here it is one ride two very different ways to ride

20
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:12,640
it so uh we could say that our life is a little like a roller coaster you highs

21
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:18,720
and lows ups and downs uh and typically we cling to each

22
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,760
state you know pleasure pain gain loss praise and blame we get really happy and

23
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,000
excited when the pleasant things come we get upset when the UN unpleasant things

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,280
come so this is this is how we typically do it and it can become a really rough

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,959
roller coaster uh when we get thrown out thrown around by all of those highs and

26
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:47,599
lows and so here here we have this one life and we can cling to the safety bar

27
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:55,239
totally freaked out uh for the whole roller coaster uh or uh we can learn to

28
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:02,200
let go put our hands in the air and enjoy the ride and of course you know

29
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:10,080
ultimately we want to be here for the whole ride I used to have a teacher who would say can you be here for the whole

30
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,799
ride um because a lot of times it feels like we you know we don't we want to we're we're on the ride to get to the

31
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:22,720
end of the ride like when when's this ride going to be over like I want the safe Dismount but that's not how we want to

32
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:28,159
live our lives we're not we're we're not living to get to the end of the ride

33
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:35,000
um yeah we want to learn how to be here for the full full spectrum of Human

34
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:42,599
Experience so um so this morning uh I want to talk about how to

35
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:49,840
how to be on the roller coaster without feeling like you're always on a roller

36
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:56,400
coaster or in other words uh how can we be with the vicissitudes of Life uh the

37
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,159
ups and the Downs um without Feeling unmowed by

38
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,480
them so in other words uh this morning I'll be talking about

39
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,640
equinity this um this great balancing factor of

40
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,120
equinity and as you probably know in Buddhism there's lots and lots of

41
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,800
lists and uh and equinity appears all over the place so it's uh it's the

42
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:34,280
Capstone of the seven factors of Awakening uh it's in the uh the paramitas it's in

43
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:41,720
the Brahma the it's the last of the Brahma viharas so clearly an important

44
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:49,320
teaching and uh the Buddha said that the mind of e equinity is um abundant

45
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:56,240
exalted immeasurable without hostility and without ill will It's A Beautiful

46
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,440
Mind um what is it exactly um this isn't a

47
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:08,160
word that's used a lot in modern parland and we don't hear that term if if you're

48
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,199
in Buddhist circles you start hearing that term more but so what is it so the

49
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,600
word equinity it comes from um uh the Latin Aquis

50
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,520
equal and animous mind so equal mind so it's pointing to this uh this the quanus

51
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,440
mind is is balanced it's stable it's unshakable so sometimes equinity is

52
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:38,680
compared to a m being Mountain like so a mountain a mountain doesn't care whether

53
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:43,840
it gets rained on or if it gets beaten with snow uh and it's impartial about

54
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,759
whether it's um gloomy weather or whether the Sun's shining brightly it's

55
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,120
stable it's steady just

56
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,600
receiving so we can actually be like that mountain and it's actually like a

57
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,880
pretty extraordinary possibility that it's it's possible in this life to be

58
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,520
imperturbable that we can um that nothing can destabilize the

59
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,000
mind because we typically think that we need to have pleasant experiences uh to

60
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,520
be happy and avoid unpleasant experiences like that's kind of the name of the game um but that actually like a

61
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:33,080
more reliable a deeper happiness is available um that that's um unaffected

62
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:39,520
by um uh the changing flavors of pleasant and

63
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:46,400
unpleasant and to to be clear um I had somebody ask me like wait so so with

64
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:52,000
equinity are we just like kind of flatlining like turning ourselves into

65
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,199
like an emotion emotionless being and I was like no the goal is not to become a

66
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:04,960
zombie like that's not that's not actually we're going here uh going for here so yeah equinity it's not cold it's

67
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:12,240
not indifferent uh that's um like on the contrary it actually equinity provides

68
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:19,400
the non-reactive foundation for compassionate action so it's um so that

69
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,280
it has heart eonity has heart uh there there's a line by TS Elliot that I think

70
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:33,120
describes this well he said teach me to care and not to

71
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,960
care teach me to care and not to care so often when we when we deeply care about

72
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:47,919
something or someone we can get really uh upset and know uh riled up uh in

73
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,319
relation to that thing or that person you know if anything goes ay for example

74
00:07:53,319 --> 00:08:00,360
um and indifference you know that's you know when we just don't care at all so equinity it lives somewhere in the

75
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,240
center of this uh teach me to care and not to care uh you it's possible to

76
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,440
care care very deeply but not in a way that makes us lose our

77
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:19,280
balance so now there are there are two classic manifestations of of equinity

78
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,159
that I'd like to unpack for you today and this is because the single English

79
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:32,399
word equinity is actually translating to separate poly wordss in the Buddhist

80
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,479
sutas so um which is interesting because we would never know because it just gets

81
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:42,800
translated as this what one word um uh but the two words are

82
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:49,519
UPA and then uh the second is tatra uh tatra majat I just learned a new

83
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,279
pronunciation of it tatra majat so um so the most frequent of the

84
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:02,200
two that's used in the sutas is UPA so I'll start there so that's what we see like in the Brahma vhar is UPA

85
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:09,920
translated as equ equinity so uh UPA it means uh maybe if it were like even more

86
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:15,240
directly translated than equinity it means uh to look

87
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:21,040
over so when when I think of that to look over I think of like a bird's eye

88
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,480
view so if there's if there's a wildfire uh it's different to be caught

89
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:34,160
inside the wildfire then it is looking over the Wildfire from above right that

90
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,120
has that's like a palpably different experience so you know with bird's eye view to look

91
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:47,519
over so in practice to look over our experience um is to be mindful of it

92
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:54,360
it's to observe it um and when we do this we become less entangled in it uh

93
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:01,560
we get less caught in it uh so to look over to observe our

94
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:07,600
experience and when we do this uh when we do this it can give us a feeling of

95
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:15,279
space and space is a very liberating thing spaciousness can provide a lot of

96
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:21,760
equinity and when I was first learning about this I was like what like what's so special about space like how does

97
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,800
that actually help uh so maybe an analogy for

98
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:33,200
you uh so you could probably imagine imagine what it would be like to be uh

99
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,360
to be trapped in a swimming pool with a great white

100
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,880
shark pretty scary uh but let's say we take you and

101
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:49,800
we take that great white shark and we put both of you into the vast

102
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:58,440
ocean then what's that like a lot more relaxed yeah so this

103
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:05,160
isn't hypothetic like most humans are willing to get into the ocean and there are actually

104
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:13,200
billions of sharks in there um so like uh like practically speaking that space

105
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,680
really makes a difference you know that space really really makes a difference

106
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:26,360
so uh so equinity it allows us to be um to be with the sharks that are in our

107
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:33,519
own Hearts um in a way where we're not reactive so we can have we can have a

108
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,920
shark in our mind um and feel about it as though as though we're with that

109
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,399
shark in the vast ocean like there's space there's space inside there's a

110
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,800
safety and the ease that that space

111
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:56,639
provides uh so I can remember I can remember times in my own practice when I

112
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,800
was plagued by like a painful cell self story or like there was a very difficult

113
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,120
life circumstance taking place um and it was a little bit like living in a shark

114
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,199
tank I was really uncomfortable with those when those thoughts would get uh get

115
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:19,040
churning um and then I'd go on Retreat uh and I'd sit a whole bunch of

116
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:25,800
meditation and um not always uh but sometimes the mind uh would settle and

117
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:33,160
become still and something would happen uh that thought uh would lose its power

118
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:39,000
over me equinity would grow in the mind and heart

119
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,720
um and that story it might it might float through the mind but the mind

120
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:50,199
would be completely unmoved by it like it had the the ease of being in an ocean

121
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:55,639
like in a great ocean and um and the shark became irrelevant you know that uh

122
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:02,880
it was like being in a pool with a a tiny toy shark um so equinity has this capacity to

123
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:08,399
shift our relationship to what moves through us to um to what we suffer with

124
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,839
such that we have that same ease um and when uh you know with this

125
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:20,639
practice when we relax the thinking mind we release the thoughts um the mental

126
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:27,680
pattern of craving and clinging actually diminishes and with it the contraction in the mind and heart so craving and

127
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,079
clinging or you know felt as a contraction in the body um so when that

128
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:38,880
relaxes the Mind heart relaxes the body re relaxes and we actually have a felt

129
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:48,240
experience of more space so uh uh to be clear um you when

130
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:55,040
talking about bird's eye view and this this sort of spaciousness I want to be really clear that we don't cultivate

131
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,920
equinity by distancing ourselves from objects like that's that's not how we

132
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:08,639
get to the equinity or experience it um on the contrary uh we cultivate equinity

133
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:15,240
through intimacy not through distancing through being intimate with our experience intimate with the objects of

134
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,839
our life um so that we're really present with them remember UPA to look over you

135
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:26,720
know to observe so we're observing our experience uh staying with what's

136
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:33,199
happening being with our experience um and it's through that process that

137
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,839
that sense of spaciousness can arise like sometimes you might have just had the experience of just relaxing and

138
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,680
feeling like there's just more space so it doesn't have to take much but but um

139
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:52,800
but it's through being close that that becomes available not through you know pushing away our

140
00:14:54,279 --> 00:15:00,120
experience so returning to the meaning of UPA looking over uh another image

141
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:07,160
comes to mind uh and that's of of a grandmother sitting in her rocking chair

142
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:13,639
looking over her grandchildren and um the the the

143
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:18,720
grandmother is sitting there and watching her grandkids maybe and having

144
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,959
uh their squabbles and uh sometimes having great times sometimes crying

145
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:32,199
having hard times but the grandmother just watched is it all you know unaffected by the childish

146
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:39,880
dramas loving um but unswayed and so uh in Zen the equanimous

147
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:46,000
mind is sometimes referred to as grandmotherly mind or parental

148
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,600
mind uh so um if I find myself kind of Tangled Up in something um sometimes

149
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:59,399
just bringing in the energy of a grandparent um you know I think it's

150
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:06,480
Temple Smith who says they there sweetheart Mama's

151
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,399
here Mama's here it's okay so just bring that that sweetness you know and and

152
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:21,399
something that I love about this term um parental mind or grandmotherly mind and that that attitude is it brings together

153
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:26,920
uh equinity um with meta like it has it has the spaciousness and ease of

154
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:34,519
equinity but with the the warmth of love and kindness okay so that's

155
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:42,319
UPA um let's move to that second word that I shared the second uh way that a

156
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:49,839
word that gets translated as equinity tatra maata um so if we were to to trans

157
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:56,680
translate that more exactly um it might be something like standing in the middle

158
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:04,079
of all this or I think biku bod translates it as um in the

159
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:12,558
middleness um so right in the middle of our crazy chaotic lives um can we be

160
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,600
upright can we stay standing not be knocked over so that's that's the energy

161
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:23,640
that this this word is pointing to balanced staying balanced even in the

162
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:29,919
midst of the chaos or the difficulty so you might have heard of um

163
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,799
there's these little dolls called DaRuMa dolls they're common in

164
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:44,320
Japan and um they have a little weight in the bottom and I think the rest of it is hollow and if you push it it'll kind

165
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:50,520
of sway over and pop come right back up so it'll sway over if you hit it pop

166
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,880
right back up um so you can't knock them over um and uh this flavor of equinity

167
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:04,000
is a little like that you know something might try to to knock you over but you come right back uh to

168
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:11,480
balance and uh something that I love about DaRuMa dolls uh is that they're uh

169
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:19,880
like um the inspiration for them uh is uh Bodhi Dharma the uh supposed you know

170
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:25,600
first ancestor that brought Buddhism to China and so the Japanese name for Bodhi

171
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:32,520
Dharma is Bod DaRuMa so that's d dolls um and so how fitting that this

172
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:38,240
little toy that can't be knocked over is is named after a Zen master you know a

173
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:46,480
great Buddhist teacher um so we're cultivating cultivating the mind and heart that can't be knocked

174
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:57,400
over so another way we can think of this quality uh it's like standing at the edge of the ocean at the wave break and

175
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:03,600
a huge wave could come over but knock not knock us down so you're getting a

176
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,640
sense of just you know this uprightness not being able to be

177
00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:15,840
destabilized and you might have you know you can recognize this experience you might have had a a day at some point in

178
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:23,720
your life where you were just like in a great mood like there was a sense of of like such well-being and something

179
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:31,080
difficult Could Happen something unfortunate and it just like nothing can ruin this mood like I just like like no

180
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:37,360
problem and there's just sense of equipoise a sense of um

181
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,880
um uh resiliency so one teaching that can uh

182
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:50,440
can support us in contacting uh equinity in daily life is a teaching by uh the

183
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,840
Tha Force Master aan Sumo and the teaching

184
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,640
is it's like this

185
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:08,080
sadness is like this Joy is like

186
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:16,200
this resentment is like this oh resentment is like this

187
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,400
okay so just meeting everything as it comes and as it

188
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,440
goes no preference really

189
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:34,400
simple uh I was on a retreat a long time ago um and I was I think I I think I was

190
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,720
ruminating about uh uh I wanted like a change in my job I think I wanted a

191
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:46,039
promotion or something like that and um all of this wanting mind wanting

192
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:51,080
mind and um at some point the mind went

193
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:58,200
oh desires like this and then a little later oh gosh

194
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:04,000
I've been thinking thinking about this so long like when am I going to get over this like can I finally put this

195
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,240
down oh a verion is like

196
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:16,360
this oh wow gosh it feels so it it's so settling to be able to see the clar uh

197
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:23,400
see what's happening in the mind with such Clarity you know to be able to see desire and aversion I feel so

198
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:30,400
relaxed oh Tranquility is like this so just seeing what's happening in

199
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:38,480
the mind and meeting it with that that gentle curiosity oh it's like

200
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:47,279
this ad John Sumo went on to say be the knower of objects not the

201
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:56,279
owner of objects so typically whatever we experience we identify with it um you

202
00:21:56,279 --> 00:22:02,159
I like it I don't like it I want it I don't want it um so instead of

203
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:09,440
uh needing to own it to take it as self can we simply know it so rather than

204
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:16,240
needing to be the sad one just know sadness is

205
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:24,679
occurring sadness is like this so this uh this act of Simply

206
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:31,919
knowing uh standing in the middle of all this t ra

207
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:37,840
Maj so those are the the two words um

208
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:45,240
and now i' want I want to Pivot a bit to talk a little bit about how equinity functions like how does this actually

209
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:52,320
work um so to understand how equinity can free us from suffering uh it can be

210
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,360
helpful to start by explaining uh how we get ourselves stuck with suffering to

211
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:04,159
begin with and this it's kind of an important thing right like we're all suffering in some

212
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,480
way or another and like how does that happen um and typically it seems like

213
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,919
well there's you know Myriad things that cause suffering in the world um but what's so extraordinary about the

214
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:20,559
Buddhist teaching is that he distilled all of the forms of suffering down to

215
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:26,880
one single Source it's like wow that's a that's pretty brilliant right

216
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:36,159
um uh so he boiled it all down to craving tanha craving so it's this and

217
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:44,279
of course the other side of the coin of craving is aversion so wanting and not wanting desire and rejection this uh

218
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:51,640
force of of uh grasping hold of and pushing away our

219
00:23:53,279 --> 00:24:00,720
experience and this is of course the second Noble Truth the source of suffering is tanha ah

220
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,880
craving thirst um so this craving or

221
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,440
aversion comes into being because we experience something pleasant or

222
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:18,279
unpleasant so on a very basic level something pleasant happens at once one of our sense doors you know we see

223
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:25,480
something pleasant we hear something pleasant we feel something with the body that's unpleasant and then the the

224
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:30,840
Baseline reaction to that is to if it's unpleasant reject it you know try to get

225
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:38,080
rid of it or if it's Pleasant try to get more of it it's a very it's a very simple mechanism um so you know this

226
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:45,600
like uh this food is incredible I've got to eat more of it oh this house is so

227
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:52,919
beautiful I want to buy it um this idea is so exciting I got to make it happen

228
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:59,679
or on the flip ah this person is so annoying like I got to get away from him

229
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:05,120
or like that squeaky door is so obnoxious I need to make it stop or that

230
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:11,120
sight sound smell taste is so um

231
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:17,200
uncomfortable I need to get rid of it so it's happening in our life all day long

232
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,600
every day this this mechanism and often if it's minor we don't really notice it

233
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,080
and more often than not even if it's major we're so fixated on the object the

234
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:35,440
thing that we don't like the squeaky door or the delicious meal that we don't see the mechanism of wanting and not

235
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:41,039
wanting that's happening in between that's actually running the whole show

236
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:48,440
um so what's what's fascinating here is that this whole this whole shebang

237
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:53,559
starts with that Simplicity of just Pleasant and unpleasant right it's so

238
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:58,840
simple so in your own life if there's some form of suffering you might just

239
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:05,320
check is there wanting and not wanting or not wanting here and like beneath

240
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:13,840
that is is there just something that's Pleasant or unpleasant like very very

241
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:21,360
simple so what's um what's extraordinary is that it's actually

242
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:28,080
possible to experience Pleasant and unpleasant without reactivity without

243
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,720
that extra layer of then grasping of of desire and pushing away

244
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:40,440
aversion so so this is where equinity comes in when there's equinity in the

245
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:46,919
mind we can meet extremely painful experiences so unpleasant extremely

246
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:51,960
unpleasant experiences without reactivity um without

247
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:59,720
aversion um without pushing it away so um so I have a a chronic pain condition

248
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,840
and I have spent plenty of time suffering over it uh on meditation Retreats and in daily

249
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:12,200
life um uh but what I found over time through sitting in enough Retreats and

250
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,480
allowing the mind to settle um it became really clear that at

251
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:24,360
its most basic level um the pain was just unpleasant um sometimes very very

252
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:33,279
unpleasant but simply put just unpleasant um the not wanting was extra so all of

253
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:38,880
the like wishing it wasn't there when will this go away how can I get rid of this what am I going to do and all of

254
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:46,120
the the stories that can proliferate out uh and create a story about I'm somebody who's sick or you have a chronic health

255
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:52,159
issue or any stories that could come out of that just distill down just

256
00:27:52,159 --> 00:28:00,360
unpleasant and so uh uh when the when equinity was welldeveloped in the mind

257
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:05,679
um the pain was just like that toy shark right it there it just had no no sway

258
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,840
over the mind um and the mind didn't have any preference uh for anything else

259
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,440
over the pain so there could be a soft Breeze or a bird chirping outside and um

260
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,559
the the mind was received them all as um

261
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,679
uh as equal visitors uh and so to be able to to know

262
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:34,640
that it's possible for the mind to decouple the feeling tone the pleasant

263
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,600
unpleasant um from the reactivity from the wanting and not wanting creates a

264
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:48,240
tremendous amount of Freedom like it's really powerful to be able to know that you have that capacity because all of

265
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,559
the suffering comes from that extra layer of reactivity the wanting and not wanting um so if you can just in daily

266
00:28:54,559 --> 00:29:00,760
life if you can just be in contact with the feeling tone the pleasant or not unpleasant you

267
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:07,519
that's a it's a big Spectrum right very unpleasant to kind of unpleasant kind of neutral kind of somewhere in between

268
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:14,120
neither Pleasant or unpleasant kind of pleasant to like you know the most Pleasant thing a human could experience

269
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:21,880
right so it's a it's a vast range and it can be fascinating to just explore that and get to know it and rest

270
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:29,440
there so there's a a common teaching pain is inevitable but suffering is is

271
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,840
optional so you can see how this teaching really makes sense in light of

272
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:40,039
what I've been sharing that there can be pain but the suffering is extra and

273
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:45,559
that's that's that that uh Second Step of

274
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,760
reactivity so you can you can see from this how how it's actually it's possible

275
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,000
to ride the roller coaster without feeling like you're always on a roller

276
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,200
coaster it's possible to experience the highs and the lows uh without being

277
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:11,159
unmowed by them without being knocked over by them because you can stay close to like oh this is Pleasant oh this is

278
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:19,200
unpleasant that's okay no pushing away no rejecting uh no grasping hold

279
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:27,000
of uh so here's a uh a poem from the uh terata which is the the early Buddhist

280
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:33,200
nuns if your mind becomes firm like a rock

281
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,840
and no longer shakes in a world where everything is

282
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:46,639
shaking your mind will be your greatest friend and suffering will not come your

283
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:56,399
way so how do we cultivate a mind that no longer shakes like how how do we actually

284
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:02,480
cultivate equinity [Applause] uh so there are many supports um many

285
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:08,200
different ways to cultivate equinity um including the the three-fold training of

286
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:17,120
uh Sila Samari and pa uh ethics or um ethical Behavior Sila

287
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:23,440
Samari sometimes translated as concentration this um uh Act of

288
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,760
collecting and Gathering the Mind unifying the mind and then PA

289
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:34,080
wisdom so if this sounds familiar if you're familiar with oh yeah Samar I've

290
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:41,919
heard that um that's the training of the eight-fold path the the eight path factors are can be broken up into Sila

291
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:49,159
Samar and Pa um so so how does this develop equinity how does how does that work um

292
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:55,679
so starting with CA um uh unethical actions like killing and stealing and

293
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:02,919
lying um uh not only only do they create a lot of external harm and Dua suffering

294
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:10,240
um but they they cause a lot of um inner turmoil as well of course um and a mind

295
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:17,120
that's engaging in harmful activity uh it's going to be riddled by uh guilt and

296
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,840
shame and a lot of difficulty so if you take that mind um and and try to have it

297
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:29,200
meditate it's going to have a really difficult time settling down

298
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,480
so um for so for those who are living a virtuous life who are following the

299
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,519
precepts who are living ethically um it's easier for the mind to

300
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:45,720
settle um and of course there's many other benefits to living an ethical life

301
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:54,279
but that's that's one important aspect so Sila uh virtue ethical Behavior Support

302
00:32:54,279 --> 00:33:00,559
Samar concentration this collecting and unifying of the mind so um so there's

303
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:08,639
two two ways I mean there's more than two ways but two ways that I'll mention uh that Som develops equinity so it's

304
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:16,720
starting with Insight the first the second first is Insight second is seclusion so for insight um when the

305
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,080
mind is steady uh it can see clearly into the true nature of

306
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,440
things uh so it can see the mind can have when when there's concentration

307
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:34,840
present uh the mind can see clearly that all things are impermanent it can see clearly um the

308
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:42,159
way suffering truly forms that the source of suffering is grasping uh it can see clearly the

309
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:48,559
selfless nature of phenomena so it can see into these truths

310
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:54,720
um some some teachers use the analogy of a a telescope for this so if you want to

311
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:01,039
see the stars um you can try holding a telescope and trying to see the stars

312
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:08,320
but chances are you're not going to be able to see them very well because of course um the hands aren't so still

313
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:14,240
right um but if we get a tripod and put the telescope on the the

314
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:21,320
triod then we can see the stars so somat is a little bit like the tripod allowing

315
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:26,800
the mind to collect and settle and become concentrated um it it serves the

316
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:34,079
same function of the tripod the mind can become very still and when it's still it can see the

317
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:42,000
true nature of things it can see the truth of um anicha Dua anata you know of

318
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:48,679
uh uh impermanent suffering not self in the same way that a a telescope on a

319
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:54,599
tripod can see the stars so uh so if we want to see the stars in our own

320
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:01,119
practice uh we need uh to engage in this process of settling the

321
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,720
mind uh so when there's in Insight uh when we can see the stars

322
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:14,160
when there's Insight uh there's wisdom PA so that's just one way that Sila

323
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:21,440
Samar and Pa can unfold into a mind um that that can be equanimous because a

324
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:26,560
mind um a mind that sees everything is impermanent is less likely to be

325
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:34,400
reactive because it knows Everything Changes a mind that can has insight into suffering um it's lessly like less

326
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,599
likely to grab hold of experience um because it knows that that's that's Dua

327
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:46,880
that's suffering a mind that sees the selfless nature of things um it doesn't

328
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:55,200
have a reason to cling who is it clinging for so in these ways um the mind is uh

329
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:02,200
can meet experience it can meet Pleasant and unpleasant but not be swayed by

330
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:09,040
them so this is one one unfolding of uh equinity in practice

331
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:15,200
um but uh but Li liberating Insight is not the only way that equinity can come

332
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:21,160
forth in practice um you know just the well-being of an ethical life um Can in

333
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:28,079
itself support equinity I just even remembering that equinity is a possibility in in daily life any given

334
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:35,240
moment can be enough to just invite that that quality in oh and I had mentioned that you know

335
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:43,079
Som there's you know two different um ways that equinity can come forth uh

336
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:48,680
through S and I had shared through Insight the second being seclusion um so

337
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:55,880
in the seven factors of Awakening seventh factor is equinity the sixth factor is concentration so there's a

338
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:04,200
reason right because the concentration supports the equinity uh so this is from Joseph

339
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,880
Goldstein equinity arises out of concentration because concentration has

340
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:17,200
the power to keep the Mind secluded from the hindrances this seclusion then allows

341
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,240
for balance and neutrality to be established and the mind to be unmoving

342
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,040
in the face of Pleasure and Pain so

343
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:35,240
uh concentration secludes the Mind from the hindrances from the wanting the not wanting uh the restlessness the doubt

344
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:41,800
all of the stuff of the mind so it's secluded and that allows for that neutrality and well-being such that the

345
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:50,720
mind doesn't get swayed so there's a way that it's secluded so an analogy for this um you

346
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:57,160
know imagine a little seed that's uh constantly being blown

347
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:04,240
around by the wind um if that's the case it's it's never

348
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:11,280
still enough to take root but if it's if it's allowed to be still for long enough uh that little

349
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:18,160
seed will take root and then even when great winds come it won't be blown

350
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:25,319
away so in the same way when you sit when you're still and

351
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:31,200
you commit yourself to being still allowing the mind to settle uh you're a

352
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:37,319
little like that seed that seed that's landed in one place long enough for its

353
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:42,599
roots to grow and so your roots can grow deep and

354
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:49,240
even when the worldly winds are blowing of uh uh Pleasure and Pain gain and loss

355
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:57,760
praise and blame um you're unmovable you're stable balanced un

356
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:07,079
shakable maybe like a great redwood tree in a storm right uh and so you can you can

357
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:13,319
stand upright in the middle of all this in the

358
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:21,359
middleness and still be free so that's the capacity of this

359
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:30,079
practice rooted and free so let's sit for a minute

360
00:39:56,319 --> 00:40:02,119
together if your mind becomes firm like a rock

361
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:08,359
and no longer shakes in a world where everything is

362
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:15,960
shaking your mind will be your greatest friend and suffering won't come your

363
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:34,720
way [Music]

364
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:37,319
thank you very

365
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:46,240
much so we probably have time

366
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:52,119
for one question or comment

367
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:59,240
reflection if there is one Hillary

368
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:05,200
did you have your holding tight on

369
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,520
the what do you

370
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:20,640
think yeah other times I'm this

371
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:27,640
one yeah that was a quick one there's time

372
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,160
for another

373
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:52,520
question I especially appreciated the two different translations back from

374
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:57,839
Equanimity both in the midst and and the bird's eye

375
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:04,040
view thank you yeah isn't that interesting yeah thanks Martha I think there's one over

376
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:09,240
here is this you hold it like

377
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:18,480
a um so I was wondering if equinity could be like almost on a spectrum like

378
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,440
I'm thinking for like severe grief or like hard moments if there's like a touching into

379
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:30,480
it for a few moments or like I don't know it feels like at

380
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,599
times like I search for equinity or like I'm allowing for it in

381
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:42,880
concentration um and it's like I can touch it but like not be there very long

382
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:52,359
yeah yeah absolutely I think that's that's an astute observation that um um uh equinity can

383
00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:58,520
come in and out of experience so it's not like some it you know you might um you might be able to touch it for a

384
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:05,079
moment and like have a moment where you feel just a little ease and then another wave of grief or another wave of anger

385
00:43:05,079 --> 00:43:10,920
and then you know where it's kind of titrated um so that's one way equinity

386
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,200
is experienced on the flip sometimes equinity can be quite stable but often

387
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,599
that takes like retreat practice um and you know not that that even happens all

388
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:28,839
the time on Retreat um and then there's also a spectrum of um of intensity of

389
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:35,680
equinity where it can be like more light like um like just a little equinity like

390
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:42,000
I'm not quite as upset as I would normally be about X I'm still upset but I'm not as

391
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,680
upset um and then you know on the other end of the spectrum where there's you

392
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:53,359
know that that real sense of equipoise and Stillness and you know completely un

393
00:43:53,359 --> 00:44:02,640
unable to be swayed so yeah they can come forth in many ways yeah thanks okay

394
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:08,319
I think I think that's it for this morning um thank you so much for your

395
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:14,680
kind attention and for your practice it was a pleasure to be here with you take care

396
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,760
folks
