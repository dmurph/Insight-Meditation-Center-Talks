1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,560
good morning everyone and

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:16,680
uh so this is um my first talk of the new year so happy New Year to all of you

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:23,320
and best wishes for the year and it's the custom for me for the

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:30,080
first talk of the year to be on the four noble truths these are a phenomenally

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:37,120
important and valuable uh template for insight for understanding

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,399
for wisdom for finding our way to a degree of

7
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,760
freedom and over these maybe more than 20 years now that I've been doing these

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:55,199
first talk of the year on the four noble truths um what how I've presented it has

9
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,800
changed over the years someone could go back and listen to all of them and track

10
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:12,280
the evolution of my thinking and my understanding of it over time and that speaks to how of um uh useful these are

11
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:19,560
for new understandings for New Perspectives for new ways of touching our heart in some important

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,720
way rather than taking the four noble truths as there's an orthodox true

13
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,280
understanding of it um it's this is very useful thing to engage in and explore

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:39,079
and apply in new ways and um I once sent an email to

15
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:44,640
bobot the famous translator of are these ancient texts a wonderful scholar and

16
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,200
asking about one particular way the Buddha taught the four noble truths and he replied not

17
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:59,960
that it was the true way of understanding them he explained oh that was a particular application

18
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:07,920
was being applied for a particular purpose so this idea so these four noble truths are wonderful things this

19
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,040
simplest way of saying them is just an outline really that

20
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,200
needs to be filled in um there is the truth actually the

21
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,720
they don't use the word this there they use the word this this

22
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,879
is the Noble Truth of suffering this is the Noble Truth of the

23
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:37,800
arising of suffering this is a noble truth of the

24
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,319
cessation and this is a noble truth of the path leading to the sensation of

25
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:49,599
suffering so immediately we realize that this is about suffering which for some people is a

26
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,200
really big word and not only to qualify as suffering it's like the big disasters

27
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,319
of life but uh sometimes uh it's been translated as stress stress and then we

28
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:07,680
can understand that it can apply to the smallest little things in life that are stress in fact it applies to

29
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,159
anything that uh degree of of stress

30
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,680
d-stress that um we might experience that it is possible and

31
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,440
reasonable to become free of to bring to an end and this is the good news of

32
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,799
Buddhism that suffering can come to an end Dua can come to an

33
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:40,480
end and um inherent in this teaching Central to all of Buddhism is the idea

34
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,599
that um of change things change Wonder way the other things

35
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,959
change and sometimes uh other people and myself maybe at times would have worded

36
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,360
this differently would have said Central to Buddhism is idea that everything

37
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,680
passes or everything's impermanent it won't be here all the time and that's

38
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,840
valuable as well to say but that also limits this understanding but if you

39
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,799
hear it as change that applies to Everything Everything Changes except for

40
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:21,600
platonic ideas maybe at least for

41
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,280
Plato and um so the uh uh that things

42
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,360
change and the idea is to find find our Peace by understanding something deep

43
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,360
about change and you hear that in the this wording of the Four Noble Truths the second truth is the

44
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,280
arising and this third Noble Truth is the ceasing the coming and going the

45
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:52,320
Buddha uses the word coming and going sometimes instead of change sometimes he uses appearing and

46
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,520
disappearing and uh sometimes inconstancy is used and sometimes the

47
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,720
word change things becoming different and um so there's this uh

48
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,039
wonderful account of a conversation that um

49
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:16,240
um a uh householder a man had with the

50
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,319
Buddha and um his name was

51
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:26,840
nakula the father of nakula and um he came to the Buddha and

52
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:34,639
paid his respects and then he said this I am

53
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:43,960
old venerable sir aged burdened with years advanced in

54
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:52,880
life come to the last stage Afflicted in body often

55
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,240
ill wow that's quite a statement now

56
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,400
remember this was 20 2500 years ago there was no

57
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,479
ER there was no pain medications there wasn't no blood

58
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:15,639
pressure medication heart medication there was no antibiotics there was no surgery for the

59
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:22,240
back for the hips for all the stuff I mean there's so much that happens in the

60
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,639
modern world that keeps us going kind of kind of tunes us up a little bit for a

61
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:35,039
while now because the march of change that the human body

62
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,120
is will change sometime when you're young if you're lucky you get stronger

63
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:48,360
and more capable and more skilled and if you're lucky enough to grow to be

64
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,120
old for most people change is not a welcome

65
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,440
thing and we spend people spend in this country a lot of money

66
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:07,199
fending off the effects of aging and um I think the time of the

67
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:13,120
Buddha they didn't have botox what they

68
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,599
had that was maybe better than Botox was

69
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:25,280
meditation so this is quite a remarkable statement this man is saying this is how it is for me and you can imagine in the

70
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,840
ancient world that yes being aged and old was you couldn't escape it and there

71
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:39,199
was no sense that you can go down to the local store and get some aspirin and some face cream and you know just kind

72
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,039
of shore it Shore things up for a while uh and so he's just saying this is

73
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:51,360
it's kind of a very clear things have changed for this man and he's clearly stating

74
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,400
it um I am old aged burdened with years advanced in

75
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:05,960
life come to the last agage Afflicted in body often ill he's not

76
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:12,159
complaining he's just saying this is what where I am and

77
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:20,400
um and he then he says uh I rarely get a chance to see the Buddha and hear his

78
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:29,120
teachings May the Buddha please teach me instruct me since this would lead to

79
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,320
my welfare and happiness for a long time so he's asking for teachings here

80
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,360
is my situation things have changed in this kind of way now please offer some

81
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:50,000
teachings and the Buddha replied so it is so it is this body is of your this

82
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,200
body of yours is Afflicted way down encumbered if anyone carrying around

83
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,279
this body were to claim to be healthy even for a moment what does that do to

84
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:11,040
other than foolishness that's a kind of straight strange statement and Powerful

85
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,040
statement

86
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:24,720
therefore you should train yourself thus you should practice this way you should

87
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,920
develop yourself and cultivate yourself in this way with the this Ori

88
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:37,680
a even though I am Afflicted in

89
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,600
body my mind will be unafflicted

90
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:50,320
this is how you should train yourself then the householder nakul

91
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,800
laita having delighted and rejoiced in The Bu in the Buddha statement Rose from

92
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:03,920
his seat and having paid homage to the Buddha uh went to visit the Buddhist disciple

93
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:11,040
venerable saruta and he said to Venable Buddha

94
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,760
this is what the Buddha told me he repeated the conversation and

95
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:24,640
um and he said to saruta it was the Ambrosia of such a

96
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:32,040
Dhat talk that the blessed one anointed me it's a very religious language but

97
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:40,320
you know that Dhat talks it was Ambrosia was very welcome he felt like he was given medicine some wonderful thing and

98
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:47,600
he was anointed he was blessed by it by the Buddha saying what did he say yes

99
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,600
the body can be afflicted but you train yourself so the mind is not

100
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,480
Afflicted when I was in Burma with uh my teacher upand

101
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:06,760
there was uh he was kind of a Stern Fierce General kind

102
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,680
of teacher he had very you know different teachers have very different personality in the same Monastery there

103
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:19,399
was a guy who was just the teacher who was just completely filled with love and you get in his presence and you you

104
00:11:19,399 --> 00:11:24,680
could do no wrong with the pandita you could do everything

105
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:30,160
wrong and um but uh there was twice when

106
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,440
I was studying with him uh giving a talk his eyes sparkled and he kind of like

107
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,959
leaned forward and he said he said something like this he said as you age

108
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,440
the body just gets more and more worn out

109
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:55,800
decays and then he lean with sparkle and say but if your practice your mind gets

110
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,880
brighter and U and he was getting to be an old

111
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:08,600
man himself but as you could see like his theight and what's can happen so he had been training himself pretty much

112
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,639
his whole life this teacher of mine and that was his conclusion that the Mind

113
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:20,279
becomes brighter so um so then Sara said to the

114
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:26,199
the man didn't it occur to

115
00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:32,920
you to question the Buddha further on how one is Afflicted in body

116
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:39,320
and Afflicted in mind and how one is Afflicted in body and not Afflicted in

117
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:47,360
mind that you got this great little teaching you didn't ask him how what to do with it how to practice with it and

118
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:56,040
so the um the man says to sarut well maybe you'll do it and he does so that

119
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:03,639
goes on from there and um and a lot of it has to do with

120
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:11,160
change the um how do we live with

121
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:16,639
change and and how is it we don't live with

122
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:25,079
change and that is one of the key insights and that's one of a lot to do with the four noble truths we

123
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:30,399
suffer when we lock on to something

124
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:38,680
and we're no longer living in the Stream the river of change we get we get preoccupied caught

125
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:44,720
in something this is how it is and uh and the way that theara

126
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:51,639
presents it to this man is when we take something in this universe in our

127
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:59,800
experience this is who I am if you take your appearance

128
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,240
in one way other your appearance defines who you are this is who I

129
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:12,440
am then when the appearances change you'll be distressed you'll

130
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:17,759
suffer if you have idea this is who I have to be and then you look in the

131
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:24,839
mirror and you're not what you were were once I've been surprised sometimes by

132
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:30,040
seeing people uh a big gap some years between seeing them

133
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:35,680
and I realized I was still carrying with me the image of them some years ago

134
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,639
sometimes it's with kids that are growing what and uh and sometimes of seeing

135
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,800
people who get older I'm sure people have done that with me because I'm getting

136
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:51,839
older and uh and one of the curious things about my own self-image that I've

137
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:59,880
seen over these decades um I do this to myself I'm usually a few years behind

138
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:06,000
with my self-image I kind of don't quite I kind of remember myself as you how I was some

139
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,519
years ago and still assume that's the way I am and um and it's I think it's

140
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:19,399
innocent enough I don't think I've suffered too much from that but this orientation to have an idea an image and

141
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:25,839
then lock onto it this is how it should be this is how it is so we can do that with appearance and we know in this

142
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:31,319
Society of ours a tremendous amount of suffering occurs because of how people

143
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:37,720
appear uh how they appear their skin color it's it's that difference that

144
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:45,600
distinction is deadly sometimes for people a lot of discrimination about uh

145
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:50,920
age there's people have told me repeatedly that because they're old

146
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:59,199
because they're old and short how much now they get overlooked people don't even see them anymore they tell me

147
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:04,839
and I stand in line at a store and someone comes along who's tall and young

148
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:11,440
and just kind of talks over them in the store clerk that ignores the person who was there first somehow they feel that

149
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:17,079
they become invisible their appearance and um and then there's

150
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:23,880
expectations of how we're supposed to look and how we want to present ourselves and this

151
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:31,240
changes so there's change in our appearance but that does not need to

152
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,480
afflict the mind and so how do we understand how we

153
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:43,040
how is the Mind becoming Afflicted around the changing of our appearance some of it has to do with how

154
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,319
we lock in we have lock into what it should be we have strong desires

155
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:54,360
expectations we have strong fears that we have to maintain it this way we have

156
00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:00,399
we live in the world of ideas and Concepts and we're kind of oring

157
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:08,600
ourselves around these ideas of how it should be how we should be and what we expect it to be and the odd thing about

158
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:15,480
Concepts and ideas they can be platonic in the sense they can be kind of they don't change and their expectation that

159
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:23,079
things shouldn't change so there can be resistance there can be distress there could be fear all these kinds of things

160
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:30,160
start arising in the mind because our ch our appearances are

161
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:37,280
changing and it's not what we want or it is what we want and then we may be feel

162
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:42,640
happy for a while but it's a happiness that's dependent on that

163
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,280
appearance and then it passes away something happens and it's not there

164
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:53,480
anymore and um so how do we train

165
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,159
ourselves not to be afflicted in the mind when when there's

166
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:06,799
change in the body and um so part of it is understanding what is happening in the

167
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:13,720
mind and and being able to live with direct presence for the changing nature

168
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:19,640
of experience and that's one of the primary purposes of mindfulness

169
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:26,240
meditation is to place ourselves experientially

170
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,799
somatically in the field of change that's all that's what's

171
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:41,799
happening all the time things are changing all the time and um there's a song that was has

172
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:48,400
those lyrics I don't know if some of you old old enough to remember things are changing all the things are changing all

173
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:56,000
the time nothing known will be

174
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,720
mine everything changed that's why I made I made that

175
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:14,080
and U but nothing known nothing that you know will remain mine everything changes

176
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,679
everything so this identification this is me this is mine this is who I am I

177
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:26,200
have to be this kind of person this way and um and so we latch on we hold

178
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:32,960
on and um but what are these ideas Concepts that we latch on to how do we

179
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:39,000
step out of the river of change and

180
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:49,320
um so uh recently I had occasionally I have uh migraines and get nauseous and

181
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:55,799
this recently was relatively mild now it can go so I kind of continued my day but

182
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:03,679
um but the way that I uh I practice with it was to um place myself in my

183
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:09,400
body in the in the in the river of change my body the flow of change the

184
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:16,159
movements and everything and um and so when there was pain I would bring myself to the pain

185
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,559
and when I bring carefully to the pain that becomes more movement more change

186
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:28,640
makes it much more easy sometimes the pain goes away even it's or it's not no longer pain but then was I'm telling

187
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:37,400
telling you this is it became a wonderful vantage point to see how I started get how I got

188
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:43,760
Afflicted in the mind and how I got caught up in the idea oh this is

189
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,159
permanent this is this is may not permanent I knew it was going to be forever that way but this is not going

190
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:54,600
to change for the rest of the day I'm stuck this is terrible this is bad and I

191
00:20:54,600 --> 00:21:01,039
could watch how that would happen as I as I could Swatch I could I could be

192
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:08,600
sitting and practicing with the river of change and this body and then if I kind

193
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:14,159
of got a little bit distracted my mind would go into my head

194
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,760
into my thoughts and as I go into the thoughts I would form this idea it

195
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:26,240
shouldn't be this way this is terrible this is you know should you

196
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:34,120
know you know I must have done something wrong what did I do and so there's this kind of these

197
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:40,400
thoughts where I could started locking into these thoughts these ideas I had a certain amount of fear

198
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:48,559
come up oh this is going get worse and it wasn't just fear that was coming but I would lock onto the fear oh no this

199
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:56,880
locking on this grabbing onto just kind of getting um that's where things got

200
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,039
rified things got solid ify and I was no longer in the river of

201
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:08,080
change I was in this idea or created idea of

202
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,600
permanence and um and then I could see oh look at that Gil you're having you're

203
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:21,720
lock locking on with the mind around something some idea some feelings some attitude some resistance something

204
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,600
that's what the mind is doing it's adding something to the situation wow

205
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:34,159
and then I'd relax go back into the river change and then it'll be okay for a while

206
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,640
until I wasn't doing that I kind of surfaced into my mind again and then had

207
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:46,279
a whole other vantage point to see what the mind is doing that gave birth to my

208
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:52,200
suffering around it and then I would come back in and open I kept opening up to the body that

209
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:58,760
was my practice open up to the change here be open to how things are flowing and moving and things were always

210
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:07,320
flowing and moving and um and it was fascinating also to see then also the to be open to

211
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:13,000
change and see that the thoughts were changing and so I would have the thought

212
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,200
that was something like this will be

213
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:24,880
forever but then I would watch it

214
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:34,120
this was very fleeting word will be just

215
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:41,520
fleeting and forever that word came to the end very

216
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,600
quickly it was just there like for a moment and it made a world of difference

217
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:56,559
to just see it as this word going through that um that rather than this is

218
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,440
going to be forever oh

219
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:08,279
forever forever forever which is you know is succumbing to it and getting caught in it and

220
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:14,400
locked into it and believing it it just for that moment it was

221
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:21,000
forever that because that was the what the word said but it wasn't forever the word wasn't forever the thoughts were

222
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:29,480
not forever the thoughts come and go as well recently also someone I was

223
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,960
presenting on something with a friend and and my friend said well I'm going to offer you my thoughts how I'm thinking

224
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:43,880
about this topic and then we'll hear about Gil what he thinks about this topic and and as soon as he said that um

225
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:50,600
I thought oh yeah I am thinking about it it was the topic and and I could watch

226
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:56,760
it was almost as if I could watch the thinking kind of in the air in front of

227
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:03,520
me like a river just passing by that had no weight no substance it was just a

228
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:11,000
changing flow of thoughts as opposed to sometimes I'm thinking about something and I'm like in

229
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,760
it I'm locked into it I'm concerned with it I'm curious about it I'm exploring it

230
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:22,200
and something about the mind has locked in something about the mind has zeroed

231
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:27,360
in and so that zeroing in locking in can

232
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,760
provide a sense of permanence a sense of constancy a sense that nothing is

233
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:39,559
changing but when my friend said what Gil's going to be thinking about it was just a

234
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:47,159
stream it was kind of like if you it to got watercolors and a brush and you were

235
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:55,200
going to paint a beautiful painting but the surface you were going to paint it on was a flowing

236
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:01,039
river imagine dipping your brush with watercolors to make a stroke in a

237
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:06,720
flowing river maybe you'd leave a trail of color in the but it would just kind

238
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,799
of be washing by and you couldn't really make the

239
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:16,919
picture it was like that's how I saw my thoughts go by the the changing nature

240
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:23,360
of thoughts wow so in that with that there was no

241
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,640
room for those thoughts to afflict the mind

242
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,760
the thoughts can afflict our mind not because of the thoughts but because how

243
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,520
we're involved in thoughts how we lock into them tense up react

244
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:46,720
resist uh you know have an emotional response to it and most emotional

245
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,880
responses are fine it's not the if we stay in the

246
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,960
river of change with emotions things are changing all the

247
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,039
time but if we react to the emotion I've had self-pity many years

248
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:09,240
ago I have this wonderful story for me of self-pity and I could and when I locked

249
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:17,080
into the self-pity it became clear that I suffered and my distress and suffering

250
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:23,559
grew but if I saw it as self-pity and kind of let go of it the suffering

251
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:30,279
disappeared and the physical pain that was associated with disappeared as well so

252
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:38,440
anger fear there's a way in which we get locked in we get caught in it and we

253
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:44,279
don't really see it or respect it or relate to it as part of the changing

254
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:50,919
nature of life and I've seen it works so much better to be with our my my emotional

255
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:57,399
life if I experiences this change constant change and then there's

256
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:02,799
much more room to allow it to be what it is anger

257
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:10,039
arises it's okay but it comes and it goes in and of

258
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:16,960
itself most Emotions Don't last more than a few seconds minute or two or something but what happens what keeps

259
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,080
them going is our feeding it our reacting to it our participation in

260
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:28,559
it but if we can really settle into the changing flow of emotions it's a coll

261
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:37,120
oscope of change and movement so so the for noble

262
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:43,720
truths are as as an honest

263
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:49,279
recognition that I'm suffering I'm I have stress

264
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:54,399
here as nakul told the Buddha in a clear

265
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:00,000
uncomplaining way I'm old and ill and

266
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,320
Afflicted just and now tell me a Dharma talk give me a Dharma talk and the

267
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:12,600
Buddha said yes it's true you are and we say that for ourselves yes it's true I'm

268
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:19,880
suffering and um and can you see the difference between

269
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:25,360
afflictions of the body and and non- affliction of the Mind Train yourself to

270
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,919
look at the Mind look what the mind is doing and so this the second and third Noble

271
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:37,120
Truth have a lot to do with seeing the change stepping out you know stepping

272
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:43,720
back into the river of change rather than being outside of it or caught in it or holding the bucket of the river and

273
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:49,080
saying I have the river and it's burden to carry this heavy bucket put the water

274
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:54,799
back in to the river and watch the rising and passing

275
00:29:54,799 --> 00:30:00,679
watch the coming and going be in the

276
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,519
change and then they come this one they kind of

277
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:16,679
really the one of the most marvelous things about this teachings of the Four Noble Truths is the fourth Noble Truth

278
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:25,120
that if you can know the river of change and see the freedom from that the freedom from locking in feel the ease of

279
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:32,679
the mind or the spaciousness of the mind even a mind that has a migraine you can feel it this Freedom

280
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:38,399
there the psychological Freedom that uh in that

281
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:45,159
flow what is it like to be flowing in the current if everything is change

282
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:52,080
you're change you are the change in fact the Buddha said that the that at some point

283
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:58,760
in practice we enter the stream and when it was asked what is the Stream

284
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:06,760
um it's the EF path in you the stream is a way of living to to be in the flow of

285
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:11,799
of change completely without locking on without getting attached to anything or

286
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:19,240
resisting anything it makes us really wise and the eful path is a

287
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,960
manifestation of that wisdom if you're in the Stream of

288
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:31,880
change in this kind of way you're wise because you can see when you get caught

289
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:37,399
when you're trying to block the river stop don't move don't go when you try to

290
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:43,480
freeze it up when you resist it when you're holding on to things when you're taking

291
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:50,559
a bucket and holding on to that as um and um and that's that's a

292
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:57,000
tremendously wise thing to see look at that just like when I had the migraine I could see that difference and that made

293
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:03,639
a world a difference for me I was able to manage fine with it because I could see what the mind was doing and not give

294
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:11,039
into it and come back to the river of change to see what it's like to have the

295
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:18,120
mind unattached that's the first that's the first uh step of the eight-fold path to

296
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:24,440
be able to see that the Right View to see that operating if you're in the flow of that

297
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:31,919
River you see that if you have have ill will you're caught you see if you have

298
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:41,000
greed if you have hostility you're caught if and if you let go of that you

299
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:47,120
have this wonderful Delight of non ill will nonhostility which is often in

300
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,960
Buddhism is defined as kindness and

301
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:58,960
compassion you if you're really in if you are the change if you are the river

302
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:05,480
of change you see how lying and

303
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:13,159
stealing intentionally wanting to harm anyone takes you out of the river takes

304
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:20,880
you out of the change and you can see how that causes distress stress

305
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,360
suffering and so this wisdom of seeing that unethical Behavior

306
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:35,200
is actually a loss of something very profound some freedom and that's the middle steps of

307
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,679
the eful path and to see that when you're in the flow of the

308
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:48,440
river the the flow of change in us has freed up all kinds of beautiful and

309
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:54,200
healthy and wholesome qualities inside of us to flow Integrity that drive for

310
00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:01,240
honesty for generosity for wisdom for patience for equinity there's all these

311
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:07,760
beautiful qualities that can flow when there isn't any resistance or

312
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,560
locking in or attachment and so and then to be mindful

313
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:19,320
of this and to be mindful of all this and to be settled in oneself in the

314
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:26,760
river of change these are the last three steps of the eful path so the eful path in this this

315
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,358
description is not exactly what you do is what you

316
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:37,398
become if you learn to relax and become the river of

317
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:43,960
change so it's not seeing change which is the beginning First Step but once you

318
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,878
see it then your Daya is to open and relax and become it and in that becoming

319
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:56,000
of it you become a wise person and you understand what it's like

320
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,440
not to be afflicted in mind you might be afflicted in body as you get older some

321
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:07,240
of you probably will be become older and as you

322
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:12,839
do maybe you know something now about not becoming Afflicted in your body in

323
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:18,640
your mind and that's the the premise of the

324
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:26,160
Four Noble Truths that it's possible to come to a place where the

325
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,320
mind is not afflicted believe it or

326
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:37,920
not so those are my thoughts for this year around the four noble truths and I

327
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:44,000
hope that they were meaningful for you in some way evocative in some way and

328
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,040
partly because today we have tea and we still have seven minutes that the Dharma

329
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:56,480
talk time uh if you're willing to stay for a few minutes and talk to someone near you say hello um be nice to greet

330
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,800
someone and welcome them to IMC and even if this is your first time at IMC you're

331
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:07,200
here and you can welcome the person you're hopefully you get you'll get welcome but you could also welcome them

332
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,599
and say hello and introduce yourself and if you want to say something about this talk anything was evocative or

333
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:20,160
interesting or or perplexing or in useful for you maybe uh share a little

334
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:25,960
bit what that was like and so if you it takes a few minutes and then I'll ring a bell and when it's time to stop for the

335
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:32,440
tea and everyone's welcome to stay or you can continue your conversations the one thing I ask is that when you look

336
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:39,400
around to talk to someone um look around maybe talk to two or three people little group of three just so no one's kind of

337
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:45,640
alone because everyone around you turned the other way we want everyone to be included to

338
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:52,720
look around make sure everyone around you is included somehow so please thank you
