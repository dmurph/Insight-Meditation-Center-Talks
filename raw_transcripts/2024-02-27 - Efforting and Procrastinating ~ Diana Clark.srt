1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:07,520
so welcome welcome everyone you know what Jim I wonder if the volume can be just a little bit lower I'm speaking as

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,000
Softly As I can there we go thank you that's a little bit

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:19,800
better nice to see you all here on a Monday

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:26,320
evening so tonight I'm going to continue on a series that I've been doing I think this will be the last in this series and

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:34,040
it's perfectly fine if you weren't here for the earlier one but this series is on like efforting or

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,200
putting forth energy or having determination or resolve or you know

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,120
these types of things like having an aspiration and then moving that

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,960
direction I'm just going to flush it out a little bit more on the talk

9
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:59,000
tonight and I'm going to start uh with a story a story that comes from the suas

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,198
that is the literature from the early Buddhist

11
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:11,560
literature and this um the story is about meia he at this time was the Buddha's

12
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:19,720
attendant some of you may know that Ananda was the Buddha's attendant this was before Ananda so this you know meia

13
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:26,400
and the attendant was somebody that would just take care of whatever the Buddha needed and I don't know exactly

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,840
but in my mind it was like when people were wanted to talk to the Buddha maybe would be the attendant that would say

15
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:38,720
well not right now they're talking to somebody else why don't you come back in an hour or you know something like

16
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:46,479
this so me was the attendant and one day he goes for MMS rounds which you know

17
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:55,159
all of them did this is how they had food and how they supported themselves was to go to m rounds every day so meia

18
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:00,960
goes for Ms rounds and on his way back he's walking along the banks of the

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,880
kimala river and this is like a a detail why is this added there's no particular reason

20
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:15,599
in my mind I'm thinking because it must have been a really Pleasant River because while he's walking back to go

21
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:21,680
see uh after his MMS RS back to where the Buddha is he also notices that

22
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,760
there's this mango Grove nearby and he describes it as really

23
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,840
Pleasant and tranquil and he has just thought oh this would be a good place to

24
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,680
meditate we can imagine right it's not like they have meditation centers Retreat centers or anything like this

25
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,599
right they were having to find just where in nature or sometimes they had buildings too but where would be a good

26
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,280
place to meditate so he while walking along the river found this

27
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,800
spot so he comes back and says to the Buddha I think I'm going to go meditate

28
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,400
at this uh mango Grove and the Buddha says no it's not the

29
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,440
right time right now meia wait for someone else to come here so the Buddha

30
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:18,239
needed an attendant he didn't want to be without his attendant at this time and then magia says but sir you

31
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,280
have no more work to do and nothing that needs Improvement but I do so I kind of

32
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,680
appreciate this like Magie is like really I need to meditate

33
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:39,599
and then the Buddha says no a second time I need please stay here until

34
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,680
there's another attendant and then the meia says in

35
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:50,040
response but sir you have no more work to do and nothing that needs Improvement

36
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:55,640
but I do so this is the third time that uh

37
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:01,319
meia is asking and it's part of the tradition if you ask three times and

38
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:07,079
there's be an acquisition saying yes so the Buddha

39
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:14,319
says what can I say to someone who is speaking of practicing do as you wish so

40
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,959
let's him go so meia I don't know how he feels exactly

41
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,000
but she he seemed pretty determined that he wanted to go meditate right and kind of insisting like you know he was

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,960
putting his own needs in front of the Buddhas at this time like okay I just maybe in my mind I'm imagining that

43
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,000
megie is like wow compared to the Buddha I have a lot of work to do I have no

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:46,759
time to waste I better hop to it we don't know exactly so so uh meia leaves and he goes

45
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:52,440
to meditate he goes to this mango Grove and he sits and he's

46
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:59,280
meditating and he has a hard time he finds that his mind is assaulted

47
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,800
by all these thoughts unwelcome thoughts unhelpful thoughts UNH wholesome

48
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,960
thoughts and she's just feels like there's nothing but this uh terrible

49
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:20,319
thoughts you know he saw this mango Grove and he had this idea okay I'm going to go sit be tranquil peaceful

50
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:28,479
calm so and specifically he says to himself like wow this even has this kind of this word

51
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,840
wow which uh we can translate in a number of different ways but I think the word wow

52
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,880
is uh could be is the appropriate one and he says I left the lay life and

53
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,759
became a monastic right he's a monastic he left his whole life behind and yet I

54
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:55,280
am harassed by these three kinds of unhelpful unh wholesome

55
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,880
thoughts these three kinds of thoughts sensual thoughts aversive thoughts cruel

56
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:08,919
thoughts so thoughts of sensuality of like something that uh maybe it's some inappropriate sexual activity he's a

57
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:15,800
celibate monk after all or maybe it's you just about thoughts of gee why am I

58
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,080
here when the mang goes it' be so much more comfortable if I were maybe even like next to the river or something has

59
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:28,000
this idea of wanting comfort you also have these thoughts about aversion like gee that Buddha guy

60
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,280
didn't let me go it or I have to go here because the other monastics are in the

61
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:42,720
way like we don't know what they are and even thoughts of Cruelty a little bit of like some harming or some ill

62
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,919
will so wow I left the lay life and become a

63
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:53,840
monastic yet I am harassed by these three kinds of unhelpful un wholesome

64
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,479
thoughts I like this verb harassed sometimes it can feel like this or at least in my mind it can feel

65
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:08,400
like this maybe for you guys it doesn't happen but for me sometimes it can feel that way so he goes back to that Buddha and

66
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,960
reports what had happened about having these three types

67
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:21,319
of unhelpful thoughts and and the Buddha gives him some

68
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,759
advice but for me I think it's interesting that here's meia who's he's

69
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:33,560
a monastic he's dedicated his life to price practice and he has what we could say is

70
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:41,360
one of the world's best meditation teachers and yet he's having a tough time so kind of like normalizes our

71
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,000
experience like humans are humans we can't just automatically make things go

72
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:53,759
the way that we want so he tells the Buddha and the Buddha says to

73
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:01,000
him when freedom of the heart has not fully ripened so freedom of the heart

74
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,879
this is a word chuti we could also translate it as liberation of the mind

75
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:14,240
so that the word chitta some of you know it can be translated as either heart or mind and sometimes it's sful to think

76
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:20,240
about for us is it heart or mind that we think is needs to be opened or liberated

77
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,280
or softened or transformed or you know what

78
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,599
way so the Buddha says when freedom of the heart has not fully ripened there

79
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,800
are five things that are conducive to full

80
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,000
ripening I like this the Buddha is saying here's like this idea of ripening

81
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,240
is a natural process you know fruits ripen we don't have to make them ripen they know how to do

82
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,880
it so the Buddha is saying well here are some things to help ripen what's already going to happen it's a natural process

83
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:01,040
that's going to help it ripen so here are the three things

84
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,640
one good spiritual friends and companions people that are on the

85
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,519
spiritual path with us it's friends and companions actually there's also a word

86
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:18,200
that can be Associates this doesn't mean we have to have best friends it just means

87
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,320
practicing with others so it can be just being here at IMC practicing together

88
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:31,079
and it also can be you know having a group of friends that you talk about the Dharma with huge range of what this can

89
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:37,760
mean second ethical Behavior I think we all know this if we

90
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,760
have some unethical things in our lives it weighs on us we have to hide it we

91
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:51,200
have to we feel shame about all these types of things third conversations with others

92
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,880
that are about contentment arousing energy and then a list of a number of other things I'm

93
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:04,399
just going to highlight these for now so this opportunity to share with others

94
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,760
and talk about what's uh what's happening with life what's happening with our practice and we could say that

95
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,120
meia he was able to talk with the Buddha and presumably with some of his fellow

96
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,720
monastics as well fourth applying effort and I'm

97
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,360
going to unpack this one some more and five having wisdom wisdom in particular

98
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,320
about seeing the changing nature the impermanent nature of things five things that support a

99
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:40,720
ripening of the opening of the heart one spiritual companions two ethical

100
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,680
Behavior three conversations about contentment arousing energy and a number

101
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:53,560
of other topics four applying effort five having wisdom seeing impermanence

102
00:10:53,560 --> 00:11:01,040
seeing changing seeing the inconstant nature of our experience

103
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,920
three out of five of these guidelines are related to effort number four is the obvious one

104
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,360
specifically about apping effort but it also says in the suta a practitioner

105
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,079
with good friends Companions and Associates can expect to be energetic

106
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:26,560
like that this can be can support practice to be practicing with others to be motivated by others and sometimes you

107
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:33,920
know we borrow other people's motivation when ours are lagging or sometimes others bother borrow ours and it feels

108
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:41,160
good to be able to support others and then this idea that the part of the conversations is about arousing

109
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:48,279
energy like what is motivating what supports us through the difficulties what helps us come back to the cushion

110
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:54,880
or continue with our efforts and our um wholesome ethical Behavior like we're

111
00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:00,160
never finished with ethical wholesome behavior in our life it's not like okay check check I got that done I never have

112
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:06,760
to think about it again in my life like this is something that we're always doing like how can I show up in my life

113
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:12,519
in a way that I can bring the most ease and freedom from myself and others

114
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:17,320
that's something we're always will be doing this takes

115
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,040
effort so for me when I thought about this I thought well what was wrong with

116
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:30,199
magia's effort he was the one that really insisted that he wanted to go meditate like really demanded and the

117
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:39,320
Buddha even said no and he relinquished and then he said yes so why is the Buddha giving instructions to meia about

118
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:45,240
effort well here's some a few things that maybe we can uh consider we don't

119
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:54,440
know of course right but here are some things we might imagine one maybe meia was

120
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:01,480
procrastinating maybe he was supposed to be meditating earlier and he didn't and he said he had this idea like okay I

121
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:11,920
have to go now because I didn't earlier and so maybe this uh idea of

122
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,440
procrastinating is one way that shows up here and the suit does we all know what

123
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:26,639
procrastination is it's this like putting off or delaying something that we need to do should do and don't

124
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:34,399
do putting it off until a time there's this sometimes it can feel like this force that uh prevents us from following

125
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,920
through on what we set out to do gets in the way of what's important to

126
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:49,160
us and you know maybe it's not surprising because humans we prefer immediate gratification we want to do

127
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:57,519
what's pleasurable enjoyable comfortable now and sometimes what we should be

128
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:07,680
doing is not enjoyable and comfortable so we'd rather just do something else and I I'll unpack this a little bit

129
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,320
more this idea of that maybe we we like to uh we'd rather watch something on

130
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,720
Netflix then then do our taxes for

131
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:26,600
example so there's a suta passage it doesn't say specifically about

132
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,839
procrastination but I appreciate that the he's calling this out he

133
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:38,199
says there can be a practitioner has some work to do and they think I have

134
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:46,279
some work to do but while doing it I'll get tired so let me lay

135
00:14:46,279 --> 00:14:54,839
down so they lay down and they don't arouse energy and they are unable to attain the

136
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:02,240
unattained unable to achieve the unachieved unable to realize the

137
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:09,000
unrealized like the unrealized the unattained the UN what's it uh

138
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,680
unattained unachieved unrealized right these are the goals these are the things that are out there and you won won't

139
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:20,800
reach your goals if every time you have this idea like oh well maybe I'll just lay

140
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,320
down and then uh this it continues it says in contrast a practitioner has some

141
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:33,880
work to do and they think I have some work to do and while working it's not easy to focus

142
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:41,639
on the instructions of the Buddha so I better Rouse up energy for attaining the unattained

143
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,440
realizing the unrealized achieving the

144
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,880
unachieved so the Buddha is pointing he's just making this contrast where some people are see what still needs to

145
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:59,440
be done and and want to the manner in which they do it they want to do it in a way that that's aligned with the

146
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,880
Buddha's pra uh teachings so they Rouse up

147
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:12,759
energy but there's some people who don't okay but how do we Rouse up

148
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:17,959
energy like this is maybe it's easy to say easy to be written down but how do

149
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:23,079
we do this well I'll say specifically one way

150
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:29,800
to work with uh some procrastination this is I I uh heard

151
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:35,639
this idea from James CLE probably many of you are familiar with James Clear he's the author of this book Atomic

152
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:41,720
habits it's like it's been a bestseller for on the bestseller lists for weeks

153
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:48,160
and weeks maybe even years I don't know so it's a it's often when I go to people's houses I often will see it on

154
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:55,240
their bookshelf there's one of those books that I think all of us can relate to it's just this idea of but how can

155
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:01,079
we have habits that uh really support a life that we

156
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:07,480
want and he James CLA he talks about procrastination and he recommends

157
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:16,918
something and after hearing this I started doing this and I found it really helpful this idea of taking baby steps

158
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:25,558
baby steps baby baby steps baby steps like really

159
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:32,400
small something that can be done in two minutes so this takes a little bit like

160
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,640
we have to creative okay what's the very first thing that can be done in 2

161
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,720
minutes so this for me right I'm having to pull together talks and sometimes I'm

162
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,480
like oh my goodness I better get to that and know I have some ideas in my mind

163
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,000
but they're not organized yet or something like this for me I just uh I

164
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,880
have this something that helps me I have a colored pen that I like I have a few

165
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:07,240
of them in different colors depends on the mood of the day what color I choose and I have a blank piece of paper and I

166
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,600
write down some of the ideas and I like will draw lines connecting them like oh yeah okay this is related to that and

167
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:20,720
that's not that's related to this and oh this is actually unrelated and cross it out or something like that this I can do

168
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:29,360
in two minutes and then like oh okay it's the start starting that

169
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,039
turns out to be really difficult and once we've started it's a

170
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:43,240
little bit easier so what is something that you can start with that takes just two

171
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,960
minutes and this is my interpretation of one reason why the Buddha when he's

172
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:56,039
describing some meditation he goes into such minutia

173
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:03,919
sometimes maybe maybe because he recognize this that sometimes we need to just do one small thing at a

174
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,919
time instead of waiting for motivation to arise instead of waiting for momentum

175
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:15,720
to arrive we can just do something for two minutes and then act often from that

176
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:22,559
momentum can arrive motivation can arrive and after we kind of like get the

177
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:28,880
ball rolling so here's how the Buddha talks about meditation

178
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:35,440
a meditator goes to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty Hut okay

179
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:43,880
go somewhere and they sit down okay here's another little baby step sit down and

180
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:50,320
maybe that's all you do maybe you go to your equivalent of meditation and you sit down and maybe that's your two

181
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,200
minutes he continues he says having folded their legs crosswise so there's

182
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:03,919
no requirement to sit crosswise plenty of people do not sit crosswise and they with their legs crosswise and

183
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:11,240
are perfectly fine having folded their legs crosswise set their body erect okay so taking the

184
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,799
meditation posture whatever your meditation posture is going to a place

185
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:23,480
sitting down taking a meditation posture then fourth establish mindfulness in

186
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:30,039
front of them so a little bit how we translate in front of them there's a different ways we can think about it but

187
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:36,480
let's just say in front of mind just have mindfulness this intention for

188
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:44,480
mindfulness mindful they breathe in mindful they breathe out half a

189
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:51,120
breath and then half a breath out so maybe this is something that we

190
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:58,360
can think about it doesn't have to be like oh I have to go meditate what if we broke it down to these tiny little steps

191
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,559
going to the place of meditation sitting down maybe that's it for one day that's

192
00:21:03,559 --> 00:21:10,480
maybe that's it or sitting down and then really taking time to get a meditation posture

193
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:16,919
a way in which you feel comfortable in a posture that uh you think you can hold for some time maybe it's like oh yeah my

194
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:22,679
knee is bothering me I need to have some support or it's kind of chilly in here and let me get a blanket or a sha or

195
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:29,200
something taking some time with that posture and then just say half breath in

196
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:36,440
or half breath out and then what's going to unfold next

197
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:44,240
is going to unfold next as a way to just get us to begin it's so easy for so many

198
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:50,200
things in our life right to not to keep on putting them off and our life is

199
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:55,880
passing Us by this idea of one way to work with procrastination is to take

200
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:04,080
baby steps another way oh let me actually uh James CLA he

201
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:11,080
talks about he there's a few advantages of doing these uh baby steps one thing is that you have a

202
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:18,000
feeling like oh okay I did something I did this I went to my meditation place

203
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,600
and I sat down and there's a little like okay that's a baby step and there's this

204
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,279
way to acknowledge okay I am doing something having like these small little

205
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:35,880
winds having these small little sense of uh progress we shouldn't

206
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:43,320
underestimate how powerful that can be just these tiny little winds like oh okay at least I did this I I'm I'm

207
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:50,559
getting there that's I'm going the direction I want to go doesn't mean you know you're going to meditate for 5 days

208
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:57,480
or something like this we start where we are and then the second way a second one

209
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:05,159
of the benefit benefits of this is that um it also helps us uh just have this uh

210
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:14,360
attitude of productivity this it kind of like shifts a there's a sense of the way that we um

211
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:20,760
let go of beating ourselves up a sense of like okay I am doing

212
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:26,559
this which means that this sense of momentum can grow

213
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,600
can is that I mentioned earlier instead of waiting for all the momentum before we sit to

214
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:38,640
just do a baby step and then to do that creates the conditions in which momentum can

215
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:44,279
begin so that's one way we can work with this procrastination and that was

216
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:50,720
specifically about you know doing seated meditation practice it doesn't have to

217
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,880
be for seated meditation practice of course it can be anything in your

218
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:03,320
life here's a second thing to understand what is it or why do we

219
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:10,960
procrastinate what's underneath this there's lots of reasons and a big

220
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,000
part of meditation practice whether that is Our intention or not is gaining self-

221
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,840
understanding we learn a lot about ourselves when we meditate we learn a lot about seeing

222
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,159
what our minds like to do we learn about what do we do when it's physically

223
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:32,600
uncomfortable what do we do when we don't want to like

224
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:38,480
how do we distract ourselves or there's all these ways in which we learn about ourselves with a meditation

225
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:44,480
practice but some ways in which we might procrastinate is maybe because we don't

226
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:50,520
really know how to do something like I know I should do this but I'm not quite

227
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:55,799
sure how I have this little uh clicker thing

228
00:24:55,799 --> 00:25:01,840
for the garage door like okay it feels like it's I the the

229
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,960
battery is getting low but I really should fix that but I don't really know

230
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:13,480
how I know I could just go find a YouTube uh video and go watch it but

231
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:18,880
there's this thing like oh yeah I don't know how like if I knew how maybe I would just go do it but so maybe there's

232
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:26,480
small things that we just don't know how so we just keep on putting them off or maybe you just don't feel in the

233
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:31,520
mood to do do it like we're waiting to be in the right

234
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:37,840
mood that works until it doesn't right because often we're not in the mood to

235
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:45,360
do things and how can we do them anyway and then maybe a third thing that

236
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:54,480
I'll say here is maybe we're in the habit of waiting until the last minute maybe we don't like to we just uh

237
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:01,679
think that we work better under pressure and so we got to do things uh at the last minute and we don't want to do

238
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:08,520
things beforehand this is just our way that we've been running our life the way that we are in the

239
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:14,600
world so one way we can use our practice as a support is

240
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,360
to maybe we could drop in some Reflections during our meditation like

241
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:28,520
why are we practicing often our intentions or our

242
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:34,120
aspirations are not well articulated is there something that we

243
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:41,720
can gain some clarity by but what is it what is it that supports my practice why

244
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:48,279
am I doing this maybe we can touch into this maybe there's something that it touches our heart this aspiration and

245
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:54,320
that can be a support or maybe something else we can

246
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,799
ask ourselves maybe like after meditation or maybe after like settling a little bit and then asking what's

247
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:07,240
getting in the way like what are the obstacles that are getting in the way of my best

248
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:12,840
efforts maybe there's something that we haven't noticed some fear for

249
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:18,480
example or maybe there's this addiction to comfort this feeling like I have to

250
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,600
be comfortable at all times and if I'm not comfortable it's terrible and I need

251
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,000
to blame somebody or blame something or maybe it's

252
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,120
our ethical Behavior can be cleaned up a little bit maybe there's we have some dishonesty with ourselves or some

253
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,159
dishonesty with others and that takes a lot of our energy or is nagging at us or

254
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:48,559
impacting Us in some kind of way so another way to work with some

255
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:56,559
procrastination or why we're not putting forward effort doing what we want to do what's important to us is for us to

256
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:02,039
maybe not h have clarity about what are obstacles what's getting in the way and

257
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:09,559
it's worthwhile to ask just do some reflection if it's not during meditation maybe some

258
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:17,840
writing so maybe for meia maybe he was procrastinating maybe not but maybe

259
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,000
there's something else about effort that the Buddha was pointing to and that is

260
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,279
this uh notion many of you will be familiar with this of right eff

261
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:36,279
many of you will write meaning like wise effort write as in it's the appropriate

262
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:43,760
effort right as in if you want to put a nail into something the right quotee

263
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:51,159
unquote tool as a hammer or something that you can hit it with as opposed to tweezers for example like right as the

264
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:59,279
correct tool so right effort wise effort is is this

265
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:06,640
uh defined as like actively diminishing what leads to our

266
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:15,679
suffering and the suffering of others and actively

267
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:21,159
increasing what leads to our well-being and the well-being of

268
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:28,120
others so this actively diminishing what's unhelpful

269
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,480
and actively increasing what's helpful this rise effort like is you

270
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:39,679
know putting energy and effort in this direction and it does require

271
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:48,799
effort right because there's this we have to have some activity or some energy is essential if we're this these

272
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:55,360
teachings this path this idea of greater and greater freeding freedom is going to be anything other than just theoretical

273
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,279
or nice thoughts than we have to do some action of course we do that's true about

274
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:08,960
everything not just this so This wise effort helps us like

275
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:16,519
bridge the gap between how we are here and our aspirations that we have our

276
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:23,679
Inspirations that we have and this this way that uh right

277
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:30,600
effort is has these different qualities sometimes this effort shows up as hard

278
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:38,480
work manual labor kind of thing perseverance or this gritty application

279
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,880
just hanging in there and sometimes wise effort shows up

280
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:53,120
this this gentle opening of the heart this maybe this gentle persistent

281
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,480
turning towards and allowing things like shed allowing things to shed and so that

282
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:07,720
there can be some calming and some settling so sometimes effort is like some takes energy in a and maybe the

283
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:13,080
conventional way we think about it but there's Al also can be this effort to

284
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:20,480
maybe open and soften some of our habits of busyness or soften some of our habits

285
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,639
of trying to prop ourselves up all the time and so whatever it might be

286
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:32,600
whatever it might be so often when we hear this word effort we think strive and

287
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:39,679
strain maybe there is part of that but that's not all of it and so often we

288
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:47,720
discard the effort of maybe we need effort to relax too right our society these days really

289
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:54,679
promotes this sense of like go go go busy be busy be busy and achieve achieve attain attain and we have this feeling

290
00:31:54,679 --> 00:32:01,360
like oh if I'm not doing that then maybe I'm I'm just you know not doing it right

291
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,000
I don't want to admit this we have some Shame about not always

292
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,679
being busy or something like this maybe it actually takes some effort to say no

293
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:19,120
actually I can't do that right now maybe sometimes it takes effort to

294
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,320
say you know what I'm going to go to bed early even though I really want to do

295
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:33,440
this that and the other thing but uh I'm going to take care of myself and my life and in this kind of

296
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,639
way so meia so maybe the Buddha when he was talking to him wasn't thinking that

297
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:45,799
he was procrastinating but he was just maybe meia was putting effort in the wrong way maybe mea when he was talking

298
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:51,000
to the Buddha was just um thinking only concerned about himself and not

299
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:58,440
concerned about others or maybe he only wanted to meditate in the beautiful place and wasn't willing to meditate

300
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:06,279
where the Buddha was in a place that maybe was perfectly fine like we don't know why the Buddha is talking to meia

301
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:12,639
about effort but maybe it's something we could ask for ourselves like what is what can

302
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:17,679
be a support for us for our lives what's important for

303
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:23,240
us whether it's your spiritual practice or whatever it is in your life what can

304
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,679
be a support what can be helpful and how can we increase what's helpful and

305
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:35,279
decrease what's unhelpful so I'll end there and I'll

306
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,519
open it up to see if there are any questions or

307
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:00,110
comments Janet last week had asked can you talk about procrastination that I'm I'm like well okay so here we

308
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:08,839
[Laughter] are yeah can we send the thank

309
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:17,320
you I'm afraid this won't be very well posed but it seemed like you were talking sort of like social supports

310
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:24,638
things that support and I believe it was item one and item three I couldn't really decide

311
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:31,118
what the difference was oh like social and then friends to talk it talk

312
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:37,240
over with what's the distinction yeah why two categories yeah I would say that

313
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:42,320
um this the things to talk about is actually quite a long list and some of

314
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:49,320
things are things that we often don't talk about so they're saying that you could have uh friends and Associates

315
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:54,398
sometimes you just see somebody like on a Meditation Retreat or even like here

316
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:59,880
if you see somebody that's sitting calmly in up right that alone can be a support you're not talking to them you

317
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,359
don't even know them but just practicing with others can be a support and then in

318
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:10,800
and then in contrast to the uh conversations there were specific topics I I just mentioned two but I think

319
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,920
there's like eight topics in that whole list there so okay that that sounds good

320
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,680
so anybody else have a have a comment or a question you're shaking your head no

321
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:28,520
don't don't make the microphone come to me

322
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,280
oh Jim has

323
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:41,440
something thank you for your talk Diana I've been thinking about energy and

324
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:50,480
effort and things like that and I just had conversations with two of my spiritual friends who have been doing um

325
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:56,880
having energy blocked and they've been doing sematic experiencing and that seems a little bit

326
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:04,079
different like it's not so much seeing how thoughts are getting in the way of

327
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,319
energy but maybe there's some blockage and so I was thinking about things like

328
00:36:09,319 --> 00:36:16,119
somatic experiencing or Chiang or some of these or um energy work of various

329
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:21,680
kinds do you have any thoughts about those I I have I have two thoughts maybe

330
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,760
we could think that well maybe we could apply this to go do one's yoga practice

331
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:32,040
Chang practice or see their SE practitioner or something like this and

332
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:37,079
two that uh there's lots of um there's

333
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:44,119
not so much in the early Buddhist literature about like energy in the body

334
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:50,880
like moving in the body being blocked or not being blocked we don't see that I I don't know why I know in some other

335
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:58,400
ancient Traditions it's there and I think in maybe in some later Indian traditions it's there but not uh not in

336
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,359
early Buddhism so I don't I don't know why

337
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,960
honestly any other comments or

338
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:29,119
questions thank you you were talking about how the right effort could

339
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,240
sometimes be something arduous like really like manual labor and other times

340
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:40,079
very subtle you know how do you what are the kind of cues to look to to distinguish

341
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:46,760
between the two or across that spectrum and determine what is the right amount of effort yeah this is a great question

342
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:54,560
I have a I have a a clear answer is this increasing my suffering or decreasing my

343
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:02,200
suffering and to see okay there's suffering that leads to the end of suffering and then there's suffering that leads to more suffering so is there

344
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:08,960
maybe uh just to gain some familiarity with this like okay I know that this is

345
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:17,280
uh yeah maybe I maybe I don't need to unpack that but you have a sense about it because the whole idea is uh right to

346
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,200
increase our well-being and Peace and Freedom and ease and to uh decrease

347
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,240
suffering so the way that we go towards a Ro suffering there is I'm using

348
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:34,000
suffering as this really really broad word right something really mild to just something really terrible I'm using one

349
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,240
word for this whole range and yeah that's just something to check in and

350
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:46,000
often the the suffering shows up if it's not like physical discomfort is a little

351
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,040
thought that uh that supports a certain amount of tightness or tension or

352
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:59,119
closing down and I would call that like suffering there's this kind of like bearing down I got to do

353
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,280
this as opposed to nope I'm going to do this I'm going to do this and kind of do

354
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:10,839
it with a maybe like a uprightness and openness as opposed to I got to get this

355
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:15,000
does that make sense it does thank

356
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:24,079
you okay okay so thank you all and I wish you a lovely rest of the evening

357
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,440
thank you
