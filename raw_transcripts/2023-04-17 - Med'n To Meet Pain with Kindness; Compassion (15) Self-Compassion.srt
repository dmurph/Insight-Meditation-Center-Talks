5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,190

6
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:37,680
[Music] um so so for the theme for this week

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:44,280
um I'd like to continue with the theme of compassion I know that uh Gail spoke

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:52,860
about the seven factors of compassion last weekend there was so much to to explore we're not done in one week or

9
00:00:52,860 --> 00:01:00,899
one month or even one year exploring this practice of compassion I continue to to to learn and explore it it's a

10
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:07,619
lifetime or maybe multiple lifetimes practice so we'll explore it

11
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:16,740
um this week in in different ways from different dimensions or different ways to to look at it and and um

12
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,080
and perhaps slice the pie or Cut the Cake from different layers looking at

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:29,520
that compassion for ourselves for others what what supports it what blocks it

14
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,299
um in a practical way in a very practical um useful way

15
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:43,560
um news you can use and of course all of Dharma is is applicable to our daily

16
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,960
lives anyway without without further Ado let's let's

17
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:57,240
sit together let's practice together I'd like to invite you to come to your

18
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:04,799
seat come to your body ah and if it's comfortable for you

19
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,099
Maybe take a couple of deep diaphragmatic breaths into the

20
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:16,879
belly or rather let the belly breathe in the air

21
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:28,520
hold for a few seconds and release with a sound if you like ah

22
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,280
the way to arrive become centered

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,800
maybe a couple more in your own time

24
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,780
only for a few seconds letting go high

25
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:12,379
and now letting the breath be natural however it is

26
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,440
shallower deep

27
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:30,239
in a few deep breaths can help us physiologically

28
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:39,560
to reorient as a bridge from activity

29
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:51,180
and perhaps a sense of hyper drive more sense of calm

30
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:57,780
returning reorienting

31
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:11,060
the mind is particularly busy right now

32
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:26,120
enacting with the entirety of the breath

33
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,020
the pause and the out breath

34
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,240
and let us turn

35
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,460
through the breath to the sensations of the breath within

36
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:45,259
the body within the framework of the body

37
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,880
not breath as a concept but a felt sense

38
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:02,240
Within this body that senses feels aches

39
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,020
earning our awareness or knowing

40
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:20,300
intertwined with kindness

41
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:27,919
towards this body

42
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:50,340
not so much in the way of whipping it to shade to sit and concentrate on this practice

43
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:55,800
but making kindness compassion the object of our

44
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:02,000
practice towards this body the parts of this body

45
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:09,199
softening relaxing

46
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,340
if there is any discomfort

47
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:42,080
or a challenge in the body areas of tightness

48
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,220
achiness

49
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:07,800
earning turning to these areas holding this area of the body

50
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:15,919
with our awareness with our spacious knowing intertwined with kindness

51
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,199
the same way that

52
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:33,300
a loving mother holds a newborn tenderly

53
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:40,339
especially if the newborn is crying

54
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,219
in some discomfort

55
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,800
patiently patiently holding

56
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,700
loving

57
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:09,260
rocking this and tender precious life

58
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,220
same attitude

59
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:31,680
can we hold this body especially if they're areas of

60
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,420
challenge discomfort

61
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,700
unease

62
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:54,680
and we tune into compassion for this body

63
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:10,279
In This Moment In Time in general

64
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,700
this body that aches sometimes get sick agents

65
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:28,880
if there's any challenge right now

66
00:12:32,779 --> 00:12:41,120
coning into the patience and compassion and the Delight

67
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:49,579
there is Delight a quiet Joy

68
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:59,000
in being patiently loving

69
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,759
there is a source of strength and uprightness

70
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,019
courage

71
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,720
in turning towards what hurts

72
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,200
with love

73
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:44,699
practicing to patiently hold

74
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:49,459
lovingly hold physical discomfort

75
00:15:56,699 --> 00:16:01,880
is training for being able to hold

76
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:10,860
and be kind with mental emotional challenges

77
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,600
it's the same process

78
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,360
the same relaxed

79
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:43,579
spacious body there is any emotional challenge

80
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:51,600
disappointment judgment

81
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,899
pain in this moment in time can we too

82
00:16:57,899 --> 00:17:01,220
breathe with it

83
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:09,720
patiently be with it with the same stance of loving mother holding a tender

84
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,260
newborn

85
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,279
same gesture of the heart

86
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:29,059
not trying to rush through it but patient

87
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,860
loving stable

88
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:56,480
it's okay sweetheart it's okay

89
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:21,179
taking time to hold disappointments challenges not to ruminate let go of the

90
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:27,200
story let go of the story not helpful at all

91
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,320
but simply holding kindness

92
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,279
and patience

93
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,799
the tenderness whether physical or emotional

94
00:19:56,340 --> 00:20:02,520
and notice the wholesomeness the goodness

95
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:08,120
of turning towards instead of pushing away um

96
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,000
breathing with

97
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:31,640
it's okay sweetheart it's okay

98
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,960
following yourself kindly

99
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:12,539
may I have ease with this disappointment sorrow pain

100
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:19,460
may I have ease and Peace and Freedom

101
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,740
of heart

102
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,100
with this challenge

103
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:52,340
may I meet this difficulty with kindness

104
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,480
as much as possible

105
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:40,380
as we begin to close this meditation

106
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:46,919
can we note the sense of uprightness and goodness

107
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:49,820
wholesomeness

108
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:59,520
there is in meeting what's difficult with kindness turning

109
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,760
towards with patience kindness instead of pushing it away or

110
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:13,640
judging it or berating ourselves or ruminating

111
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:19,260
there is a wholesomeness and just meaning

112
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,059
it's difficult with kindness

113
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:35,360
and that brightness a quiet strength

114
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:44,899
as we bring this meditation to our clothes

115
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:52,559
appreciating that we showed up if there are any judgments arising for

116
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:59,700
how it was or wasn't can we meet that Dagger of self-judgment

117
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,898
with kindness

118
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,320
appreciating ourselves

119
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:24,000
and our beautiful Sangha for showing up and planting seeds of

120
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,399
kindness compassion towards ourselves

121
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:37,039
and the world compassion starts with ourselves

122
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:47,120
may we be of service

123
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:53,240
maybe serve compassionately

124
00:30:54,779 --> 00:31:03,740
may we be kind to this being who's us to all those whose Lies We Touch

125
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:11,179
directly and indirectly may all beings everywhere

126
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,898
be free have ease

127
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:24,260
with their challenges with their suffering

128
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:32,899
may all beings be well may all beings be free including ourselves

129

um strength of the heart to be with to be

154
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:24,359
with challenges instead of rushing through them and it takes time it takes patience

155
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:30,660
no compassion so much we can say about this and so much we can explore so what

156
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:36,020
I like to turn into today is um

157
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:43,260
is compassion for self -compassion self-compassion as the basis

158
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:51,920
for compassion to others compassion to to the world etc etc

159
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:58,510
and maybe I'd like to take a step back first and uh

160
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:03,720
[Music] um offer a definition maybe a couple of

161
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:09,000
definitions of compassion just so that we're on the same page we we have a

162
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:16,140
sense of what compassion is and many of you have been practicing practicing for a long time and yet it helps to

163
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:23,099
reconnect with with okay what are we talking about so it's not a fuzzy fuzzy

164
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:28,940
you know compassion which is you know panty about this word

165
00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:34,560
so so in the taravada tradition

166
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:40,320
kindness or meta is the primaries the first practice of

167
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:47,520
the heart kindness loving kindness Good Will and basically what kindness or

168
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:54,480
Goodwill is is um just the kindness of the heart say when you are walking around and you

169
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,359
smile to a neighbor or or just a very simple sense of good will just sensible

170
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:06,599
kindness It's not complicated we all have it readily access it many many times a day

171
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:11,700
when you see someone you care about oh there's just a sense of simple care so

172
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:19,440
good will foreign t a or translate as kindness loving

173
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,540
kindness love Good Will so many nuances

174
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:31,579
it's basically kindness of the heart that meets a being who is in a neutral

175
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:37,880
State neither suffering nor happy just kind of like kindness of the heart okay

176
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:44,180
now if you take the same kind and the same meta and it meets

177
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:52,680
suffering it meets the suffering either your own suffering or suffering of someone else some other being that meta

178
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:58,920
when it meets suffering it holds suffering becomes compassion

179
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:06,839
so compassion is love meta plus suffering

180
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:13,680
in other words it's also been said that compassion is the love child

181
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:21,960
of love and suffering so there needs to be a challenge so a

182
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:28,460
some kind of pain suffering difficulty and it's met and it is met with kindness

183
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:33,839
okay so that is one way to consider meta

184
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:41,670
to consider compassion in Pali karuna and of course just to just to

185
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:49,079
[Music] um um give you the if you have not heard this before if

186
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:55,320
the same kindness meta meets joy in the world someone who's very happy or your

187
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:03,359
own Joy then it gets expressed as as mudita vicarious joy joy for the joy of

188
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:10,440
others or also if it's for ourselves it gets expressed as gratitude which is the third Brahma vihara the third practice

189
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:16,710
of the heart mitta being the first one meta karuna being the second

190
00:39:16,710 --> 00:39:22,980
[Music] um being the third and the fourth one being

191
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:30,540
equanimity Brahma vihara is being the practices of the heart the the Heavenly abodes

192
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:36,300
practices and many of you in in the have practiced this already and if you've

193
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:42,660
been coming to the happy hour in the evening uh you you've practiced with

194
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:49,440
various dimensions of these practices so so compassion is needing needing

195
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,720
suffering needing suffering with with uh with kindness

196
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:02,099
foreign s that are required for compassion we

197
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:07,500
need to have an awareness of suffering we need to know we need to turn know

198
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:13,740
that this is hard this is painful and really that first cognitive knowing that

199
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:19,020
suffering is happening is the most important aspect because

200
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:25,140
often we don't rock that oh

201
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:31,020
this is suffering this is pain this is Disappointment this hurts that first

202
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:36,300
ouch that ouch is the most important is really the most

203
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:44,040
important step first how many times have you been yourself suffering having a challenge

204
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:51,359
and and just bulldozing through it I know for me

205
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:59,220
um many of you know that I've had a chronic illness for many years and and at the beginning when I was just trying to get

206
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:05,700
my head around it I would be tired and and aching and I wouldn't rock it I wouldn't crack that actually I'm not

207
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:11,640
feeling well I'd be like okay come on let's get going you've got work to do you've got emails like come on it's

208
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:21,180
going like there would be judgmenting it took a while to realize oh sweetheart wow you are tired you are in pain this

209
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:30,119
is hard ouch this is hard so that first recognition allowed and a wise response

210
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:36,720
which was kindness patience the appropriate response to come in but without that acknowledgment also with

211
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:44,220
towards others too like ah they're just being fussy or they're just being this or relabel it with very sometimes unkind

212
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:50,400
we we miss that oh this person is struggling this person is having a hard time

213
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:59,780
um so that that cognitive is taking a pause uh to to have that cognitive awareness

214
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:06,920
is very important and and often if we are rushing through life if we feel

215
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:12,300
stressed ourselves if we if we are internally stressed externally stressed

216
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:17,640
and not taking a moment to pause and and realize and that pause as you've been

217
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,800
practicing you realize that that pause becomes more and more available the

218
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,859
longer we practice and yet it is important to have this in the background of our minds

219
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:34,140
to take a pause or what is happening how am I perceiving this situation is it

220
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:43,740
really what it is or am I perceiving it through a through my eyes of rushing rushing

221
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:50,640
um about and compassion for self kindness for

222
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:56,579
self really is the basis for kindness and compassion for others it's really

223
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:05,700
the starting point is the starting point we can't fill other people's cups if we

224
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:11,520
haven't failed Our Own Cup first we have to fill our own cup and self-compassion

225
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,480
is not selfish it's not [Music] um

226
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:25,500
self-aggrandizing it's not enabling and in fact there are there are research

227
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:33,960
studies that suggest that when we are self-compassionate we are um

228
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,839
we take more responsibility for our actions not less we don't become

229
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:47,339
oh enabling like oh whatever but actually we take more responsibility maybe I'll just take one minute to share

230
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:52,980
one of these studies with you and um many studies but one of them is the work

231
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:59,880
of Mark Leary and colleagues that and they found that when a participants were

232
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:05,119
instructed to be self-compassionate when thinking about a past mistake

233
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:10,619
humiliation or failure they were more likely to accept personal responsibility

234
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:17,400
for what happened instead of blaming outside things outside or events outside

235
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:25,079
and that makes sense right you know when we have a sense of kindness for ourselves we can accept our own failings

236
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:31,859
like oh sweetheart yes that was unskillful yeah you screwed up it's okay I still love you it's okay we'll do

237
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:39,420
better next time you see it's more available whereas if we don't have that if we have self-judgment like then then

238
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:45,240
we don't have the capacity to it to acknowledge that we screwed up it's like oh no it wasn't me no no it was their

239
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:52,380
fault we we point finger everywhere because there's no capacity because if we we ex we acknowledge that we screwed

240
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:59,700
up ooh ouch they're going to be so many daggers we're gonna and they're gonna be so many daggers so so self-compassion

241
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,980
allows us to actually take more responsibility for our actions

242
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:12,000
in the world and it's the basis for or compassion towards others so so

243
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,839
um in this brief time we talked about some definition a perhaps a one

244
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:25,980
definition of compassion there is more we talked about the importance of knowing of that ouch of acknowledging of

245
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:32,060
awareness of of of of suffering with this physical emotional internal

246
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:38,940
external and self-compassion really being the basis uh before compassion for

247
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:45,720
others there is there's a lot more to explore and I'm delighted that we have the rest of this week to to practice

248
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:52,140
together so thank you so much dear ones may you be compassionate to yourself the

249
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:58,579
rest of the day May you take time pause if there is an ouch physical emotional

250
00:45:58,579 --> 00:46:06,599
disappointments to just to just acknowledge maybe just with a hand on your heart or just saying ouch to to

251
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:13,440
practice with this for the rest of the day thank you so much be well and looking

252
