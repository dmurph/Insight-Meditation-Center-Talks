1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:09,179
good day friends I hope you are well in whatever time

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:14,820
zone and whatever location on this planet of ours you are

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:22,080
delighted to be joining you in this moment in time to continue to explore the five Aggregates this week together

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,320
so today we continue exploring with the

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,900
third of the five Aggregates um

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:44,420
often translated as perception or recognition and uh

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:51,180
what an important constituent of our experience to really

8
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,640
become aware of and turn towards and really see so I'll say more about it

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,860
when we uh when we turn to the um darmet

10
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,080
and for now let's uh let's practice together so

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:13,500
I cheat too find a posture that is comfortable for

12
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,560
you whether you are sitting

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,780
lying down or standing In This Moment In Time

14
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,020
the posture that is both comfortable and has a sense of integrity

15
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:49,219
allowing the muscles to be relaxed as relaxed as possible

16
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:59,119
and allowing the uprightness of the spine if you are sitting

17
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:09,379
to really come from your sit bones from a supported base that is relaxed

18
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:18,000
and well rooted and allowing yourself to be held up

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,239
as if by an invisible force as if there was a magnet a very gentle magnet

20
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:31,260
pulling up the top of your head ever so gently ah

21
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,959
you can let go and relax any effort

22
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,599
relaxing any effort

23
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:54,860
and being in the flow of both

24
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,300
feeling present

25
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:13,379
engaged in your posture the posture of your body the posture of

26
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:19,019
your mind let the posture of your mind also

27
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:27,439
be engaged with this practice not with thinking planning past future

28
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:46,319
wholeheartedly engaged relaxedly relaxantly

29
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:57,080
easily engaged letting this relaxed engagement

30
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:03,620
receive the breath in the abdomen

31
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,639
are you perceiving knowing any

32
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:51,419
tightness in the body or in the mind and the entanglement that needs to be

33
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:55,220
softened released

34
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:47,720
and as we receive the breath the relaxed and engaged mind and heart

35
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,800
let yourself know that you are perceiving the breath

36
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:27,600
recognizing how are you recognizing how's the in-breath

37
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,160
being recognized

38
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:40,259
this investigation doesn't have to be effortful just drop this question in

39
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:46,699
the body leaning into

40
00:06:48,539 --> 00:06:53,639
their recognition question isn't so much that you start

41
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:58,740
investigating and how is it being done but just know then oh yeah

42
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:06,240
in-breath is being recognized as an in-breath your out breath is being recognized as

43
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,020
an out breath

44
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,960
there has been many in breaths and out breaths and we recognize it and

45
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,319
maybe there's also a slight quality about this in-breath or this out breath

46
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:32,220
in this moment in time that's maybe it's recognized as being long or

47
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,919
short or deep or shallow

48
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,979
or easily leaning into

49
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:58,380
this recognition perception Sonya that keeps happening

50
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:04,099
automatically bringing it to the Forefront a bit

51
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:09,000
Forefront of experience

52
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:25,080
such a fun sandbox this mind is hard to be a scientist of it what

53
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,340
happens if you lean into

54
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:40,580
recognition as if you're highlighting it and breath our breath

55
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:32,480
this is an empress this is an out breath

56
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:58,860
perhaps even more refinement this is the pause between the in-breath and the out breath

57
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,440
just the pause between the upper and the in-breath

58
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,860
recognizing in breath in the out breath

59
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:07,399
or rather recognizing the recognition of the in-breath and the out breath

60
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:59,880
and as we say stay embodied and open this fear of recognition

61
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,500
and awareness further

62
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:14,399
but the relaxed mind and heart let their be a recognition

63
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,880
of us of the Mind recognizing different aspects of aspects of

64
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,480
experience

65
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:33,380
maybe a sensation arises and takes the center stage

66
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:39,420
sensation of the body and you recognize that oh yes this is

67
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:45,000
the sensation of my fill in the black my thigh this is that

68
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,320
this is that

69
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:03,420
oh yeah this is the sensations of my hands touching my lap

70
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,959
this is that I recognize this

71
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:21,380
your thought arises or recognizing

72
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:28,019
this is a thought and recognizing that you're recognizing you're knowing what it is

73
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:34,920
you're not a martian on this Earth having these experience and you don't know what they are you're recognized

74
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,880
this is that I know what this is

75
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,060
this is that

76
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:55,760
so if you have a reserve of many recognitions before pattern recognition

77
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:03,740
that's what's happening all the time become tuned attuned to it in the mind

78
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,940
and we turn into become aware of this pattern

79
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:56,539
recognition it's happening all the time

80
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:10,039
in our minds recognizing matching this is that

81
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,000
fast

82
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:31,860
usually unconscious based on so many previous experiences

83
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:39,080
and also through the lens of the Mind the Mind state

84
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:43,399
in this particular moment

85
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,260
fascinating

86
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:09,440
your body and mind be relaxed as the stream of recognition flows through

87
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,600
your mind gets tight your body gets tight Let It Go just be with the breath

88
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,679
keep it simple

89
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:48,240
and sometimes you might even notice that there's a perhaps

90
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:55,740
some separation timeline between recognition

91
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:02,520
of what an object is and debate enough feeling tone Pleasant

92
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:09,020
unpleasant or neither

93
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:26,360
or sometimes one comes before the other the vadana comes before

94
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:29,360
for the last minute or two of this practice period Let's do an experiment

95
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:39,600
but if you wear a smile intentionally wear a smile which we know physiologically shifts

96
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:45,620
makes shifts in your body and mind

97
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:51,539
and see if having a smile on your face with this shift

98
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:59,299
physiological shift changes how something is perceived

99
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:06,860
at this moment is perceived your breath is perceived

100
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:44,720
me how Shifting the state of your body and mind shifts your perception

101
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,380
see for yourself

102
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:10,200
and as we bring this practice period to our clothes let there be a recognition of

103
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:16,260
goodness wholeheartedness that you brought yourself to do this practice this is

104
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,299
good this is good

105
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:28,140
planting seeds of awareness Awakening

106
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:34,740
compassion kindness towards ourselves and others May our practice be of benefit to all

107
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:38,840
beings everywhere

108
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:46,520
including ourselves [Music]

109
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,329
[Music]

110
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,740
thank you all for your practice

111
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,980
take a moment to switch over the recording

112
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:05,520
greetings everyone lovely To Be With You In This Moment In

113
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:11,820
Time and I'm delighted to be continuing to um

114
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:20,100
explore together the five Aggregates this teaching this important teaching

115
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:25,320
by the Buddha um the five condas the five heaps the

116
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:34,140
five constituents of our experience that our experience

117
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:39,960
the way we perceive the way we feel the world are in the world know

118
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:47,580
ourselves as being human and our experience of reality is really made up of these five constituents nothing else

119
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:53,520
so it's quite profound quite profound and by bringing awareness to these

120
00:32:53,520 --> 00:33:01,860
aspects we become more awakened as to how the how this is made how this this Gestalt

121
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:10,799
of our experience this happens often unconsciously so so we discussed uh Rupa

122
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:17,960
first day Rupa body the first day and uh the second day we uh

123
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,880
explored vadana or feeling tone Pleasant unpleasant mutual and today we're going

124
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:30,960
to spend more time with recognition perception Sanya and before we um

125
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:39,360
move to Sanya there was a question in chat that I noticed afterwards um that I wanted to address regarding

126
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:45,899
um vedana that came up yesterday so there was a question and this actually comes out for a lot of practitioners so

127
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:51,539
I appreciate the question coming in but um sometimes it feels like the feeling

128
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:56,880
tone the the of pleasant unpleasant or neither Pleasant or nor unpleasant but

129
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:06,899
usually these two Pleasant unpleasant seem very strong seem very intense and and sometimes they they

130
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:12,358
feel mild so is that different is that what's what's up with that how does the

131
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:18,780
teaching extend to that so so it's actually the same uh vedana it's the

132
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:24,839
vedana is is feeling tone it's

133
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:30,179
first is so if if the mind was really really concentrated and this is possible

134
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:35,940
by the way to see and to practice with when the mind is really calm and settled income concentrating I've done this

135
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:42,480
practicing um in and and one can see that

136
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,839
um when and for example an object arises stimulus arises in the sphere of

137
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:54,179
experience and and um and awareness makes contact with it

138
00:34:54,179 --> 00:35:01,380
Pasa makes contact with this object in the sphere of experience at first the vedana the feeling tone is

139
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:06,839
actually in the first mind moment after the contact is pretty mild it can be

140
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:12,540
very soft and then in the next mind moments it gets it keeps getting stronger and stronger and stronger and

141
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:19,200
stronger um so so it's the same vaginized just the same the different intensities that

142
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:26,700
one can see maybe uh no it's almost like you can liken it to the uh say if you're

143
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:33,240
trying to fall asleep at a friend's uh uh house

144
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:39,960
and and they have a tick tock you know a big clock that makes Tick-Tock at first it's just Tick Tock you know the vedana

145
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:45,240
of the unpleasant perhaps waiting is very subtle and and soft but as it keeps

146
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:51,480
going on and on and on and on it just becomes like more and more unpleasant I don't like this make it go away so so

147
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:57,599
it's it's that building up it's that Snowball Effect and you can become tuned to it at first so if we actually so this

148
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:04,020
is how we can use this teaching is that if you bring awareness if you bring your

149
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:11,160
knowing to the to feeling tone at the beginning if you know that oh this is just unpleasant you actually get to see

150
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:18,720
it before it gets out of hand and gets very strong and and puts into action the

151
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,480
and I don't like it make it go away I hate it I you know blah blah blah you know all of the stuff that happens but

152
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:31,200
uh that can happen in in an unstable mind when the mind gets uh unsteady but if you notice at the very beginning oh

153
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:39,119
yeah this is a little unpleasant this is a little unpleasant there's a little subtle unpleasant vedana then then

154
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,760
um there's a lot more freedom that becomes available which is why this this

155
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,579
teaching of vedana is so powerful in fact in the teaching of of 12 Links of

156
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:56,700
dependent origination dependent arising but really the sublime

157
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:04,980
teaching of the Buddha really that has to do with with freedom um it is said that the link between vedana

158
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:11,160
feeling tone and tanha clinging bad link between all the 12 that that between

159
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:18,480
those two that link is the easiest place for us to cut the the

160
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,619
um the wheel that going on and on and again and again in the sub-sara and suffering that's really when between

161
00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:30,839
vadana feeling tone and tanha which is clinging clinging or pushing away so

162
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:36,480
that so becoming aware of tanha is really so so powerful in so many ways

163
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:43,079
for uh our freedom for our ease as human beings the way we go through life

164
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:51,180
okay um now turning turning towards um Sanya which is which is an amazing

165
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:56,820
topic so um again all each of the these could be

166
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:04,260
an hour-long uh talk so the time left so Sanya s-a-n-n-a Sanya uh perception

167
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:12,300
often translates perception or or recognition it's really it's it's a little different from perception in in

168
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:18,180
um uh Western psychology it there's a lot more to Western psychology

169
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:25,560
perception so for psychology psychologists out there this is much simpler it's actually as I as I

170
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:32,640
mentioned during the guided meditation is pattern recognition is this is that this is that whatever comes into the

171
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:39,900
sphere of our experience recognizing it as this is that like if you see a a um a

172
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,940
string on the road a a multi-colored string black and white string oh this is

173
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:50,119
a snake oh no this is just a thread this is that so it's that aspect of

174
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:57,180
recognition this is that this is x y z whatever it is so

175
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:04,079
so um so much to say but briefly to say yeah maybe a personal history that at

176
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:12,180
first when I uh received the teachings on the five accurate so I was a little confused by by Sonya this is like these

177
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:17,940
five you know the Buddha taught chose very very carefully they're they're very

178
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:25,500
few things that are included in this five Aggregates as the constituents are why is Sanya so important that it

179
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:33,240
deserves to be among these fives and um so I didn't quite get it uh years ago

180
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,640
and and the more I have practiced I've actually seen that this perception or

181
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:45,839
recognition is so fundamental in in our human experience and and and our freedom or

182
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:51,180
lack of Freedom really lack of Freedom it's the it's a linchpin it's a linchpin

183
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:57,260
and there's so many teachings anyway so um so so

184
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:03,000
our perception our recognition is really

185
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:10,200
um conditioned is really our recognition is conditioned by so many factors by so

186
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:16,680
many causes and conditions so really Sonia again is it arises it dependently

187
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:21,859
arises dependent origination right the the sublime teaching of the buddhistania

188
00:40:21,859 --> 00:40:28,579
dependently arises from so many different aspects and and and and

189
00:40:28,579 --> 00:40:33,599
dimensions of our previous experience that we've had

190
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:41,579
as as well as our state of mind state of mind and body

191
00:40:41,579 --> 00:40:47,760
right now and it's dependently arising it's actually empty sunyata is actually

192
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:55,859
empty it's not fixed it's so malleable and and our perception really depends on

193
00:40:55,859 --> 00:41:00,960
our perspectives so in the guided meditation I invited

194
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:07,859
you to to tune into it and and um and uh it can be so fun to actually

195
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:14,339
tune into oh yes this recognition is recognition of this is that oh this is inbred this is out breath this is the

196
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:21,500
sound of neighbor's dog this is that this is a sensation in the body it's happening all the time we are pattern

197
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:27,900
recognition machines and in fact this is what you know being an AI scientist I do

198
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:34,740
have to bring this in so so when we talk about artificial intelligence and also the power that nowadays AI has these are

199
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:40,740
the AI systems that we have are simply pattern recognition machines the

200
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:45,839
algorithms um are tuned to have a lot of data and

201
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:53,280
then to recognize new patterns and generate new patterns based on a lot of data that has been has been seen so so

202
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,859
in many ways this is what we do as human beings and and we don't examine our

203
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:05,460
pattern recognition and we just go through life and do the same pattern recognition we always did oh

204
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:11,820
um oh the sound oh I don't like it I'll make it go away or this thought of self yeah self-judgment yeah that means Baba

205
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:19,020
so so we just these patterns they just keep coming and we recognize them without any uh discernment without

206
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:25,140
wisdom without compassion so so being tuned to how Sonia is happening all the

207
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:31,800
time and how dependent it is on on the state of our mind and body and also the previous experiences so

208
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:38,880
so so um the uh the invitation I had for you and a couple of notations I want to

209
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:45,300
highlight um one invitation I had the very end I asked you to wear a smile to just I know

210
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:51,480
you might feel foolish and stupid doing that but but just do it it's an experiment this this whole body mind

211
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:58,859
this is fascinating so uh we know that physiologically there are shifts and changes when we were a smile so do that

212
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:05,040
and then see how your perception your Sonia shifts a little bit it does for me

213
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,680
I noticed that there was a lightness it was just a bit of a lightness in the the

214
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:16,440
way my state of this present moment was being uh perceived

215
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:24,599
another thing I invited you to tune into um was sometimes recognition can happen

216
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:30,060
before feeling tone and sometimes feeling tone can arise before recognition and and it's again

217
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:35,160
fascinating to to notice these the the the impact of that in our everyday

218
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:42,839
experience so it could be that say you're sitting in meditation and you hear a say a dog bark and oh yes

219
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:49,440
recognition this is dog park oh yes this is the uh dog of my neighbor oh a

220
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,540
neighbor whom I had challenges with does this dog bark is unpleasant right so

221
00:43:54,540 --> 00:44:01,380
after the sunny after pattern recognition an unpleasant feeling tone arises in the mind and maybe the mind

222
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:06,960
gets grumpy um um and sometimes it can be the other way

223
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:13,740
around sometimes they can be a a feeling tone Oh yeah there's oh and plus something unpleasant is happening in my

224
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:19,980
leg oh my leg has fallen asleep this is that I know what this is this is familiar I'm

225
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:25,079
not a newborn if you're a newborn and your leg fell asleep you're like what is this I don't know what this is where you

226
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:30,780
would cry but no yeah you have recognition you have Sanya you know what these patterns are but then again A lot

227
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:36,780
of times I'm speaking fast because there's so much I want to share with you anyway maybe that's enough for this morning

228
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:43,440
maybe that's enough but so for the rest of the day I'd like to invite you to tune into

229
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,319
um this pattern recognition and how it is dependent how it's malleable we just

230
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:56,700
recognize the Mind recognizes things this as that willy-nilly in an automatic

231
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:02,940
way and it doesn't always have to be automatic if it doesn't lead to Freedom

232
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:08,700
um and ease and care and kindness for ourselves and others so questions so put

233
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:15,480
a question become more aware recognize your recognition

234
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:20,579
thank you all for your practice I look forward to continuing the series with

235
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:26,280
you tomorrow be well recognize goodness

236
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:29,000
bye
