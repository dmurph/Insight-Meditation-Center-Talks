1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:07,358
so warm greetings

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,440
and happy to have this hour to meditate and

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,279
talk about the dharma together

4
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,840
and the idea of relaxing the body and then relaxing the mental

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,880
activities is um might as might seem to be

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,239
a not a particular spiritual thing to do

7
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:50,079
or so significant but it is quite meaningful

8
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,000
in many ways it

9
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:05,280
gives us a feeling for a sense of what's possible as we go deeper and deeper the deeper

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,000
tranquility the deeper forms of letting go and freedom

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,520
it's also a significant in that is not just an issue of relaxing

12
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,080
but also the issue of feeling the consequence of relaxing or

13
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:33,360
calming or letting go feeling the influence it has on us

14
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,520
sometimes when we relax parts of our body areas around the area

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:50,560
respond sometimes the um

16
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,920
if you occasionally if you relax if you're sitting upright and you relax the belly

17
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,040
something then lifts in response sometimes there's a lifting of the torso

18
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,920
that goes together with relaxing sometimes relaxing the shoulders

19
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,000
there can be a lifting then of the the neck and the head and the

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,720
upper spine

21
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:28,000
relaxing the elbows and this can have a nice effect down to the hands

22
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:37,840
relaxing the face can have an uplifting feeling in the mind

23
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,519
or in relaxing there might be a feeling of lightness

24
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:54,640
or even vitality that comes something gets released as we relax

25
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,959
when we're really tense there's a lot of energy in tension but energy and the tension is

26
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:09,280
all kind of contracted and there can be a wonderful very subtle feeling of

27
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,319
what's as the tense tension is released so there's a freedom of a certain kind

28
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:23,519
of vitality openness ease

29
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,159
lightness

30
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,640
so as we do this relaxation that we often do at the beginning of a sitting

31
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:42,239
you might see what's subtle and it might be quite subtle influence that has what's the

32
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:50,400
what's left over what good things follow the relaxation

33
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,599
and you can appreciate it if it's pleasant or enjoyable

34
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:07,519
spend a few moments appreciating that taking it in the joy the lightness the pleasure of it

35
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:18,400
so sitting upright and closing your eyes

36
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:32,240
and gently taking a few somewhat deeper breaths

37
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,880
steep enough so you feel like you are expanding stretching good

38
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:48,800
part of your torso and as you exhale

39
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,960
to release and relax

40
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,759
the torso

41
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,599
whatever in your body feels easy to

42
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
relax

43
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,840
um

44
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:07,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal

45
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:18,479
then starting with a belly relaxing the belly softening around the belly

46
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:26,400
and feeling whatever is pleasant or enjoyable or good

47
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,759
about that relaxation

48
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:49,840
the influence the relaxation has around that the belly

49
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,599
relaxing as you exhale relaxing the chest

50
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,560
softening in the chest

51
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:31,840
and if it there's relaxation feeling whatever pleasure or lightness or openness that results

52
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,440
yeah feeling your shoulders as you breathe in

53
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:59,840
relaxing your shoulders as you exhale

54
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:48,399
and then there's the muscles of your face as you exhale softening in the face

55
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:57,040
letting the muscles fall away from the skull and then feeling the vitality

56
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:09,839
or the openness the peacefulness that follows

57
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:48,720
and then bringing your attention to where in your body you most associate

58
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:56,080
with thinking if there's any physical feeling

59
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:04,480
sensation associated with mental activity maybe in the area on your head

60
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,839
but it could be somewhere else

61
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:19,839
and as you exhale relax your mental activity relax your thinking

62
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,959
soften in the mind and feel whatever goodness

63
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:39,519
or pleasure vitality or peace that

64
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:47,839
seems to result from that however subtle

65
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,040
and then feeling the whole global body

66
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,920
wide feeling of being here in your body

67
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,399
and with the exhale release the body

68
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:33,120
relax the whole body and feel the influence that has

69
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:43,839
on the body

70
00:11:52,399 --> 00:12:00,880
feel the mind kind of the global mind

71
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:07,680
if that's available to you and then release

72
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:25,839
the whole mind and feel the influence of that release

73
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:10,320
and when there's relaxation more room to feel

74
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,200
contentment

75
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,839
to feel some peace

76
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:31,519
to feel a kind of healthy vitality just being alive and breathing

77
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,200
that might even have some joy or well-being as part of it

78
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:55,199
so then as we now continue with breathing breathing in and breathing out

79
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,720
breathe with whatever is pleasant pleasure

80
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,160
pleasurable enjoyable

81
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:22,800
peaceful that's here in the wake

82
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,079
of letting go relaxing

83
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:36,639
letting go into the present moment relaxing into the body

84
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:45,040
releasing the mind whatever influence

85
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,480
that remains from having settled in and just being here

86
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:58,560
breathe with that good influence let it support you to quiet the mind

87
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:04,320
even more quieting a stilling

88
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:13,839
of an active mind and a contracted body

89
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:27,839
just here

90
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:08,639
as you relax or get calmer more subtle than the sitting

91
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:17,440
feel the goodness of that feel the pleasure or the

92
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:24,000
what's positive about that even if it's subtle

93
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,720
feel the influence of that throughout your being

94
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:41,760
without focusing on it so much include it as the atmosphere

95
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:48,000
as you breathe in and breathe out

96
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:56,640
even if there are difficulties in the peripheral attention

97
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:03,840
breathe with whatever goodness is here

98
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:17,840
whatever pleasure contentment peace

99
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:31,840
the atmosphere within which breathing occurs

100
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:55,840
so

101
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,839
hmm

102
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,839
um

103
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:24,078
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

104
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:36,319
to consider that your ability to relax be calm have some tranquility

105
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,440
is a gift to others

106
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,359
especially if you consider that when we relax

107
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:55,119
there's an influence on that on us there's a impact or a result

108
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,880
that it allows us to be present

109
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,400
with less clinging

110
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:12,560
with less of the movements of mind and heart that

111
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:19,119
come with clinging less assertive less

112
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:27,280
forceful on people less

113
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:32,720
projecting our expectation demands

114
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:44,319
our bias prejudice our preferences

115
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:52,079
and instead when we're relaxed some of the good qualities that we have are more available

116
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:03,440
care attention for others kindness and friendliness generosity

117
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:15,839
so not just to feel not just to relax for its own sake

118
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,280
not to get calm for its own sake as if it's just for us

119
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:32,880
but appreciate the impact there the results the influence that has on us

120
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:41,838
in a way that lets us participate in our social world in a better way

121
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:51,920
and may it be that we reflect on how this meditation practice

122
00:43:51,920 --> 00:44:00,160
does in fact help us participate in the world in a better way

123
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:07,119
both consciously and unconsciously intentionally and unintentionally

124
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:15,200
may the influence of our practice spread benefits out into the world

125
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,839
may all beings benefit from our meditation

126
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,838
may all beings be happy

127
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:36,800
may all beings be safe

128
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,400
may all beings be peaceful

129
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:51,838
may all beings be free

130
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:04,000
and if we notice how our goodness can benefit the people and beings around

131
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,440
us may we have the wisdom to do so

132
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:19,838
may we have the inspiration to do so

133
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:30,839
[Music]

134
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:33,839
so

135
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,480
so

136
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:32,880
in doing uh this buddhist path doing meditation practice

137
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,240
it's certainly helpful to relax

138
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:44,160
to calm the places that are over activated to relax the places that are

139
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:51,359
overly tense to bring tranquility to the ways in

140
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:57,839
which we're anxious or agitated

141
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:06,240
and sometimes then the emphasis emphasis is on the relaxation on the rely on the calming

142
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:14,000
but one of the things that's very important to develop on this path of practice

143
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:22,480
is a skill is a heightened sensitivity to the tension to the agitation

144
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:28,319
to the the ways in which we

145
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:37,680
get tense and the reason for that is that we want

146
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:44,559
to become skilled at we want to be able to recognize it well and clearly so that it becomes something

147
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:50,400
we pick up early as it begins or so that we become more aware of the

148
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:56,000
more subtle ways in which we get caught and cling if we're only

149
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:02,079
focusing on the relaxation and the calm we might not become experts at

150
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:09,680
perceiving attention now all the tensions we feel tension in

151
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:17,440
the body not maybe i shouldn't say all but most of it um probably represents

152
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:23,280
some way that the mind is clinging to something it's fixated on something it's pushing on something

153
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:30,319
in the mind and the much of the physical tension that we have represents

154
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:35,920
something deeper in the mind and the surface tensions of the mind

155
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:43,599
that we might feel when we're really you know anxious or upset or tense around something also represents

156
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:50,960
probably something deeper in the mind some deeper place of holding of clinging of attachment

157
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:56,079
and so even though it may be talking about physical relaxation

158
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:01,119
what we're relaxing is something that has its source in the mind deep in the mind the

159
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:07,359
clinging in the mind and so the idea is to start becoming more sensitive

160
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:14,240
to clinging to tension and that has many benefits one is that it can help us go further

161
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:19,760
and further and deeper and deeper into practice because we've gotten used to we've gotten familiar with all little ways

162
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:31,200
that that clinging appears in our body and mind and heart but also we can um

163
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:37,359
it's also a protection for ourselves that it protects our practice because

164
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:42,880
it's very easy to practice with tension practice with attachment

165
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:50,000
and we don't see it so i mean paradoxically a person could get the instructions just relax

166
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:57,440
your tension and they get so serious about the relaxing and that they tense up around let's do that let's

167
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:03,200
have to really do it well here the teacher says to relax and by golly i'm going to relax i'm going to be the

168
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:10,160
best relaxer anywhere and then we relax certainly we relax part of the body but the mind has

169
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:16,319
gotten tense in the effort to push anything any instruction people get in

170
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:22,720
practice we can get attached to the instruction any idea of what might happen in

171
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:28,800
practice we get attached to wanting that to happen or attached to somehow clinging

172
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:35,359
kind of a negative clinging to oh that's not happening to me it's not possible for me that doesn't relate to me

173
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:42,720
or that's not right so there can be this tension is holding on to that in a

174
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:49,119
way that limits our freedom and so if we start becoming skilled

175
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:55,040
at recognizing tension then we recognize the very tension that's involved in

176
00:50:55,040 --> 00:51:02,079
how we practice what we're looking for wanting to have happen in practice and so it becomes a protection that

177
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:08,559
we're not ahead of ourselves in practice that we're not trying to make something happen or expect something to happen that's not

178
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:14,400
actually what is happening the default is always to come back to

179
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:20,720
what is happening and in doing that again we recognize

180
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:26,400
maybe how we're tense recognize the pushing the striving the

181
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:34,400
contraction that might be there and then as we let go of that then there's an influence that has on us

182
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:41,040
and part of this recognizing tension deeper and deeper is that we can

183
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:46,400
recognize what is not tension we can recognize the impact that has on

184
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:52,480
us to let go to soften to relax and we can recognize that there's more

185
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:58,960
happening here than the tension i've certainly had the experience of

186
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:04,160
being overly concerned with my tension in my body and mind

187
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:12,319
concerned with something i was supposed to do like focus on the breathing that i didn't notice that in the wider

188
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:18,160
picture of what's going on there was in fact some subtleness some calmness some

189
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:24,800
peacefulness some actually some some very subtle kind of delight and just being here

190
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:31,440
and i was so fixate and concerned with my preoccupation and so this idea of relaxing and opening

191
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:37,280
the attention to feel the influence of relaxation the influence of tranquility

192
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:42,720
allows us to feel some of the other goodness that's here some of the other things that are

193
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:47,920
actually going well for us and

194
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:55,920
and this is um the um because as as this anapan asate deepens

195
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:04,240
we want to uh broaden the attention to take in the bigger picture as well of what's happening so

196
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:09,680
the joy and the happiness of practice the contentment belongs to this kind of little bit

197
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:15,440
bigger picture and it might be subtle nothing dramatic and we might

198
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,880
then get fixated get attached to having joy attached to having happiness and or

199
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:27,520
disappointed that we don't have it and that's tension and if we

200
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:33,920
again if we are skilled at looking at tension we'll catch it right away so it doesn't trip us up oh there's

201
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,839
tension maybe rather than looking for joy i should look for i should really spend

202
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:47,359
time feeling that tension so he can relax it can soften or let me not be limited by the tension

203
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:53,200
let me kind of open up the attention wide or not in a fixated way

204
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:59,440
but in an open relaxed way and so the

205
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:06,240
uh and then but then as we open if we do feel some of the goodness of

206
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:11,520
the relaxation some of the goodness of the practice that's occurring i think of

207
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:16,559
it as the atmosphere uh the or the mood of a room or the

208
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:22,640
atmosphere of a situation we're in we we can go into i've gone into some places and the atmosphere is clearly

209
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:28,319
peaceful and i feel like i'm being washed in peacefulness i go into other atmospheres of your

210
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:35,760
social atmospheres and just feel immediately feels very tense the whole thing so the kind of the atmosphere within us

211
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:42,400
and and take in the atmosphere of the goodness even if it's subtle and breathe with

212
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:49,280
that not to deny other things not to lose our ability to notice when we get tense or

213
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:54,880
tight or contracted or resistant or all the different expressions of

214
00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:01,280
clinging but as a way of creating a nice atmosphere that supports

215
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:09,040
the further letting go of clinging that gives us confidence that gives us some sense of the rightness of the moment as

216
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:16,160
opposed to it's so easy to focus on the wrongness of the moment some people are really experts at this

217
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:23,520
and and this is not to make a polyanis view everything is good but it's to create an atmosphere that

218
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:28,720
allows us to hold and be with the difficulties in a way that we don't get fixated or

219
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,760
cling to them or resist them too tightly

220
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:42,160
so all this is a way of saying that part of what we were doing in this practice is becoming an expert on tension

221
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:47,040
and so even though if the emphasis might be on relaxing

222
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:54,960
don't become tense because you're trying to relax or because you can't relax keep remembering that recognizing and

223
00:55:54,960 --> 00:56:01,680
learning the feel sense and becoming more of a connoisseur all the different flavors and textures

224
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:07,520
of tension of clinging of holding of attachment is actually a very important part of the

225
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:12,960
practice and the so you want to take some time to feel it and get to know it and

226
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:19,280
and not be in a hurry to relax or not not in a hurry to to get rid of anything

227
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:25,119
that's uncomfortable because the lesson of what you what you learn

228
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:31,839
by really feeling it fully you learn how to be prepared better for

229
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:37,839
next time how to catch it earlier how to protect yourself from being caught in it

230
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:44,000
next time so part of this buddhist path is to become

231
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:51,200
skilled intention not skilled in tensing

232
00:56:51,200 --> 00:57:00,160
because we don't want to be you know learn better how to tense but skilled in recognizing tension

233
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:06,240
and seeing it when it's there seeing it sometimes almost when it's beginning and the last thing i'll say about this

234
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:14,640
is that importance of not confusing tension with intentness

235
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:20,480
sometimes there's an intentness that has a certain energy and engagement

236
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:27,920
that and wholeheartedness that doesn't have the quality of limitation or

237
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:32,960
or debilitation that tension or clinging has

238
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:38,480
but it's really present there can be intenseness of the body and tentness

239
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:44,319
of the mind i'm here this is what i'm doing i'm i'm involved in this but there's no

240
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:51,760
tension there's maybe a tautness but no contraction or tentness

241
00:57:52,079 --> 00:58:00,880
and so because sometimes people when they hear relax relax their intentness they relax their

242
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:07,680
healthy tautness and they become moved towards becoming just a slouch just kind of move towards

243
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:15,838
becoming just a you know too limp to really let the vitality of practice operate

244
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:24,079
so certainly relaxing calming becoming tranquil

245
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:30,720
peaceful is a support for this practice but don't overlook the important work of

246
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:36,240
becoming skilled at recognizing tension and maybe take some delight and

247
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:41,359
satisfaction as you become more and more connoisseur

248
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:47,119
of all the different ways that you're tense and rather being disappointed when you see it you say

249
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:52,799
oh fantastic i get to study this and get to know it better

250
00:58:52,799 --> 00:59:00,400
it's not so pleasant right now to the tension in and of itself but in the long term i'm much better off

251
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,520
to really become the student of tension before i

252
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:11,839
focus too much on relaxing so thank you and

253
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:17,520
