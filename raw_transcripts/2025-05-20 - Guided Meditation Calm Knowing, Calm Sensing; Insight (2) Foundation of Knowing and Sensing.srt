1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:10,200
good morning and welcome to our morning meditation

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,880
and in uh addressing the issue

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:21,720
of insight as part of our practice there's a number

4
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:28,920
of ways of attending to our experience that allows for

5
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,280
insight and as we do mindfulness practice it's useful to uh have a range

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,719
of options of how to attend which means how to be

7
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:47,960
aware and uh one of them is very simply to know our

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:55,199
experience the second is to feel or sense the experience uh experientially

9
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,600
meaning through the body and these two are the kind of foundation

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:09,920
for uh developing insight and what they have in common is uh experiencing things in

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,759
the present moment that insight is a present moment experience of

12
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:23,759
uh understanding and they come from the uh from other attentional aspects as well

13
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,880
present moment experience ways of knowing experiencing being aware but

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,640
these two and they are

15
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:41,400
uh in order for them to uh carry on their function for bringing us

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:51,159
insight they both have to be calm calm knowing calm sensing or spacious

17
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:57,360
knowing spacious sensing and feeling sometimes I think of it as

18
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,560
giving breathing room to whatever experience we're having in the present moment

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,479
so not to be caught up in the experience with judgments and commentary but just

20
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:17,440
to allow each thing to be as it is and to discover the joy and the freedom in

21
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,360
calmly knowing this is what's happening in calmly sensing and feeling how it

22
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,720
is and how much we are sensing and how much we're feeling uh knowing is a

23
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,239
little bit uh individual for each person but there's a kind of a gentle going

24
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:43,360
back and forth whichever one helps you helps the most bring the most presence

25
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:49,440
the most present moment experience whichever one helps to quiet

26
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,160
the thinking mind so to begin

27
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:03,959
uh to assume a meditation posture that uh helps you to feel

28
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:07,840
calm helps you to feel

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,920
alert and giving some care and some maybe even love to that

30
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,400
posture and then gently closing your

31
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,840
eyes and beginning by knowing and

32
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,280
sensing your body in this

33
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:44,120
posture almost letting your attention roam around the body

34
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:52,080
refamiliarizing yourself with the present moment experience of the

35
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:09,680
body if we're paying careful attention the body is never the same

36
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,519
the experience of the body the sense of the body is constantly

37
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,720
shifting and then

38
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:40,479
to gently take a few longer slow deeper breaths

39
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:50,120
as a way of calming centering yourself

40
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,759
here in your

41
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,120
experience relaxing on the exhale

42
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:24,320
and letting your breathing return to

43
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:41,039
normal and but with a normal breath continue to relax your body on the

44
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,919
exhale softening in the face

45
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,759
softening in the

46
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,000
shoulders softening the belly

47
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,600
maybe as you exhale to let there be a calming of the

48
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:51,680
whole body maybe a calming wave through the

49
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,680
body

50
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,639
and as you exhale let there be a calming of the

51
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:25,160
mind maybe a kind of settling of the mind

52
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:14,160
and then insight meditation mindfulness

53
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:21,319
meditation begins to work best if the

54
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:27,639
knowing and the sensing is cal done calmly calm

55
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:32,760
knowing as if you have all the time in the world to know

56
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,399
something calm

57
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:44,240
sensing where the knowing is very simple the simplest recognition of what's

58
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,760
happening in the present the simplest way of sensing it

59
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:58,160
with your body and you might begin by doing

60
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,720
this with your body

61
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:14,360
breathing simple knowing of breathing in knowing exhale as an exhale

62
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:22,880
experimenting with a very quiet simple maybe almost

63
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:27,200
silent maybe silent

64
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:35,399
knowing the experience of breathing in breathing out

65
00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:03,600
can the knowing be be done from the back of the

66
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:12,120
mind so that it's simpler quieter

67
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:51,040
With the mind a little gathered together

68
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,560
oriented to know the breathing

69
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,920
to know it calmly

70
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:22,120
where something in your body and mind is nourished by the calm knowing

71
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:04,640
And then you're also experimenting with sensing the bodily

72
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:11,040
experience of breathing feeling it with your

73
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:17,600
body sensing how the body experiences breathing

74
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:27,320
so the primary locus of attention now is in the body itself

75
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:24,040
experimenting with a calm sensing or a spacious

76
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:31,800
sensing of the physical experience of breathing in and breathing out

77
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:14,160
where the where the calm sensing supports a wider calming of the

78
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,160
body

79
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,720
simple calm knowing

80
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,600
is an antidote to the mind thinking a

81
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:20,279
lot it's using simple thoughts to be present

82
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:32,639
calm sensing of the body breathing is also an

83
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:39,399
antidote to being involved in discursive thinking

84
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:12,440
feeling any degree of calmness

85
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:21,039
settleness that might be here in your body mind or heart

86
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,080
and if you do feel some calmness chances are that it's little

87
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,200
bit diffuse

88
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:39,039
feeling as it should

89
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:56,520
be breathe breathe with the calmness breathe through it

90
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,840
and as a support for a very simple and direct

91
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:23,679
present moment awareness calmly

92
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:33,039
know breathing in whatever way that it is

93
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:41,080
known calmly sense the sensations of breathing

94
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,760
and in whatever way they appear

95
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,960
And as we come to the end of the

96
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:16,519
sitting maybe with your eyes still closed to recall

97
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:27,760
The room you're in the building you're in the location where you

98
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:36,200
are and the people who you'll be

99
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,760

[Music]

117
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,559
thank you

118
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:10,960
so good morning and welcome maybe I'll move the umbrella for

119
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,120
a moment

120
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:10,399
so so welcome to this second talk on

121
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:18,320
uh insight what the insight is of insight meditation with it following the series

122
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,159
on samadei and that it's uh insight is much

123
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:30,600
more effective much more penetrating or much more

124
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:37,960
wise when it's partnered with an ability to be focused stable

125
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:44,279
settled where all of us is included in a kind of gathered Third

126
00:32:44,279 --> 00:32:49,919
simplicity of attention um so that when we are

127
00:32:49,919 --> 00:33:00,320
attending to something with our attention with our mindfulness um it's not a uh a um a simplistic or or

128
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:09,679
a very narrow kind of attention but it's something that's uh wide or full

129
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:18,159
uh and it's um rich with so much so much of who we are coming along to be present

130
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:24,240
so part of the joy of breath meditation being mindful of breathing

131
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,679
uh doesn't ex doesn't exactly come from the experience of breathing itself but

132
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:36,880
it comes from the the way in which we have this calm stable settled ability to

133
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,559
really gather ourselves really get absorbed in the experience of breathing

134
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:49,519
and then there's a wonderful feedback loop between the breathing and how we're

135
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:56,559
aware of it and at some point in that feedback loop in the inter face between

136
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:03,480
breathing and awareness um a a wonderful feeling of um of uh

137
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:10,398
well-being joy delight a richness a sweetness uh arises uh from the

138
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:18,919
experience of breathing or maybe in that interface and uh the

139
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:26,118
um Um so to bring together and samadei and

140
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:34,638
mindfulness and then it's uh very important to understand the basic building blocks of mindfulness that

141
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:41,040
we're going to be using in order to have insight and the simplest of these

142
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,638
building blocks is the ability building blocks of attention

143
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:53,440
and the simplest building blocks are knowing and sensing knowing and feeling

144
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:01,079
feeling the experience experientially in the body and um and knowing can be

145
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:06,280
nonverbal knowing can be uh very very

146
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:12,839
simple quiet in the mind verbally knowing can be a little bit more

147
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:18,800
wholehearted when it's when people use mental notes a label for the experience

148
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:26,040
saying in as we breathe in out as we breathe out and uh the

149
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:34,800
um and so breathing in breathing out uh with um uh uh really feeling like it's

150
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:42,480
known well completely sometimes if it's nonverbal it's a kind of knowing where you really are present

151
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,599
for it so if later someone asked you what was your breathing like you would

152
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,680
have something to say you can give some you can describe some of the details of that experience because you were so

153
00:35:53,680 --> 00:36:00,320
present for it um if you're sensing it that helps the sensing gives a lot of

154
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:08,560
information for the knowing mind to sense all the different sensations that come into play as we're breathing

155
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:16,160
and the reason why sensing and knowing are so important or how they become important is when they're able to

156
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,480
support us together with the somebody to stay in the present moment to stay in

157
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:29,680
the present moment experience of things as close as we can and uh because the insight we're

158
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:35,079
looking for in insight meditation arises from present moment

159
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:42,480
experience there are other there are insights important insights we can have about our life our psychology

160
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:50,079
um the reasons why things are the way they are in our life um that uh can be

161
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:55,240
really big aha moments uh and we might in ordinary English call those

162
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:01,480
insights uh and uh being meditation practice can support these personal

163
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:07,480
insights but the insights we're looking for in inside insight meditation are not

164
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:13,280
personal uniquely personal to oneself because of one's own life experience

165
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,200
um but rather they're they're called universal experiences universal things

166
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:26,880
that we can have insight about that we can understand and see that are so universal that um that they really touch

167
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,320
some of the more fundamental maybe we can say universal

168
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:38,079
aspects of how we operate and how we live that is deeper and more the

169
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:47,040
foundation from which we have our personal experience in our life and so the art of uh Buddhist

170
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:53,680
practice is to know when we are addressing you know personal issues that need to be addressed and when it's

171
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,720
useful to uh not mix them up with Buddhist practice too much maybe they're

172
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,400
get they're they're treated elsewhere in reflections journaling with talking with

173
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,960
friends a therapist or someone but to really put aside the uh medit using

174
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,640
meditation as a place to navigate negotiate our personal psychology and

175
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:23,359
our you know the details of our emotional life the stories of our emotional lives uh in order to get quiet

176
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:29,920
enough and still enough to begin to feel what's underneath that personal level of our

177
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,400
our life the the kind of the the level what we all have in common that is kind

178
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:43,359
of the fundamental building blocks for even our personal stories and experience

179
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:48,599
so the art of this is knowing how to attend what needs to be attended to and

180
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:58,000
how and um and uh sometimes when we have to attend to the the influence or the

181
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,760
powerful experiences in the present moment that are related to our uh life

182
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:11,920
story or life life events then um uh when we have the what we try

183
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:19,440
to do in mindfulness meditation when it's a Buddhist practice when we want to is to have insight about it which means

184
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:25,359
again staying in the present moment with it making room for it allowing it and

185
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:32,000
and having the art of really being present of knowing and sensing with

186
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,520
sometimes the analogy that it's kind of like listening listening deeply to a

187
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:43,680
friend who's needs uh someone to debrief with needs someone to uh talk with about

188
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,520
what's going on and what they need most from um from their friend is just being a

189
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:55,440
good listener and um so the uh so that sometimes we provide that for ourselves

190
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,880
uh we're not exactly listening to the story we tell but we're we're knowing

191
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:09,359
what's actually going on in the present moment we're sensing what's happening accompanying ourselves in a deep way

192
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:15,839
and um so uh when the shift happens from

193
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:22,079
samadei if that to insight or when we're trying to bring these together

194
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:31,839
um uh samadei doesn't necessarily mean we're uh uh uh uh becoming attuned to the

195
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:39,359
details of the present moment uh it's almost the details and how things shift and change um maybe it's not so

196
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:44,400
important for somati as it is the gathering and quieting of attention

197
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,720
itself so that we get absorbed in the experience with with insight the details

198
00:40:50,720 --> 00:41:00,680
of the experience become important not to be studied and investigated but to um bring into

199
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:07,119
focus and uh and as uh as as the kind of experiences we have in the present

200
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:13,119
moment change the focus can be um uh the

201
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:18,319
aperture can be changed sometimes with breathing

202
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:24,400
uh the focus can be very precise in a small little area

203
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:31,359
uh and sometimes what's nice is to have a wide angle lens both of them we allow ourselves to know

204
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:37,440
and feel in the present moment but sometimes it's a small little area of

205
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:44,319
breathing sometimes it's the whole um breath body breathing so the um it's different

206
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:50,720
things for you know different times and so with with mindfulness meditation we're kind of learning how to discover

207
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,640
what is the aperture what is the focus that's useful to help us stay present

208
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:04,960
for the experience in a way that's appropriate for what's happening in the moment uh and how we measure this by is

209
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:12,880
what what helps us to stay in the present moment stay with the experience helps us get more settled helps somebody

210
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:20,720
to grow as we do the insight and we're learning how to know and sense

211
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:31,040
in a richer way in a rich way and in a calm way and a calm knowing calm sensing in

212
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,480
the classic teachings of the Buddha on mindfulness um he first talks about

213
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:43,200
sensing and sensing and when sensing he talks about sensing the whole body and

214
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:52,560
then he says uh uh calming calming the body and as we calm the body that has a

215
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,160
has an influence on the mind on our inner life so that the knowing becomes

216
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:06,800
calmer the sensing can become calmer and there's a wonderful reciprocal relationship with um uh knowing and

217
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,960
sensing supporting calm and calm supporting a more uh present moment

218
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:19,119
sensing and knowing so sensing and knowing

219
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:26,400
um this is uh uh the more we are in this world of sensing and knowing the and the

220
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,640
knowing and again is the very simple recognition of what's happening in the present the simplest recognition we can

221
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,160
have almost like one word rather than an understanding of what's happening where

222
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:43,680
we know you know the big picture of why something is happening the history of it

223
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,240
and where it's going what's going to happen next um it's very very

224
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:54,720
simple and um so you might try that through the day you might find

225
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,760
situations where you can um uh center

226
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,520
yourself into to the present moment and try to keep yourself here with your

227
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:12,560
experience as you're living it as you're doing it and um and know and sense a

228
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:20,079
place that I uh do this a lot is with driving from driving is that um I let

229
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:26,160
mostly I try to let driving be very simple and I put aside a lot of my

230
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:32,000
stories and a lot of my thinking and um and just try to be in the experience of

231
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,040
knowing and sensing with a focus on the driving and there's a kind of a peacefulness that sometimes sets in

232
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:45,560
because I'm not being distracted and caught up with my preoccupations my thoughts and concerns of my

233
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:52,480
day and there it's a wonder and I I'm a very act more active driver but I'm also

234
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:59,280
feel more gathered and more kind of here for the experience of driving almost

235
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:06,319
like I've entered into a slight samadei or a slight harmony

236
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:11,760
with the driving itself and my my uh in

237
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:17,920
a very nice way i'm looking at the rearview mirror looking left and right i'm kind of sensing and feeling and

238
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:24,720
knowing uh as I go along and sometimes if I do this I arrive where I'm going

239
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:31,599
calmer than I was when I started so the idea of uh using sensing

240
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:37,440
and knowing as a way of staying in our present experience in a useful way and

241
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:44,560
not being caught up in the stress of past futures and fantasy

242
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:49,720
so you might try it you might try it uh in different activities that you do

243
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:55,280
today so thank you very much and um and we'll continue this week with this

244
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:05,160
introduction to insight until we the next week we'll start talking about the specific insights themselves thank you
