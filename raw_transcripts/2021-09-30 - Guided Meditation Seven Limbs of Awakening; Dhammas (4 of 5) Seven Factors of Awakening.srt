1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,480
so good day everyone hello and i'm happy to be here

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,960
uh i might be a little bit um not quite myself today i had

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,560
the covet booster shot yesterday and been going through chills and feeling

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:26,640
very tired and the moment i feel great and so maybe it'll stay that way but if i

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,079
begin to sag then that is why probably

6
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,320
so

7
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,719
the topic for today is some people have said as the crown jewels of buddhism

8
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,480
it is a list called usually called the seven factors of awakening

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,840
the word for factors can also mean limb and some occasionally you see uh seven

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,760
limbs of uh awakening and i like the study of limbs factor just seems like a you know

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:11,200
list a list but lim seems like a part of a whole it's like a uh you know a body

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,880
and and uh and it a little bit more associates it to me to our own body

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:25,119
our lived experience and the seven factors awakening are not abstractions but they are lived experiences

14
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,560
that maybe you can understand them to be

15
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,840
what happens when you get in the groove of meditation groove of mindfulness of the practice

16
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,920
that you know you maybe you're just learning to ride a bike and it's awkward and difficult and

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,399
but at some point you can jump on your bike and maybe you're going for a long distance and you get in the groove it just feels like you're just like

18
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,000
moving along just in a really wonderful way and or many other things we do once

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,240
we master them in the groove it's just delight to be absorbed and doing the activity

20
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:10,000
so these seven limbs of awakening are things that begin to arise when the hindrances abate

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,080
and the distractions abate and the attachments abate and and we get into the groove of

22
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,959
mindfulness so what i'd like to do for this sitting is a little bit of a guided tour or

23
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,720
guided meditation on the seven factors of awakening and perhaps that's a nice way of being

24
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:34,840
introduced to them or to be connected to them is uh if i'm able to kind

25
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,000
of point to the point to them or evoke them or

26
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:47,200
give you a sense in your own experience how they work now they are

27
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:54,959
so first i'll tell you what the seven are they are mindfulness

28
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,239
investigation usually next one is energy i'd like to

29
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,159
today call it strength and then joy

30
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,400
tranquility and concentration samadhi

31
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:20,319
and equanimity and we'll go through these again so we don't have to memorize them right now

32
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,080
so assuming a meditation posture

33
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,519
that you can

34
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,760
gently close your eyes

35
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:02,159
and it's a way of establishing yourself here kind of definitively here

36
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:10,400
taking a few long slow deep breaths three quarters full

37
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:19,280
big enough breath so that it becomes a predominant thing you're focusing on it takes some intentionality

38
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:27,600
long exhale so that it takes some attention to this to do it

39
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,880
and begins this turning from the distracted mind to being present

40
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,440
and maybe deep breaths and as you exhale

41
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,040
also to relax the body

42
00:04:52,479 --> 00:05:02,040
sometimes the deep in breath allows for kind of a deeper even internal relaxation on the exhale

43
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,120
and then letting your breathing return to normal

44
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,560
and with the orientation to gather yourself here

45
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:31,919
in this present moment putting aside your distracted thoughts

46
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:39,840
as you exhale relaxing the muscles of your face as if you're settling in

47
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,199
with your face to be here

48
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,880
face doesn't have to work or figure things out or reach forward be outward directed

49
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,199
the face can settle back on itself be at ease

50
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,080
on the exhale to soften the shoulders

51
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,240
let go relax

52
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,639
release the holding contraction of the shoulders when

53
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,479
from busyness and fear and

54
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,240
and on the exhale softening the belly

55
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:52,199
and with the softening of the belly also kind of a settling of your weight into your lower torso

56
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:16,240
and then to settle in now

57
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,560
on the experience of the body breathing

58
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:33,479
accompanying the body as it breathes with your attention

59
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,879
the first factor of awakening is mindfulness awareness

60
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,560
and you might say use the word here h-e-r-e

61
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,879
awareness is here nowhere else

62
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:37,279
here with awareness here with a little bit of clarity

63
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,680
present attentive to your experience

64
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,680
here and now breathing

65
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,399
letting your awareness be here with breathing

66
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:17,800
awareness accompanies breath is a companion for the body breathing

67
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,040
perhaps as you exhale to let go of your thoughts

68
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,839
so that the quieting absence of thinking

69
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,040
makes more room for awareness

70
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,839
to be here to be open to be clear

71
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,680
the second factor of investigation is investigation second vector of

72
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,360
awakening is investigation

73
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:30,800
it's not analysis or probing or but rather very simple

74
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:38,000
attunement to your experience that can be expressed through the word

75
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,600
what whatever you're aware of just say what

76
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,160
what is this and not answering it with words but

77
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:58,959
i'd rather let it register more fully as if you get closer to it or feel it

78
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:07,120
more fully maybe even a sensory awareness

79
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:14,160
that you receive so there's more clarity distinction of

80
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:23,800
what's here with the question what says if you get closer to the experience

81
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,120
putting a hand on a piece of wood and then

82
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,920
you can feel it more carefully

83
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:49,040
the hand of awareness goes on the breathing and there's more

84
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:56,200
richness and variety of sensations that you experience in breathing

85
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:42,160
the next factor of awakening is strength can you call upon a gentle strength

86
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:49,760
to so you inhabit in a strong way

87
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,560
the simplicity of being here and present

88
00:13:55,040 --> 00:14:00,880
maybe a kind of inner strength in your body

89
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:07,040
not the same as muscular strength but maybe a kind of strength of

90
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:13,760
gentle determination yes here

91
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:24,600
engaged strength that supports awareness

92
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,879
the fourth factor of awakening is joy

93
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,320
the delight of being engaged fully in the experience

94
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,519
coursing in mindfulness in the present moment

95
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,560
appreciating the opportunity to be here

96
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,399
i associate joy with the word yes

97
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:47,360
yes to be with this experience yes to feeling the breath in the body

98
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,920
and maybe even you can make a small half smile

99
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,000
that makes it easier to enjoy

100
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:09,720
being present here with breathing

101
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,320
that next factor is tranquility

102
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:58,000
perhaps there's a way of continuing to relax and let things be calmer

103
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,560
the calming of your thinking mind

104
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:12,438
a deeper relaxation of the body

105
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:37,440
and whatever reference point you have for present moment tranquility

106
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:46,039
maybe that can be a magnet for awareness in the present moment

107
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,519
the next factor is samadhi

108
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:30,240
i think of an associate i associate this with the word steady

109
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,480
to steady oneself here and now

110
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:48,559
to steady oneself in the middle of our whole being

111
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:56,440
so all of us is here supporting present moment awareness

112
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:05,679
awareness that flows or radiates from all of our life

113
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,320
now here

114
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,320
steadying oneself on the breathing

115
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,919
and the last factor of awakening is equanimity

116
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,919
maybe can be associated with the word okay

117
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:30,759
not being in conflict with anything or troubled by anything just it's okay

118
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:38,320
so the mind is less reactive more balanced

119
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,720
to be here with the breathing in your body

120
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,480
strong centered

121
00:21:53,200 --> 00:22:00,559
awareness not pushed around or caught up in

122
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:06,960
what is happening but staying balanced

123
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:13,400
equanimous non-reactive

124
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,360
it's okay

125
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,000
and then i'll name each of the seven factors of awakening

126
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,840
as you listen to them can you find a reference inside of

127
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:12,320
yourself for each through a memory or a place in your body or

128
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:20,480
some feeling of each and within and see them as a kind of strength

129
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,880
that support you to be balanced and attentive

130
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:33,759
grounded in the middle of all the difficulties of life

131
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,240
mindfulness

132
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,559
investigation

133
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,278
strength

134
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,559
joy

135
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,240
tranquility

136
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,440
concentration

137
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,240
equanimity

138
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,080
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

139
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:56,320
perhaps consider that each of these seven limbs of awakening

140
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:04,799
are a support for gazing upon the world kindly

141
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:11,520
compassionately they're a way of

142
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,840
being available

143
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,440
in a helpful way for others

144
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:31,200
supported by the seven limbs of awakening you're less likely to get caught up in

145
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:36,240
your reactivity and more likely to be present and see

146
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,240
clearly

147
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,120
respond to the world with something with something from a place of

148
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:58,760
wholesomeness goodness

149
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:12,799
made through this practice we strengthen a wholesome

150
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:21,039
caring way of being with the world certainly this world needs more people

151
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:26,919
who bring kindness and compassion and care friendliness

152
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,080
it may be that this practice we do does that for us

153
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,559
so that we intentionally consciously

154
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:48,639
are attentive to making this world a better place for others

155
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,639
may all beings be happy

156
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,640
may all beings be safe

157
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,640
may all beings be peaceful

158
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:12,120
and may all beings everywhere be free

159
00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:30,179
[Music]

160
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:42,559
so the topic is the seven factors of awakening the seven limbs of awakening

161
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:48,000
and as i said earlier i like the expression limbs limbs of awakening because

162
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,760
it connects it to our lived body you know it's something that's embodied in these seven

163
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:00,399
seven factors the word seems to just imply a list and um

164
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:08,000
and these are seven qualities or seven states of being that get activated in a very nice way

165
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,080
as we get into the groove into the flow of meditation practice it's kind of like the reward

166
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,799
of meditation when you're really kind of able to put aside distractions and really get focused on just being here in

167
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:27,039
the present moment steady continuous kind of in the flow of the of the

168
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,960
present in the

169
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,799
ancient texts they uh contrast them or pair it up with

170
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:45,200
uh the five hindrances and the five as being opposites that have a very

171
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:51,440
opposite effect on us and the task is to put the five hindrances to sleep or let

172
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,039
go of them and awaken the seven factors of awakening the five hindrances what we talked about

173
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,399
monday are said to be forces of um of uh

174
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:07,440
uh we forces that obscure wisdom

175
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:14,720
that obscure a clear vision of what's happening it uh kind of is blinding to our clarity

176
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,960
and our wisdom and our good understanding whereas the seven factors awakening are the opposite

177
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:27,120
they bring forth clarity with the clarity of vision clarity of

178
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:33,120
wisdom and um and i kind of aliveness and

179
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:40,559
the hindrances are kind of deadening in a certain way and so uh where practice is going from the world

180
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,600
of the being caught up in the hindrances to the world of coursing in the seven

181
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,679
factors of awakening and so uh as the practice proceeds

182
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,720
then at some point they wake up and then it's good to recognize them and and the

183
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,080
recognition of them is meant to kind of support them to grow even more and they're a little bit like a cheerleader

184
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:08,640
that kind of cheering you on this is really good you're on track so the way i presented these uh this

185
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:16,399
fourth foundation of mindfulness the first three exercises are progressive

186
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:23,519
coming to terms with letting go of settling down coarser to more refined or deeper

187
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,799
forms of attachment and preoccupation and so the practice is a lot to do is to

188
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:35,519
see the preoccupations the hindrances the attachments the the entanglements we have so we're no

189
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:42,240
longer in tango no longer caught in them but we begin waking up and become free of them

190
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,960
as that freedom begins to unfold and we're no longer caught in these things then these seven factors awakening are

191
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,559
what uh begin to show that you show up and it's a beautiful thing to practice

192
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:00,640
present moment awareness and really get into the groove of it and then feel the birth the arising of these

193
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,679
very healthy wholesome wonderful states

194
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:12,480
that are in some ways feel impersonal attachments and entanglements and

195
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,599
identifications and the hindrances have a kind of very strong stickiness that kind of

196
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:24,398
where we get caught up in our egoistic ideas our our sense of self and agency in certain

197
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:30,079
way but the seven factor awakening even though our practice is what brings them about

198
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,520
it feels they're definitely arising from within ourselves but they have this beautiful quality of having this

199
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,040
naturalness to them and almost like this is what happens when i get out of my way

200
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:47,040
and not be so focused on me myself and mine and it's a quite encouraging to feel

201
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,079
these healthy states bubbling up coursing through us

202
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:57,760
it's very encouraging it's very encouraging for appreciating kind of a positive

203
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,920
disposition towards life and what's possible it's um it's just a feeling of health

204
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:10,079
in fact as in the ancient world sometimes it was really clear the seven factors awakening were considered a kind

205
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:16,160
of medicine and when the buddha was sick he asked for example a monk to recite these seven

206
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:23,920
factors awakening maybe like a guided meditation in order to kind of say help arouse him or help heal him

207
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:29,520
from his sickness and sometimes the buddha went to see a sick monastic and he would recite the

208
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:35,920
seven factors awakening this is for people who know who are familiar with them who are coursing in

209
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:43,119
them into regular part of their lives so that when they're named they kind of come alive and a good energy comes up

210
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,880
and it's kind of considered a healing energy i've had them coursing through me and

211
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,960
the best language i had was was i felt like there was healing

212
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,920
fluid kind of coursing through all my veins and throughout my nerves and just the sense of healingness that

213
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:09,359
comes with the seven factors awakening is remarkable and so these are mindfulness

214
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:14,800
investigation energy or strength

215
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:22,400
joy tranquility concentration and equanimity

216
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,960
and sometimes they are presented as being progression as mindfulness gets stronger

217
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,720
then at some point we get the clarity that the investigation is we see more clearly what's here

218
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:42,240
as we see more clearly it's just easier to have evoked a kind of good sense of strength and energy and enthusiasm for

219
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:49,200
the practice and so we we engage more fully and it's like second nature to like oh yes let's do this

220
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:56,480
and then as we do that then joy arises at some point joy is felt great but uh

221
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:03,440
just when we're settled in the joy sometimes something settles can settle and relax and tranquility sets in

222
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,680
and the joy becomes more of a happiness than than joy and then with that kind of well-being

223
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,040
and tranquility that's the ideal conditions in which to for concentration to arise

224
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,640
it's hard to get concentrated if you do it from just the ordinary street state that you're walking around and

225
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:27,119
preoccupied and and i have the idea that you're supposed to have a laser focus and really work hard

226
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,720
at getting concentrated it's a lot easier if you if one prepares the ground for

227
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,760
concentration and the first five

228
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,760
factors awakening are part of this preparation that allows us to kind of get unified and stable and

229
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:51,040
rooted here and then um the uh and then there's equanimity

230
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:59,040
and um and uh equanimity can seem kind of boring or just uninteresting but it's a it's a

231
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,560
really uh pristine kind of like an emotional state it feels

232
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:11,680
so clean and good and peaceful and and um it's like one of the most uh

233
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:19,920
pinnacle of of like fantastic emotional states that you can feel that's equanimity um and um

234
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,520
and uh and here the mind is so balanced so non-reactive but with this beautiful sense of

235
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:32,480
cleanliness and clarity and openness and and um it's kind of it's a you know so

236
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:39,119
so the mind is not going to react to anything anymore it's just there and a feeling of strength and

237
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:45,440
and um so these seven factors of awakening uh can appear

238
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:52,240
in little hints of it at first and it's helpful to recognize it all right this is it this is it

239
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,480
and probably some of you have them arising in everyday life as well maybe some of you really some of the

240
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,800
ordinary activities of life that you really get focused and enjoy doing um you can recognize that in fact some

241
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,000
of the seven factors are present like even cooking to really get into cooking and let the

242
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,040
world drop away and and really have the sense of presence and uh and this

243
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:21,839
attentiveness of investigation where you you know really attending to uh the food and you know this

244
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:27,119
you know tracking it carefully and knowing how much more seasoning to put in or how long it needs

245
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:33,440
to cook or turn down the flames or all kinds of things and um and there can be a delight and

246
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,640
there can be a sense of joy and there can be everything gets kind of tranquil our

247
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,000
cares of the world fall away and it's a piece it can be peaceful to just kind of go around

248
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:50,960
cooking and maybe some equanimity maybe the sense of well-being is good enough

249
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:57,760
that uh if uh you know you suddenly get a phone call that's a little bit difficult uh you're

250
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,839
in a state of mind where it's easier to take that in calmly because there's a calm state a quantum

251
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:11,440
state so to begin recognizing these seven factors in ordinary life they come up

252
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,640
and appreciating them and making room for them and not overlooking them not

253
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,760
dismissing them or thinking they're unimportant they're very important for this practice

254
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:28,079
and allow them avail yourself of them more often get familiar with them

255
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:34,160
and when there are times when they're there appreciate them riding a bicycle if you're a bicycle rider or going for a

256
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:39,280
hike or sometimes reading a great novel can bring up some of these feelings

257
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:45,280
whatever it might be and um and uh the

258
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,839
wonderful alchemy of this meditation practice or mindfulness practice is that

259
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:57,520
um mindfulness of the hindrances mindfulness of attachment

260
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:04,000
decreases the attachments mindfulness of what's wholesome increases what's wholesome

261
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,720
so it's a wonderful balance uh mindfulness of what's unwholesome and helpful in our psychological states

262
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:16,000
uh gives us a little freedom and distance from it and that freedom and distance uh takes

263
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,319
some of the juice and an investment we put into it as we

264
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:29,520
are to bring this kind of open awareness clarity to really see the seven factors awakening the seven factor

265
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,200
awakening they thrive in receptivity openness relaxation

266
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,319
and non-entanglement and so they grow it's a wonderful kind of

267
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:45,440
thing that works this way so may you

268
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:52,160
become familiar with the seven factors awakening may they be part of your life may you enjoy them

269
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,200
and i think in this pandemic at some point maybe last year i did a whole series on

270
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:04,560
the seven factors awakening on this you know early this early morning sitting so you could listen to those talks

271
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:10,480
and you know it's a good thing to learn about and uh in terms of the path to

272
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:17,119
liberation the seven factors awakening then set the stage for liberation itself that's why they're

273
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:23,280
limbs of awakening and so um and that's a little bit the topic this is a topic for tomorrow the

274
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,839
last exercise and the fourth foundation of mindfulness and um

275
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:34,800
then has the seven factors awakening as the

276
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:44,520
platform in which to realize it so thank you very much and i look forward to tomorrow
