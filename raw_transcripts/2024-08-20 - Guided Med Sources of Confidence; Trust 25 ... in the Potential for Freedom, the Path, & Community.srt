13
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,720
moment allowing ourselves to connect with the sense of

14
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,960
stability sense of stability touching the

15
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,040
Earth with our bodies becoming aware that we are

16
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,798
touching the Earth feeling our feet on the

17
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:59,280
earth relaxing our legs

18
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:07,640

the the connection to the Earth through these touch

23
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,080
points as a source of balance and stability and

24
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,599
groundedness even before you go to the breath which might be

25
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,920
the go-to for many of us before that really spend time settling into the

26
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,400
sensations of these touch

27
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,519
points and allowing your spine to rise up with a

28
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:38,720
sense of stability uprightness from your sit bones not pushed up but held

29
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:47,560
up effortlessly there is an invisible string connected to the top of your head

30
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:54,280
pulling up pulling up vertebrae by

31
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,439
vertebrae letting there be a sense of ease in your shoulders and your arms

32
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,599
your chest and your abdomen relaxing all these parts I'm naming one by

33
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:15,040
one your sit bones let them offer their own weight and the entire

34
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,078
weight of your torso to the

35
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,680

legs and feet

37

and allowing awareness to to connect to be aware of the

38
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:12,638
breath through this body the sensations of the breath the feeling of the

39
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:21,039
breath the tender music of the breath as if a

40
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,639
violin the bow of a violin

41
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:43,319
moving moving through across this this instrument of yours this maybe

42
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:49,680
it's more like a chello it's bigger this body this cello the

43
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,840
breath this body and the breath moving

44
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,720
appreciating not taking any note any any note of this breath for

45
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,599
granted listening deeply to how it resounds how it

46
00:06:09,599 --> 00:06:14,080
vibrates throughout this whole

47
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:28,560
body one breath one bow movement one note at the

48
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
time

49
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
e

50
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520

51
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440

66
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:46,560
releasing releasing what takes your heart away not

67
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:54,160
needed right now coming back to ourselves to this body to this

68
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,279
breath connected to the Earth the sense of stability and ease

69
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:07,200
softening the heart and the body this

70
00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:22,639
breath breath that plays the music of being alive in this body for limited

71
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:31,040
time enjoying enjoying relishing this breath

72
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:34,480
like a sweet

73
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,320
song resonating in the whole

74
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
body

75
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,120
e e

76
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:08,959
I'm going to invite you to drop in three

77
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,399
Reflections to support our practice

78
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,360
today and dropping in these Reflections as if you're dropping a pebble in a pond

79
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:30,680
the pond being your body not in your head but in your body letting them drop and see what

80
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:37,759
happens as the pebble settles in the

81
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:44,279
depths of the pond of the Still

82
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:53,800
Pond the first reflection dropping it in to our

83
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,839
hearts our bodies our bellies

84
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:22,320
just like the human being Buddha just like that human being I have

85
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:29,680
the potential I have the potential for awakening

86
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:38,680
to wisdom compassion in this life I have the

87
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:46,040
potential I do have the potential the seed is in me of course it

88
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,319
is I can wake up in this very life

89
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:02,199
In This Very

90
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,839
life and if doubts and judgments come up see them see what happens if you just

91
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:30,279
release perhaps the self judgments or doubts just for a second you can pick them up later but just what happens if

92
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:35,880
you release them and allow

93
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,839
this this knowing this conviction that it is possible for every single person

94
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:48,360
given their circumstances of their lives to wake up it's possible for me to just

95
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,519
land what happens if you receive

96
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,399
it I can have more freedom May that I can have trust in I

97
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:06,240
can have more freedom than I do right now it is possible it's absolutely

98
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,600
possible I can have more ease and freedom in my

99
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:25,438
heart I know it is possible I trust it's possible

100
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:49,950
and let it settle let this settle in the body in the heart in your

101
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:55,000
[Music] bones I can have more

102
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,320
freedom I know I can it is possible

103
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,840
more

104
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:22,080
ease dropping in the second reflection in the body and see what

105
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:30,280
happens other people have walked this path and have had more freedom more ease

106
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,559
more love more compassion more wisdom I know that I see

107
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:41,919
that others have done it so it's not impossible I know it's possible of

108
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:48,000
course and I am supported I'm

109
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:55,840
supported by others on this path like this very moment listening attending

110
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,720
this I have the support of s I'm

111
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,679
supported by a community I'm not

112
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:14,279
alone I know

113
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:27,520
this simply showing up together or supporting one another

114
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,080
I am

115
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
supported e

116
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:47,360
and letting it just drop into your body not to think about it it's not a rumination practice just drop it in and

117
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:53,360
let the breath Let The Knowing of the breath knowing of the

118
00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:00,600
sensations come from this resonance from this

119
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:22,320
acknowledgement I am supported through an invisible web by so many by so

120
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:31,559
many I trust this I know this e

121
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,159
and the last reflection I know I know and I keep

122
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:19,159
learning more about ways that I can have more freedom I can have more ease be

123
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:26,400
less reactive be kinder be wiser I know there are ways their

124
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,360
practices their teachings their recipes P I know there are I've tried

125
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:39,799
them they seem to work and I know there is a lot

126
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:48,320
more that other people have tried other people have done and have

127
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:54,640
been transformed I trust this is available these practices are

128
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,480
available or known to humanity

129
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,559
and dropping this kind this acknowledgement into your heart into your

130
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:14,240
body and letting the breath the awareness arise from it

131
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,320
a path is available I know it

132
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,440

translated as um confidence or trust sometimes the word faith is used but but

168
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:17,799
not so much so confidence or trust and we started with the theme of sadada

169
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:25,720
trust yesterday as an introduction and now today I'd like to um

170
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:31,679
continue um and as you perhaps noticed with the theme of the

171
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,080
um meditation today the invitations the

172
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:44,440
guidance um today's topic will be about the What's called the triple Jewels the

173
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:51,559
Buddha Dharma Sanaa which sounds really archaic perhaps and and like wait how what does that have to do with me you

174
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:59,480
know but I'll explain because it's really about our Humanity making it personal before I do that I wanted

175
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:09,519
to share something I didn't share from yesterday uh kind of leftover uh which is um confidence trust

176
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,840
which is needed for any Endeavor for any Endeavor we need some confidence and

177
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:20,480
Trust so that we begin we have a trust that oh it is possible maybe it's good

178
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,159
you know some some sense of confidence so that we get started and and also it's needed to

179
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,679
continue this endeavor this practice in this case and one thing I wanted to mention

180
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:37,919
yesterday is that um it's very important especially in

181
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:43,159
this tradition that that confidence or sadada just going to use the word sadada

182
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:49,559
it's it's it's rather beautiful that sadada is uh balanced with wisdom with

183
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:59,600
PA so that it does not fall into um Blind Faith or gullibility

184
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:06,679
rather um or to cynicism so it needs to be balanced to

185
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:12,398
this the sense of confidence with with wisdom

186
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:19,320
so now with today's topic with the quote unquote the classical language trust or

187
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:25,118
Sada Sada uh confid confidence trust in the triple Jewel let's unpack that a

188
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,760
little bit so so let's say think of it this way you know if you wanted to start

189
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:39,118
any um new Endeavor let's say if you wanted to um practice um if you wanted

190
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:45,240
to learn an instrument to play today I've been talking about the cello right during the guided meditation let's say

191
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:51,919
the cello okay so so let's say you wanted to learn how to play the

192
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:59,240
cello um first there has to be some sense of a um confidence or trust that

193
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:04,359
oh yeah it is possible to play the cello this instrument this large instrument

194
00:35:04,359 --> 00:35:10,400
and huge thing but other people have done it you know there's Pablo Casal you

195
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:15,640
know these famous there's yoyo ma if you're familiar with the you know cello

196
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,960
players uh roster prish okay these are all the cello players I know I'm done um

197
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:28,760
you know it's possible people have done it it's possible to learn the cello and you see other people so oh is

198
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:35,320
possible so when you see it is possible for others somebody else has done it so

199
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:41,640
um this this instrument is not unsurmountable someone has another human being has done it so it is possible for

200
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:48,920
me to to learn it's possible for me to Advance at least learn a little bit to to play a little few notes it is

201
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,319
possible so that's that's trust

202
00:35:54,319 --> 00:36:00,880
in the Buddha taking Refuge or having trust in the Buddha here which is oh

203
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:07,119
somebody has done it there's a human being Buddha who's done that so I know I know that there is an inner Buddha it's

204
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:15,680
possible for me too it's not impossible he was a human being he wasn't a God and he made that very very clear um

205
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:24,400
in his teachings that he wasn't a God he wasn't a super you know he was a human being that had who had woken up who had

206
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:33,440
um practiced and had found the way to more happiness freedom and ease and compassion and and uh yeah

207
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:39,079
these beautiful qualities of the Buddha so so that's

208
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:44,920
um that's so trusting that it is possible it is possible uh because

209
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:51,000
someone else has done it compassion wisdom Purity

210
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:57,079
Etc so outer Buddha inner Buddha outer Buddha inner it is possible for me

211
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:03,480
someone else has done it and then and back to the musical

212
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:10,160
instrument example you know that there are there are ways practice you know nowadays

213
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:17,359
there's an app for everything right so there's an app for everything or there's you know through the centuries people

214
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:23,599
have taught have learned how to play the cello right through um the centuries

215
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:30,920
there there is a way to learn you do the scales right first you do the the scales and then or maybe first I don't know

216
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:38,280
anything about the well let's see so you you kind of learn how to hold the bow how how how to hold the instrument how

217
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:44,640
to move it you learn the notes maybe then you do the scales then maybe you do

218
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:51,599
a simple song and then the more complicated one you know all that so the music theory then you start to learn

219
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:58,720
music theory get interested in that so there's a way there's a recipe for this it's not like okay there's a sh go it's

220
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,400
there's a recipe ah okay so that's taking Refuge or having trust in the

221
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,119
Dharma the Dharma the teachings of the Buddha uh they've been

222
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:16,599
developed they they're 2700 years old and there's a recipe there is a way

223
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:25,440
if you want to become Kinder wiser have more happiness more freedom in your heart uh etc etc more peace in the world

224
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:32,920
this is what you do you know you sit silently you train your awareness to be

225
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:38,079
calm you train your heart in meta in loving kindness you practice in the in

226
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:45,359
between times when you get off your cushion you practice kindness generosity to others there's recipes right these

227
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:52,319
are you the Dharma is vast there there are a lot of recipes there are a lot of

228
00:38:52,319 --> 00:39:00,480
teachings how to do this there is a way so it's it's just trusting that yeah there they I know they teachings of

229
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,760
course I'm not alone like okay go figure this out okay just become happier and

230
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:13,720
Kinder um so trusting that there is a way there is a way just Humanity has

231
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:21,760
figured it out we're not prehistoric like in caves like yeah how do I do this thing um

232
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:26,800
so so there there is a way trusting that there is a way and then trusting that

233
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:32,880
other people have have done this okay let's go back to the musical analogy so

234
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:39,800
so yeah there are lots of people who have learned to play instruments in the world you know you can you know listen

235
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:45,520
to recordings oh yeah cello player there oh chello player there and you know

240
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:16,560

247
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,920
trust in uh that is a path so that's the

248
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:04,839
Dharma trusting that I'm going to go out of order for a moment trusting that there is a path

249
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:10,960
they're teachings that other people have done it and it's possible for me I can

250
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:18,560
do this too I I can do this I can I can I can learn more maybe maybe if it's too

251
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:25,319
hard sometimes to see I can you know I can be fully awaken maybe that's a little uh it might be accessible maybe

252
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:32,240
that brings you confidence but but trusting that I can have a little more freedom I can have a little more freedom

253
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,079
kindness for myself for others I can have more peace uh just a little more I

256
00:41:51,520 --> 00:42:00,200
