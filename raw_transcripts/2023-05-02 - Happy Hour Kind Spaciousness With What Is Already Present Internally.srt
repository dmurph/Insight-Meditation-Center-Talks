00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:50,239
earning awareness inward

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,180
and Grading whatever is present in the heart and the mind and the body

27
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:10,080

29
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:22,560
maybe agitation [Music] distraction heaviness in the heart whatever is

30
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:31,080
present allowing it to be present just as it is

31
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,080
with kindness relaxing the body

32
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,980

can all be here

34
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:02,959
and letting the breath be just as it is you don't have to breathe in any special way

35
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:09,959
and tuning into the spaciousness there is around holding

36
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:17,060
all of present in the body in the mind

37
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,860
as if the breath is expansive it's spacious

38
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:35,120
making peaceful calm space to be with everything just as it is

39
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,979
letting the body be relaxed and breathing away whatever is present with

40
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:14,240

making space if the mind is busy distracted okay

44
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:45,960

48
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:30,800
it's plenty of space in the heart and the mind for everything to be here just as it is

49
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,540
nothing else is needed

50
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,519

now before we turn to a small group practice

91
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:18,899
I wanted to just say a few words about what we did tonight a summary so the invitation tonight was

92
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:26,159
actually a very simple invitation the invitation was to be with the breath

93
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:34,679
and letting the breath make space make space in accepting space

94
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:41,159
around whatever is accepting kind space around whatever is

95
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:47,760
present in the body and the mind and the Heart without pushing them away by connecting with the breath as a way

96
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,539
of stability as to create collection collectiveness of mind and

97
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:59,760
kindness and then a sense of spaciousness spaciousness because there's so much

98
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,880
more we usually focus on what's difficult and our mind gets really tight and small but this invitation for

99
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,820
spaciousness and then realize wow yes the challenge with difficulties if there are any

100
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:17,220
emotions we can have them without being completely overwhelmed by him there's a

101
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:22,740
lot more that can be present and at the end I invited you to turn to

102
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:29,340
uh recollecting your own goodness to Glad in the heart it's uh one way of

103
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:35,820
doing this practice that's called Buddha nusrati they're collections of the qualities of the Buddha in this way

104
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:43,679
we're we're collecting the qualities of the Buddha within the kindness the generosity the

105
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:50,820
the wisdom itself that was what we did and whatever showed up for you or didn't

106
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:56,100
show up for you is all fine it's exactly as it needs to be let there be

107
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:01,980
acceptance peace non-judgment what needed to arise

108
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:08,059
this month this this evening this well depending on your time zone Wherever You Are

109
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:17,640
so now I'd like to invite us to uh turn to practicing in small groups and um

110
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:23,100
The Prompt is what happens what happens

111
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:29,100
you know when you have a difficult emotion what happens if you have a difficult emotion

112
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:34,860
um what what happens if you deny it if you try to push it away deny that you

113
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:40,019
have it versus if you allow it to be which doesn't mean that you act out of

114
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:45,899
it but if there's a sense of okay frustration arising sadness arising

115
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:51,720
and and also if there is a sense of spaciousness around the acceptance so

116
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:57,419
maybe some words come up and if no words come up you can just bow and say pass

117
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:03,120
hold uh kind presence um in the container

118
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:09,118
so so I'm going to create the breakout

119
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:15,800
rooms take care of yourselves take care of each other be kind

120
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,940
and um hold on one second

121
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:26,220
let's see creating the rooms here

122
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:33,480
okay all right I think I am ready to open them my ready actually wait I need

123
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:40,919
to do one more thing before I open them hold on uh you can have patience you can you can

124
00:34:40,919 --> 00:34:46,740
practice patience as I uh as I do as I move things around okay

125
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:52,260
let's see what happened I didn't mean to do that hold up all

126
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:58,320
right having some technical difficulties difficult okay there I think that's it all right great okay here we go I'm

127
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,380
about to open their rooms take care of yourselves take care of each other be kind

128
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:10,680
um okay and oh yes one last thing I forgot to say um in in practice in in the small groups

129
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:16,200
yeah a couple of things I forgot to say uh one is let's go in in alphabetical

130
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,540
order and the second is that you only share please you're invited to share just

131
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:27,480
something from your own practice just maybe share a short nugget maybe a

132
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,880
minute or half a minute and then let another person speak and then another person and then it comes back to you so

133
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,640
you can go around a few times and it's not appropriate to ask questions from

134
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,040
another P from someone else or or God or

135
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:51,560
lead the group just show up with what you want to share and let people share whatever they want to share or not just

136
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:59,700
creating a safe space as possible for one another is safe and and uh accepting

137
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:06,000
space okay all right here we go I'm going to open the rooms now okay welcome

138

139
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:19,440
can either raise your hand if you haven't spoken for a while in the group

140
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:26,160
um you can raise your Zoom hand if it's your physical hand I may not see you we can also share your Reflections or

141
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,400
questions in chat and if you send them to me privately I will read your

142
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,800
reflection not your name if you send them to everyone I will also read your

143
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:44,700
name to attribute it to you so what did you discover in this practice or either to silent

144
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:49,520
practice or in the sharing why did you discover

145
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:55,920
but making space with kindness for what is emotions challenges instead of

146
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,880
pushing them away letting their kind space

147
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:08,420
maybe with Stillness even any reflections

148
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:12,079
Sabrina

149
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:21,660
yeah I uh I showed up today with a migraine and I didn't realize how much I

150
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:28,920
was pushing the pain and frustration away until until I chose to really embrace it how

151
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:35,280
much like more space there was and how much much more acceptance I was feeling and

152
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:41,640
and then by the end of the session my migraine was gone so it's just like it felt really practical for me

153
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:48,480
um as well as like a reminder to keep acknowledging my my emotions rather than pushing pushing them away so practically

154
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:56,940
it was really great and like emotionally it felt really great so thank you so much yay thank you Sabrina oh my goodness I'm

160

yes yes yeah um what I shared was that um

161
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:42,900
I I had been in a hit-and-run bike accident I had to work through a lot of that was in August and I actually showed

162
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:49,980
up for this group got through it when um back in anyway back in the end of it was

163
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:55,560
Diana that night anyway fear and anxiety and having to work

164
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:01,020
through that came out of that accident that's become easy for me what I've noticed lately is when I'm feeling

165
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:07,560
really happy I feel guilty around people because there's still a lot of a lot of people I

166
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:12,599
know are in fear and post covet kind of a malaise here in San Francisco they've

167
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:19,440
lost jobs just or you know so something you did last Friday we did the

168
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:26,460
emanating love and being like a son so I noticed lately I just

169
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:33,300
one ways I've mitigated that and guilt for feeling so happy around people who are sad is like I'm just gonna shine and

170
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:38,400
share my joy and just yeah because I don't want to give

171
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,619
it up but it was just a great tool that you gave Friday to help me

172
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:48,900

174
00:39:54,980 --> 00:40:02,760
guilt or shame like others happy and it's you know it's bad for me to be in three lives actually I can I can give it

the same way acknowledge that you're afraid don't try to push fear away can you

187
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:32,060
see it acknowledge it okay breathe with it make space for it

and don't let it take the whole Space don't let it suck the air out of the

191
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:58,320
have a seat on the table but not the but not the megaphone so that's what I would say three diving and see that in your
