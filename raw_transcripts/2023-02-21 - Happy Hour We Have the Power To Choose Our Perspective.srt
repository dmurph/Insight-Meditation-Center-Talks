trusting making a decision to see the universe as a friendly place

91
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,600
taking on this perspective we can take so many perspectives on just taking this

92
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,260
on as if you're changing your glasses you can always take these glasses off later after the meditation just try it

96
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:02,460
but it's all okay it's always been will ever be

97
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:11,299

98
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,880

sides what shifts what changes and um and things can shift and change so

133
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:23,039

134
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:32,240
to to show up with one another in small groups and whatever is said or not said

135
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:37,620
internally in the group can we love what is can we just practice

136
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:43,620
for just a few minutes in a small group The Rubber and meeting the road can you

137
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:48,659
show up with kindness with two strangers or maybe two friends

138
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:54,419
um and just show up with kindness loving what is in the moment even if it's back

139
00:31:54,419 --> 00:32:00,299
pain which I'm currently loving um whatever is is arising she's loving

140
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:06,240
what is loving what is so so the invitation for the small

141
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:13,980
groups are gonna try to make them of size three for everyone and the invitation is let's go

142
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:19,440
um in alphabetical order each person will just share maybe one

143
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:26,820
short very short um maybe just 30 seconds or a minute what what what is it like what what was

144
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:32,760
this practice like and you can say I fell asleep I couldn't love anything this was the reverse like it's all okay

145
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:38,279
but make it very short so that the other folks will have the time to to share as

146
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:46,020
well or if your time comes you can just say pass I'm gonna hold compassionate presence I'm gonna love the silence and

147
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:51,419
you can perfectly do that no problem just show up with kindness that's for

148

yourself and for others and even if you're cranky or afraid show up with

149
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:04,140
kindness with towards the crankiness and and the fear it's it's

benefit and share for the benefit of others again this sharing is not from a place of ego and look at me it's more

162
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:25,760
like oh so what I discovered look at that in my common Humanity with others and can really help

163
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,679
the community that way Don please

164
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:39,300
um well uh first thanks so much Nikki Sangha uh uh one of my favorite parts of

165
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:44,460
the day um I was uh really sleepy I was falling

166
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:49,618
asleep and and then I thought oh no I'm just going to leave and I and I left and

167
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:55,080
then I thought oh wait if I can exercise then maybe that'll wake me up and so that's

168
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:00,300
what I did I was got back on and was doing some exercise and the video off

169
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:05,900
over loving what is

170
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:16,320
so yeah sometimes it's if you've just you've had um a lack of sleep and sleep deprivation

171
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,500
of course when you start to become calm that's where the Mind goes it's like oh you have this debt you need to pay

172
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:27,540
you're like no no I want to bet it like no you've got debt so so then opening

173
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:34,760
the eyes sometimes you know we say walking meditation movement meditation so meditating while you move so so

174
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:41,880
exercising is also movement meditation and when you're really present with the movement of the body so great you worked

uh well Nikki thank you for your your share and

178
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:05,339
um what I actually have a an aversion to for tomorrow's work because this is the

179
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:10,500
night before going to work tomorrow so I have this animal version at work

180
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:17,700
so when you actually suggested shifting lens or changing eye the eye glass

181
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:23,160
I said well maybe I could actually love worked for tomorrow and then it suddenly

182
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:30,720
it shifted and I thank you for for giving that Insight thank you so much

183
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,300
thanks for sharing that now which which you not I don't want to put you on the spot but I'm curious is this first first

184
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:42,660
just to say it sounds amazing and wonderful that you tried it and you were curious like oh yeah let me try it and

185
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:49,140
you tried it and then it shifted and and is there anything else you you were willing to share like how it shifted

186
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:54,200
like what opened up what thoughts opened up about work that were not available before

187
00:36:54,200 --> 00:37:01,079
well I realized that the lens is always there to shift it's it's a matter of choosing what lens

188
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:06,540
to look and I am so grateful for this hunger and

189
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:12,300
to you okay thank you Nell you you nailed it

190
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:18,300
beautifully the lens is always there and we can always choose that's one thing

191
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:24,240
that cannot be taken away from us everything else can go but our freedom

192
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,420
to choose is our first and last freedom is is how we choose to see something so

193
