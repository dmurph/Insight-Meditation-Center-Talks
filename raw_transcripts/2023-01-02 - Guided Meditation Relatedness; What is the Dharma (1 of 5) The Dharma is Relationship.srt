00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,920
foreign

2
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:19,380
greetings on this first Monday of the Year 2023

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,380
we made it this far and um

4
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:32,520
happy to start this year this way with all of you as I have this last uh two years now

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:40,140
that um two januaries it's remarkable that we've had this time

6
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,660
together and a chance to do this kind of teaching and practice

7
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,899
so thank you for this chance opportunity for me so um

8
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:59,640
one of the things that I want to emphasize today is relatedness

9
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:07,979
that certainly just I just uh evoked our relatedness through this 7

10
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,080
A.M sitting this early morning and um

11
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,560
and there's a relationship that is here even if you're the for the first time here welcome

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,900
um you're somewhat in relationship now to what's happening here to my teaching

13
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,180
to me and I and me to you without that relationship what's

14
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,540
happening here today would not happen and um and one of the key elements of

15
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:43,200
Dharma practice is in fact to focus on focus on relatedness

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:50,159
not not in some large abstract way but in an immediate way here and now

17
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,720
so there's a we don't often focus on the relationship that exists

18
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:05,159
we often focus on the things of the world objects people

19
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,280
and so there's an object of our thoughts an object of our concern and we're focusing on that person said

20
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,459
this and that was wrong or that was great or that person's doing that or or we're focusing on ourselves as an

21
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:23,459
object me I'm I'm the victim I'm the the wonderful person delusions of

22
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:29,660
grandeur perhaps but I'm here and uh and things are happening to me

23
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:35,660
and I'm measuring what's happening to me about whether it's good for me or bad for me or something

24
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:42,300
and I don't want to diminish the role of that there's a

25
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:48,000
place for that kind of thinking for sure but uh when we enter into the Dharma

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
there's a new orientation and that is what takes precedence

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,239
is how all these objects including oneself are

28
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:07,140
relating to each other in between you and me there's a relationship in

29
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,200
between me and my breakfast there's a relationship that breakfast supports me

30
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,440
I take interest in the breakfast and and between the two uh you know the

31
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,480
breakfast occurs and um and a tremendous amount of our

32
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,720
life immediate life is occurring because of what's in relationship to us

33
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,519
what's in relationship to this mutuality um our life is uh is related to the

34
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,900
oxygen that's around us without that we wouldn't live that relationship of how

35
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:48,780
the or the way that we interact with oxygen is crucial for us to be alive

36
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,879
there's us there's oxygen into how we relate to it the connection

37
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:59,940
and you can go through a whole list of things like that and one of the important aspects of

38
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:05,099
Dharma practice is to stay close to that place of relatedness what is that

39
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:11,640
relationship and some of that time that relationship is are doing we like and we don't like

40
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:19,799
something we want we don't want something where open and aware of something or

41
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:26,280
we're shut down or we're asserting ourselves on something so it's how we're relating to

42
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:33,479
it is important how we're relating to ourselves we have a not so nice thought

43
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:39,780
and then what's the relationship we form to that thought we judge ourselves by it or we attack it

44
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:46,919
or something and we have a wonderful thought then we take pride in it and want to show off to

45
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:53,340
other people this wonderful realization we have and so what is that relationship and how

46
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,500
to keep that relationship be won that's where freedom is found

47
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:05,400
we're not necessarily becoming free ourselves we are freeing the relationship

48
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,840
between us and all things including ourselves

49
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,180
and uh so freeing ourselves from this preoccupation with self

50
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:25,560
measuring everything from the point vantage point of Me Myself and mine and instead looking at the relationship

51
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:34,139
the relatedness Is that relatedness real skillful or unskillful is it helpful or

52
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:40,860
not is it healthy or not those are to keep it really simple

53
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:48,680
is there an ouch in that relatedness or is there an ah

54
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:57,500
so I'll talk more about this but if for now to take a meditation posture

55
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:05,060
and gently close the eyes

56
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:14,840
and just sitting here quietly

57
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:23,240
in what way are you activated in your mind your emotions your heart

58
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,039
that could be seen as a way of relating to something

59
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,919
or a way in which there's a relationship with something

60
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:39,139
outside of you and yourself

61
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,020
the relatedness between

62
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:54,780
sometimes it's initiated by what's around us sometimes what's within us

63
00:06:54,780 --> 00:07:03,800
when I came to IMC today I was being related to by the cold

64
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,160
and I had a relationship to that cold

65
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:28,460
so what what is the relatedness that's operating most for you now

66
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:44,639
relatedness is not necessarily what you do in relating

67
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,280
something might be relating to you

68
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:55,139
impacting you having an effect on you

69
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:59,060
the cold the warmth

70
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:22,860
and then perhaps you can take a few moments to relate to your body

71
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,680
with a gentle tender appreciation

72
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:39,380
probably your body is doing its at the best it can with how it is

73
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:56,000
we can take the body for granted in so many ways to appreciate the body

74
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,940
and the appreciation is a relatedness

75
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:20,040
maybe it's a more important that appreciation

76
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,399
than it is you doing the appreciating

77
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,360
just let there be appreciation

78
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:46,320
and then there's your body breathing there's a significant

79
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,839
impact on you that you breathe

80
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:59,879
breathing relates to everything about you that is living

81
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:13,880
everything you can experience has an experience in your with your body

82
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:21,200
depends on breathing to keep the whole show going

83
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,940
and how are you relating to the breathing

84
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,459
can you adjust that relatingness do something that's allowing and easeful

85
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,459
appreciative

86
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,600
is there some appropriate way that you can trust

87
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,079
the body breathing

88
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,860
and with that trust to accompany

89
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:34,200
your breathing the rhythm of breathing in and breathing

90
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:40,980
out and if anything takes you away from your

91
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:46,260
breathing chances are

92
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:52,019
it's because of the nature of some relationship to something

93
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:59,600
not the something but the relationship you have hurry it has with you

94
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,860
foreign

95
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:15,620
one way or another you are relating to something

96
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:19,699
is that relating

97
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:25,880
supportive or unsupportive for you

98
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:36,800
is it beneficial or unbeneficial could it be more beneficial

99
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:45,380
could there be a right effort in the relatedness

100
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:18,600
there is always relatingness relatedness

101
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,340
how are you relating

102
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:36,140
or how are you receiving what is relating to you

103
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,940
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

104
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:50,940
imagine that the way that you are relating to any other person at any given time or

105
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:59,900
group of people that the way that you relate was Is Not Invisible

106
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:06,720
like a musician has the instrument

107
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,360
musical instrument and as they're playing the instrument and in

108
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:19,919
relationship to those two things there comes music so for you

109
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:25,200
if there's the persons you're with the way there's you and

110
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:32,400
and if the way that you're related came out like music that people could

111
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:38,700
hear or came out as colors that people could

112
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:45,140
see or smells that they could smell

113
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:53,900
how would you think that the way that you relate would appear to other people

114
00:27:54,419 --> 00:28:01,520
would it be beautiful would it be not so beautiful

115
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,520
would there be a sense of Harmony balance

116
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,140
or would it be discordant

117
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:25,440
to offer Goodwill kindness

118
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:33,799
maybe is the way to bring Beauty in the relatedness

119
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:41,760
beautiful music beautiful colors smells

120
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:49,039
it's a way of beautifying this world

121
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:56,159
and while people do not necessarily see with their eyes literally

122
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:03,919
the way we relate to the world has a big impact on ourselves and the world

123
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:12,600
and at the end of The Meditation is a valuable time

124
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:20,700
because maybe just maybe you have more of opportunity to

125
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:27,380
have a healthy and a sincere

126
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,840
well wishing for others

127
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:41,940
and so to spend the next minute with that well-wishing for individuals for

128
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,919
groups of people for everyone

129
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:55,820
may all people be happy

130
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:05,120
may all people be safe

131
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:12,440
may all people be peaceful

132
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:21,380
and may all people be free

133
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,679
and may all of us meditating together God into the world

134
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:38,480
to make a collective Beauty Collective music

135
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:46,620
through simple acts of kindness May our meditation be for the benefit

136
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:51,440
and the welfare of all people

137
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:08,109
[Music]

138
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,100
thank you

139
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:27,360
hello everyone and welcome to the first talk

140
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:34,200
of the year and beginning of another week of five part series

141
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:42,360
and uh what I like to do this week is to answer the question what is the Dharma

142
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:48,720
and I'm hoping this series will nice create a nice foundation for what will follow

143
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,299
um which isn't completely decided but uh I would like it to build on this

144
00:31:54,299 --> 00:32:01,200
and um and so Dharma is uh some ways it's a

145
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:09,120
very important very Central word in Buddhism because it could mean Buddhism uh the Dharma sometimes sometimes is

146
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,220
synonymous with the word Buddhism the word Buddhism is a kind of a modern

147
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:20,100
Western invention um it didn't really exist that in that

148
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:27,200
kind of way and as an ism word um in in Asia in fact uh

149
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,840
uh even the word religion didn't quite exist and so in some of the Asian languages and when they had contact with

150
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:40,380
the Western civil Western culture they um had the kind of invent a word for

151
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:45,600
religion uh to translate religion into their language

152
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,840
and now so the word Dharma sometimes holds all of that but Dharma also has more specific

153
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,299
meanings and uh and the and has even in the

154
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:06,539
ancient times they said they had a lot of different meanings and um and uh uh through three a list of

155
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:13,080
three things that Dharma means that's I think very evocative that from the ancient commentaries is

156
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:19,860
that uh it's all kind of uh words that are built on

157
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:29,000
words that are built on verbs activities something dynamic and the first is uh pariyati

158
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:34,620
uh p-a-r-i-y-a-t-t-i and um

159
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:40,019
I'm not sure if there's one or two with teeth and uh pariati is usually taken to mean

160
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:47,399
teachings but it's based on a root word it has to do with obtaining receiving and

161
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:53,220
sometimes pariati is understood to be the act of learning so first there's learning which is an

162
00:33:53,220 --> 00:34:00,659
activity the second is my

163
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:08,220
images means to practice which is also a verb and the last one is

164
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:14,898
adigama which is to obtain or to attain something to reach something

165
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:23,099
so these are so here the Dharma has three different activities and and so when having something Dynamic

166
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:31,320
not something static that's being emphasized and that right now the dynamism of what

167
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:38,460
Dharma means I would like to encapsulate that Dharma means relatedness

168
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:44,220
the ancient way of saying it back in the time of the Buddha was uh through a

169
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:52,138
little slogan that goes whoever sees the Dharma sees dependent

170
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:58,380
arising whoever sees dependent arising sees the Dharma

171
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:04,280
the powerful statement dependent arising means that things occur independent

172
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:11,099
Independence and other things the things that things are not independent they don't self-exist they

173
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:18,060
don't just simply materialize in thin air for no reason at all or no cause or no conditions at all

174
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:23,700
um they're always there because of some some preceding conditions some events

175
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:30,599
some occurrence that then is the possibility for the next thing to occur

176
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:37,320
and um so human life itself is clearly dependent on many factors in the present

177
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:43,260
moment and down Through the Ages that had to occur in order to there'd be this

178
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:50,099
physical physical and psychological mental life that we embody we experience we are

179
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:55,859
so you know where in some ways who we are as human beings could be said to be

180
00:35:55,859 --> 00:36:01,079
a hundred percent dependent on something else existing for us to be

181
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:06,780
able to live breathing you know we have to ask to be oxygen uh

182
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:12,119
water there has to be water has to be on this planet uh how did that happen how

183
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:18,119
did oxygen happen um it was a conditions that had to build over millennia

184
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:23,520
millions and billions of years for it to be conditions right for what we have as

185
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:30,540
human life and those have to persist and so you know you can go layers and layers of in

186
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:35,700
the present moment if things Our Lives depend on and our psychological life our inner

187
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:41,579
life is dependent all kinds of things as well and some of them might be hormones and

188
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:48,680
our biology affects our psychology quite a bit uh what other what happens in the world

189
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:57,500
and some people their moods is completely attached to connected to wedded to

190
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:05,339
things in the world and what people do what other people are doing or substances how they feel are

191
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:12,240
completely dependent on having coffee or not coffee or or drugs and not drugs or

192
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,780
alcohol and not alcohol and and so how the mood and how we feel this can be dependent on many things exercise

193
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:24,599
and not exercise and um but it's in that dependency in

194
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:29,940
that not dependency in terms of like codependent exactly psychological term

195
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:34,980
but uh the fact that things occur in relationships to other things occurring

196
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:41,400
as well and that relatedness between things and that's how I would like to present

197
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:48,000
this idea of dependent arising today is it has to do with the relatedness

198
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,940
um that Dharma is the relationship the relatedness between things that can

199
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:59,400
be called things in fact in Buddhism uh I think this it's

200
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:07,980
fairly it's a fair thing to say that there are no things in Buddhism there are only uh Dynamic processes

201
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:14,040
Dynamic occurrences events that are moving and

202
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,140
act in action and process and um

203
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:24,720
and so um uh so or at least that's what Buddhism

204
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,780
focuses on so much is the dynamic aspect of life and in terms of our psychological

205
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:36,420
spiritual mental physical life it's very

206
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:41,520
much caught up and caught up and involved in this whole dynamic world of

207
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:47,400
relatedness in relationships that everything occurs through

208
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,619
partly because everything that happens even if uh happens through

209
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:59,760
the dynamic process the dynamic activity of perception

210
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,460
so a mountain might not seem so Dynamic it might seem like a real thing that's there

211
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:10,560
is changing slowly over time but not much in my lifetime Maybe

212
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:17,940
but the perception of the mountain is a dynamic activity and everything that we experience in the

213
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:26,220
world goes through our perception deeper than our perception it goes through our liking and not liking it our

214
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:33,540
sense of this is Pleasant or unpleasant partly because our evaluation of things

215
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:40,500
uh everything goes happen to us then goes through the way that the way that we know it do we know it with

216
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:46,260
contraction and tightness and assertiveness in greed or generosity or without it

217
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:52,740
and so there's this whole dynamic world of things that happen in relationship to

218
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:58,380
other things being there and that is that's the Dharma

219
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:05,160
Dharma is found there and and uh and then caring for it

220
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:10,859
because that is also where bondage occurs where attachment and

221
00:40:10,859 --> 00:40:18,060
tightness where suffering occurs is not there's no inherent suffering that just kind of pops up in the universe like out

222
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:23,280
of the blue suffering occurs in relationship to

223
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:29,000
something else it's a way of relating it's a relatedness and um

224
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:35,660
and freedom is a shift in that relationship

225
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:42,359
so this idea that the Dharma is relatedness

226
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:48,599
is a paradigm change from I believe how many people live their lives

227
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:56,040
where they live their lives as if focused more on Me Myself and mind what's happening to me

228
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:01,140
my ideas my ideas of self

229
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:08,220
what's happening out there who those people are what they're doing but there's a paradigm shift of

230
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:13,440
appreciating what's happening between the people or between us and the world

231
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,660
and nature and everything that what's the relatedness

232
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:23,760
also within ourselves how do we relate to our inner experience

233
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:31,859
how are we relating to the outer experience that's where the Dharma is begins to be discovered

234
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:38,119
and that is all to do with things which are fluid and dynamic and because of that

235
00:41:38,119 --> 00:41:44,339
they can be changed maybe not easily but that's what Dharma

236
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:49,500
practice the practice of relatedness the practice the practice of working with

237
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:55,800
this whole nation notion of things arise depend on other things is we can shift

238
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:03,420
and change the relatedness that the dependencies the dynamic the dynamic quality of it

239
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:08,960
so that what supports our hearts our minds our our freedom

240
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:14,339
is more present than what supports attachment and clinging and and

241
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:20,599
suffering so it's a paradigm shift and so you might try

242
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:26,400
stretching your mind to look at kind of an invisible world

243
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,160
the world between another person and you what is the

244
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:38,820
relationship that's being formed like especially if you meet a stranger maybe that's easiest there what's that

245
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:46,680
real how's that relationship before you get to know them are you afraid of them are you cautious are you eager are you curious

246
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:51,839
that's a way of being in a relationship as you talk with a stranger do you feel

247
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:59,099
more like closed down and pulling back or you feel more open and interested in

248
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:04,500
is there kindness is there friendship going back and forth or the opposite

249
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:11,880
what is happening in that invisible World kind of that maybe each one of you don't

250
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,920
necessarily see but maybe you can feel maybe you can sense

251
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:24,060
if that relatedness between you was music would it be beautiful music or not so

252
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:31,260
beautiful if it was color would be beautiful array of colors or uh this uh unharmonious

253
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:37,260
display of colors how is that the relatedness

254
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:43,200
so I would encourage you for today to look at this world that's

255
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,540
has to do with how you are in relationship to all things including

256
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:56,520
yourself what's the nature of that relationship and that is dynamic that is Shifting and changing throughout the day

257
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:01,740
and what kind of relating relatedness

258
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:07,680
what kind of meeting does things outside of you have towards you

259
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:13,140
how are things relating to you the air that you breathe how is it relating

260
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:19,440
is it you know me could say it's not relating at all but it does have a relationship to you

261
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:25,560
what is that relationship what is the relationship to the food that you eat how does it impact you

262
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:31,859
and um and maybe there's a way to do this Paradigm Shift here

263
00:44:31,859 --> 00:44:38,579
that you really kind of are stretching yourself to be in the world from a very radically

264
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:44,220
different perspective than how you usually go through the days the perspective of what is the

265
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:51,180
relatedness that's going on right here and how do you want to relate what is

266
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:58,079
the beautiful way of relating so the Dharma

267
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:03,920
is this is what arises in relationship

268
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:10,859
and if you can see how things arise in a related way then you're seeing the

269
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:18,380
Dharma you see the Dharma if you see how things arise in a related way

270
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:23,880
so thank you and we'll continue this topic of what is the Dharma

271
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,240
tomorrow
