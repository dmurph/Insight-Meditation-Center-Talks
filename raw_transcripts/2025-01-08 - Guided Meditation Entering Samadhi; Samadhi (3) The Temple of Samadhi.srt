1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:08,480
so hello everyone and Welcome to our 30 minute

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:16,358
meditation and I feel happy sitting down here thinking

3
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:24,599
about sharing with you this theme this of samadi something that I hold very

4
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:31,160
dear um and partly because samadi is is

5
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:38,200
um something quite special um uh you know nowadays we talk

6
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:43,280
about uh secular mindfulness I don't think it makes sense

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,320
to talk about secular somadi at least in my

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,239
mind because samadi has a I have a profound sense of reverence for

9
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:01,359
samadi and uh to give you a little sense of this

10
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:08,960
maybe is that um there are two general movements that uh of Buddhist Meditation

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,960
terad Buddhism and the way I'm going to say it now is uh little bit um for the

12
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,479
purposes of distinctions and they in practice they

13
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:28,240
they don't actually play out so dramatically different but there's still a significant

14
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:36,079
distinction and so there's two general movements of Buddhist tabot and Buddhist

15
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:43,240
Meditation one is uh to focus on the objects of

16
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:49,719
attention and to do that thoroughly is to make everything into an

17
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:57,039
object and um without and the subject disappears the other way to

18
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:01,840
practice is to

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,720
focus on being subjective everything becomes a

20
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,080
subject uh all objects fall away and everything becomes part of the subject

21
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,560
the subjective experience and somadi belongs to the latter and mindfulness a little B more

22
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,120
belongs to the former and to make there's more to be said about this of course but just for

23
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,840
the purposes of today um and so when we sit for

24
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,920
somebody there is a shift into the subjective world of

25
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,599
experience not the world that we interpret not the world of being

26
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,840
self-consciously subjective it's not subjective and that it we tie it to me

27
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,239
myself and mine but rather there's something kind of like we're living inside of

28
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:00,640
it as opposed to looking at it or considering it as

29
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:08,760
something that uh we look on it's more something we experience we enter into

30
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:13,840
and the Buddha used the language of entering when he talked about

31
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:20,440
samadi and uh finally uh as an introductory words of samadi

32
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,519
today um it I think it can be useful for those

33
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:32,040
of you who are so inclined to consider

34
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,640
samadi entering into samadi is like entering into

35
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,400
a uh sacred Temple sacred

36
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:51,079
spot entering into a sacred uh

37
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:59,920
location and not a location you just stumble into or um casually go into

38
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:07,439
but something that you would as soon as you come into the edges of it you would become quiet you would change your

39
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,040
demeanor you would enter with attention present moment attention you'd enter

40
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,720
with reverence and care with u a sense of now the

41
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:26,040
place is has a significance a atmosphere

42
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,759
a value that um it's important to be

43
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,120
attuned to be respectful for maybe even

44
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:44,840
with a sense of reverence so so for me these qualities of respect

45
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:51,919
and reverence and Care Attunement belong to this subjective

46
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:59,320
world of how we bring all of ourselves into the situation not just treating somadi as an

47
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:06,639
object like there an object of of concentration that we're going to zero in on and stick with but we're entering

48
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,600
into a new mode of being a mode of being where

49
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:20,240
subjectively we are offering ourselves or allowing ourselves to be

50
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,600
changed by something that is not our doing

51
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:33,520
exactly just like you if you walk into a sacred Grove of trees or power spot in some

52
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,639
place of nature just being there something shifts but if you stay on your phone

53
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,440
looking at a YouTube channel walking in you probably nothing would happen probably for

54
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,600
you so here we are so assuming a meditation

55
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,720
posture which is beginning to build

56
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,080
evoke the temple of

57
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,880
somebody and perhaps entering into the

58
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,199
posture not treating it as an object where the Mind focuses and

59
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,800
arranges things but within the body

60
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:30,759
itself as if the body from the inside out is aligning itself ATT tuning itself

61
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:38,400
adjusting itself to be

62
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,599
alert to be

63
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,080
awake to have a

64
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:59,639
balance and part of this turning inward to the subjective experience

65
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:06,960
is to lower your gaze and perhaps closing your

66
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:20,440
eyes and as a preparation for entering the

67
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:27,160
meditation to adjust yourself prepare yourself by taking a few long slow

68
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:35,599
gentle breaths just long enough to not become winded or strained

69
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,080
by it but long enough to

70
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,840
feel a fuller embodied connection to your

71
00:07:52,159 --> 00:08:01,720
body and as you exhale to relax soften the the

72
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:12,199
body and as you relax to take all the rest of you and

73
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:16,479
let it relax into your

74
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,479
body for

75
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,519
and then to let your breathing return to

76
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:23,440
normal and with if it works for you with a feeling of

77
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:31,360
reverence or tenderness or gentleness

78
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:41,839
feeling different parts of your body as you breathe in and as you exhale soften relax those

79
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:48,279
parts of your body a kind of

80
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:55,079
relaxation where that part of the body can feel like it join joining the

81
00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:03,600
rest of the body tension in the body is kind of a pulling

82
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,680
away relaxing is a

83
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,120
joining on the inhale feeling the muscles of your

84
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:23,839
face on the exhale softening the face

85
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,680
on the inhale feeling the shoulders on the exhale relaxing

86
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,880
softening the shoulders

87
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:29,680
on the inhale feeling the middle of the chest on the exhale

88
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:37,079
a gentling tendering of the chest

89
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:31,560
on the inhale feeling the belly on the exhale exh ale softening

90
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:37,240
the belly and as it

91
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:45,639
softens settling relaxing the body into the pull of

92
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,639
gravity

93
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,920
on the inhale feeling the thinking brain thinking

94
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:22,800
mind and on the exhale quieting the thinking mind

95
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,399
and then finally when you go into a sacred Temple

96
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,480
sometimes there's little rituals of

97
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:11,240
purification and it's not so far-fetched to see breathing as a process of

98
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:19,839
purification the byproduct of carbon dioxide is

99
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:31,040
exhaled to bring in oxygen that's so necessary for life

100
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:44,199
centering yourself on the rhythm of breathing to the subjective experience

101
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:51,680
of the body breathing the

102
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,920
lifegiving purifying process

103
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:12,839
of breathing as a sacred

104
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:18,199
process into which to enter and

105
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,120
settle to be intimate with

106
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,639
exploring the Deep subjective

107
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,720
experience that flows from the experience of

108
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
breathing

109
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

110
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

111
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

112
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

113
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

114
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

115
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

116
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

117
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

118
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,600
for e

119
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:45,919
as you exhale let go into your

120
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:54,520
body and as you inhale fill your body with

121
00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:00,320
awareness release your torso and chest

122
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:13,679
as if you're entering deeply into your subjective

123
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:22,080
experience free of self reference free

124
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:29,960
of being self-conscious about it like you would perhaps if you went

125
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,600
into a sacred

126
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
location

127
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

128
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

129
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

130
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

131
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
for e

132
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:24,679
and as we come to the end of this

133
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:34,159
sitting ever so gently follow the full cycle of

134
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:43,559
breathing in and breathing out in a tender way a gentle

135
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:51,080
way as if you're caring for something invaluable

136
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:05,320
as if you're touching something with care and

137
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:24,320
gentleness and then breathe a teeny bit deeper

138
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:31,159
Fuller as if your edges of your body your

139
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:37,559
chest is beginning to open up out into the wider

140
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:45,639
world as if you're breathing your

141
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:52,159
being is available to be attentive to

142
00:27:52,159 --> 00:28:00,120
care gently for the environment in which you're meditating

143
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,919
for the people and living beings that might be close

144
00:28:12,679 --> 00:28:21,398
by out Beyond into your neighborhoods towns

145
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:29,399
districts across the lands across the seas

146
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:39,679
a feeling of sacredness feeling of

147
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:47,360
tenderness a feeling of kindness that spreads out from you

148
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,080
across the

149
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:03,080
lands we're we're all together as subjects it's all a

150
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:11,760
subject no objects out there in this field of

151
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:21,480
care and then wishing may all beings be

152
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:28,000
happy may all beings be safe

153
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,600
may all beings be

154
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,360
peaceful may all beings be

155
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:49,600
free and may it be that each of our care each of our kindness

156
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:59,000
friendliness touches everything we see and know today

157
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:06,360
may we leave in this world traces of kindness wherever we

158
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,919
go thank

159
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
you e

160
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:20,000
so hello and welcome to this third talk on series on Long series now it's going

161
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,159
to be on samade and this first uh five days of it

162
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:33,799
is really setting the stage it's introduction to the topic and entering into it and and today in particular uh I

163
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:40,519
want to emphasize that uh uh Som is something

164
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:47,480
that I believe uh is appropriate to enter with

165
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,679
humility with care with um reverence

166
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:59,000
with respect that um uh too many times I have

167
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:05,679
and people I know have uh attempted to get concentrated without humility or

168
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,960
reverence or care with a kind of uh forcefulness the

169
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:17,919
kind of expectation I'm going to do this and I can do it I'm going to really kind of Bear Down and laser focus and just

170
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,519
stay focused and and um and um and it is

171
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,039
possible to get somewhat concentrated that way maybe sometimes very concentrated in certain kind of way with

172
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,679
that kind of attitude but I don't think that that's the useful attitude to have

173
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:40,039
and useful for what purpose in the Dharma in the Buddhism

174
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:47,320
samadi is the the precondition it's often considered a precondition for the

175
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:56,559
rising of liberating insight and that uh if uh and liberating

176
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:04,279
Insight is not just an understanding that we appropriate for the purposes of the self and but it's

177
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:10,000
liberating Insight from the appropriation of self from the

178
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,360
attachments to self and doing things for the self it's allowing ourselves to Step

179
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:22,760
Beyond the limitations uh that we create for ourselves when we Orient ourselves

180
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:28,840
Around Me Myself and mine and uh

181
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:35,480
and that is pretty special it can feel like Grace it can feel like something

182
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:43,799
transpersonal sometimes people even use the word Transcendent a word that I don't care too much for but uh uh it's

183
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:50,039
for some people it's the only thing that can represent something that seems to take them out of their usual

184
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:58,399
understanding of self and um so samadi and uh in my studies of

185
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:05,159
Indian religions it seems that there are some of the religions in India or yoga

186
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:10,560
Traditions India that uh use the word samadi the way Buddhists would use the

187
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:17,638
word nibana that samadi is sometimes a word for the ultimate uh experience that

188
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:24,919
these yogic Traditions will emphasize and uh in Buddhism that's usually not the case but uh it does

189
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:30,158
point to this kind of very special feeling of what samade is it's and so I

190
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:37,760
like to think of it as um uh samade sometimes and uh as uh a temple a sacred

191
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,919
Temple that I enter into and um maybe some of you don't care

192
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:49,638
for that kind of metaphor um sometimes I've thought about it a sacred grove of trees I've been in

193
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:54,800
places in nature where uh it just felt like everything got quiet and peaceful

194
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,079
and clear and and um and this is something inside shifts and

195
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:07,560
changes in my whole demeanor um because of the place that and it calls a certain kind of clarity

196
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:14,040
of attention like now I'm really here and I'm here with a kind of reverence

197
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:19,680
and sometimes there's a a wonderful feeling of being quite small because of

198
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,280
the great Majesty of uh of the

199
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:32,160
Natural Things natural world world that's in that place but uh but it's entering a sacred

200
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:38,680
Temple and the reason why I think this is useful when we talk think about um uh

201
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:44,119
samadi is that um uh when we sit down

202
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:49,880
specifically to practice samadi uh it's helpful to reorient yourself to spend a

203
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:55,599
little bit of time preparing yourself similar to how you prepare yourself if

204
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:02,440
you were going into some some kind of sacred location and if a temple is a

205
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:11,079
think that works for you sometimes you go to these places you might put on clean clothes you might uh clean

206
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:16,640
yourself with take a shower and be show up clean you might

207
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:23,319
um uh you know some places you go in and you uh bow as you enter the temple or

208
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:28,720
you touch a sacred object or you um you

209
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:37,440
know do something that kind of marks the transition going in sometimes you would um uh you know

210
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:44,839
you really feel like you're outside in the busy hustle and bustle of the world but inside every you get quiet now

211
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:51,880
you're ready to for something that's not exactly you something Beyond you or

212
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:59,160
bigger than you that is found in the quiet and the care and the

213
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:06,079
and um and rather than objectifying that like you know this is some sacred place

214
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:12,800
where a sacred being or something lives um I kind of prefer to see it that it's

215
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:19,720
the very shift in the subjective nature of our experience that then allows us to

216
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:26,760
feel or sense uh something that's uh doesn't feel like it's part and parcel

217
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:31,920
of the usual ual way we think of ourselves usual attitudes

218
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:38,280
orientations judgments feelings we have so it might not be so easy to make

219
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:44,280
this kind of shift in or in orientation but I think it's helpful to realize when

220
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:50,160
we practice somadi that uh we are involved in a process of Shifting and

221
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,760
changing our subjective experience and so to the degree to which

222
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,240
that can be a choice degree to which we could prepare ourselves for that or or

223
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:07,640
care for that and support that so we have have kind of like a uh we we start

224
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,720
we start the process um to you know live A busy life

225
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,040
run around and do a lot of things and check a lot of websites and check all

226
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:24,599
your text for all your texts and emails and social media just just you know

227
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:31,400
because you know you're not going to be on it for 30 minutes 45 minutes of meditation um you sit down and the

228
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:37,000
momentum of all that greedy attention doing things

229
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:44,680
wanting things with attention uh follows you and uh or any attitude you have and

230
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,880
so to have a transition to practice samadi where

231
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:57,800
we're leaving all that behind long enough that we allow for a settling allow the whole system to become calmer

232
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:06,560
more settled more ready to feel uh the Deep maybe sacred dimensions of

233
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,839
subjective experience um so this is very different

234
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:18,480
than just sitting down and being determined I'm going to get concentrated there is a kind of

235
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,599
humbleness or humility uh where we're preparing

236
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,599
ourselves almost like to receive a gift we're preparing ourself you know it's

237
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:37,400
almost like uh samadi willing Samar will come we're kind of um uh shifting

238
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,599
something about how we are to become a vehicle become a vessel I guess is the

239
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:47,640
word a vessel in which to receive something that bubbles up from deep

240
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,800
inside something that spreads or something that appears maybe there's no

241
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:59,440
clear sense of whether it's inside or outside but now we're really here to be

242
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:07,040
open to be available to be receptive to be a vessel for

243
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:14,160
something and um and uh so to give you some sense of

244
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:21,480
this that how the Buddha presents it um for him uh just as samade is a condition

245
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:28,400
for liberating Insight uh uh well-being happiness is a

246
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,760
condition for samadi so he's already focusing on a

247
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,960
shift in the subjective experience that's needed in order to open up to

248
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:46,160
this world of samadi and um so when you sit down to

249
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,400
meditate what can you do that supports that

250
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:57,640
transition can you give yourself more time in preparation to sit not just Rush

251
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:04,800
from what you did to just sit down but maybe always come to meditation 5 minutes early whenever you meditate

252
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:11,760
maybe go into it slowly maybe do some stretching some settling maybe do a little bit of walking meditation maybe

253
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:19,319
quietly have a cup of tea and let things settle and then maybe uh sit down and

254
00:41:19,319 --> 00:41:27,680
and uh just kind of be uh before you start even close your eyes maybe look around and and uh look

255
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:35,960
at the walls look at the floor look at the objects where you are look out the window to kind of begin really feeling

256
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:42,480
connected to here and now this place so that the momentum of the mind being

257
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,119
concerned about other places and other times begins to fade away and so we're

258
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:53,520
beginning to gather ourselves to Here and Now be here to prepare ourselves for

259
00:41:53,520 --> 00:42:01,240
a new subjective way of being so uh in these introd these still doing

260
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:09,480
these introductory introductory remarks about samadi um the uh I want to review that

261
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:15,640
the first day I talked about discovery that we really want to see and understand how we

262
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:21,000
are uh and the more we can discover about how the mind body heart

263
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:29,119
is um it's the more material we have for the unification the Gathering Together

264
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:34,760
process we have and then um uh Discovery

265
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:41,720
involves attention an important part of samade is to find a form of

266
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:48,440
attention uh that um has a lightness to it that's not forceful it's not uh

267
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:55,079
contracted or straining very light uh transparent translucent just

268
00:42:55,079 --> 00:43:00,760
open and um and it's easy then for the every the mind to wander off into

269
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:07,319
thoughts um and get distracted but uh then if we start now

270
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:13,319
today to uh appreciate that we're entering into we're shifting ourselves we're

271
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:20,119
enter into a new mode here then that preparation that new mode now can maybe

272
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:27,559
be a vessel to hold that light attention that is going to be the Gathering point

273
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:35,559
or the support for a deeper a deepening into a dimension of our life which uh we

274
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:41,480
often don't experience in everyday life a dimension of our life that um uh is

275
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:46,960
healing somebody can be quite healing a dimension of our life which can feel

276
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:53,800
sacred and dimension of our life that can give us a tremendous amount of wisdom and

277
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,520
understanding and um so

278
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:05,160
um with that um one more thing I'd like to S Suggest as we go through these

279
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:12,119
weeks around samade is uh as we settle into it I would encourage you to uh

280
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:20,480
consider a time a time where you're going to start meditating a little bit more uh each day than you do uh maybe

281
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:28,440
add a second meditation and to sit uh twice a day at least uh maybe 15 to 45

282
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:34,400
minutes and uh because Som Builds on a familiarity a

283
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,880
connectivity uh Builds on the residue that's left behind each time

284
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:47,599
we're practicing meditation that helps it to build over time so if that works for

285
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:53,520
you uh so thank you for today and look forward to being here with you again

286
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,520
tomorrow
