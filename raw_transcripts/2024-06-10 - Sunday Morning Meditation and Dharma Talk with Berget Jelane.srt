1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,720
good morning everyone it's very nice to be here it's been a long time I used to

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,839
be here a lot for many many years from the beginning and with

3
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:19,960
Co I stopped coming in person and I got very used

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:27,080
to since it continues on YouTube I just tune every Sunday morning on

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,480
YouTube um so it's it's both exciting

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:39,680
and a little bit different to be here I'm just not a customed to it and

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,000
there's so many new faces so many new people it's wonderful it's really

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:54,160
wonderful that um everybody together has been able to keep IMC so active and so

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,320
meaningful uh for all this time

10
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,320
so a sentence that I read this morning that touched

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:13,680
me wisdom Springs from meditation without

12
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,680
meditation wisdom

13
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,920
wains so Joe asked me what was the title of my talk

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,680
today and I said the fallacy of

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:39,840
perfect so that gives you a clue where I'm going doesn't

16
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,520
it what is this idea of

17
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:54,280
perfect what do we mean when we say that as I say it what does it bring up

18
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:03,118
for you what do you think of perfect or might say

19
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:13,959
perfection it is used I think pretty commonly in our culture these days since

20
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:20,560
I've been thinking about this topic I have found myself so frequently in the

21
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:28,760
mind saying oh perfect oh that's perfect of course it's not perfect by

22
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,920
any in a neat truthful way what is it it's a

23
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:41,599
personal preference oh that fits with what I'm doing or what I like or what

24
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,920
feels good so we talked about this in Morgan Hill uh week or two ago and I got

25
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,280
an email from somebody a couple days ago in response to something I had suggested

26
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:01,519
and she wrote and said oh that will work just fine and then in parenthesis notice

27
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:08,799
I didn't say [Laughter] perfect and what was really nice about

28
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:17,440
that is it's in her Consciousness now so perfect doesn't just come out she

29
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:25,000
will think about it and that's that's the point um that's the important part

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,439
of Buddha's practice right that we're aware that we're conscious

31
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:36,840
of what we're doing what we're saying what's happening and then from that awareness

32
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:44,760
and Consciousness we can make more skillful wise

33
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:55,360
decisions so when we think about what's

34
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:02,120
perfect what's appropriate or what's best for

35
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:09,239
whom for myself for you for a teacher

36
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:18,079
for who who is it perfect or very good

37
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,120
for think of the last time you used the term

38
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:32,039
perfect what did you mean and how did it it

39
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,320
fit recently someone asked me to switch teaching

40
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,360
dates and my response was oh that's

41
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:54,720
that'll work perfectly for me I'm becoming more and more aware how

42
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,919
frequently that thought that idea oh that's perfect oh that'll work perfect

43
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,320
ly comes to mind when of course what I mean is oh that fits very well with my

44
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:12,120
schedule yes that that works fine for me that's that's good

45
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:21,039
so I'm trying to be more conscious more aware and use different wording than

46
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:29,800
perfect because of course perfect has a certain connotation doesn't it

47
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:38,280
and with that connotation there's the opposite so if something is

48
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:45,919
perfect that suggests that something else might be

49
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,919
imperfect and what does that mean

50
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:03,400
imperfect so this topic came up for me

51
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,520
because recently I have heard so many times in

52
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:16,080
different settings different ways we are imperfect human

53
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,918
beings we are flawed human

54
00:06:22,039 --> 00:06:27,599
beings and that certainly gives a certain bias doesn't

55
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:33,759
it if we're flawed God if we're

56
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:40,160
imperfect what does that suggest are we less

57
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,599
that are we

58
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:53,599
incapable I think it's often said as a way of giving a

59
00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:01,280
slack you know we're human beings we can't be expected to be

60
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,879
perfect but I find hearing that over and over it

61
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:13,680
also gives the impression that we are less than that we

62
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:20,840
are somehow not so

63
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:28,280
great and therefore we don't have to expect certain things from

64
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:35,960
ourselves well I think it's fine maybe not to have uh high or unrealistic or

65
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:45,440
whatever expectations but do we really want the notion or

66
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:55,680
accept about ourselves that we're less than that we're not okay maybe not fully

67
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:06,240
human so could we see ourselves as

68
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:19,759
flowers different varieties different colors different sizes shapes fragrances

69
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,639
Etc together a beautiful

70
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:33,279
bouquet and is one type any

71
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,640
better any more perfect than another type we all have

72
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:48,519
preferences some might like roses better than whatever daisies some might like

73
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:53,680
orchids better than

74
00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:00,120
gardinas but those are just preferences aren't they there's no truth

75
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:07,000
or no reality to a notion that one is better

76
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:14,959
than another they're just different just like

77
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:21,399
us we're all different and in some ways not so

78
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:28,680
different of course but not more perfect or less

79
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:35,160
perfect than anyone else can

80
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,360
we just

81
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:47,880
be that's a very important understanding in Buddhist practice to just

82
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:54,920
be but what does that mean that can be a little intimidating

83
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:01,240
or a little bit scary or a little bit

84
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:08,079
concerning I have experienced it what does it mean to just be uh uh how should

85
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:15,880
I be who should I be just be uh but what is that how do

86
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:21,200
how do I do that I have

87
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:29,040
learned I have learned to trust an inner uh I don't know if guidance is the

88
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:36,560
right an inner unfolding so that sometimes now if if

89
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,160
I'm questioning something or trying to decide you know I'll think about it a

90
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:50,120
little bit then I let go and smile to myself and say h well we'll see what

91
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:57,680
happens much easier way to live and for me it feels much more

92
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:06,880
congruent much more like I am being and not trying to be something or

93
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:14,680
someone so often that's what we're doing right we're trying hard to be someone to

94
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,959
be something

95
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,279
special rather than just who we are and we don't have

96
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:36,680
to Define that that doesn't have to be anything in particular but just

97
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:44,519
being so we still can

98
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:51,720
practice can learn the teachings the teachings of the

99
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Buddha and many other

100
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:02,040
teachings we have in Buddhist practice the 10 Perfections we have the

101
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:09,600
eight-fold path we have the four Brahma viharas we have many

102
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,320
lists and they're wonderful for practice

103
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:23,639
they're wonderful for developing our awareness expanding our

104
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:30,639
compassion our loving kindness um

105
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:37,760
generosity all of the things that we want to

106
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,560
expand we don't have to practice them to be

107
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:54,480
perfect our practice is not about becoming perfect it's about

108
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,760
becoming more loving more accepting more are

109
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:06,079
conscious all the attributes that

110
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:15,440
we want to cultivate and want to expand but not as a way of being

111
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:23,120
perfect sometimes people want to become the perfect

112
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:31,120
meditator what's that there's no perfect

113
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:38,920
meditator there's there's no perfect meditation there's whatever our meditation is right

114
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:45,320
now and we work with that there's nothing perfect or

115
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,560
imperfect about it

116
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:58,079
so in our culture judgment is a big thing there's judgment

117
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:06,639
everywhere and we're taught from a very young age to compare and to

118
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:16,360
judge this is good this is not good this is beautiful this is

119
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:23,720
ugly if this is this then that is

120
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,440
that but what we're really expressing is a personal

121
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:40,279
preference not as I said earlier a

122
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:49,399
truth some people may think that if you're

123
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:56,480
this that's wonderful if you're that that's not so good

124
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,800
we take our judgments so

125
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,519
seriously and hold them as truths we don't often we don't see them as

126
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:17,560
judgments but as truths this is this is how it

127
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:22,639
is however they're just

128
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,959
thoughts and if we latch on to them

129
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:38,000
and hold them tightly they expand they

130
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:43,680
proliferate If instead we can see them as

131
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:50,720
thoughts thoughts come and go right if we

132
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,040
don't grab onto them latch onto them

133
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:05,319
they will change they will come and

134
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,920
go so I'm not suggesting

135
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:19,600
that a form of judgment is never okay we have in this practice

136
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:27,160
discernment wise discrimination it is important to be

137
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:36,920
Discerning and and to see things clearly but that's different from

138
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:44,319
this important judgment Discerning something seeing

139
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:50,519
something clearly can be very very

140
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:55,959
important letting go of it as

141
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:03,639
judgment can be just as important important and a part of being Discerning

142
00:17:03,639 --> 00:17:08,760
using discriminating wisdom is to hold

143
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:14,839
things Loosely so that when circumstances

144
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:21,880
change or for some reason our thinking changes something changes we can be

145
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:29,400
flexible we can change sometimes that's considered we

146
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:35,440
weakness if you're if you're really serious about something then then you

147
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,600
don't you're not flexible you don't get to change your mind well of course it's

148
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:49,120
the opposite if we're really serious about something then we have to be open to

149
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:54,200
change because that's how it is that's how life

150
00:17:54,200 --> 00:18:02,240
is and actually it takes more strength to be be willing to change our minds

151
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,360
change our attitude see something differently when things

152
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:14,919
change when we get new information or somehow

153
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:23,520
we see things differently to be able to be flexible with that and change that

154
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:30,240
takes more strength than holding on to something typically when somebody holds

155
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:38,000
on really tight to something and won't consider any other alternative um there's fear there's

156
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,679
weakness that can feel like strength to hold on so tightly to something but in

157
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:53,600
this practice we're encouraged to be more open to be more flexible to

158
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:00,480
allow a different attitude a different way of seeing something when something

159
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:07,480
changes or we see something in a new light we

160
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:17,760
see something different when I was young somehow I had

161
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:29,600
the whatever ability or something to see both sides of an issue I'm a great Libra

162
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,200
you know I hold both ends of the scale

163
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:43,360
but I got the impression that I was considered wishy-washy or weak you know and it

164
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:49,960
wasn't until really I came to Buddhist practice that I recognized that was an

165
00:19:49,960 --> 00:20:00,159
attribute that was helpful to be able to see uh both sides of any issue

166
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:07,159
I still considered an attribute although in our culture I'm sure again

167
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:12,240
many would see that as wishy-washy you're supposed to see things clearly

168
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:19,799
and then stay with it but as we look around

169
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,159
our our very painful

170
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:34,640
world all all the fighting all the

171
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:48,880
unhappiness it can be very helpful to be willing to be open to see

172
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,799
both perspectives so this morning when I was

173
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:02,240
walking my dog I saw I Came Upon my Russian neighbor who's taking care of

174
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,840
his son's dog

175
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,840
and we had a brief very friendly

176
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:20,759
conversation and as we walked away I was struck

177
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:28,120
by I know a little bit about he and his wife's feelings

178
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,200
and I have in Southern California a Ukrainian

179
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:42,080
friend that I met in Ukraine many many years ago and I couldn't help

180
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,400
but you know each of them have very different views of what's going

181
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:53,960
on different positions from their experience from they're growing up one

182
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:02,960
grew up in Ukraine one grew up in in Russia and so so they see things quite

183
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,880
differently both very very wonderful

184
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,760
people very um you know on a personal

185
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,559
level and they have different perspectives and it's so easy in our

186
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:29,279
culture it's so easy I mean I I try to resist it but there's the temptation to

187
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:34,360
see one side is right and the other side is

188
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:48,320
wrong that's how we get to war isn't it what if both sides have a

189
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:57,320
perspective what if we let go of this right wrong good bad but this is one

190
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:03,760
perspective this is another perspective same with Gaza

191
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,600
right both feel

192
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,919
victims how can

193
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:23,840
we not be so judgmental hold

194
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:35,639
both and work together together I have in my notes war is the

195
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:42,960
problem we we tend to jump to war and we tend to think that you know war or

196
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:50,720
violence or fighting is the way to answer something what if

197
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:59,640
we consider things as perspectives

198
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:07,760
and how can we work together so that both

199
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,880
perspectives can have a

200
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:20,960
place it can be the same in interpersonal relations right doesn't have to be

201
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:28,520
countries how can we appreciate and understand

202
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,200
the perspective of someone who's very different from

203
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:44,799
us without this right wrong that's a challenge isn't it we so

204
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:51,159
frequently we hear something on the news or from somebody or we understand

205
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:58,720
something and right away this is right and this is wrong well

206
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:06,840
when we look a little bit closer it's not always so clear is

207
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,600
it they're different because experiences are

208
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:24,440
different but that doesn't make one right and one wrong

209
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:39,240
can we enjoy each

210
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:49,559
moment each day each week each year without

211
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:55,440
judgment setting aside the

212
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,799
Judgment we have so many judg ments about so many

213
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,960
things I mentioned flowers earlier flowers and

214
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:12,799
weeds who determines what's a flower and what's a wheat I don't think it's

215
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:19,919
nature I think it's human beings so um I have a little reputation

216
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:26,440
in the community in which I live I appreciate the

217
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:31,720
weeds so so when the gardeners come around you

218
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:38,120
know they don't dig up the weeds or they'll say can can we cut these is okay

219
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:43,200
cut these and I love it you know

220
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,320
um they want so often to have everything

221
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:54,919
very uh what's the word Prim trimmed

222
00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:00,200
just looking just so well the

223
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:06,440
weeds add Greenery and some of them have little

224
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,880
flowers and so the tree right next to

225
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:18,559
me has all this green now I'm sure not everybody likes

226
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:26,440
it but I love it I love the green and it's a reminder what is a weed and what

227
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:32,720
is a flower this weed has a lovely little orange

228
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:47,880
flower I think about the seasons everybody most everybody has a

229
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:55,039
preference for summer fall winter

230
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:03,159
spring it's a preference isn't it there's nothing inherently better

231
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:11,159
about winter than spring we need we need them all of

232
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:18,159
course and if we're open we can enjoy them

233
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:28,559
all even what's alive and what's dead

234
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:36,159
it's all part of life we're taught we've learned of

235
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:42,159
course that alive is good dead is not

236
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:48,600
good however we all know don't we we're all

237
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:55,840
going to be dead one day and just like the seasons where the

238
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:01,960
leaves die and fall off the tree

239
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:07,840
um insects rodents um our

240
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:15,159
pets die at some point and is that

241
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:20,600
ugly we die at some point is that

242
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:26,760
ugly can we see it as part of the cycle of

243
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:34,399
life and that well we may have feelings about

244
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,880
how someone or something

245
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:47,679
died the suffering that may have gone along with it the actual

246
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:56,360
death is part of life isn't it everything that comes into being

247
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:04,200
will disappear that's a basic teaching isn't

248
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:15,840
it so I want to leave some time for discussion I'm going to end with

249
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:22,840
um just a little bit about my grandson my

250
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,880
favorite Crooked Tree in the forest

251
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:37,279
my grandson is 24 he um he has uh he was diagnosed at about a

252
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:44,200
year 18 months with cerebral paly um he he ha he

253
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:49,880
cannot uh read or write

254
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,000
um he knows his name but if you ask him how old he is if he's with me he'll turn

255
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,240
to me and he might say 16 just somehow that

256
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:08,919
sticks in his mind on the other hand he is one of the

257
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:13,960
nicest human beings you could ever want to meet everybody says that not just his

258
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:19,919
grandma but everybody he's so friendly you know he's

259
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:26,600
kind and he loves music so I've taken him to

260
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:34,720
many symphonies and he can tell you every single instrument in that

261
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:43,000
Orchestra and I have been known to misname something no grandma that's a

262
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,720
whatever he knows the difference five years ago we were in

263
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:58,360
Missouri for my daughter's ordination and we were sitting outside having breakfast and we heard this bird

264
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:05,080
up in the tree and right away Alexander said I didn't understand him but he said

265
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:12,039
that's a cardinal and I kept saying know what you know finally oh a cardinal we

266
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:18,080
don't have cardinals in California but his grandpa had given him a book with uh

267
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:25,440
the sounds of birds and the name and he knew from that it was a cardinal well of

268
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,600
course a couple minutes later out flew this red bird from the tree it was

269
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:40,399
indeed a cardinal so I say that I I talk about my

270
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:50,000
grandson because I have learned so much from him and learned you know some

271
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,320
would say he's imperfect well I guess from a certain

272
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:00,720
point of view he is my daughter and I both

273
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:08,559
agree we would not want him any other way he's a wonderful human being

274
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:17,159
imperfect as some might say or as the Crooked Tree in the in the forest

275
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:22,600
crooked trees can be beautiful can be

276
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:32,200
wonderful so let's remember that perfect is a human construct it's a human

277
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:38,919
idea that probably isn't so

278
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:43,600
helpful because if there's perfect there's

279
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:51,919
imperfect and what if we dropped both what if we just saw things as

280
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:59,000
clearly as we can saw things see things as they are

281
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,519
without all our human Notions and

282
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:13,118
ideas does that make sense yeah so we do have a few minutes are

283
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,638
there comments

284
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:27,320
questions uh bergette over the last 22 years I've seen and read quite a few

285
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:33,440
Buddhist teachers and um uh there's one point I think it's safe to say they

286
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:40,398
don't all agree on um some many teachers or some at least uh do

287
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:48,000
believe in um the possibility of uh full

288
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,280
Enlightenment which you could describe as a sort of perfection and then other

289
00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:00,000
teachers N I don't think so they would say don't think it's really completely

290
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:08,240
possible or they have doubts about it um U and for me

291
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,599
it's not something I think of as attainable but something that I can

292
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:21,280
always get closer to and then closer to closer to whether I get there or not

293
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,920
as you know I have no way of knowing so why why why even think about that just

294
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:33,720
just keep making the effort to get a little closer but do you have any thoughts on that on on on

295
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:45,200
enlightenment I think what you're saying is very wise who knows who

296
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,319
knows um when I first came to Buddhist

297
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:56,520
practice 30 some years ago I didn't know anything about Enlightenment and after a few years oh

298
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:03,680
all I wanted was Enlightenment I practice and you know

299
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:12,800
and then it kind of gradually just relaxed and I feel a little bit like you

300
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,839
I I want to make the effort for the qualities I was mentioning earlier I

301
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:26,200
want to be uh Kinder and more loving and more compassionate and etc

302
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:34,520
etc uh Enlightenment I guess I sort of feel if it comes great if it

303
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:42,039
doesn't does that answer totally thank

304
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:57,240
you hi Berget it's nice to see you and um as I was listening to your talk what

305
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:03,359
came up to me was discernment right so there is

306
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:09,839
um the idea of some of the things in um

307
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:15,599
in this particular philosophy that we're practicing under can be very

308
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,920
idealistic in from my point of view and rightly

309
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,079
so and there are things uh my heart spit up when I

310
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:35,280
started to hear you talk about war and and the word Discerning discernment

311
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:41,440
came to mine and um in the way that you know I'm

312
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:47,680
just thinking about the plan world or the or the um possibilities for choices

313
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:54,800
for eating right diet not all foods are created equal not

314
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,319
not all of them are wholesome as you know right some plant are really poisonous to

315
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:07,599
us and so I just um I wanted to drop

316
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:17,200
discernment into the Consciousness as well today um as a as a possibility that

317
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:23,119
while all is could be perfect it needs to be

318
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:31,880
included not all is wholesome there you go right right exactly yes I

319
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:38,839
did say discernment a little bit ago um I think I see discernment is different

320
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:44,040
from judgment that's why I mentioned it and yes discernment discriminating

321
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:52,079
wisdom it is very important um not just for diet all kinds

322
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:57,560
of things right um

323
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,480
and so I like discernment or discriminating wisdom better than

324
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:12,960
judgment because of all the uh implications that judgment has

325
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:19,920
but judgment in the sense of seeing things clearly and making skillful wise

326
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:27,200
decisions yes can be very helpful and I think discernment discriminating wisdom

327
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:33,839
uh um might

328
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:39,040
be more helpful terms than

329
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:44,400
judgment yeah and I agree with you and

330
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,000
it's one of the things that has kept me with Buddhism it's very

331
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,880
idealistic but you know what it's realistic what we call idealistic is

332
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,440
really realistic is really more

333
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:12,000
realistic if we followed the teachings and did our very

334
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:22,079
best that would be so much more realistic in the sense of helping

335
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,960
our communities our planet Etc so

336
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:34,760
um I love the idealism and I think it's more

337
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:42,480
realistic did you want to say something thank you so

344
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:26,920
question comment yes

345
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,000
okay hi thank you for your talk um I just wanted to make a comment about the

346
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:44,480
notion of perfection and how it struck me that Perfection is something that's

347
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:50,400
public we share it we use it as compliments with other people but I

348
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,920
don't see it as being a notion that um we might experience or think about

349
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:02,319
private say a little

350
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:08,319
more when we use the word Perfection or we think about it we use it as a

351
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:13,359
compliment about something uhhuh and we talk about it with another person oh

352
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:21,240
that was perfect oh you did a perfect job so I feel like it's a public concept

353
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:28,280
more than a private concept more than one that we think about in our our own

354
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:34,000
private thoughts ah that we might not privately think oh that was perfect oh I

355
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,440
did that just perfectly that's that's what I'm thinking I'm I'm just wondering if

356
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,960
that's if that's something that you if you thought about perfection as being more of a public statement or compliment

357
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:54,920
or something that's shared with others publicly rather than something that people can appreciate or think about

358
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:05,760
privately well I haven't thought about that [Laughter] um it seems mostly that people

359
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,359
don't tell themselves very often oh that was perfect oh you did that just

360
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:18,440
perfectly we tend to be more critical um and more likely to

361
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:24,760
say well that wasn't so great well you could have done that one

362
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:32,680
better um we probably wouldn't say that to somebody else necessarily but I think to

363
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:39,960
ourselves we're probably many of us most of us quite

364
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,280
critical whether it's public or

365
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:55,559
private it has a judgment and judgments can

366
00:43:55,559 --> 00:44:01,359
be very hard har and

367
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:10,800
harmful and I would rather that we saw things clearly and saw things as they are

368
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,400
without the need for

369
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:23,480
judging we judge all the time do we really need to do

370
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:29,040
that discriminate discern yes

371
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:36,599
but that's not judging that's not good bad right wrong that's seeing things as

372
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:43,960
they are

373
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,240
okay Nancy I foret um thank you I uh was

374
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:57,280
thinking during your talk today about the notion Japanese notion of wabisabi

375
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:04,240
of there being Perfection and imperfection and I thought um that sort

376
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,799
of encapsulated a lot of what you were talking

377
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:18,680
about how Nancy how would you define that concept of wabisabi of there

378
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:24,440
being Perfection and imperfection

379
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:30,559
um that circumstances people or

380
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:37,280
um even conversations may go imperfectly but in

381
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,400
that imperfection there's still always something to

382
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:50,200
learn I mean there is something that can be given even in an imperfect situation

383
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:55,760
exactly exactly thank you for

384
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:01,640
