1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,200
good evening welcome welcome good evening and of course i always have

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,240
to say this well if not good evening good morning good afternoon good day whenever you are listening to

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,920
this or watching this

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,960
yeah what a pleasure it is to practice together

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,760
so we'll start with a guided meditation

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,960
and just to come into the body the invitation

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,320
is to bring our awareness to the experience

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,878
of being here now

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:13,840
that is what does it feel like to sit and know that you're sitting

10
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,479
feeling the pressure of the chair or cushion against the body

11
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:32,560
or maybe you're sitting on the couch sitting on the bed

12
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,479
whatever it might be just feeling connected

13
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,840
grounded

14
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:02,079
and when the mind wanders away as it will we just very gently

15
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:09,679
simply begin again noticing the pressure against the body

16
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:23,840
the places of contact

17
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,360
and of course this body is breathing

18
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:05,840
so we might bring our attention to the sensations of breathing

19
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:22,080
we don't have to change it manipulate it breathe in any special way

20
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,480
we're just noticing what is the experience what are these

21
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:47,840
sensations what does it feel like to have an in-breath

22
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:15,840
can we notice the beginning the middle the end of an in-breath

23
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,840
what about an exhale how does that feel what does that feel

24
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
like

25
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:32,160
and if we set the intention to be with the sensations of breathing

26
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,560
of course we notice that the mind isn't necessarily stay

27
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:53,840
where we set the intention

28
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:07,840
so we might do a gentle inquiry

29
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:15,280
what is it that pulls the mind away

30
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,478
for example might there be

31
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,638
a quiet idea

32
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:36,720
that says this would be so much better if only

33
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,319
blank if only the neighbor's dog were more quiet

34
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,160
quieter if only

35
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,599
the temperature were a little bit cooler or warmer

36
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,800
if only i had a different type of cushion to sit on

37
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:17,840
if only my knee didn't bother me

38
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:45,280
do we have these ideas desiring something to be different

39
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,160
something to be changed to make it just

40
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
right

41
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:27,759
can we just allow it to be how it is how our experience is

42
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:34,959
without demanding comfort or ease

43
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:45,440
but instead is there a way in that which we might find the comfort in ease in this moment

44
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,279
by putting down relaxing softening

45
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,399
this may be quiet demand that things be different

46
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:23,839
can we allow things to be as they are during this meditation

47
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,760
can we do this in a kind-hearted gentle way

48
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:09,760
just noticing if we have this strong wish for things to

49
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:17,279
be different so that we might meditate properly or

50
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,160
something like that

51
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,880
is there a desire for things to be perfect

52
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,839
it's perfectly natural

53
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:47,839
can we allow that desire to be there

54
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,120
so being with the sensations of breathing

55
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,720
and noticing what takes us away

56
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,200
and we might notice that we have a desire for things to be different

57
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:57,839
thinking if only this were different then i could meditate

58
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:11,839
we're just noticing

59
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:51,760
learning to recognize when we have this feeling of if only

60
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:59,120
this were different this persistent feeling we need

61
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,679
something else we need something else to be able to

62
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,679
settle into this moment to be happy

63
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,840
whatever it might be

64
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:26,720
and to be able to notice this natural inclination of the mind

65
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,840
without following it all the time

66
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,240
if ever without fall succumbing to the seemingly

67
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,840
authority of this like i can't possibly

68
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:50,880
being mindful while i'm also having this experience

69
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:58,720
while i'm the refrigerator is running too loud or

70
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,760
or my back is bothering me whatever it might be

71
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:15,440
as we learn to notice the way that we often have this if only thinking

72
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:22,799
increases our capacity to recognize well is it true

73
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:30,799
maybe this isn't ideal isn't perfect doesn't match my preferences exactly

74
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:38,840
but can we be okay with it and increases our capacity to be with

75
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:46,080
discomfort things not being exactly as they are

76
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:53,600
and with this increased capacity we can bring wisdom the best version of

77
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:59,600
ourselves to more and more situations instead of collapsing around them

78
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,360
or doing some behavior or saying something that we might regret

79
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,840
later just because we're feeling uncomfortable

80
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:19,919
a big part of this practice is increasing our capacity to be uncomfortable in this way

81
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:26,080
might we bring some wisdom to not only our experiences but to be

82
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:32,640
able to support other people maybe in their experiences too

83
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:41,120
so that our practice can be the benefit not only for ourselves

84
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:51,840
but for those we come in contact with spreading out to all beings everywhere

85
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,309
[Music]

86
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:47,200
good evening good evening welcome welcome warm

87
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:54,320
a warm welcome to everybody wherever you are whomever you are

88
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:05,919
a number of years ago i heard an explanation or a discussion about mindfulness practice

89
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:11,600
i had a big impact on me i felt like when i heard that um i had like a click

90
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:18,000
like oh now i understand something and i've even used this and taught this

91
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,559
when i'm teaching them mindfulness and that is this idea that

92
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:33,039
we we can use an image of that when there's perhaps a really slow stream

93
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:39,919
in fact maybe we're on a hike and we there's a little bit of water we have to cross over and we're not even sure

94
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,000
is this water moving or is this just uh like underground

95
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,399
spraying or something like this and then often what you can do right of course is like put a stick

96
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:58,000
and then you can see if there's a little bit of a wake that comes after it or you can see the

97
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,279
water kind of like part around the stick so it's an indicator of oh

98
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:09,279
yeah it's moving and shows you which direction it's moving but it wasn't obvious until you

99
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:14,559
put the stick in the middle and held the stick still

100
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:20,640
so in the same way mindfulness like when we choose an object of meditation such as the breath

101
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,080
as we often do not until we choose to kind of have the

102
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:33,679
mind be right on the breath so until it's kind of like putting the stick in that we notice oh how often that the mind is going off

103
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:39,200
and doing other things everything except being mindful of the breath right

104
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:45,600
but we wouldn't have noticed unless we had set the intentions at the anchor of being mindful of the

105
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:52,399
breath we wouldn't have noticed how our mind is often wandering all over the place and following this and following that

106
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:57,519
being distracted by this or something like that

107
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,919
so in this way we can consider that mindfulness practice is a great way to really learn about

108
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,398
ourselves to learn about what takes us away from the breath

109
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:18,320
what is so compelling that we can't stay there and when does it happen so

110
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:24,158
mindfulness practice is a great way to have some greater understanding

111
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:33,200
and in the same way just like having a breath helps us to

112
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:38,240
become more clear about when we're not on the breath

113
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:44,398
and the same way we can consider ethics as a way for us to notice what's

114
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:52,320
happening when we are considering doing something that might be questionably ethical

115
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,680
maybe we wouldn't even notice some of these things we would notice the large ones

116
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:03,920
but maybe some of the more subtle ones we wouldn't even notice unless we had set the intention to

117
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,760
behave ethically of course all of us want to behave ethically but

118
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:16,079
there might be a way in which when we set our intention with commonly known as

119
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:24,040
the precepts that we start to notice all these little ways in which we might be

120
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:31,599
rationalizing or somehow not really stain with

121
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,359
our intention to be ethical

122
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,200
and i'm bringing this up or i want to talk about ethics a little bit here

123
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,240
not in some moral heavy-handed way

124
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:55,359
there are so many different ways we could approach ethics and morality and the polly word is sila

125
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:00,960
there's so many different ways and could give a whole you know combination

126
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,200
of a whole series of talks in different ways but one way i would like to look at it tonight

127
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:14,240
is the relationship between sila and suffering that is that sometimes

128
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:21,760
the way in which we are deviating maybe i'll say from the ethical precepts

129
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:28,079
which i'll talk about in a moment is a way to help us understand some of our sources of

130
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:34,640
suffering either that we're causing for ourselves or maybe that we're causing for others

131
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,680
but it's a way to understand ourselves

132
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:47,200
to practice with ethics is to an opportunity for some reflection but why am i doing what i'm doing and

133
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,560
why do i not want to do this other thing that i don't want to do

134
00:36:53,119 --> 00:37:00,160
and i would like to propose that we don't have to use it in a way with judging ourselves oh i'm a bad person

135
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,240
because of x or that person is a bad person because of why

136
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:14,160
i would like to say that's not so helpful i didn't actually be increasing the suffering but instead can we

137
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:20,839
look at um our relationship with ethics and the way that we behave as a way to

138
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:26,960
support our wanting to have less suffering in our lives

139
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:33,599
so many of us come to meditation practice with this wish to have less suffering

140
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:41,680
and sometimes there can be a little bit of bewilderment like why is my life not unfolding in a direction that i want it to or why

141
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:50,640
do i still have um so much suffering discomfort in our in my life

142
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,599
so this can be dare i say a tool ethics can be a tool that might help us to unpack and

143
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,920
understand ourselves better as i said there's a number of ways in

144
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:09,680
which we can talk about ethics both the specifics about it as well as the

145
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,040
role it plays and meditation practice the role it plays and buddhist practice

146
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:23,119
but right now i'd like to focus on the its relationship with suffering

147
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,320
we know that the buddha is concerned with suffering and i'm using suffering as a generic

148
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,640
word to cover this really broad range from a little bit uncomfortable

149
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:41,440
to great harm terrible harm so i'm using this generic

150
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:48,160
word to cover this whole range in the buddha i mean he's a famous

151
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:55,520
saying right that he only taught about suffering in the end of suffering so we could use that as a lens through

152
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:03,599
which to view the ethics about okay how is this related to suffering in the end of suffering because of course

153
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:10,320
also the buddha said right the first noble truth there is suffering

154
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:18,320
all of us have it it's part of the human condition but maybe we can look at it or work with

155
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:25,359
it a number of different ways so one way that we might look at ethics

156
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:30,720
or sila is through five precepts that are commonly held

157
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:37,920
by lay buddhist practitioners monastics they have a whole another set

158
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:44,480
i'm not going to talk about them in addition to these five so the five precepts perhaps many of you

159
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:50,320
know them is first is to not kill living beings

160
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:57,760
the second is to not take that which is not freely given sometimes you know not stealing the

161
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,960
third is to use our sexuality in a wise way not to

162
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:09,119
harm with our sexuality the fourth is to not harm with our

163
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:15,760
speech and the fifth is not to use intoxicants that lead to

164
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:21,200
heedlessness so i'd like to unpack these a little bit

165
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,880
not so much to talk about the precepts themselves even though i'll say a few words about them

166
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,599
but what can we learn about suffering kind of using these as a

167
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,040
way to investigate suffering

168
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,640
maybe something else that perhaps many of you know that there's the suffering that leads to more

169
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:51,200
suffering and then there's the suffering that leads to less suffering

170
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:56,640
so how can if we're going to have separated our life can we have more of the suffering that

171
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,560
leads to less suffering and some people might say some of the precepts is that maybe it's

172
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,000
uncomfortable to do some of these things but it creates the conditions in which

173
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:16,400
our life can unfold in a way that supports well-being in a way that supports happiness

174
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:24,720
so this idea of the suffering that leads to more suffering and the suffering that leads

175
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:31,599
to less suffering the precepts are such a rich place to explore this

176
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,400
oops sorry i'm not touching the microphone there hopefully that wasn't too loud

177
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:45,200
so can we use our relationship with the precepts as it may be a starting place to look at

178
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:51,680
what's underneath our wanting considering to break a

179
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:58,079
precept i'm assuming that none of us are murderers necessarily or

180
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,119
terrible thieves or rapists or some of these things

181
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:09,839
but maybe some of the more subtle ways in which we might

182
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:15,280
rationalize or bend the rules a little bit something with the precepts

183
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:21,760
but to notice as part of our practice how does it feel before

184
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,040
like when we're considering breaking a precept

185
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,839
how does it feel while we're doing it how does it feel afterwards is it

186
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:38,960
increasing our suffering or is it decreasing our suffering

187
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:46,319
and maybe i'll put in there recognizing that part of this suffering is maybe to recognize that it

188
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:53,040
takes time that when we learn about ourselves we when we start to learn and i'll speak

189
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,319
more specifically about this in a moment but when we start to learn about ourselves when we investigate

190
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:05,680
our relationship with the precepts or when we're about to break them and we see oh wow i didn't realize

191
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:12,800
this about myself and yet i hear i am still doing this this behavior that of course is the

192
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:19,359
suffer is a type of suffering but hopefully it leads to less suffering

193
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:26,400
okay the first precept to not kill a loving living beings not

194
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,079
loving beings either sometimes we could expand this to not

195
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:38,720
harm in fact we could generalize all five precepts to say not to cause harm

196
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:46,480
but the first one we could say not killing and we can ask why do people kill

197
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:52,960
if we were to think about um killing other humans of course there's like fear perhaps

198
00:43:52,960 --> 00:44:00,400
underneath that or a wish for control or wish for power

199
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,078
so if we f find ourselves in this murderous rage

200
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:13,440
maybe there's some something in there about this fear or maybe there's a

201
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:20,000
feeling out of control and wanting to gain control or something like this so is there

202
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,760
something for us to explore if we find ourselves with this i

203
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:32,800
even the idea of breaking a precept but of course there's not only other human

204
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:39,119
beings what about um for certain pests

205
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:46,480
that um we might have this want to kill them for to protect our family or protect our

206
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:53,440
resources you know for termites for example and for us to really explore

207
00:44:53,440 --> 00:45:00,079
well what is my relationship to killing leaving beings if i'm going to

208
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:06,960
use an exterminator with termites for example i'm not going to tell you what to do but

209
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:14,400
just to notice what your thoughts are what your thinking are how does it feel

210
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,400
and you know and to use it as a support for practice

211
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:27,359
what about with uh ants and insects sometimes it might just be habitual

212
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:32,800
maybe we grew up that when there's a mosquito we just slap them and kill them or flies

213
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,640
or something like this or with ants or but is there a way in which

214
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:43,920
we might make an effort to keep our living spaces really clean so that

215
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:49,119
ants don't have anything to eat so when the scouts arrive those ant scouts they're not sending

216
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:55,680
back word that there's plenty of food or water i guess maybe too

217
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:02,960
so i don't have the answers to this but is there a way in which we can explore these precepts and our

218
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,079
relationships to them so not only in our behaviors and activities that we are doing

219
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:15,040
but also in our meditation maybe we might notice that when there's

220
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:22,000
uh some discomfort in the body we might have this feeling like we'll do anything to make this go

221
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,480
away this feeling like i don't know a little bit of feeling out of control like just make it

222
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,920
stop just noticing if that comes up and is

223
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:42,960
there a way that we can hold our discomfort so that we don't tip into this

224
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:49,440
having feeling things insisting that they be different

225
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:56,720
can we stay with that discomfort can we allow that discomfort to be there of course

226
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:04,880
honoring our body honoring our limitations being wise not harming ourselves

227
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:15,599
but is there a way also in meditation that we might explore this uh some of the discomfort

228
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:21,119
that might support our wanting to harm or kill others and can we increase our capacity to be

229
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:28,160
with that discomfort what about this second precept

230
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:32,720
not taking that which is not freely offered

231
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:41,119
so we might notice probably we're not uh most of us aren't thefts of

232
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:50,800
big obvious things but maybe we take things from the office maybe when we visit people's houses

233
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:56,960
we i don't know maybe we take shampoo or something like this even though it's not really offered or

234
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:02,079
or maybe we take people's time they're busy and we feel like we really

235
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:08,480
have to tell them things something or they want to uh we want them to advise us and but they don't

236
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:15,359
really have time then or i don't know all these different ways in which we might take things that are not

237
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:23,520
freely offered and do we rationalize it oh they won't notice

238
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:29,680
oh they have so much money they can totally afford it i can't afford it

239
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:37,440
or is there a way in which we don't we're a little bit numb to ourselves and we're but now i'm not

240
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:44,520
feeling what does it feel like to take things that are not freely offered is there also maybe a sense of um

241
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:51,359
self-righteousness or i'm so important it doesn't matter i'm just going to take what i want everybody else doesn't

242
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:58,960
matter so much is there a little bit of self-righteousness that's in there

243
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:04,880
again we're looking at this now so that we can judge ourselves but just as an exploration of where is

244
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:10,960
their suffering and if we're taking from others and it's

245
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:16,319
not really freely offered i would like to suggest there's some suffering there

246
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:22,880
either there's some suffering because our desire is so strong that we feel compelled that we have to

247
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:29,680
take things in order to be happy or maybe it's just that we're not

248
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:36,240
sensitive to the boundaries of what's ours and what's others and that not being sensitive to boundaries can

249
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:44,400
create suffering in so many other ways in our life if not by uh taking things

250
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:51,680
or maybe we have a strong sense of lack i don't have enough i don't have enough

251
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:58,000
i need more i need more i need more i need this and this and this and this and this and it doesn't matter whether it's offered

252
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:04,720
or not i need it so that's another way in which there

253
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:10,160
might be an exploration around this precept to not take that which is not

254
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:17,119
freely offered which is a little bit more strict than just not stealing

255
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:23,680
but that which isn't freely offered and whenever we're tempted to or we do

256
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:29,440
just to have this reflection what can we learn about ourselves

257
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:34,880
and in meditation we can notice that if we have this feeling in meditation

258
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,880
like oh i need this in order to meditate properly i need that

259
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:47,200
or this feeling things have to be different i need more or things to

260
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:52,400
somehow be other than they are

261
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:58,559
can something we can explore in meditation and that might be something that might

262
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:03,520
be supporting our wanting to break a precept

263
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,880
the third precept about being wise with our sexuality

264
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,559
so the precept assumes that sex is between consenting adults

265
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:25,280
but we'll just lay that as a i think that hopefully that goes without us saying and um

266
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:30,880
when it's explained in the sutras it's really about honoring commitments

267
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:37,520
and honoring vows and

268
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:43,200
and protections that are in place for people

269
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:51,838
and if we find ourself wanting to break a precept make a commitment a vow

270
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:59,680
is there what's underneath that like what's what's supporting fueling that maybe there's

271
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:06,480
a sense of loneliness that we're trying to fill maybe we don't feel connected to

272
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:12,240
others and we're trying to have sex

273
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:19,280
inappropriately in it with inappropriate partners just because it's outside of a commitment or it's causing somebody to

274
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,920
break a commitment about either yourself or your partner

275
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:30,079
is there a sense of loneliness or maybe we need some reassurance

276
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:37,200
of our attractiveness or worthiness or something like this

277
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:44,480
and many of us want to live a life of of love but are we using our sexual energy in a

278
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:50,558
way that promotes that that allows that to happen

279
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:57,520
or if we're having a lot of casual sex with consenting adults of course then we can just ask

280
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:05,359
dazar how does that support our meditation practice or our life

281
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:14,400
so in this way we can as i've been saying we can use the precepts as a way to help us reflect on our behavior and

282
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:22,960
the decisions that we're making again not in a way that we have to say i'm a bad person

283
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:28,480
i'm a bad buddhist but as a support for practice what can

284
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:37,920
we learn about ourselves might we find a way in which there could be less suffering with this reflection

285
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,480
and then the fourth a precept to not use false speech so not to lie but

286
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:52,240
maybe we could expand that to like write a speech many of you know includes not only should

287
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:59,680
what we're saying be true but it should be kind it should be timely and it should be

288
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:04,799
beneficial to be helpful for others

289
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:11,520
so we could have this reflection why do we tip the truth even

290
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:18,160
if it's just a little white lie is it because we want to be liked

291
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:23,680
is it because we want to get our way maybe we want to we don't feel like we

292
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:30,240
can speak directly so we're kind of we're manipulating people to believe something so that

293
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:35,359
they'll behave in some particular way or are we trying to hide something that

294
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:39,838
we're ashamed of

295
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:49,520
i'll say it maybe for me that very early in my practice i took on this precept

296
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:56,960
of not speaking falsely you know always telling the truth and i really learned that oh yeah those

297
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:02,559
times when i wanted to tell the little white lies or shade the truth or omit things

298
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:07,680
or it was because there were things that i was ashamed of i didn't want people to

299
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:14,160
know i was embarrassed maybe ashamed's too strong a word i was embarrassed or

300
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:20,960
telling little white lies i'm late because the traffic was so bad but no i'm was late

301
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:28,799
just because i was disorganized and didn't get leave the house on time or i

302
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:34,000
couldn't figure out what to wear and or you know something like this and

303
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,040
once i had that insight and i said no no if i want to have this commitment to speaking the

304
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:46,880
truth it turned out to be a relief to kind of like change my behavior so i didn't have to be embarrassed about it anymore

305
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,559
and just the quality of my life just went way up in a way that i would have never

306
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:59,040
imagined just from this little um wish to look at why am i telling little white lies

307
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:04,799
here and there and part that's partly kind of my

308
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:10,720
motivation for this dharma talk too is just this encouragement that when we start to look at them and we

309
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:16,400
like maybe pull one little thread we might discover all kinds of ways in

310
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:22,799
which suffering was a not a suffering was being created but maybe pulling a thread helps us to

311
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:30,960
have some greater understanding in which there can be some less suffering

312
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:37,680
and then maybe i will also say that it's not in the buddhist teachings

313
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:43,599
but also with speech i'll just put in something about the importance of listening to

314
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:51,520
we might ask ourselves why am i not listening sometimes why do i not give my attention to others

315
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:56,880
why do i find myself looking at my phone instead of listening to people

316
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,480
i could also be a rich reflection then the last one is to not use

317
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:09,040
intoxicants that can lead to heedlessness so there's obvious intoxicants like

318
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:15,440
alcohol and drugs and but there's lots of other ones that we use to check

319
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:22,319
out or numb out or push aside we might use food shopping surfing the

320
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:29,280
internet watching youtube videos or work as a way to no longer be present

321
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,760
for our experience

322
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:42,960
so none of these things are inherently bad or harmful but we might use our wish to

323
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:50,240
do them as an opportunity to reflect on is there something we're trying to avoid

324
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:57,599
is there a reason why we don't want to be present for what's happening especially with their recognition right

325
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:03,520
to not use intoxicants that leads to heedlessness the heedlessness is because

326
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:08,960
we are much more apt to break all the other precepts if we break this one

327
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:15,680
the one of but um intoxicants so are we no longer do we feel

328
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:21,839
burdened by wanting to behave in an ethical way and we want it or we feel

329
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:27,599
oppressed by it and there's a way that we want to do intoxicants so that we can just behave freely without

330
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:32,960
any feeling of what might be supported leading to suffering

331
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:38,318
or causing suffering or maybe something that doesn't cause suffering

332
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:46,160
so that's just one way in which we might um approach ethics is the relationship between sila and

333
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:52,720
suffering and self-reflection three esses silas

334
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:58,400
suffering and self-reflection stila is a way that maybe we can like put a stake in the ground like

335
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:04,799
if we have this intention to behave this way in an ethical way we can

336
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:12,160
use it as to notice when do we not want to when do we not do it and what can we

337
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:19,680
learn from that might only gain greater understanding but what can we learn about suffering

338
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:24,960
what can we learn about what helps us to have greater ease and happiness in our life

339
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:33,119
and what doesn't in this way so that our lives may unfold

340
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:38,880
in a way that brings greater and greater ease and happiness not only to ourselves

341
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:45,839
but to those around us just imagine just imagine what this world

342
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:51,280
would be like if all of us kept at least

343
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:57,920
one precept all the time if we ever could be a model for others

344
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:05,920
or an inspiration for others so may your practice unfold in a way

345
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:12,559
that brings greater and greater ease and less suffering and may we use ethics not as a way to

346
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:18,799
beat ourselves up to judge ourselves but it's an opportunity to learn more

347
01:00:18,799 --> 01:00:25,760
thank you
