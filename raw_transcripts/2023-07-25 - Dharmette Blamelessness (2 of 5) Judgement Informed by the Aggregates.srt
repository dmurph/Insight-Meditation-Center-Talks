1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,400
so hello everyone welcome to the moment

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,559
now if you missed it my name is Maria stratman and I am filling in for Gill

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,380
this week who is off leading a retreat at one of his favorite places so

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:23,960
we can share a moment of being happy for him

5
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:34,800
so this week what we have been talking about or we will continue talking about is how to overcome self-criticism or

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:42,059
self-blame and in thinking about it we use the word blamelessness because

7
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:49,020
that's where we wish to be is in the world of blamelessness and today what I'd like to talk about is

8
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,360
Judgment because it is Judgment through which we finally come to the place where

9
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,920
I did that wrong I shouldn't have done that how did that happen

10
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,900
so I want to talk about a couple of aspects of judgment you know judgment is really about

11
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:13,799
forming an opinion about something it's not the behavior so much as it is the opinion about the

12
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,560
behavior and we do that very largely through the

13
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,200
act of comparison We compare it to our ideal our ideal self our ideal way that

14
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,360
anyone would behave but there's always an element of both opinion and

15
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,479
comparison right so it moves beyond the realm of just straight

16
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:44,159
discernment I can tell the difference between a and b i can distinguish between A and B it goes to the place

17
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,520
where I prefer A over B and I compare A and B to one another this act of

18
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:58,320
comparing things gets us in the realm where we start judging and we seem to have these ideas and

19
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,560
beliefs that we're labeling against all of the experiences we have

20
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,080
so I want to quickly there's so many things to say about this

21
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,980
I want to complete uh first remind you of of the uh the way

22
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:23,220
that we experience all experience there that we call this the Aggregates and they're called the Aggregates because

23
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:29,459
they're the five ways of receiving experience that we use to form a self

24
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:34,920
which is tied to what we believe and what our opinions are so so they are the

25
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,560
the sense Factor itself what I'm hearing or seeing or tasting or

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,560
smelling or touching or thinking the sense experience itself whether that

27
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,200
experience is Pleasant or unpleasant not whether we like it or not

28
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,540
that's an important distinction but is it Pleasant or unpleasant

29
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:04,200
Pleasant or unpleasant we don't actually have to go to like or dislike it can just be pleasant or

30
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,920
unpleasant so under some conditions I might taste a lemon and think

31
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:17,519
that is so blessedly wonderful after all of that sweetness or I will taste it and feel only the

32
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,540
bitterness of it in that taste those are Pleasant or unpleasant whether I like or dislike them has to do with all other

33
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,180
kinds of conditions the third thing is uh perception it's

34
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:37,080
it's noticing something it's it's the naming function you know this this this is a glass

35
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,180
but actually is a container but I call it a glass

36
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:50,220
because it has my water in it so there's a a naming feature and we name our experiences all the time

37
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:56,700
we name this is this is uh running this is sitting this is standing

38
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:03,780
so we perceive what it is we name it and that places a little placemark for us

39
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,360
the fourth thing is thinking so I'm a and I've got a few comments yesterday

40
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,580
I'm going to look at this and call it a bowl and I look can look at this and

41
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,680
call it a bowl one is much larger than the other I can

42
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,900
compare them on the basis of that I can compare them on the basis of sound

43
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,520
that's how they sound together

44
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:34,340
that's large and deep

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,720
small now I might have a preference for one or

46
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,360
the other and that's where we're in the realm of thinking now I'm thinking well this one is like this and this one's

47
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,780
like this and I can compare them it's the world of comparing in that experience and usually we compare based

48
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,960
on our experience and the other conditions around us

49
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,880
so maybe I prefer the light Bell if I'm alone in the room and just want to make

50
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,820
small Mark and sound and I might prefer the large Bell because it resonates much

51
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:21,560
more and I feel like that is going to be a better thing for me

52
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,120
the fifth thing is awareness if we're not aware of something it

53
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,820
actually doesn't even exist for us now behind me I know there are things on

54
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:41,160
the wall there's this I don't know if you can see it there's a little green heart underneath the picture and the the green

55
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:48,479
heart is made up of leaves and it was given to me by my husband I have all kinds of associations for it but behind

56
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:55,220
me when you can't see it and I can't see it it doesn't even exist

57
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,320
but when I look at it I know it it's not just that I see it

58
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,500
but I know that I see it this is an important part of mindfulness

59
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,380
when we're when we're considering what's going on in the moment and we're mindful of the moment

60
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:21,360
we see something there's an object we see it but the awareness is knowing that we see

61
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:29,699
it we see lots of things you look around you the environment you end you see all kinds of things but what do you know

62
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:35,100
I don't mean the knowing of what do you know about it but the registering is the

63
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:42,539
awareness part of it where you use oh yes I see that I know that so all of these elements are present in

64
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:49,560
any experience we have so judgment comes in when we start

65
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:55,560
comparing something some action some feelings some emotion to what we believe

66
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,380
is the right thing believe where did that come from

67
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:08,840
I failed in this because I really was sure I'd never do that again

68
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,120
how do I know I've failed in this well the outcome wasn't my expected outcome

69
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:20,460
it's all opinion what do you mean expected outcome oh oh

70
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,639
this is about what I think should happen not what happened

71
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,979
the art of blamelessness of non-judgment lies in being able to see your

72
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:37,740
experience just as an experience

73
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,418
oh this one this happened

74
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,960
and then I can say oh that wasn't my desired outcome

75
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,340
but I don't have to say that means I'm a failure that goes to another place now I'm comparing myself to something else

76
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:03,780
and instead I can say well that didn't work I'll try something else next time or I'm not going to do that I catch

77
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:11,400
myself doing something I have done over and over and over and I thought I wasn't going to do that again

78
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:20,660
ah I'll try harder next time it doesn't mean that we necessarily

79
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:26,639
dismiss any responsibility for the outcome but only that we look at it

80
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:32,399
cleanly without adding it to a whole list of other ways

81
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:40,500
in which we Define who am I judgment comes down to me

82
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:46,440
this is what I think this is what I believe this is what I maintain is always the same

83
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:53,760
when the experience is Just Happening Now a moment is only a moment

84
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:01,819
the assigning meaning to that moment is where we start creating suffering

85
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,899
when we have an opinion about it

86
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,920
when we can look at something without adding our history to

87
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:20,300
it sometimes we can see it more clearly

88
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:29,640
if my history tells me that being kind leads to people taking advantage of me

89
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:35,519
then I'm going to be worried about always being taken advantage of and I'm going to compare any experience I have

90
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:41,940
with kindness to whether I feel like I'm being taken advantage of because zero that's me

91
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:49,500
but if I can just be kind without tying it to what the outcome means

92
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,839
I find it's easier just to be kind

93
00:09:55,080 --> 00:10:02,100
so in any moment when we find ourselves wallowing in self-criticism

94
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:08,279
might be a moment to say what actually happened what's actually happening now and what

95
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:14,640
is being wounded in me what is the wound that I'm experiencing

96
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:21,120
well I am feeling

97
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,779
dismissed I am feeling like I made a fool of myself I'm feeling like that person's

98
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:34,200
not gonna like me I'm feeling unliked feeling unliked is very different than failing

99
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:40,440
very very different but if I'm busy having an opinion about the

100
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:46,639
experience I can miss with the experience actually is

101
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,620
the image is getting in way in the way of seeing clearly

102
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:59,459
the oh this must meanness ask yourself

103
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:05,700
when you're thinking about all the ways in which that person is

104
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:13,680
failing you you are failing that person whatever those judgments are think about how that's tied to the

105
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:20,760
history of the moment and not just the moment we tend to take these pictures of

106
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:27,360
ourselves and and drag them through our history on this string here it here it comes this is me following my experience

107
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,779
and I'm right here see it's just the same when the conditions are totally different

108
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:40,380
totally different the moment is totally different and if I let go of that string

109
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:45,480
I'm better able to see clearly this is what's happening

110
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:52,380
and maybe in seeing this is what's happening I can break the habit

111
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:57,920
of belief that leads to that judgment

112
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:05,279
now I want to be clear this doesn't mean that we don't have opinions about things

113
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,700
it doesn't mean that we don't have value systems it doesn't mean that we

114
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:20,459
don't have ethics but it does mean that we can look really cleanly and clearly at what it is

115
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:25,980
and not decide in advance if it looks like this this is what it means so

116
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:33,120
yesterday I came home and there was a paramedic truck at the opening of our garage the last time there was a

117
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:40,079
paramedic truck here someone had just died and so immediately there's a rush of anxiety

118
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,120
now had I been anxious before that I might have

119
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,420
been the conditions would have been different but this time I was mostly curious because there was no one in the

120
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:57,779
building that I would have expected might need a paramedic and then I noticed three firemen coming

121
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:03,899
down the outside stairs and one of them got to the two steps down and he leaped

122
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:09,180
off and clicked his heels together as he before he landed

123
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:16,380
and I I thought Charlie Chaplin right I laughed and I thought oh that's totally

124
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:24,360
inappropriate and then and then immediately oh that's inappropriate for him and then I thought no maybe it's

125
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:31,380
because nothing serious is actually happening and all of these were opinions and judgments about what might be true about

126
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:38,220
this fireman leaping off the stair and I have no idea why he leaped off the

127
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,399
stair and clicked his heels none whatsoever

128
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:51,300
but I didn't notice there's no urgency here no urgency and I could lay down

129
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:56,519
the judgment about why he did and just enjoyed the moment

130
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:04,560
of him kicking his heels together just enjoy the moment of him clicking

131
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:11,399
his heels together so today I'm going to read you another poem yesterday I failed to mention that

132
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,860
it was Jane hirschfield's poem the best and so today I want to be sure that I

133
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:24,740
tell you this is Tony Hoagland and I will find that column here

134
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:35,040
title of this poem is I have news for you there are people who do not see a broken

135
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,339
playground swing as a symbol of ruined childhood and there are people who don't interpret

136
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:48,060
the behavior of a fly in a motel room is a mocking representation of their thought process

137
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,100
and that there are people who don't walk past an empty swimming pool and think

138
00:14:53,100 --> 00:15:00,720
about past pleasures unrecoverable and then stand there blocking the sidewalk for other pedestrians I've read

139
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,760
about a town somewhere in California where human beings do not send their

140
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:12,600
sinuous feeder Roots deep into the potting soil of others emotional lives as if they were greedy six-year-olds

141
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:19,199
sucking the last inch of milkshake through a noisy straw and other persons in the midwest who can

142
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,360
kiss without debating the imperialist baggage of heterosexuality

143
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:30,420
do you see that creamy lemon yellow moon there are some people unlike me and you

144
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:36,000
who do not yearn after fame or love or quantities of money is unattainable as

145
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,880
that Moon thus they do not later have to waste more time defaming the object of

146
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:48,480
their former arter or consequently run and crucify themselves in some solitary midnight

147
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,660
Starbucks Golgotha I have news for you there are people who get up in the

148
00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:01,980
morning and cross a room and open a window to let in the sweet Breeze and let it touch them all over

149
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:05,720
their faces and bodies

150
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,820
you read it again there are people who do not see a broken playground swing as a symbol of ruined childhood and there

151
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:20,579
are people who don't interpret the behavior of a fly in a motel room as a mocking representation of their thought

152
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:25,980
process there are people who don't walk past an empty swimming pool and think about past

153
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:31,860
pleasures unrecoverable and then stand there blocking the sidewalk for other pedestrians

154
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:38,220
I've read about a town somewhere in California where human beings do not send their sinuous feeder Roots deep

155
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,800
into the potting soils of others emotional lives as if they were greedy

156
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:50,279
six-year-olds sucking the last inch of milkshake through a noisy straw and other persons in the midwest who can

157
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:57,360
kiss without debating the imperialist baggage of heterosexuality do you see that creamy lemon yellow moon

158
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,420
there are some people unlike me and you who do not yearn after fame or love or

159
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:10,918
quantities of money as unattainable as that Moon thus they do not later have to waste more time defaming the object of

160
00:17:10,919 --> 00:17:17,160
their former ardor or consequently run and crucify themselves in some solitary midnight

161
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,260
Starbucks Kolkata I have dues for you there are people who

162
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:30,360
get up in the morning and cross a room and open a window to let the sweet Breeze in and let it touch them all over

163
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,860
their faces and bodies

164
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:44,160
let yourself not be the person who needs to find the meaning in every step

165
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:53,160
but simply walk across the room and let the sweet Breeze Rush all over your faces and bodies

166
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,340
thank you

167
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,380
hey thank you very much for that Maria and um I guess at this point we'll

168
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:10,679
take any questions over Zoom or on YouTube if you want to post them in chat then I can

169
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:13,679
Maria

170
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:22,400
and if you want to raise your hand uh in Zoom then we can also call on you

171
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:30,419
what were the uh just kind of start off what were they Aggregates again and can you kind of just uh kind of repeat like

172
00:18:30,419 --> 00:18:36,960
the I guess the connection to um I guess quickly summarize the connection

173
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,720
to blamelessness or judgment and yeah sure okay so the Aggregates are the

174
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,820
sense input the feeling tone which is Pleasant or

175
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:53,220
unpleasant or neutral perception the naming function I name

176
00:18:53,220 --> 00:19:00,299
this as thinking about where we form our opinions and what we

177
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:06,900
believe about them and awareness which is just what do I know what what am I

178
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:12,419
registering when I look at this or feel this or see this these five things are

179
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:20,220
the ways that we create self they're they're the ways that we say I like this I don't like this I like it

180
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:26,760
because of this it's the way in which we form opinions and beliefs about us in

181
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,520
relationship to the experience so the experience has all of these elements in it

182
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:38,840
and we use them to form a sense of self

183
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:44,760
I am having this experience it's the place where I am having this experience

184
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:51,960
and the way that we want to live that leads to less suffering is to

185
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:57,059
live in a place where I can just see the experience I can know the the

186
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:03,120
part of the experience that I am aware of I'm aware that I'm thinking

187
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:10,860
about this I'm aware that I have an opinion about this I'm aware that this is Pleasant or unpleasant and it allows

188
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:18,660
us to enter the space where we can just experience and say Pleasant unpleasant I

189
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:25,220
don't have to run away from unpleasant I can just see it as unpleasant

190
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:31,260
and we can practice being with what is unpleasant without needing to fix it

191
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:36,860
without needing to change it it allows us to be in the space of

192
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:43,880
non-judgmental awareness it's a really big topic I

193
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:49,200
apologize for throwing it in the middle but it needed it's the basis for

194
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:55,020
how we think about judgment that allows us to step away from self-criticism

195
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:01,380
through judgment so I hope that helps yeah no that's great and it's good to be exposed to

196
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:07,580
these things even if just for uh and a little remorseful yeah

197
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,120
so are there other questions

198
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:24,200
we'll give folks a little while to and for the YouTube folks to catch up as well

199
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,460
so one of the one of the tricks

200
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:41,960
of non-judgmental awareness is realizing how

201
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:50,460
our opinions about life our need to have an opinion about life is about feeling

202
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:56,760
that we're about creating a sense of familiarity and comfort

203
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:03,960
we are we are much uh we find the familiar more pleasant than the

204
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:13,140
unfamiliar part of being non-judgmental is being comfortable with what is ambiguous

205
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:19,799
one of my favorite business books mostly for the title was a book called uh

206
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:25,260
sacred cows make the best hamburger which offended a lot of people but what

207
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:31,980
it reminded me of was that if I come into a situation totally believing what the outcome should look like

208
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:37,559
I miss opportunities I miss the opportunity to see things clearly or to

209
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:46,020
see something that I wasn't looking for that's one outcome of being able to

210
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:51,059
be in the space of knowing this is Pleasant or

211
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:56,100
unpleasant I don't have to change it I don't have to make it something other

212
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,940
than it already is can I be okay with it just as it is

213
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,980
what is the name of that book again Maria oh the book I talked about yeah the hamburger book or hamburgers make

214
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:18,440
the uh sacred cows make the best hamburgers

215
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:26,460
I don't think I have it anymore or I'd give you more information about

216
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,799
it and keep in mind that's you know that's probably 20 years old

217
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:38,340
or more okay we've got Nancy uh Nancy you can go

218
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:45,960
ahead and uh uh unmute yourself and hi Nancy goodbye

219
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:51,960
everyone to hi Maria hi everyone on zoom and YouTube

220
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:57,900
awesome good to see everyone um so

221
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,780
my question is about um the point of the

222
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:09,960
the process where there's the seeing what's Pleasant and unpleasant and then

223
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:17,460
there's uh the comparison informing the opinion and then that was my notice my battery's

224
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:24,419
getting low so hopefully this holds um and then there's this story about how

225
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:31,159
this reflects something bad or unfavorable about myself

226
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:37,620
and could you talk about that that point because it seems to me like that's where

227
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:44,940
the suffering comes in it's like when I've made this story about me or something yes like something

228
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,559
uh unfavorable about myself

229
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:03,379
talk about a fault I have uh or it's actually not a fault it's a it's a feature

230
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:09,960
uh but it took me a while to figure it out so at some point in my life I decided that uh I had to be the

231
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:16,320
strongest person in the room that this is what would make me safe and it happened around the time my

232
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,900
mother died when I was 12. okay so long time mental habit of needing to be the

233
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:27,179
strongest person in the room I could withstand anything I could be tougher than anybody else

234
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:33,659
so over time I came to understand that this created a huge amount of suffering both for me and for the people around me

235
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:39,120
and I decided I would stop needing to be the strongest person in

236
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:46,260
the room no deciding that doesn't just make it happen I have to tell you so I would practice things like

237
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:51,720
oh I know the answer to that and they're really on the wrong track but I'm not going to say anything I'm going to sit

238
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,419
here and not say anything I'm not going to exert control over the meeting I'm just going to let it happen

239
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:02,940
and how watch how unpleasant that was and how difficult it was and the story

240
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:10,080
running in my head was something like oh I have the answer and it would be better if I just told people and I just let it

241
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:17,340
happen and I discovered sometimes I was right about that that the outcome was not very

242
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:25,380
good and sometimes I was wrong about that and somebody stood up with a really great answer and a great solution and oh

243
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:33,360
I wouldn't have done it that way but you know I think it's going to work and so allowing myself to notice that I don't

244
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,940
have to be the way I was is one way of dealing with it I don't have to be who I

245
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:44,840
have been I can be someone else and it may not be

246
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:53,220
comfortable and when I say someone else it doesn't mean I'm trying to be an ideal self but just this person who has

247
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:59,820
this tendency to be the strongest person in the room and to know that that is actually a

248
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:06,120
skill I have to be wielded at the right time and under these conditions it can be

249
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,220
criticized and under those conditions when there's chaos for example and

250
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:18,500
nobody can quite see their way I can establish a vision for people

251
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:26,220
this is an appropriate use of it I can suggest a vision for people you

252
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:34,260
see how easy it is how easy it is to fall into that because I was already to execution okay

253
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:42,240
this is how you this is how you do it because that's the outgrowth of that feature but it's just a feature

254
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,279
and I've also discovered the ease in not

255
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:54,360
being strong sometimes that the appropriate thing for me

256
00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:00,299
is to just be there and so it allows me to see more clearly

257
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:07,679
that I don't have to judge What's Happening Now by what's come before or what

258
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,140
I would like to become I can just be in this moment

259
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:18,140
and see this is what's happening in this moment

260
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:26,340
I can see The Need to Be Right which is tied to the need to be liked or

261
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:32,460
the need to be seen in a certain way or so I don't have to get lost in an

262
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:39,480
analysis of it I can just see oh that's here that's here that's here

263
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:48,299
so if I'm in a conversation with my husband and uh we are not we're packed

264
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:55,039
talking across one another I can say okay

265
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:02,340
I have an intention to be kind to my husband so is our difference a matter of

266
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:07,679
my needing to be right or does it have some other impact

267
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:13,020
does it have an impact that affects the future or just this moment

268
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:21,659
I can let it go if it's just me wanting to be right I can say ah much better to be kind to

269
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:27,559
my husband than to be right much better

270
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:34,080
so I can make that judgment based on just seeing just this and not well you

271
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,620
know if I give in now I'm going to be giving whatever story whatever story we're telling we don't have to tell the

272
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:47,039
story so does that answer the question

273
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,898
thank you thank you very much

274
00:29:52,679 --> 00:30:00,179
okay we've got uh um uh just to share something like I guess when you said about getting it right uh or being right

275
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:05,760
um I I listen to Sports Talk Radio all the time and there's this uh um uh

276
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:11,820
uh there's a there's a particular uh co-host I listen to and he often says I

277
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:17,240
want to get it right not be right so that's

278
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:23,419
that's good uh let me

279
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,640
go to YouTube there's a question there uh and

280
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:35,340
um so Sam asks uh Maria how can we make sense

281
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:40,100
of experience without being insensitive

282
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:49,799
well there are a few loaded words there so first of all

283
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:56,820
um the only way to See Clearly what the experience is is a

284
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:05,100
kind of heightened sensitivity so uh making sense of the experience I'm sorry

285
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:10,260
ask the first part of again because I'm getting lost in the words sure

286
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:18,600
um how can we make sense of experience without being insensitive right okay so

287
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:24,179
so part of the uh drive here is the need to make sense of the experience which

288
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:31,140
means I'm incorporating it integrating it into something that is uh has been

289
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:38,820
happening might be happening could be happening in the future the making sense has to do with giving it meaning right

290
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:45,240
and the point about blamelessness

291
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,700
is that not every experience has to be put into

292
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:57,299
a pattern it has to be put into uh an ongoing story that says well this

293
00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:02,640
means this because it looks like that so if I talk about my firemen for example

294
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:09,000
what I the sense I made out of him leaping off the stairs was there's

295
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,020
no urgency here

296
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:20,600
but it would have been possible for me to incorporate that into a whole

297
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:27,059
and therefore because there's no urgency here

298
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:33,659
it it was unnecessary for me to form an opinion about an opinion about that

299
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:39,840
fireman jumping off the stair had I gotten a sense that everybody else

300
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,000
was rushing around I would have more likely formed an opinion that this

301
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,880
guy did not have the proper concern for the job he was doing

302
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,980
there's all kinds of things that can incorporate which are

303
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:03,919
additional to the minute to the moment that so the making sense of part

304
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:09,299
has to do with the in whether you're doing it in the immediate experience or

305
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:15,779
whether you're later reflecting on what something what has happened and you say well now what were all the elements of

306
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:21,179
that now you're not trying to make it now you're trying to

307
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:27,539
reason you're aware of the fact that you are thinking and trying to to resolve

308
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:33,179
something which doesn't have anything to do with self-judgment as soon as it goes into

309
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:39,360
the place where I'm judging whether it's good bad or indifferent as opposed to

310
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:45,840
is this appropriate to the mental process that I'm following I can get

311
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:52,580
myself in trouble I'm sorry if that gets confusing but I'm trying to make a distinction between

312
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:58,200
analysis in the moment which is going to be fed by my opinions

313
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:04,380
and what and me and reflection which incorporates

314
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:09,658
more wisdom and is not colored by whatever emotional content I have in the

315
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:14,940
moment or may not be colored by it unless I introduce it

316
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:20,820
I start saying oh that's my sister she did that she always does that she I

317
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:27,839
don't know when she's going to stop doing that now I'm applying something from the past to the future and I'm not

318
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,358
allowing her to be any different than she was

319
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:40,080
because I'm interpreting according to the story that I'm carrying with me so the difference between seeing clearly

320
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:45,960
and fitting something into a pattern is quite distinct

321
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,919
I hope that helps yeah thank you

322
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:59,280
uh Elroy uh or Eloy had a question um can you talk about how aspiring fits

323
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,520
in aspiring to write thought for example

324
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:09,660
okay so uh you may remember that when I

325
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:15,119
was talking about the firemen or when I was talking about discussing something with my husband where we were talking

326
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,820
past one another I reminded myself of my intention so I would say aspiration has

327
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:26,720
to do with intention so

328
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:33,960
you can use your aspiration your intention to

329
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:40,020
re-center yourself in a moment when you feel uncertain

330
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,060
this is my intention because what we have all we have

331
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:51,000
responsibility for In This Moment is Our intention and the action that we take

332
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,240
the next step what's already happened has already happened we can't change it we can't

333
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,599
undo it we can look at something with remorse and say uh I'm not going to do that

334
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:09,119
again and if I can make up for that I'll do that but carrying guilt with us

335
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:16,280
is trying to make it better in the past in the same way aspiration is

336
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:23,040
an intention this is this is where I want to place my attitude for the next

337
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:30,119
Moment The Next Step that I take and those intentions are changing all the time also we have broad intentions

338
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:36,000
and short-term intentions that the aspiration so I'll to make it less

339
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,420
theoretical I can say that I have an aspiration my My overall large intention

340
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:48,420
is to be open-hearted to be open-hearted and at one point I

341
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:55,140
noticed that begins with be open oh it's not about becoming something

342
00:36:55,140 --> 00:37:02,180
else it's about being open so I can apply be open to this moment

343
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:10,740
and then I heard myself say B just be the way to be open-hearted is to not

344
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:17,339
have opinions about everything but to simply be as present as I possibly can so if you're doing

345
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:23,760
something like an aspiration to why speech that you know I can always ask myself

346
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,880
is this is this uh is this true is this useful

347
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,280
is this kind is it Timely and if it passes all of

348
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:42,300
those things I can say that I don't always have time to go through all of those pieces of my aspirational wise

349
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:48,780
speech but I can notice when something is unkind or I can notice when it's

350
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:56,820
not timely or I can notice there's no point in my saying this to this person because it will not change

351
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:03,359
his mind her mind and only leads to further conflict

352
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:12,500
so I can back off based on my intention or I can pursue it based on my intention

353
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:21,920
but it isn't about becoming someone it's about being

354
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:27,260
how can I apply my intention In This Moment

355
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:33,240
and when I fail to be kind

356
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:41,339
I can feel the corruption in my heart and that suffering follows from that

357
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:47,579
and I increasingly sensitize myself to that so that I will

358
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:52,099
be less likely to fall into that pit again

359
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,900
so

360
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,200
are there any other questions

361
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:17,760
I think that's pretty much all the questions that uh that we have in YouTube and

362
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:24,000
um and uh uh I guess Cindy just kind of commented uh and zoom like we could

363
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,579
probably have a day long on this topic so um and we only had a 15-minute talk so

364
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:35,640
yeah you know the truth is around judgment every lies everything in

365
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:43,400
Buddhism why wisdom why is wise view wise speech wise action wise livelihood

366
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:49,320
meditation all of it is there so uh

367
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:56,960
we have to choose where we point our attention as always

368
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:03,359
thank you all thank you thank you may you all be safe and well and thank
