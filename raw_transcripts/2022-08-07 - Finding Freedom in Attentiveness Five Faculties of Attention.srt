1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,680
so good morning everyone welcome to imc both of those of you here in person

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,599
and those of you online and i just say just some brief

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,000
comments about meditation before we start and keep it mostly silent during this time

4
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:27,840
interesting kind of instructions for mindfulness meditation

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,000
is to consider that we're

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,320
doing two things one of two things one is we're knowing

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,399
something in the present moment like knowing the breathing knowing our body just knowing what's happening in the

8
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,559
present moment but in a way where the knowing is clear enough

9
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:58,559
that you could say to yourself i know that i know

10
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,119
so it isn't just a casual it is just like checking it off i'm kind of aware it's like there's a clarity or

11
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,400
brightness or a fullness in the knowing that's an in-breath

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,159
you're not necessarily saying those words to yourself but it's oh it's like i've never had an in-breath

13
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,920
before almost like oh that's what it's like i'm really clear it's really like okay

14
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,400
that's one thing to kind of not really know and to let that knowing be relaxed it

15
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,560
doesn't have to be a strain or just like it's almost like you allow yourself to really know something you make room to

16
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,400
know it all the second thing is to

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,039
is uh to know when you're not doing that

18
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,200
to know when you get caught in your thoughts and wander off and go on daydream and

19
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:00,880
get preoccupied in something and when you know that that's happening

20
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,840
don't make it a problem really know that so you can say

21
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:15,280
i know that i know there's a clarity there's a brightness and the mind oh that's what's happening

22
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,040
so you're it's okay so in this way you don't have to be concerned with being distracted or

23
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,760
caught up in your thoughts you just fold it into the knowing

24
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,840
so it's a little bit of a trick right it's like you just stay present in the knowing

25
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,200
and then rather than thinking that thinking is a problem

26
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,040
it just becomes the reason to know something clearly oh here i'm thinking

27
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,840
i'm distracted but you're no longer distracted if you say that

28
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,959
you're present with that so you can smile when you say i'm distracted or

29
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,720
because you're not really at that moment you can appreciate it you can love it even

30
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,760
so two things either know the present moment like the breathing

31
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,799
or know that you're not present and if you're not present really know it

32
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,040
so taking a comfortable alert posture

33
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,879
perhaps letting there be a gentleness to your posture

34
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,599
the softness while being alert

35
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,799
closing the eyes

36
00:03:51,200 --> 00:04:01,040
and to relax the body some as you exhale soften

37
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,280
on the exhale and as you inhale a little bit of opening lifting

38
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,040
energizing into the body

39
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,239
a connecting to your body in a fuller way on the inhale

40
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,720
relaxing as you exhale

41
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,720
so

42
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,240
and then perhaps just settling into breathing here

43
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,520
becoming familiar with your body's experience of breathing

44
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,560
and to know breathing with clarity with

45
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:26,320
it might be more mental it might be physical might be both

46
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,120
a clear feeling sensing of breathing

47
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,840
clear knowing

48
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,560
and whatever occurs in the present moment

49
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,919
is not nothing is a destruction if you take it to be just one more thing

50
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:03,479
to know clearly

51
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,400
so

52
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,919
you

53
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,680
so

54
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,399
so

55
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,040
so

56
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,399
so

57
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,680
so

58
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,480
so

59
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
um

60
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,279
so

61
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,640
so

62
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,720
so

63
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,600
um

64
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,039
so

65
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,480
so

66
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,919
you

67
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,080
so

68
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,159
so

69
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,679
uh

70
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,840
and as we come to the end of this sitting

71
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:11,200
maybe to appreciate that whatever ability we have to

72
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,760
be more aware

73
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,360
to show up for our life with attention

74
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,159
it's also an ability to show up with care

75
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:33,840
respect with attentiveness to the situation of

76
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,278
others as much as to ourselves

77
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,320
and may it be that this practice of attention

78
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,799
supports us bringing

79
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,840
kind compassionate caring awareness

80
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,679
to this world of others

81
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:10,559
in doing so may we better care for the world

82
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:17,120
may this practice we do be for the welfare and happiness of everyone

83
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:25,840
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

84
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,720
may all beings be peaceful

85
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:37,398
and may all beings be free

86
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,080
so

87
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,680
[Music]

88
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,480
so to make a few announcements before the talk

89
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:24,079
the first is that in a few moments my plan is to take off my mask

90
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,358
the custom is in a number of buddhist centers for the

91
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:36,320
teacher to take off their mask when they're teaching and then everyone else leaves their mask on

92
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,000
and i think the idea is that with everyone but the teacher wearing masks

93
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,839
it's safe for everyone safe for the teachers because you're wearing masks safe for you because you're wearing masks

94
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,878
and um and we have all these you know air purifiers and fresh air coming in so i

95
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:01,359
think it's pretty safe and so but if those of you who are sitting close by would not like to move

96
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,720
please do so freely there's no you know it's completely fine but

97
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,920
you don't have to you can sit further away if you don't comfortable with me taking my mask

98
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,838
off and then the other is um

99
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:25,520
we used to before the pandemic you know in these kinds of events make announcements about things that are happening here at imc that might

100
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:32,559
interest people coming up and we're kind of out of the habit of it but

101
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:38,320
one of the foundations of what we do here at imc is the intro to meditation class

102
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,359
and uh we just started on thursday to do it again after almost

103
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:48,720
two and a half years or more and in person and um

104
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:56,000
and uh some of you just would like to know that it's on thursdays at 6 30

105
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:03,920
you'll miss the first one but that's okay you can come to the second one or you can it's on audio dharma the first one you can listen to the ketchup

106
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,480
okay so that was the announcements and then this goes off

107
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:41,040
and then i'm probably clear too speaking this way not so muffled so

108
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:49,359
so welcome everyone nice to have you here and be together this way

109
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:55,760
and uh to be a little bit of a celebration about you know the whole pandemic time

110
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:00,880
to see so many people coming back to imc this way and

111
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,280
coming sitting in community and i really appreciate the chance to practice together and be this way so

112
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:15,040
thank you for being here so um

113
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,680
the central feature of this mindfulness practice

114
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,720
is attention and attention is

115
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,320
maybe a number of different faculties we have different capacities we have

116
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:38,560
that come together under this umbrella term attention and i'm aware of

117
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:44,720
in this modern kind of technologically centered world that many

118
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:50,400
of us live in there's a fair amount of conversation now about

119
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,320
how there's a lot of a lot of money and a

120
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:03,520
lot of effort a lot of intelligence that goes into tricking human beings attention

121
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,920
capturing people's attention the more clicks you can do or the more you'll surf the more you'll

122
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,720
maybe you'll consume or the work all kinds of things that happen and so to get people's attention and

123
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:23,359
keep it on their monitor on their screen there's a whole industry for it

124
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,480
and many of us participate willingly with that whole enterprise and

125
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,599
maybe spend hours a day sometimes on a monitor and and sometimes even you know

126
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:40,320
caught by the news caught by the me social media caught by you know the advertisements or you know

127
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:47,280
searching for something and there's a feeling among some people who are studying this that it's uh it's

128
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:54,400
a problem for our society that so many people's attentions are captured and being pulled along

129
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,640
and if you go along willingly it can even feel like you're so free i can just go along and just anywhere where

130
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:06,720
anywhere i want to go i can just go freely into the surfing the web but in fact

131
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,000
it's not that free of the mind in a sense the buddha 2500 years ago was

132
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,839
addressing the same issue but what was capturing the mind was not

133
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:23,359
social media but monitors but rather was desire desires

134
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:29,680
in the in the human mind and the desires in one form or other

135
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:36,640
would hijack our attention take it over or with the tension get pulled into sometimes a black hole of desire of

136
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:42,560
wanting something or not wanting something kind of flip side

137
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:49,920
and from a buddhist analysis the we don't want to put the responsibility or the blame

138
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:56,400
on those people on the other side of the monitor who are dreaming up all the ways to capture our attention

139
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,320
and from buddha's point of view you're responsible for your attention and

140
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:08,480
and certainly probably there should be a lot of changes in what how social media media and computers are presented to the

141
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:15,119
world but still in buddhist point of view we're responsible for it and with probably the same problem as it

142
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:20,400
was time of the buddha and it somehow or other desires or aversions

143
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,480
were caught in the grip of it and pushes our attention but sometimes our attention is hot held hostage or

144
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,760
hijacked by these strong forces of the mind

145
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,960
and as i said earlier it can be feel the same way that if you you can give yourself over to your desires your

146
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:44,000
aversion so completely that it can feel i'm so free it's like giving and you know an uh

147
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,560
unlimited credit card to spend you know you can feel like so free to go into the shopping mall and just buy buy

148
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:57,200
buy everything you know and it's too much for you to carry that's okay because you have a credit card you just buy you get sherpas to

149
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:03,280
carry everything for you or the equivalent by the robots they're going to kind of follow you around and carry everything

150
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:11,119
back with you so just because you're so free right it's so great to be free when you sit down to meditate

151
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:16,800
you discover that that kind of mind is not that free you find that the mind sits down you

152
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,160
want to just do the simple thing of sit down and be present in the present moment maybe be present for the

153
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:28,720
breathing and in fact the mind doesn't want to do that the mind has a mind of its own

154
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,920
and in a certain way it's not your mind anymore it's not the mind that you have some

155
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:40,800
control over some authority over some choice over you get pulled away pulled away pulled away

156
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,079
and it's a powerful lesson to meditate to see that to see

157
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:52,000
how not free the mind is whereas we thought we were free the

158
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,400
other way now do you have a choice one choice is to come back to the old

159
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,240
way you know in a sense when we're on the web if you have a monitor to look at and

160
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:10,640
the web to be connected to it's almost like you have unlimited you know credit card you have unlimited and

161
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:18,560
no money you can't buy anything necessarily but you just think you have unlimited ability just you know search search search search

162
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:24,880
and feel free but but hopefully when people meditate or in another kind of ways even just going for

163
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:32,319
a walk in a park or just having a sabbath day and doing nothing we start reclaiming

164
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:40,319
our capacity to be be at home in ourselves and not have the mind incessantly searching wanting doing

165
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:45,520
but the mind becomes some profound meaningful rest and ease and

166
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,720
it's a kind of reclaiming the mind rediscovering the mind or the heart if you prefer

167
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,800
even ourselves and some people are really out of touch with themselves because of

168
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,839
the monitors before you know they work on monitors they spend all their time in monitors and

169
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:07,760
and it's kind of a way of being disconnected and to reclaim ourselves to reconnect to

170
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:13,440
ourselves to find ourselves discover what freedom means in some deep inner way

171
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,440
where we feel like the mind has become our friend the mind has become our companion

172
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:27,040
and and support for the fullness of our life so just so attention then becomes the

173
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:32,960
medium the means for freedom because it's how we use attention

174
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:40,960
is a measure of where the freedom and the lack of freedom is and so attention is mindfulness

175
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:47,359
and so we're developing this capacity to be mindful for the purposes of this freedom

176
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:54,880
that is a reclaiming of ourselves of coming back to ourselves and being able to breathe easily again freely again and

177
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,000
openly and i don't know maybe i shouldn't say again because some of the ways that we the

178
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:06,240
deeper ways we discover it's like for the first time that we find this way

179
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:12,800
so for the cultivation of this attention in our practice we consider that it's an

180
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:19,359
ecology of the mind or ecology of the heart that's operating meaning there are different faculties

181
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:25,119
mental faculties that are operating that are cooperating and participating

182
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:33,359
in this endeavor in this task of setting the awareness free or reclaiming it

183
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:41,359
and appreciating that this occurs there's an ecology there's all these different pieces of the mind that are support that support attention

184
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:48,240
and which attention cultivates and develops and um so this what i'm going to talk

185
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:55,040
about today the ecology is something called the five faculties and the five faculties

186
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:01,599
are five functionings of the mind five like kind of processes of the mind or

187
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:08,480
of our inner life if the mental world seems too mental of our inner inner life

188
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:14,880
that we're all operating in fact they're operating for you right now it isn't like they're strange

189
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,560
mystical kind of states to be listening to me these are operating

190
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:26,079
and um and you know your capacity to be attentive

191
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,200
is being tested here as i give a talk because you're either

192
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:38,400
attentive because you want to be or because it's so fascinating what i'm

193
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:44,480
saying that you're just captivated and caught i mean this this story i'm telling and the drama and the

194
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,000
most you know you you're just waiting at edge of your seat for the resolution of this fantastic talk right and you're

195
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:55,680
just kind of caught maybe but um

196
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,880
but uh or your mind is drifting off in thought

197
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:06,480
and your mind is lost or maybe you've decided that you're thinking about really good jeopardy

198
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:12,640
questions and that's the best use of your time sitting here not listening to me but you know coming up with a jeopardy question

199
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:19,280
so you made it a choice the very this very thing i'm talking about the ecology of attention

200
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:25,520
is operating here while you're attentive while you're living here and

201
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:30,960
you might want to listen just enough to use to then reflect back

202
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:37,200
how is it operating for you now are any of these factors how are they living in you now

203
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:43,680
as you're listening so i'll first kind of just name the five faculties

204
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:50,480
and then i'll kind of talk about them in different ways maybe more creatively than just the classic

205
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:57,359
language how they're described so most commonly in english they're described as

206
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:03,440
faith energy or effort

207
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:10,079
mindfulness concentration and wisdom

208
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:16,000
and um and what i want to highlight first is that the importance that here

209
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,079
mindfulness is in the middle it's the third factor and the first two factors

210
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:28,079
faith whatever faith is this energy or effort they're considered to be activating

211
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:33,520
energizing faith is meant to be inspiring to bring energy

212
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,880
that's the function of faith in this practice the

213
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,559
fourth and fifth and the other side of the middle mindfulness is um

214
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:50,960
concentration and wisdom both of which are supposed to help with a settling

215
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,319
with a freeing with a relaxing with a de-stressing

216
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:02,000
and and so they're activating and settling kind of qualities

217
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,920
and it says that mindfulness in the middle helps the bring those into balance

218
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:13,040
as mindfulness develops these other four qualities can follow in

219
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:17,920
the wake they get stronger as mindfulness gets stronger

220
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:25,359
but also it works the other way that the other four are the foundation that we create that we bring in

221
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:30,880
that supports mindfulness like a scaffolding we build for have a

222
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:38,160
lighthouse on top so the lighthouse can see and spread light in all directions so these four other four as they become

223
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,680
strong help so support and hold up the awareness so it becomes strong and for

224
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,880
us as well so um it begins

225
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:56,559
and so on the on the the list begins with the pali word sada

226
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:02,480
which is most commonly english is translated as faith i like to think of it as

227
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,520
wholeheartedness what you put your heart into

228
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:14,000
you know what we put our heart what we put our heart into doing what we do wholeheartedly what's what

229
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,440
our heart wants to do in our life is really important

230
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,880
i don't think if you really ask your heart to really what what are you going to put to wholeheartedly put your heart

231
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:30,800
into because you really love it or it's really meaningful for you it's probably not

232
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:37,440
going home to your monitor to your device and in search amazon

233
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,640
for the wonderful things you can buy and what's on sale

234
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:48,800
that's probably you might the desire might want to do that there's energy there for it but it's not the whole if

235
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:55,200
you really tap into the what you you want to put your heart into it's probably not that

236
00:49:55,200 --> 00:50:00,960
what we put our heart what we do wholeheartedly when would we put our kind of to

237
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,880
you know our whole self into what's really valuable what feeds us and makes the heart sing

238
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:14,880
what is that and um so that's what i associate with this word sada faith

239
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:22,319
there's some idea that in the centuries before the buddha the word sada meant hospitality

240
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:28,000
which also is a very nice idea that what you're willing to be a host for

241
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,680
what you're willing to be present for and invite come here so what you've put yourself into

242
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,800
wholeheartedly with your attention where do you want to put your attention at what's important

243
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:46,480
for you and and what do you want to be the host for it kind of goes hand in hand because

244
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:52,880
the idea in meditation at least is to put your your attention

245
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:58,400
wholeheartedly to reclaim yourself to be here for

246
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,440
yourself with yourself to reclaim this attention this is

247
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:10,240
important and then in doing that because be the faith to have the faith that it's

248
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:15,839
appropriate to be the host to be hospitable to all things that

249
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:21,359
occur faith is kind of since i used the word wholehearted for

250
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:28,079
it it's the more the emotional most emotional quality of the five faculties

251
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:35,119
so there's an emotional quality of inspiration it's very that's why it's energizing we're inspired by this

252
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:42,319
wow i can't do it yet but if this is what's going to

253
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:48,880
i'm going to find my freedom set my attention free reclaim my attention for myself

254
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:58,960
that's good i want to do that this is important and then um the next one the effort part

255
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:05,040
is to what we is to put some energy into this you know not to have a good idea yeah

256
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:12,640
this is a good idea to be wholeheartedly present but yeah i'm going to do this i'm going to you know really give myself to it

257
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:19,520
so the engagement the non-conventional idea that i like to associate with this

258
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:27,440
word is to inhabit to inhabit our aliveness to inhabit what

259
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:34,640
we're doing and i like this for myself because then it's more than just a mental thing

260
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:41,839
you know meditation just bring your attention and pay attention and know what's happening but to inhabit for me is to be embodied

261
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:47,520
to kind of be present in a fully embodied way i'm here with this experience

262
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:53,839
and there's more faculties of attention than just what goes on in the mind

263
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:58,960
the part of the faculty of attention it are all the sense endings the nerve

264
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,640
endings that tap for sensations in our body and they're just as important for

265
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:11,040
embodied fully developed attention as any capacity of the mind to recognize

266
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:16,640
oh that was a sound there's a sound outside for example

267
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:22,559
there's also the whole embodied sensory apparatus that takes in that sound

268
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:27,839
we haven't had it for a while but occasionally it's really great to have these cars

269
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:33,760
drive down to have the really deep ass boom box because then it really feels like this

270
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,880
is embodied listening you know the whole body is shaking and

271
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,960
even the building shakes sometimes and um so um

272
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:50,400
the in the ancient language in the of the buddha the i don't think he associated with

273
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:58,160
this effort or engage with energy with um you know really being inhabited

274
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:03,440
inhabit your experience he associated with courage

275
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:09,760
so to do something it was courageously and sometimes this practice requires that there's something kind of a little

276
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:15,200
courage and then i love the idea that courage comes from the french word heart

277
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:21,359
so that we're not don't get that we don't feel like we're striving or you know or kind of overriding what's happening

278
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:27,920
but to really courageously show up for ourselves and feel what's here be with it and that's hard sometimes right our

279
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:34,400
emotional lives are difficult and challenging and and so to do this practice

280
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:39,680
so that's what we put energy into then on the other side of mindfulness

281
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:45,440
there is um concentration and concentration is probably not the

282
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:50,799
best translation for samadhi samadhi is often associated with

283
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:58,000
tranquility it's also associated with letting go

284
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:05,280
a lot of letting go some people with one of the first lessons i had when i went to thailand to do this practice here

285
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:12,079
like the first evening i was first there to engage in the practice i was in a monastery and there was talking with

286
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:17,359
some of the monks and and um they were a little bit uh critical of

287
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:23,119
concentration practice and they were saying oh that's that's just about letting go

288
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:28,720
as if that's nothing every small thing but the idea was that uh to develop

289
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:35,520
deeper states of concentration has more to do about letting go than it is about laser focusing your

290
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:41,680
attention and so this letting go and the word that i liked associated

291
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:46,960
with concentration that's a translation of an ancient teaching

292
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:52,160
is to be settled the concentration is to be settled on

293
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:59,839
your experience and so now you feel how it's the idea of settling letting go relaxing

294
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:05,440
tranquility how concentration is um is the calming effect of the five

295
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:11,280
faculties so we inhabit and engage we're inspired

296
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,400
but that can be too much sometimes and then we it comes into balance with

297
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:23,119
relaxing with settling with letting go and bringing those into proper balance

298
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:29,359
is the art of mindfulness if we let go and relax too much you fall start falling asleep and the mind

299
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:35,520
wanders off too much we need the engagement we need the inspiration the clarity

300
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:40,880
and so we're navigating this ecology in our ecosystem and figuring out which

301
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:49,200
one to bring forth and then uh the the fifth one is wisdom

302
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:55,440
which has a lot to do with having insight really seeing in the present moment it's not wisdom that you carry with you it's

303
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:01,280
like you read a book and now you think you have all the wisdom you need because you have this knowledge the

304
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:07,200
it's really um i think the word insight probably works better to translate panya

305
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:12,880
in the sense that it emphasizes what you're seeing and understanding

306
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:20,640
in the lived experience of the moment so that's where the wisdom is in the lived experience what do i see now

307
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:28,960
and the one of the primary forms of insight here and now that this is in enterprises about

308
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:34,000
is to be able to recognize the difference between stress

309
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:40,640
and not stress the difference between when we are adding stress to our mind to our body to

310
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:46,160
our heart and to know there's a possibility of not adding that stress

311
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:52,000
stress is not healthy in the long term stress is not where freedom of attention

312
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:58,000
is discovered we don't reclaim the fullness and the ease of ourselves

313
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,359
by being stressed and so rather than thinking of wisdom as being

314
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:08,559
this complex you know you have to get a book on buddhist philosophy to understand the ins and outs the depths

315
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:13,680
of you know buddhist wisdom it's actually it's always

316
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:20,000
something very simple what's being discussed here about wisdom something we can see and know for ourselves

317
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:27,280
and one of the primary ways to say it in modern simplistic terms is to be able to have wisdom inside to

318
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:33,520
see clearly when what we're doing is stressful and to know

319
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:38,960
that we don't have to do that we might not be able to stop it

320
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:44,960
so don't add stress on top of stress but to see that to know that is to start

321
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:51,040
having wisdom oh i'm striving and pushing i'm resisting

322
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:57,200
here all that is stressful okay so now i have to be aware of this

323
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:03,119
be attentive to that i have to know that at least i have wisdom i don't know what to do about it but at least i have

324
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:08,799
wisdom about it another form of wisdom is to that uh

325
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:15,520
becomes more and more important as the practice becomes as the capacity for attention becomes stronger

326
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:21,440
is to have more and more clarity about how moment by moment

327
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:29,200
and i want to emphasize that moment by moment our experience is constantly changing

328
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:35,839
and why that is important is then we really see that then we're willing to kind of maybe

329
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:41,760
uh surf on it as opposed to hold it like it's one way this is the way it has to be

330
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:47,040
this is the like one of the mice my delusions has been sometimes

331
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:53,839
i've arrived this is how it's supposed to be you know in meditation for example okay

332
00:59:53,839 --> 01:00:00,000
finally i'm concentrated this is it or finally i feel you know i feel some

333
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:05,839
sense of calm and relaxed and happy i've got it made don't breathe

334
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:11,359
you'll mess it up and um but really life is more like

335
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:16,799
being on a surfboard you're finally caught the wave you don't say this is it

336
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:23,599
you have to be very attentive to the changing natures of the wave to be able to stay on the board

337
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:31,280
or in a bicycle maybe that's better example for some of you than a surfboard is you know you you never say like now i got it made

338
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:36,880
on the bicycle like that don't move you know it's uh you know you're

339
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:42,880
constantly navigating negotiating and shifting your weight and adjusting the you know everything

340
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:49,920
it's a so to really start appreciating that the the intimacy of changing nature of

341
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:58,400
experience here and now then attention this whole enterprise of the five faculties are involved

342
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:05,119
in not fixating on anything because any fixation is stress

343
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:13,119
so as if the faith is in the forefront wow this is so i'm so inspired by this or

344
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:19,440
this is what i realize now what's most important for me and what i'm willing to put my whole-hearted attention in

345
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:27,040
not necessarily the activities that you do but rather how you do those activities

346
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:32,319
and that's the secret of buddhist practice i think is not what you do

347
01:01:32,319 --> 01:01:38,880
but how you do it that's where this inner freedom is really found

348
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:45,040
and that's why when we do mindfulness meditation it's not exactly the meditation that's important like don't think you have to

349
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:52,559
become a great meditator but rather it's what you're learning about how you use

350
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:59,039
attention and as you learn how to use your attention and meditation in this simple

351
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:04,559
laboratory then it'll start spilling out into your life

352
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:10,079
and then when you go home to wash your dishes or clean the kitchen floor

353
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:18,240
it isn't about kitchen getting the floor clean as quickly as you possibly can so you can get back on your monitor

354
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:24,240
it's do you discover that you reclaim yourself your freedom is

355
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:29,920
found in being fully present for washing the kitchen floor

356
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:36,640
as if there's nothing else to do in the whole world there's no stress about the next thing

357
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:45,039
there's no stress about why do i have to do the kitchen floor you know didn't i do it last week

358
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:54,240
you know which i should someone else should be doing it these are all ways that interfere with just inhabiting

359
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:01,440
being wholehearted being relaxed and settled

360
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:07,680
letting go not adding stress

361
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:14,319
seeing where the non-stress is and washing the kitchen floor being present with attention for this

362
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:22,240
activity and by the time you finish doing the floor it's like well that was great

363
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:28,839
not because the floor is great not because the particular activity is like the greatest thing invented by human

364
01:03:28,839 --> 01:03:36,720
beings but because of what you brought to it how you were with it

365
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:44,559
that's the trick and that's what what happens after a while this the freedom of mindfulness practice

366
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:50,559
is portable into anything that you do

367
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:56,160
where what you do is less important than how you do it

368
01:03:56,160 --> 01:04:02,079
and it's absolutely what you do is important and you might love doing some things more than others

369
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:08,640
but the wholeheartedness the faith the where we inhabit

370
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:15,760
where we where we are settled is in how we are with our attention

371
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:22,000
how we are present with our attentiveness for what we're doing

372
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:31,920
so you might consider how there's a way of being wholehearted

373
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:37,920
in the attentiveness you bring to what you do that's easier to do

374
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:44,400
if you don't equate what you're doing with the attentiveness

375
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:51,280
some things are hard to be inspired to do in and of themselves

376
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:56,880
but what's inspiring is the attentiveness by which you engage

377
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:02,720
with them some of you probably have been parents

378
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,640
some of those things we have to do are not inspiring

379
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:16,000
at all the things i had to do as a parent i never would dreamt that i had to do

380
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:23,280
i remember one day i should have may tell you maybe shouldn't tell you this but one of the big surprises was um when my kid was really young and he

381
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:30,400
was still sick and he started throwing up i quite i don't know what to say without any

382
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,520
horror or any disgust i just put my hands together and cup

383
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:40,880
them to receive the vomit it just seemed like the most natural

384
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:48,240
thing to do anyway so occasionally

385
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:55,200
occasionally you know occasionally we have to do things which you know are not necessarily something you would think ahead of time wholeheartedly but it's

386
01:05:55,200 --> 01:06:00,480
the ac it's how we do it that becomes the you know

387
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:06,079
so to be present for whatever wholeheartedly

388
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:11,440
to be pre to inhabited the energy factor

389
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:18,000
to discover to be attentive to really attend to i like the word that the attention kind

390
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:25,119
of means to attend to to really attend to with our capacity to be present to know

391
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:34,319
to do it in a way that's easeful i like the word ease and this is almost a synonym of concentration

392
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:40,079
to do it with relaxing and ease letting go letting go of what

393
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:45,520
letting go of what we learn with our wisdom letting go wisdom shows us where the

394
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:50,960
stress that we carry and over time as the practice develops for us

395
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:59,280
we see more and more where all the stress lives in our body and our eyes and our jaws and our hands

396
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:06,079
in our belly in our minds and our brains all these different places and we learn

397
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:14,960
to not give in to that stress we learn to relax it these are five faculties that you have

398
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:22,000
that whether you know it or not were somehow present here listening to this talk

399
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:28,720
maybe some of them were in short supply maybe they're all present in a wonderful

400
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:33,839
way but i hope that it at least gives you some uh

401
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:40,000
idea of what we're you know the landscape of what mindfulness is about kind of the terrain

402
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:45,599
the map of the different faculties that were coming into play it might seem like a lot to keep in mind

403
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:52,559
five different things but you're using them all the time anyway

404
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:58,720
and and as you become more aware of this and first it might be like riding a

405
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:06,000
bicycle that's awkward and feels like you're now even more stressed out because you have to keep all these things into my in mind

406
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:13,280
but as you keep doing this practice you'll see these things become stronger and become more second nature

407
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:18,480
and it becomes sometimes it becomes like oh this one's weak

408
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:26,880
or this one's overdone i think i'm trying too hard here or i think i'm you know

409
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:34,798
i could use a little bit more inspiration here where's what do i what do i feel wholehearted about what's really important for me

410
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:40,400
and realizing what that is does that bring me some more juice

411
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,640
to

412
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:53,400
being here attentively finding my freedom in my attentiveness

413
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:59,040
so that's my talk

414
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,640
may the five faculties be at treasures be five treasures for you

415
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:10,000
that you've realize are in you

416
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:16,798
it can be your wealth so um thank you

417
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:22,798
and um it's we we have a few minutes before the

418
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:27,838
official ending for the talk uh we can maybe take five minutes or so

419
01:09:27,839 --> 01:09:33,040
if any of you have any comments or questions and then afterwards after that i'll

420
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:40,080
invite all of you is we'll go out tonight and continue having a discussion if in the in the parking lot outside we

421
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:45,679
take the folding chairs out and sit in a big circle and we can take off our masks out there if you want

422
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:52,159
and and we just have an open discussion but before we go out to any questions comments now that any of you would like

423
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:58,719
to ask here thank you

424
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:05,440
hi uh thanks for your talk so what i've been thinking was

425
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:12,560
i feel as my practice deepens i start to notice more things

426
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:20,719
maybe when talking to people you start to notice patterns of thoughts that they have and

427
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:26,880
they're not like asking for help or anything but you can tell it seems like a

428
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:32,880
trap somehow and i still don't know how to navigate that like

429
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:38,159
they're not asking for advice and is that something that you should like

430
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:43,600
tell them so they are aware of or oh i see so what you're saying is that

431
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:50,080
you're as you're becoming more mindful and understanding your inner landscape better you you now understand other people

432
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:56,080
better and you see for example that there's whatever they're doing now how they're talking or how they're engaging

433
01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:02,080
that they're involved for example in a stressful way and so should you

434
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:09,120
you know poke them and say hey you [Laughter] not not that way yeah i understand i i

435
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:16,640
know i know i i apologize i didn't i wasn't at all implying that you were not all by applying it you were you're

436
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:22,480
that that's what you meant but um so the first thing that occurs to me to

437
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:27,679
tell you is the story when i was i was first doing this practice regularly

438
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:32,560
uh i saw how people were so caught up in their

439
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:41,360
ego games you know and wanted wanted to get some people wanted to be get praised or back then the language was stroked

440
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:46,640
and um and uh and i didn't want to play the games

441
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:53,198
anymore so i had a girlfriend and a wonderful woman who

442
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:58,480
wasn't the practitioner and so i didn't want to you know play those

443
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:03,678
games and so the relationship ended

444
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:09,520
and many years later what i realized was that um

445
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:15,120
i had some wisdom like seeing something how things were operated and there was some wisdom about not participating in

446
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:21,280
it but what i lacked was compassion and so i didn't i didn't care for her i

447
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:26,719
didn't understand her suffering and understand how what how i was being was actually

448
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:32,159
because she wasn't a practitioner and no idea what was happening that it actually probably added suffering to her rather

449
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:37,520
than took him away so you want to be clear if you see something in others that

450
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:44,159
they're ready to hear it that they want to hear it that it's welcomed almost invited that it's useful

451
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:49,600
and you're doing it out of care and it's the right time to do it um

452
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:57,440
so things like that thank you that sounds kind of the answer i've been found uh i found

453
01:12:57,440 --> 01:13:03,199
like with compassion and it's almost like an art form on yeah when and how to

454
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:08,960
do it thank you and don't underestimate how valuable it is to be present for

455
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:14,080
people to listen to people and you know the inner system of human

456
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:21,120
beings shifts and changes towards health when there's a lot of attention we when

457
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:27,199
we give attention to ourselves this whole thing i'm talking about today of really bringing attentiveness to our

458
01:13:27,199 --> 01:13:33,679
life tends to shift and move things towards health when we bring a lot of listening and a

459
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:40,000
lot of attention just just listen and be present for other people it tends to move them towards health too

460
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:46,480
so don't underestimate how useful that is so even though you might see that person's stressed out

461
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:52,640
rather than telling them that offer them the kind of caring simple relaxed attention that maybe helps

462
01:13:52,640 --> 01:14:00,120
something in them to relax and then they might learn eventually on their own they'll recognize

463
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:06,320
it's a very good question but then and i just scratched the surface of all the answers

464
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:12,320
so there's a question here thank you gil this was an extremely

465
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:17,520
valuable session for me anyway along the line of the uh

466
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:23,600
the threat that this gentleman initiated there are times when people

467
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:28,800
ask for advice but they really don't want the advice so

468
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:35,520
i think perhaps part of wisdom is recognized when there is a room for advice to be

469
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:42,960
given and when there is just simply supporting and actively listening and and just being there for them

470
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:48,880
how do you feel about that i didn't quite follow let me see so

471
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:54,560
you're talking about when when people ask for advice or when they don't ask for advice well sometimes they actually

472
01:14:54,560 --> 01:15:02,800
dads asked for advice but then you find out later that they really did not want the advice they just said yeah

473
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:08,159
well in in um there's a in japanese zen

474
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:14,480
uh there's a little saying or instructions or something um

475
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:20,320
when someone asks you a question and i think they mean then dharma question like with a teacher but it's maybe good

476
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:26,719
here too is um only do 30 answer

477
01:15:28,719 --> 01:15:35,920
and um and then see if they ask again and uh like the buddha sometimes

478
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:41,040
would not answer the first time someone would ask they had to ask three times

479
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:48,080
and uh and actually in zen monasteries they have that idea it's kind of built into the ritual of the dharma talk you

480
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:54,480
know no one sees it but before someone gives a talk there's some kind of ritual ringing of bells and bowing that's

481
01:15:54,480 --> 01:16:00,239
offline sometimes where it's kind of meant to replicate the idea that the community is

482
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:06,880
asking the person three times to give the talk so you know so just offer just enough

483
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:13,199
that you're responding but not everything you could say and um

484
01:16:13,199 --> 01:16:19,199
and uh and then see if they want more and they'll come back with more and come back with more

485
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:25,360
thank you thank you great so um is there a question let's do see it

486
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:30,560
