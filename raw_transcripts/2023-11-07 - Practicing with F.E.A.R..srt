1
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:09,559
welcome welcome everybody you're welcome to move around if you'd like sit in a chair or move

2
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:15,879
chairs or come up front or something like this we put chairs not really knowing how many people will be here so

3
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:21,690
just want to let you know move to where you'll be

4
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:28,400
[Applause] comfortable so I don't know if you guys

5
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,280
were like me but uh somehow when I first started meditating I had this idea like

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,760
oh just be relaxing and all those like pesky emotions would just go away and an

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,760
opportunity to uh just be quiet it turns out right that didn't

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,079
happen and maybe that's been true for you too especially if we have a regular meditation practice if we have a

9
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,480
commitment that we're going to sit every morning for example some mornings we

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,640
wake up and we're cranky so we meditate with crankiness or maybe we feel sad or

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:14,520
maybe we still feel tired or hungry you like all these types of things or maybe there's some times in

12
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:21,240
which you go to sit to meditate and you feel really easeful and relaxed and

13
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,200
steady and then maybe a memory comes up and then there's emotion fear or anger

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,040
or sadness or maybe you're thinking about something in the future and fear and anger comes

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,840
up so meditation and emotions right they definitely go

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,880
together and we have we might even have this idea like oh to be an awakened means to not have

17
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,479
emotions it's not how it works it's not that we like get rid of emotions it's

18
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:57,880
instead that the suffering that we are adding to emotions

19
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:04,880
just doesn't exist anymore sadness it still arise but it's not a

20
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,759
problem there's no suffering associated with it anger might arise it's not a

21
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:17,120
problem there's just no suffering associated with it and it arises and passes away it's like short duration

22
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,519
might be intense but it's like oh wow oh this is what anger is

23
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,319
like so in order to find like Freedom some ease some peacefulness

24
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:37,360
with whatever is arising in our meditation in our daily life that of course would include with emotions with

25
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,319
our emotional life whichever emotions of course most often we want to

26
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,760
talk about the difficult ones anger sadness

27
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:57,159
fear we want to keep all the love and the joy and the happiness of course we

28
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:02,720
do and it is true that we tend to talk more about the

29
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,920
difficult emotions because they're difficult but also because there's a way

30
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:16,360
in which there's a collapsing there's a shutting down there's a like getting stuck with

31
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:23,319
difficult emotions and then there's a this strong sense of self that gets created I'll talk a little bit more

32
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:28,400
about this but that's in contrast when there's love and joy and happiness we

33
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,519
tend to be open and then when there's open there's can be more shedding and to be letting go

34
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,360
and this open and shedding is the direction towards more freedom as opposed to this collapsed and tight and

35
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,000
I got to figure it out I got to make it go away or something like this so that's

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,239
often why we talk more about the difficult emotions the happiness and the joy that's an inherent part of practice

37
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,519
it's definitely a part of practice to himself just talks about this how they

38
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:09,599
are factors of Awakening joy and happiness so they're definitely part of it and they arise naturally so I don't

39
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,079
want to like say emotions and only focus on the difficult ones and not

40
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:20,840
acknowledge that's why there's so much beautiful the most beautiful experiences

41
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,120
of my life have definitely been associated with

42
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:33,000
meditation so but how can we how can we find Freedom with our emotions

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,600
recognizing that they're not going to disappear they're a part of our life our meditation life our daily life our work

44
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,880
life our personal life they're just a part of our life how can we find Freedom how can we

45
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:54,360
feel like we don't feel overwhelmed by them or to feel like we don't have to try to avoid them but instead to have

46
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:03,080
confidence okay I'm going to do this and then it's I'm probably I'm going to feel fear or I do feel fear but to find a way

47
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,599
to do it anyways have those difficult

48
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:15,039
conversations to be able to support somebody who's I often give this example

49
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:22,360
because it's uh it's really touching to be able I've had this experience a number of times to just hold the space

50
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,919
when somebody relates terrible diagnosis or a terrible breakup or you know

51
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:37,039
something that family member that's really just heartbreaking has happened to be able to just be with the

52
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:44,199
difficulty of that and not collapse and blame or somehow lash

53
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:50,919
out but to be some steadiness that then supports everybody else we shouldn't

54
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:56,000
underestimate how powerful that is like how different this world would be if

55
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,479
more and more of us could do this hold the difficulties

56
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:09,120
so in order to find Freedom with our emotions we don't get to say okay I'm

57
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:16,840
not going to have any instead the freedom is with our relationship to the

58
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:22,240
emotions how we respond how we react how we feel about

59
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,800
them the emotions will come and go because life brings us things we don't

60
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,919
get to choose that so practice is really about our

61
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:39,720
relationship and so often we don't even notice what our relationship is to an

62
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:47,319
emotion because we're overwhelmed with it and we're trying to push it away most

63
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:56,000
likely or manipulate it and change it or make it be different so there's two kind of like

64
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,879
categories this might be a gross simplification but some sometimes I like to do this just because it can be

65
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:08,319
helpful like little hooks or that we can hook some of our thoughts or ideas on so

66
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,560
might be like way we can understand like two categories of relationship to

67
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,000
emotions that we can work with maybe like two levers that uh we can pull or

68
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,720
dials we can twist one is to look at any

69
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:33,240
resistance we have and I'll talk about this more some of

70
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,199
this pushing away or turning away or I don't want to go

71
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,520
away right there's so many ways this shows up in our lives or two being

72
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,919
identified with it I'm angry I'm mad this means I'm an

73
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:57,639
angry person I shouldn't be an angry person I'm an angry person and maybe we beat up

74
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:03,120
on ourselves a little bit or maybe we have the sense because I'm angry then you know people are just going to

75
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,360
respond to me in this certain way or I can't go there because I'll lash out and they'll be angry or they're expecting me

76
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,759
to be mad or there's a way in which we can like take on these emotions as part

77
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:23,919
of our self-de the way that we view ourselves the way that we just think it's part of

78
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,960
who we are it's true its experiences we're

79
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:36,200
having we experiencing anger there's no denying that but it's sometimes what the meaning

80
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,719
we attach to it is where some of these there's this word levers or dials that

81
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,279
uh we can turn levers we can push with our relationship to

82
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:53,600
emotions our resistance and what the meaning we're making very often that

83
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,920
meaning is about what it means about us as a person the identification that we

84
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,360
have with us so this

85
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,360
shift from a away from identifying or making it mean something to just

86
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:17,720
recognizing instead of I'm

87
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:23,600
sad and then when we say that oh just I think naturally that comes along with a

88
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:30,320
statement like that is all the other times we've been sad and this fear that how long am I

89
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:35,560
going to be sad I don't want to be sad again and because I'm sad that means

90
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,600
that I can't do this or that or the other

91
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,519
thing especially these days right if you look on social media there's this False

92
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:53,480
Image that everybody's uh portraying writing putting online and we start to feel like oh I'm

93
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,079
isolated because my life doesn't look like that I have difficulties but you

94
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:08,519
you know of course nobody's putting that online so they're they have these false lives that are getting broadcast but

95
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:13,760
nevertheless so this shift away from thinking I'm

96
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:21,200
sad to sadness has arisen sadness is here

97
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:28,000
sadness feels like this and I know this is clunky language this isn't a way that we would normally

98
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,040
speak to ourselves or to others but I have found this is so

99
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:41,320
helpful just this little if we can remember right to make this little shift in the way that we just verbalize it to

100
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:48,480
ourselves to others sadness is here sadness is being experienced

101
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:55,399
sadness has arisen sadness feels heavy on my shoulders and I feel this pressure

102
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:01,519
behind my eyes like I'm going to cry then that kind of like undermines

103
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:07,279
all the story making and the meaning making and instead it just allows us to

104
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:13,079
honor the sadness to honor our

105
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:19,399
experience and to know it's like this sadness is like

106
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:27,240
this there's also a big shift that can happen when we think when we notice the

107
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:33,040
resistance resistance shows up in so many ways that can be subtle and we

108
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,480
don't even really notice it it can be this way if we find ourselves really

109
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,800
tangled up with a particular emotional experience

110
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:53,480
anger and we feel like we just can't get rid of the anger part of it is maybe there's some of this identification this

111
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,600
meaning remember this one time I was really angry this is years ago but I was

112
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:05,639
really angry but I had had have been that angry

113
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:11,360
I don't know for a long long long time and I was surprised by this all the energy that came with it and I kind of

114
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,199
liked it all of a sudden I felt really powerful and like wow but it turned out

115
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:22,399
to be so corrosive and really just

116
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:29,399
awful this was a good learning but there's a way in which maybe we have this me

117
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,480
that we're assigning like oh it makes me I'm powerful because I'm angry or

118
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:41,920
because makes me I can push people or things away but resistance also shows up in

119
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,399
subtle ways I'm sorry so part of what uh keeps

120
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:55,560
anger around can also be resistance it's like why am I angry I don't want to be angry I shouldn't be

121
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:02,519
angry especially often women get this message that we shouldn't be angry angry and then if we are like oh no I

122
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:08,800
hope I didn't they didn't see that or I may have to do some apologizing and I don't know how to apologize or I don't

123
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,880
want to apologize or all these things all this stuff that gets

124
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,199
uh Tangled Up I kind of like this word Tangled Up with the anchor I'm just

125
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:26,720
using angor as an example this could be sadness it could be fear any of these difficult

126
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,360
emotions but if we don't have resistance there can be a way like there could be this anger

127
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,600
arrives uh heat in the face maybe a sense of energy maybe a sense of like

128
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,279
kind of like this you know sense of power like oh or it could also be a

129
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:51,279
collapsing like oh I'm so mad but I don't want to be mad

130
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:59,279
but it just arises experience it acknowledge it and it passes away it's the nature of these

131
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:06,160
difficult emotions to do that so as a want to kind of like

132
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:13,560
support working with these difficult motions either with the meaning we're assigning to them or the resistance we

133
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:21,199
have to them and borrowing something that Gil did a couple of years ago

134
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:26,279
and of making some modifications I kind of liked what what

135
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:32,560
he offered and I'm altering it to for my purposes

136
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,800
here and he offered something to as a help work with

137
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:48,160
fear and I'm using fear as an example for any difficult emotion it's a way to work with fear and

138
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,319
the acronym f e a r

139
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:01,560
fear what is the first f is friend we I mean technically probably

140
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:09,160
would say bef friend but I guess now you can like click something that's like a friend or so to friend the

141
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:15,160
experience is there this way that we can stop pushing it

142
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:22,240
away right this is the opposite of being res having

143
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:29,920
resistance I'm sorry I'm remembering now that I lost my train of thought earlier I want to say a little bit more about

144
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:37,000
resistance I was saying that it can show up in subtle ways it shows up in one is like it's the prolongation of the

145
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,199
emotion but also is just some general avoidance a lot of avoidance and

146
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:49,720
avoidance shows up with just wanting to distract ourselves always picking up our phone or

147
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,759
always doing something other than what needs to be done is we're trying to

148
00:15:54,759 --> 00:16:00,480
avoid something and often what it is is is an uncomfortable experience

149
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:06,680
erience or maybe some ways of the way that we're resisting is just telling

150
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:11,759
ourselves like okay I just have to get awakened or something like this and I

151
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:19,800
have to have some more spiritual something and then all these emotions will go away we might have this

152
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:25,360
story it's true that the troubless or the difficulties of emotions go away but

153
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,519
Emotions Don't Go Away we don't stop becoming humans

154
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:35,959
so to friend this difficult emotion to friend fear is different

155
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:42,480
than being aversive different than being ashamed it's different than trying to

156
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,560
fix it it's a different than attacking the fear trying to make it go away it's

157
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:56,519
different than analyzing it trying to figure it out like when a child is afraid we don't

158
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:04,678
do all these things we don't yell at them more instead maybe we take them into our lap and hold

159
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:11,760
them Comfort them we pay attention to

160
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:19,240
them maybe caress them be a friend be a parent be a aunt uncle whatever

161
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:27,000
grandparent whatever our relationship is whatever is appropriate for them but to be

162
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:35,480
present for a child or that part of ourself that is having fear or is

163
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:41,799
sad is there a way that we can acknowledge it and respect

164
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:48,000
it so much about this practice is kind like becoming whole stopping the trying

165
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,039
the ways that we try to excise cut off parts of

166
00:17:53,039 --> 00:18:00,399
ourselves is there a way kind of like the fear feels s

167
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:09,640
safe to just be fear this isn't necessarily

168
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,679
easy but is there a way that we can acknowledge it's already

169
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:22,039
there and there is truth in this cute little saying that what we resist

170
00:18:22,039 --> 00:18:31,039
persists so just this recognition that okay there's fear here here sadness here

171
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:38,919
and there's there there's this way in which mindfulness practice we could say is all about this too is kind of like

172
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:45,799
meeting whatever is arising in our experience with some attention and some

173
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:52,200
care Jack cornfield now kind of talks about mindfulness as a loving awareness and so is there a way that we can bring

174
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:59,880
this loving awareness to this experience of this difficult emotion so f is

175
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:07,039
friend be friend e

176
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:12,559
explore there's lots of different ways we can explore one is additive feel in

177
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:19,880
the body this is a way to kind of like get into the present moment and to disrupt the momentum of the thinking

178
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:27,039
mind resisting mind it's also a way to create a little space between us and the

179
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:34,480
fear or or sadness or anger or anything that's difficult because if often if we

180
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,799
are like are collapsed into it and we're completely identified with it and we're just overwhelmed by let's say

181
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:47,880
fear then that's often happening in the um in the mind and in the body but

182
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:55,880
there's something that's happening in the mind that's kind of like a promoting it or supporting it so to explore how

183
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,679
does this feel in the body and even to ask that question is to

184
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:09,880
create a little space between what's been look at and the looker and that

185
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:14,919
little bit of space is where we can find some Freedom kind of like disrupts the

186
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:21,960
momentum also so to explore where how does this feel in the

187
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:28,480
body and this kind of maybe just this stance of exploration instead of trying

188
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:34,960
to push it away but instead of like curiosity what is this what's what's

189
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,158
going on not that we have to figure it

190
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:47,880
out the point is not to find answers the point is to

191
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,840
question and so this is so different than how we are usually in our daily life it's you know we're trying to find

192
00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:00,440
answers and figure things out of course we are it's fun to do that it's rewarding to do

193
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,399
that but is there a way to have the sense of

194
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,679
exploration so not only when we feel it in the body it also can help us to

195
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,080
clarify what is the fear versus what is the resistance to

196
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:23,520
the fear that might not always be clear maybe the fear is for example a lump in

197
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:29,520
the throat but not in the belly maybe there resistance is this

198
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,360
activation this sense of restlessness or energy want to jump up and run

199
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,440
away but maybe we it just starts to feel like a big jumble of

200
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:46,760
uncomfortableness but maybe we can explore what does Fear feel like what

201
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:54,000
does resistance feel like and maybe it's not immediately clear what the differences but again

202
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,200
it's the asking the question and to create this space around

203
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:06,880
the experience of fear disrupt the momentum because I'm talking about disrupting the momentum a lot of what

204
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:15,200
the momentum is doing is creating meaning because I'm afraid means that

205
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,320
I'm weak and I've always been weak and I was

206
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:26,440
hoping that this meditation practice would be better but now it's bringing up my fear and it's just making me feel

207
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:33,440
worse or you know there's all these things that we could do all the thoughts that could happen in our

208
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:40,360
minds so this exploration how does it feel in the body the fear and the

209
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:49,360
resistance it's also to turn towards the object of the fear what is it that we're

210
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,799
afraid of part of that this question of what is

211
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:01,480
it that we're afraid of is to recognize that some fear is appropriate there's of course if we're

212
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:07,200
in imminent danger or we expect that it's

213
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:14,440
dangerous some of it is maybe it's uh maybe I'll stick with appropriate it's

214
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:20,880
appropriate to fear that we may harm ourselves we may harm others or we may

215
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,200
harm our integrity do something that uh makes us not feel so good about

216
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,799
ourselves that we regret but there's also this kind of

217
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:40,960
like fear or that's unhealthy that like uh diminishes the quality of our life or

218
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:47,520
keeps us from living a full life or causes us to lash out and harm

219
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,360
others and then of course there's some fear that we can't I've tried probably

220
00:23:54,360 --> 00:24:02,120
all of you have tried too to talk myself out of a fear ears that aren't quite logical but I just have them

221
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:08,880
anyways there's something about I have this fear I don't really like to do this I

222
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:15,279
I'm getting better I can do this but I don't really like to cross the street not in a

223
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:21,159
crosswalk I kind of have like this memory of been yelled at I think this you know when I was I don't know you

224
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:27,080
know five years old like don't cross the street and so now I always feel like oh

225
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:32,720
my gosh I have to be a crosswalk or something even though I'm I'm an adult and I can look both ways you know all

226
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:39,240
this stuff but but even though I try to just uh talk myself like d you shouldn't

227
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,640
be afraid I can do it but there's still that little uncomfortableness it's just

228
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,960
we all have these things some of my friends tease me about

229
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,080
it and some of my friends are just like we just it doesn't matter Dana we are

230
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:04,158
crossing here they just force me to do it it's okay right I haven't been run over

231
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:11,000
yet but there's this way in which we so we might re when we look towards the object of the

232
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:19,080
fear we might know some is healthy and appropriate I don't want to like demonize all fear and but also some of

233
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:25,120
it is some anxiety and we can't talk ourselves out of

234
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:31,480
it sometimes we can sometimes we might notice if we really look at the object

235
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:38,360
we kind of explore the object we see oh this maybe isn't helpful and there's a way in which we

236
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:45,440
can it can release not always not always but this exploration

237
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:51,240
is about our experience and the

238
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:56,679
object but here's something that's maybe I'll add this there's

239
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:01,919
a way in which I me to ask what we're

240
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:09,799
afraid of is also a way that we're kind of respecting the fear or respecting the

241
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:17,240
anger instead of being just dismissive of it or chastising ourselves to kind of like say okay what

242
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:23,679
is the object it's to acknowledge oh yeah the fear the anger the sadness is

243
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:29,600
here let's explore it let's not ignore it

244
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:38,559
but here's something that can be really helpful and it's not necessarily easy to

245
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:44,840
do but to explore look for what is it

246
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:54,679
that feels threatened what inside of me feels

247
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:59,600
threatened what is it

248
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,120
because sometimes it doesn't have a real

249
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:14,120
basis for example we might have these underlying beliefs that we don't really owledge and

250
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,960
these beliefs are what's underneath the fear for

251
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:25,200
example we might have this belief everybody has to like

252
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,519
me all the time

253
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:36,000
everybody and then where there's fear is like oh I don't want to do that because

254
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:42,200
they won't like it and they may not like me I don't want to say no even though it's crossing a boundary or I actually

255
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:47,640
can't even do that I would have to stay up late and not get enough sleep or you

256
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:53,120
know something like this if they somebody asks us to do something extra that we feel like we just can't really

257
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,519
put on our plate but we do it anyways so what is it that feels

258
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:05,559
threatened maybe this view we have about ourselves I always have to be the wise funny one and then oh I'm afraid that

259
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:12,919
they won't think that I'm wise if I say that or if I go or don't go or all these views we have about ourselves these

260
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:21,960
often they're hidden so in fear and anger and

261
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,840
sadness there's this way in which this exploration the E of exploration is to

262
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:34,159
kind of like turn around and look what is it that's feels

263
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:41,159
threatened sometimes anger is this what feels threatened too sometimes sadness is also what something feels threatened

264
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:47,120
so to explore is like the physical experience explore the object what is it

265
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:53,960
that we're afraid of and then to explore like what is the what is it that feels

266
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,399
threatened what's fearing

267
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:04,799
because we might discover that these are just bits of our imagination Concepts

268
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:11,320
ideas constructs ideas that we have about ourself but you know they're ephemeral

269
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:16,799
they're not real they're just ideas thoughts

270
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:22,240
Notions we may have gotten them you know by a sincere method you know through our

271
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:28,039
culture our family but they're not tangible things

272
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:35,480
that can't that will always be there that can't change morph go

273
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:42,320
away and in some ways that which feels threatened is just another

274
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,240
identity sometimes we get identified with the fear but if we're not identified with

275
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:56,320
the fear there might be another identity that um is fearing feeling

276
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,399
fearful so what are what are I maybe an easier

277
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:08,600
way to think about it's like the meaning making that's happening here is there's this way that we

278
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:15,039
can explore like what's our what's underneath this what kind of beliefs or

279
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:25,360
Notions or ideas we have friend explore A is for

280
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:35,039
allow allow we could says to notice the resistance and as best we can to soften

281
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:40,440
it allow also means to notice the identification the way that we think it

282
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,919
means something about us can we soften that and just recognize

283
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:53,799
nope this is just an experience the fear is here but I am not I am not the

284
00:30:54,639 --> 00:31:02,960
fear so this idea of allow if the fear is very strong it can be wise not to just jump

285
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:09,679
right into it instead maybe just do it very short bouts to feel it and then to

286
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,880
back away so not to explore it or to allow it for a long bouts because

287
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,720
there's a way if there's lot of any strong emotion it'll just tip us into overwhelm and that's not the direction

288
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:27,240
we want to go because we don't have access to our wisdom and tools and

289
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:34,039
wherewith all when we're in overwhelm so especially with really strong things just to touch into them

290
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:40,080
allow them friend them explore them maybe just for a short bit and then back

291
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:45,639
away pull away come back another day another

292
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:53,159
time slowly approach and back off if you're in meditation and like

293
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:59,120
you're something like a strong emotion comes up one thing you can do is just open your

294
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,760
eyes and maybe still stay in the meditation posture but Open the eyes and

295
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:10,039
like look straight ahead and then like kind of Orient yes okay I'm here in this

296
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:17,360
room and I'm sitting I can feel the pressure against my body I'm here and that can be a way in which can

297
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:22,600
help interrupt that and help us to feel more stabilized if you can continue

298
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,960
meditating maybe keep your eyes open as a way to

299
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,480
kind of like is it one way to like back

300
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:40,159
off but there's a way this uh movement of allowing like inherent in this is

301
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:48,360
this sense of trusting trusting that our inner life knows how to take care of

302
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:55,000
itself we don't have to make it be different we don't have to fix

303
00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:04,320
it it's impressive what can happen if we make room for things to unfold on their

304
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:09,760
own it's not always easy to do this right because there's this way in which

305
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:15,600
we it's we're in the unknown territory perhaps and it feels

306
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:23,840
uncomfortable but as best we can to allow it is to allow this unfolding which

307
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:30,960
often is the often not what we're expecting and is maybe the most beautiful thing

308
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:37,600
that can happen there's a metabolism that can happen in a different

309
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,960
way friend explore

310
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:48,919
allow maybe I'll say something about allow also is that you know not all

311
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:54,279
fears are going to go away we have existential fears as part

312
00:33:54,279 --> 00:34:00,000
of The Human Experience maybe that goes away I don't know but I

313
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,760
think it's you know it's a big deal to have this kind of fear of death for many of us it's not front of

314
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,720
mind but it's there right when we're afraid when we're in a situation which

315
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:20,158
we might die soon or or fear that we have when a loved one

316
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:27,520
is doing something dangerous so this allowing

317
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:33,000
is part of learning to be with what

318
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:39,280
is not making it go away cuz maybe it's not going to go away but can it not get

319
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,760
in our way and we can practice with this with

320
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:52,398
small things with small discomforts for me I started I didn't

321
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:58,000
know this was practice for allowing discomfort but turn out to be great practice

322
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,520
I used to do um some yoga Yin Yoga some of you might know about this where you

323
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:10,920
take a posture and you hold it for a long time in the beginning the posture is perfectly fine but then you know

324
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,160
after 2 minutes 3 minutes four minutes it starts to become uncomfortable and

325
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:24,240
you do this a way in which you're not hurting or damaging yourself in any way but just to like just to stay stay even

326
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:30,520
though it was physically uncomfortable just really gave me a lot of confidence that kind of bled out into other areas

327
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:36,160
of my life to be with difficult emotions difficult uh Sensations and other

328
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:41,240
ways so maybe that's something kind of like this

329
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:47,359
allowing and then the r released and I'm saying this kind of

330
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:52,839
as a past tense released as the as opposed

331
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:58,200
to an imperative release let go of if you could do that you wouldn't

332
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:03,880
need all these other steps right you would have just let go of it and you would have gone on your Merry

333
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:11,960
way but what happens here actually I'm saying released as maybe as

334
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:17,079
a past participle I guess or something like this so I don't want to give the

335
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:22,839
impression that you have to do something but what happens is if we

336
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:30,760
shift our relationship with the identific ation the meaning making or our

337
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:37,960
resistance the fear just gets released on its own as its

338
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,359
nature so as the resistance abates the fear abates or the difficulty abates or

339
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:52,960
as the identification with it the getting all tangled up with it as that starts to soften or abates then the

340
00:36:52,960 --> 00:37:01,720
emotion intensity softens and abates so R is for released when or maybe when

341
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:10,359
we look around and we see that excuse me that which is uh feels threatened like

342
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:16,000
oh yeah maybe that was just an underlying belief that was just a belief and doesn't have any

343
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
substance maybe when we realize that then the fear is

344
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,880
released so there's these ways in which if we work with the Rel relationship

345
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:34,000
with the fear maybe I should make that that or be about relationship to

346
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:40,839
fear released relationship but the the key to release is to working with the

347
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:46,520
relationship because if we're trying to get rid of the emotion itself there's a way in

348
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:53,400
which it's like the Torah baby right we push it with our hands and we get stuck

349
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,119
so then we try to push away with our feet and now our hands and our feet are stuck then we try to push it with our

350
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:05,040
head and then our hands feet and head are stuck but if we work with our

351
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:14,800
relationship to it I used f a AR friend explore allow

352
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,240
released as an acronym maybe doesn't happen in that

353
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:28,119
order maybe it's not just fear anger or sadness just is a way for us to work

354
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:35,280
with our relationship to difficult emotions so that we can find Freedom with them so that when emotions arise

355
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,880
they don't have to be a problem it's just what's happening at that

356
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:47,359
moment and I'll stop there and I'll open it up to see if there are some questions

357
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,160
or comments thank

358
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,520
you

359
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:13,640
I I went to school in San Francisco and I was always afraid of jaywalk in San Francisco too because it's so loud and the hills you can't see if cars are

360
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:19,440
coming over but in San Jose it's no problem where I'm from I'm talking about the the fear and so I think like

361
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,800
emotions are are normal and I I sometimes think of like my friends I have you know friends who might have the

362
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,920
whole Gambit of emotions but for me myself I I think um when I notice it

363
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:35,560
coming up like oh no I've been here before this is not good or I don't like this fing or that feeling that's

364
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:41,560
probably the part that might throw me off and then I'll try and Monday night quarterback after I'm like I didn't do

365
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:48,200
well or I could have done better in this area or whatnot but so I don't know if it's maybe a more practice thing or what

366
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:54,240
would you probably can you tell me a little bit more about what does the Monday night quarterbacking feel like or

367
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,920
like what are what's the nature of that is it a what's the tone what's the attitude is it like so so like afterward

368
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,960
when I'm debriefing with myself or with somebody who I might call an expert like you know I'll go to Buddy and what would

369
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,359
you have done in this situation like oh my goodness I I totally messed that one up or foot and mouth syndrome or

370
00:40:10,359 --> 00:40:15,640
something like that but I'm more hard on myself kind of afterwards or something

371
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:21,839
so it's not so on the the the afterwards it's not about saying like oh

372
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:27,480
okay I see that that was kind of triggered but I couldn't figure it out okay well maybe next time or is it a t

373
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:34,560
like oh dang it I'm never G to get this I'm always doing this probably the more extreme one that that points out yeah so

374
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:41,280
common right this kind like the inner critic gets activated when we're trying to make some changes in our behaviors or

375
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:48,119
the way that we show up there a few things we can do one is when you find your so you have a difficult emotion and

376
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:53,440
maybe you get all tangled up and then later you kind of like do a postmortem

377
00:40:53,440 --> 00:41:02,400
right or Monday Morning Quarterback or whatever it is this kind of thing um to look at it one and then after that

378
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:09,520
to recognize oh I'm trying to make changes and it takes time I'm trying to

379
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:15,119
do something different it takes time because that is to help with the inner

380
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:20,440
critic because the inner critic just that's just another way of resistance or

381
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,640
it's just another form of getting all tingled up but there's a way that we can

382
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:31,640
soften the inner critic say yeah of course I had difficulties and then the inner critic

383
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:37,160
arose oh yeah of course it takes time it and we have to see these things over and

384
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:43,440
over again but unless we can get to this softer place where we where the inner

385
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,839
critic is soft then we'll just keep on doing this over and over because the inner critic

386
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:54,599
is the form that resistance is showing up to soften the resistance to say is to

387
00:41:54,599 --> 00:42:02,240
be like oh okay yeah that's yeah I see how this is a pattern I have H well I know it takes time to undo

388
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,560
patterns let's see what I do next time you know to really have a different shift a different attitude maybe is that

389
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,319
is that helpful makes sense yes thank

390
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,560
you anybody anybody else have a comment or

391
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:32,680
question okay well may you not have any fear when

392
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:38,720
you're like walking out to your car even if you have to cross the street and I'm wishing you all a lovely

393
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:45,640
evening thank you
