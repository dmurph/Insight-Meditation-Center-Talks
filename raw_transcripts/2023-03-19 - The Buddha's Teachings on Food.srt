1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:11,760
good morning everyone and welcome can you hear me okay here

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:17,520
and uh welcome to those of you online and uh it feels very

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,800
I don't know it feels very encouraging to know their people participating in

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,080
from all over and online and

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,980
so the Buddha

6
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,739
used a lot of ordinary Concepts ordinary activities as

7
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:48,239
metaphors for to for the spiritual practice and teachings that he had

8
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:55,460
and so for example the word that's often translated into English as craving

9
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:02,520
literally means thirst so thirst was the kind of the metaphor for human craving

10
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:09,180
the word for grasping is the word for fuel like the fuel of

11
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:15,659
Fire and somehow or clinging is the few and somehow like a flame somehow clings to

12
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:22,560
the wood that it's burning and so the fuel for so uh and so there happens to be

13
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,680
that both the clinging and the word fuel are synonymous and so it's a wonderful

14
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,220
idea that clinging is the fuel for more clinging

15
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,479
so another very common idea that the Buddha borrowed to make is a metaphor

16
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,640
for the psychological life event mental life is the idea of food

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,820
and that we have food that we can feed our mental life

18
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,340
but we have to be careful what food we feed it some food is detrimental

19
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:01,500
gives you indigestion and some food helps you to thrive

20
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:09,599
so to be able to know what kind of food that we're taking in psychologically mentally is actually quite helpful

21
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,540
so to that's what the topic is today is the Buddha's teachings on food

22
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,940
and um but this is a kind of metaphoric use of the word

23
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,480
and so to start I want to tell a somewhat famous

24
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,180
Japanese Buddhist story that uh

25
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:39,540
kind of apply in a particular way so there's a story of a

26
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:45,360
some kind of erudite academic scholar who comes

27
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,500
who's maybe a great scholar on the philosophy of Buddhism and he goes to see a Zen master to have

28
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:58,680
a Dharma discussion about things and so there's a message well come and have tea

29
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,800
and so they're sitting together and the Zen master ends this academic hands

30
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,319
the academic an empty cup of tea and then he grabs a teapot to pour the tea

31
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,379
into the cup and when the cup is full of tea

32
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:21,420
the the Zen master does not stop pouring the tea

33
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,300
and so it's a tea starts pouring out and the academic said stop stop the cup

34
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:34,920
is full can't take anymore in the Zen master then stops and he says well in the same way you're so full of

35
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,920
your knowledge that you're coming here you can't there's no room for more

36
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,519
so whether that's fair for the the academic or not I don't know

37
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:52,319
but uh certainly it's possible and I actually came to a not a zen

38
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,720
master but many years ago I came to my Burmese teacher upandita and I had all

39
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,379
these questions I wanted to get down to the bottom of something and I probably had a little bit of opinion so I was trying to move the move the conversation

40
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:09,780
in a particular way and at some point he stopped and looked at me and said Gil

41
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:14,959
are you here for your own opinions or to learn something

42
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,459
so um so um

43
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:29,820
so the food we eat can fill us but how it fills us is very

44
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,820
significant there are some mental food that we take in that fills us so there's

45
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:43,560
no more room for anything else and then there's other kinds of food that we take in psychological food

46
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:49,860
that actually has the opposite effect it actually creates more space for more

47
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:56,100
a feeling of abundance happens when we take in this food and then that abundance there's room for all kinds of

48
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:02,580
things so for example if a person is filled with desire

49
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,740
for a particular person maybe it's sexual desire of a particular person

50
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:14,280
and they say you know I really love that person you know but really the love is wanting the person more than I don't

51
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:20,400
know genuine kind of Goodwill or appreciation

52
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,520
and it's possible that that sexual desire is so strong that there's not there's no room for

53
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,400
anything else that's what the person's thinking about they're wanting and and if anybody stands in the way they're

54
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,919
hardly noticed and you know and someone asked them a question and they

55
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,680
hardly hear the question because they're consumed by this desire

56
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:50,520
on the other hand if a person is um has just a tremendous appreciation

57
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:57,240
for someone and and Goodwill that has space for the person to be who

58
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:04,080
they are then there's also space for other people the mind is not narrowed and caught up

59
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,180
in particular desire but rather is taking in a broad

60
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:14,759
appreciation that has an opening feeling it opens the heart expands the mind

61
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:21,419
and so but both of those are kinds of food the sexual desire thing

62
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:27,000
can feed more sexual desire one way that sometimes works is that

63
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,039
sometimes desire like that maybe comes from a feeling of discontent and maybe

64
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:38,520
loneliness and paradoxically being pouring yourself into sexual desire at the expense of

65
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:45,720
everything else is a kind of alienation from oneself and so it kind of adds to the alienation

66
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:52,259
adds to the dissatisfaction that kind of the desire is supposed to kind of this wage

67
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:58,199
so the same thing with alcohol there are all kinds of desires that people are addicted to that they kind of feel

68
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:03,840
something temporarily but they don't really you know they feel something that doesn't let other things in but it

69
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,940
leaves something empty there's other things that fills us

70
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,520
nicely and but rather than filling us so that we're

71
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:22,560
there's no space for anything else it actually makes us more expensive more more wonderfully available and empty

72
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:28,199
so in the teachings of the Buddha he gave he talked about these two forces

73
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,300
the food that leads to indigestion or food that leads to kind

74
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,699
of to our detriment and the food that leads to our betterment the food that can actually be

75
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:45,660
beneficial to have in this practice and these two different processes he

76
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:50,880
summarized in a teaching called the five hindrances

77
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:57,660
and the positive is the five the seven factors of Awakening and he would often hold the two together

78
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:04,319
you know teach the two together almost like one is the antidote for the other or the opposite the other

79
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:11,940
so he said that uh the food for sensual desire

80
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:18,120
is obsessing about what's attractive so somehow looking at what's attractive

81
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:25,620
all the time that's what we focus on and so some you know with our media that

82
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:33,000
we have if you're spending a lot of time looking at media looking at advertisements for I don't know what

83
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,779
you know you know beautiful cars

84
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:44,760
then I can imagine that then after a while that there's more and more desire for beautiful cars and they don't notice

85
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:53,480
anything else I was a little bit kind of surprised at myself kind of it was very I thought

86
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:00,420
indicative of how this food thing can happen unconsciously so when I first moved to the peninsula

87
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:07,440
here in over 33 years ago I had been given an old Toyota Celica

88
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,399
some of you know what that was it was happily read and um but it was you know it was 14

89
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,880
years old by the time I got it and so it was kind of old and and uh and I was very happy and content with it was given

90
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,160
to me and so I was driving around and I would drive around I used to teach in Palo

91
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,560
Alto this group and so I'd go there for dinner before I taught Monday nights and stuff

92
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:38,940
and that was happily going along with my old soap metal car and then but in Palo Alto back then even

93
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:46,860
then there weren't many old cars there were a lot of new cars

94
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:53,640
and after doing some years of driving around I think it took some years maybe the food came in kind of slow

95
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,800
but maybe after about five or six years of doing this

96
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,560
um I start maybe even more but I started noticing

97
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:12,440
so that by time my car my car was 20 years old and um I noticed that um

98
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:20,480
I started having new car thoughts you know it'd be nice to have a new car

99
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,220
and and before that I was always I would have gone any any car would do or you know I would have been happy to get a

100
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:33,120
used car why buy a new car and but I think I was slowly being influenced by what I saw every day

101
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,880
it was coming in oh this is what you do or to fit in and fit into the crowd or something you should have a new car

102
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,920
something like that and I was like I was like wow look at that Gail where did that come from

103
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,640
and that was happening unconsciously what if I got home and spend you know every waking hours you know searching

104
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:56,880
for magazine back then or you know the web and like to look at cars and look at that car and

105
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,339
and um you know it would probably would if it could affect someone especially that desire is kind of feeding and

106
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:09,420
feeding and feeding something so they would also said ill will

107
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,459
hostility is fed by looking at what you're

108
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:20,399
repulsed by if you're repulsed by something and really feel kind of like off by

109
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,800
something if you then go on the web to really you know search for all the

110
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:32,399
instances of things you're repulsed by you know what is that going to do to you that's going to feed something feed

111
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:39,060
something feed something and so I think that in some ways that happens with politics

112
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:47,519
people are repulsed by the opposition about how terrible they are how awful it is but there's a drive to keep renewing

113
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:54,540
that and studying it and seeing it and so the hostility then builds and builds and builds and some of that you know

114
00:11:54,540 --> 00:12:02,480
it's a kind of unconsciously building it just becomes kind of like isn't this ordinary it's normal to be this way

115
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:10,380
sloth and torpor which is not a uh just being tired or fatigued is a kind of

116
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:17,120
deep weariness of the mind that psychological in its root resistance

117
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,060
kind of giving up the sloth and torpora has food

118
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:30,660
and sometimes it can be posture to give in to sloth and torper

119
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:36,839
posteriorly then maybe the you know and you stay home and you just kind of hang out and

120
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,060
just watch more and more TV and uh you know if something begins to sink

121
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:48,800
and and you know the Energy starts to drain and there's more of the sloth and torpor

122
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:55,260
uh restlessness agitation is the feeding for that is being

123
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:02,160
unsettled according to the Buddha the word is unsettled are agitated and um and how you know

124
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,459
I've seen this in myself is that if I'm Restless or agitated I'm activated in a

125
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:15,180
certain way and for me I get activated kind of upward Direction it kind of goes up into my upper torso into my head I'm

126
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:20,880
kind of like you know like activated and so I'm unsettled

127
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:28,920
and so if I keep focusing on that feeling of agitation the feeling of you know with restlessness it kind of feeds

128
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:34,620
itself like something's wrong and then oh yes something is definitely wrong because I feel it's wrong

129
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:41,880
and then it gets even more wrong there's something you know off so so if I focus on that feeling of

130
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:47,040
agitation it tends to feed more of its aim

131
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,700
doubt is the same way that that doubt and focusing on what we don't understand

132
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:59,000
focusing on how we don't understand uh can be a little bit of addiction for people because

133
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,100
there's a assumption that only by understanding can be we be safe or get ahead in life

134
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:13,220
and so we keep focused noticing how much we don't understand so we can't be safe and then doubt kind of spirals

135
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:21,740
on the other hand and this is where I think it gets the most interesting is we can be fed by healthy things

136
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:27,720
spiritually healthy dharmically healthy phenomenon and that's what the seven factors of

137
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:33,420
Awakening are and they don't close us down they don't fill us in a way so we have no space for

138
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:39,660
something else but rather they open us so there's much

139
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:46,500
more space and it's part of the Delight of these seven factors is it gives a kind of Independence to the inner life

140
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:54,720
where there's room and to not be caught there's a space to not be caught by things that are usually caught by

141
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,120
and so the Buddha said that the food for mindfulness

142
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,639
are the are the objects of mindfulness

143
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:13,079
and that could be any object of mindfulness but when we see something as an object to be mindful of then we're

144
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:18,540
establishing a different kind of relationship to it than if we're not mindful

145
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:25,920
so an example might be that I really want a new car like that's like that's

146
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,500
going to be the key to a happy successful life and that's what it takes

147
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,720
and so I'm really you know zeroed in on this new car thing

148
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:43,079
um so what's the proper object for mindfulness it's not

149
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:48,779
the cars rather it's the desire I have for the cars

150
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:54,120
and as soon as I bring clear mindfulness to the desire then now there's space

151
00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:01,380
there's a kind of the mindfulness the clear mindfulness has a quality of of of spaciousness a little bit of healthy

152
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:09,540
distance and independence from what we're focusing on so to have a clear sense of how to and

153
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:15,959
what to have as the object of mindfulness and what mindfulness is that's different than being absorbed in

154
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:22,800
what I want it's oh it's the desire look at that desire and then specifically for the Buddha

155
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,019
there's four general areas where mindfulness can be focused on that's

156
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:36,480
really supportive this Independence is freedom is uh the body mindfulness of the body

157
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:43,199
that's the object so if I have desire for car and I'm really agitated around I have to

158
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:49,980
have it then how does that you know let's be mindful of how that feels in the body

159
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:57,720
so it's turning the attention away from the desire of the car 180 degrees to feel what it's like in a

160
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:03,839
physically to have that desire or to have that hate or to have that

161
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:10,500
restlessness whatever it might be and it's I feel it physically I feel the agitation I feel the contraction the

162
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:18,780
tension that I carry and to have that wonderful connection of knowing and seeing agitation tension in

163
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:24,780
the body but in a mindfulness which is a little bit independent as spacious allows it to

164
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:31,799
be there that gives room for the body to begin to relax because the mind is no longer caught up

165
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:37,980
in the desire it's now involved with the mindfulness of the desire that part of the physical

166
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,620
and that allows something to relax to feel the pleasant and unpleasantness

167
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:49,919
of the experience there's another object for mindfulness so I have this desire for the car

168
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,260
and someone says is that Pleasant oh yeah that's so pleasant those cars are so great

169
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:02,700
but if I do 180 degree turn to really feel the direct living experience here

170
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:09,539
the cars are still Pleasant but my desire is not the tension around wanting and searching

171
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:15,720
and deciding between the cars it's um there's a lot of unpleasantness here

172
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:23,100
then wow I had no idea how unpleasant this so anger hostility can have a certain

173
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:28,620
pleasure to it but if we really turn deeply and feel to what it's like we see

174
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:34,380
how harmful it is to the person who is hostile so you've oh wait a minute this is

175
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:40,559
terrible I'm doing this to myself and then there's the Mind state

176
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:46,799
to be aware of what is a state of mind that's operating and again this is to be aware of the I

177
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:53,880
like to call it the quality of your inner life rather than mind State what's the quality of your inner life

178
00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:00,539
when you're Desiring a new car and caught up in it and you feel like the new the inner desire the quality in your

179
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:05,820
life is not so pristine it's not so beautiful it's not so spacious it's not

180
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:11,640
expensive it's not the feeling of abundance it's the opposite I feel like I lack

181
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,740
feel that you know that um you know tight constricted of wanting there's no

182
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:22,320
room for things in that space and then the fourth Foundation is to

183
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:28,260
start understanding some of the mental processes at work understanding the hindrances that are

184
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:34,620
there understanding the some factors of Awakening which is kind of makes this whole thing then repetitive and repeats

185
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:40,039
itself so the first of the seven factors of Awakening is mindfulness

186
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:45,179
and that's when the object of mindfulness support more mindfulness

187
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:52,740
because it's satisfying to have this kind of wonderful attention that's not locked in it's not

188
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:58,679
caught as that attention is there is what's called usually called

189
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:06,900
investigation and but what it literally means is distinct the process of the mind making

190
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:14,520
healthy distinctions and so if you um

191
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:19,740
if you're able to see all this carefully then you can make the distinction oh

192
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:26,480
this activity wanting to have a new card such an addicted way

193
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,280
that's very different than being mindful of the desire

194
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:39,240
seeing that distinction is really helpful because then there's a chance for you to

195
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:45,720
choose the one that feels better for you if you don't see that distinction don't you might as well continue thinking

196
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:52,679
about the car so being able to distinguish options in the present moment oh this opens me up

197
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:58,919
this closes me down this has an ouch in it this has an ah in it this feels good

198
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:05,660
be able to make these very simple distinctions and then to choose which distinction

199
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:12,059
encourages more of making these distinctions mindfulness perceives it more and more we become experts we

200
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:19,440
become skilled at seeing what is harmful and what is not what is wholesome and what is not and this in Buddhism is

201
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:25,799
considered to be an invaluable skill to develop to really tune into the moment

202
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:31,679
and have the agency to see and have the agency over what is a wholesome and

203
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:39,059
unwholesome what is gives indigestion and what kind of creates some help for you

204
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:45,120
and it isn't like a lot of analysis that's involved it's a product of having it just clear

205
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:51,360
mindfulness of the moment the mindfulness reveals kind of oh

206
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,640
that's tense this is not tense this feels

207
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:03,419
kind of supportive this doesn't feel supportive with that agency with that seeing then

208
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:09,240
there's the third found factor of Awakening which is engagement energy

209
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,940
this is where agency comes into a play and this is where we see I think I'm

210
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:21,299
going to choose the mindfulness over preoccupation with a car

211
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:26,340
there is a choice involved I'm going to engage over here

212
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,500
and having that choice um

213
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:37,500
supports more choices supporting a choice that brings energy

214
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:43,320
that brings engagement that brings a kind of this is this feels good

215
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:49,320
if we keep making choices to make us feel bad then we're going to kind of kind of

216
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:54,360
spiral down and become lethargic and become discouraged and all kinds of things

217
00:22:54,360 --> 00:23:02,520
so there is something very important in psychologically for us that we feed ourselves with good choices

218
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:08,460
and that can be you know macro level but it's also this micro level of the Mind

219
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:14,880
and it can be as simple as choosing to be mindful feels much better to be mindful of this

220
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:22,860
than the alternative that it leads to the fourth factor of

221
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:30,240
Awakening which is joy and that as we learn to make choices to

222
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:36,720
go towards the wholesome Moment by moment this is good this feels good be mindful here be mindful here this feels

223
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:44,220
good it's kind of like this yes begins appearing yes yes it feels good yes here

224
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,500
here yes yes we see the difference between a Horseman

225
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:55,260
and wholesome that's oh yes that's so great to see this difference yes

226
00:23:55,260 --> 00:24:01,559
choose the whole small yeah that feels nice and so the joys is kind of the quality of yes

227
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:07,679
and that and that yes that that recognizing what's joyful is a food for

228
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,860
more joy the next factor of Awakening is

229
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:20,220
tranquility with enough Joy something inside of us can begin to settle

230
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:27,179
and here the Buddha said the food for tranquility is more tranquility

231
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:35,039
and how I understand that I've come to appreciate this is that if you feel like Tranquility is useful

232
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:41,940
it's a nice thing notice the Tranquility that's always already here

233
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:47,820
can you find inside of yourself some reference point for tranquility

234
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:53,700
I could be inflamed if inflamed around what kind of

235
00:24:53,700 --> 00:25:00,780
car to buy the new car that I'm supposed to get and then then a friend of mine says Gil

236
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:07,320
you don't have much tranquility you know yeah Tranquility might be nice for you and I I don't I don't know

237
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:14,159
anything about tranquility and then first my friend says I just look out the window

238
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:20,039
it's a beautiful spring day out there it's uh it's it's a look out you see

239
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:25,799
look at the street it's so calm and peaceful and I look oh look at that yeah it is tranquil

240
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:30,900
in fact my butt on the couch feels tranquility

241
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:37,620
and then slowly you know my friend turns on tranquil music

242
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:43,020
and then something inside of me Settles Tranquility is the food for more tranquility

243
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:48,360
if we stay in Restless agitated mode that's the food for more restlessness

244
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,760
and agitation so this shift and that's also where this this second

245
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,240
factor of Awakening of this ability to distinguish oh that this is the path towards being

246
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:07,640
Restless this is a path to being a little more tranquil is so useful yes to that

247
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:13,020
the next factor of Awakening is samadhi concentration

248
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:19,140
and here the food for this deeper concentration unification of Mind deeper

249
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:24,179
meditative meditative States and all that is something the Buddha calls the

250
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:31,940
evidence the sign the evidence for concentration the evidence for being

251
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:38,760
concentrated or settled or Unified

252
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:45,000
as people develop concentration in meditation there are symptoms of those concentrated

253
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,760
states that appear if some of those are physical something begins shifting and changing in the body

254
00:26:50,760 --> 00:27:00,360
the body feels more unified there might be a kind of nice feeling of of Tranquility a glow a warmth the

255
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,940
breathing can start for some people can start feeling quite beautiful they're like oh this breathing is so

256
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:11,400
great it doesn't feel like a beautiful feeling but sometimes there's a tingling that

257
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,500
begins happening in the body some people see white light they might see these are

258
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:22,020
all symptoms of the mind getting calm and subtle then concentrated

259
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:29,340
as we take in the symptoms of concentration they become the food for more concentration

260
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:36,659
to recognize the very things that are happening as we get concentrated is the support for letting you know the mind

261
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:43,080
getting interested or focused or gathered together around this good things that are happening so it gets

262
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:49,140
more and more settled more and more focused and then the seventh factor of working

263
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:56,220
is equanimity and here like with Tranquility Equanimity is a food for Equanimity the

264
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:01,580
so if you're not if you have no Equanimity then good luck

265
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:09,120
but if you have some Equanimity and remember this is seven factors of Awakening so it comes on the uh it

266
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:15,480
follows these first seven so they kind of build on each other starting with mindfulness so you might not have

267
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:22,860
Equanimity at first but as you keep practicing it starts to come and but when it comes

268
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:30,539
pay attention to it take it in let it register because the Equanimity is the food for

269
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:36,000
equanimity so one of the things that I think is

270
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,820
quite marvelous about this kind of teaching is you don't have to understand the

271
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:47,520
cause of your suffering you don't have to analyze yourself to no end

272
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:54,659
you don't necessarily have to fix the other people in your household or in the world around you

273
00:28:54,659 --> 00:29:03,480
that they have become better so you can be good it's all about turning in and being fed

274
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:10,440
and supportive by something that's available in making these simple distinctions here for

275
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:16,140
yourself in your own psychology and your own mental engagement with the world

276
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:22,380
and it begins by making the distinction between being Mindful and not mindful

277
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:29,039
and as we learn to be more and more mindful we start seeing that distinction and it makes a world of difference to

278
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:36,360
really recognize it to know when you're Mindful and when you're kind of like just absorbed and lost in the experience

279
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:43,440
it can make a huge difference the other day I was at kind of I was

280
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:51,299
every once in a while have something I think of a little bit like a headache a migraine and it wasn't so bad last time but uh I

281
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:58,799
started feeling kind of I feel strange in my stomach and I get really hungry but I'm full and I

282
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:05,820
get this headache and it's kind of a drag but you know I've learned to be mindful on it and there's a way of being mindful

283
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:13,380
as I feel like I'm not identified with it it's like it's almost like it's not me but it is me I'm not like pretending

284
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:20,700
it's not but there's a in when a mindfulness like this independent through space it's almost as if who I am

285
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:27,480
is the mindfulness not these difficult feelings if I'm not mindful I could feel I could

286
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:34,919
feel a few days ago I could feel it sometimes almost like my identity sunk into those feelings like that's who I

287
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:42,360
was and there was a world of difference between that's who I am versus this is what I'm mindful of

288
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,760
and just felt you know so much easier to go through life this way through just this I'm mindful of this okay this is

289
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,340
what's happening and and I'm not identified I'm not lost or absorbed in it

290
00:30:53,340 --> 00:31:01,679
but there's this place of freedom or Independence that's there at the same time that's not denying it

291
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:07,620
I don't feel like I'm aloof I don't feel like I'm distant I don't think I'm denying anything it's just like this is

292
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:13,100
real this is this is more real than what this identification thing

293
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:18,659
so to be able to make this distinction between being Mindful and not mindful

294
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:25,320
that's the food for the other six vectors of Awakening they grow and develop and as they receive them then

295
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:31,799
appreciate them and then there's so much more room so much more space so much more freedom in

296
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:37,799
the mind and it turns out that just a few you have to decide how many

297
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:44,940
of the problems you have in your life somehow in a funny kind of way

298
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:51,960
gets solved if you change your state of your mind

299
00:31:51,960 --> 00:32:00,240
into a mind that's mindful sees clearly is engaged nicely

300
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,179
has Joy has tranquility is deeply settled and has a degree of

301
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:14,720
equanimity these are states of abundance these are states of of there are Treasures

302
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:22,320
and so the reference point for what needs to happen changes for us and it turns out now it's hard to

303
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:29,480
believe that Gill's happiness is not dependent on the car

304
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:35,039
it just turns out that's you know who who would have imagined

305
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:41,159
yeah so so food what do you so what do you feed

306
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:46,919
yourself with what do you do all the time all the time

307
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:53,760
the food for the hindrances is very much tied to what we're thinking

308
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,840
about all the time and um and she almost might want to think that the food for these hindrances

309
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,240
for what gives you indigestion has to do with thinking about cars all the time

310
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,559
thinking about hate thinking about the doubt about how terrible things are there's something about

311
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:18,179
watching the mind ruminate and and

312
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:24,720
spin out you can feel how it's not good food for the heart not

313
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:31,140
good food for the mind you can spill how it's and a lot of it's a tremendous amount of psychological distress in our

314
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:36,600
society comes from how people are constantly thinking constantly thinking and

315
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:44,100
thinking the same thing negative thing over and over again it's just debilitating it's a kind of food

316
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:49,440
and it is possible to change the diet and that's what Buddhist practice is

317
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:55,200
about changing the diet so it's a healthy diet of the input that we take into the heart

318
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:03,179
the mind is something much more beneficial and for the Buddha I think it begins by

319
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:10,980
being mindful such such a powerful thing to learn and it's not something to you learn just

320
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:17,580
overnight like oh that's mindfulness is something you keep learning and growing in the years and

321
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:24,919
decades you do it it's a fantastic thing that just kind of discovering oh that's what it is oh okay wonderful

322
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:32,820
so I hope that this week you make a resolution to eat better yeah

323
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:38,220
and uh and that you find this teaching uh applicable that you might want to

324
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:44,220
experiment and take a deeper look at yourself and chances are

325
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:49,800
that if you don't do that if you don't stop use this kind of this kind of teaching to take a deeper look at what

326
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:57,118
you're doing chances are pretty high that you'll be on a diet That's not

327
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:03,480
healthy for you the more of a preoccupied and lost in our thoughts lost in our it's usually

328
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:11,160
not healthy to be unpreoccupied chances are then you have space for

329
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:17,060
these beautiful qualities of heart that Buddhism cherishes

330
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:24,180
so may you eat well so we have a few minutes and if some of you would like to ask any questions

331
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:31,079
about this you're welcome to ask or comments or

332
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:39,019
if you have any experiences having a good diet maybe we have some testimonials

333
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:48,599
can people hear me with a mask on um

334
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:56,220
trying to frame the question and completely resonates everything you've said my difficulty uh I will be fully

335
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:02,400
transparent I have two children and both of them are suffering because of a family situation that has unfolded

336
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,940
post-covered through no Faults of their own and so I see my oldest in particular who's 17 and

337
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:15,900
Awakening to the world suffering quite greatly because of factors that are Beyond her own control and I understand

338
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:23,760
that my suffering is because of her suffering and I don't know how to help her to see how she spends and spends on

339
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:30,720
the doubt and the things that she cannot control that are causing genuine suffering through no fault of her own

340
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:38,280
and so that causes me great suffering and I'm I'm unable to skillfully understand how

341
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,320
to support navigate how to how to feel Equanimity how to reach a state of

342
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,720
equanimity when someone I love so much is suffering

343
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:54,180
that's a very important question and it's probably has so many different

344
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:59,820
factors that then he's answer I'll give you a response I'll give you is maybe kind of too narrow or you know might

345
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:08,339
miss you even but here are some ideas is that some of your suffering some of

346
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:15,060
your pain let's say use the word pain rather than suffering some of your pain is completely appropriate for a parent

347
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:21,060
to have for a distressed child of course what parent wouldn't be

348
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:27,599
some of the pain is more to do with you than with your your child

349
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:33,780
and so this idea of turning your attention 180 degrees back to yourself so you can ban distinguish

350
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:39,540
distinguishing between the pain the parental pain that's of course is going to be there

351
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:46,320
and and the parental pain which is debilitating for you the first I'd like to suggest can actually be energizing in

352
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:52,800
a good way the second undermines you it gets in the way

353
00:37:52,800 --> 00:38:00,420
and uh and uh and so one of the interesting kind of things to think about maybe as a reference point is a as

354
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:07,619
a not a not not a judgment or a conclusion about yourself but as a way of seeing yourself better

355
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:13,440
is uh try the assumption that the extra suffering that you have

356
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,180
is from a lack of confidence

357
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,680
just that might kind of like well what what why am I lacking Comfort what's

358
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:32,040
that about could it be and and so I don't have an answer but that

359
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:38,040
said you'd like to explore that and uh exactly but the um

360
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:45,000
one of the principles that I kind of live by especially with children they really need to feel

361
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,820
the the care the love and the acceptance of a parent who's present not

362
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:57,000
necessarily a parent who can fix their problems but a parent who really is there and understands but and

363
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,359
accompanies them with it in a healthy way and if a parent's trying too much to fix

364
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:09,599
sometimes that's appropriate for a parent to do that to get the Band-Aid out and put it on the cuts but uh but

365
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:15,960
sometimes uh the very movement of fixing um if we're so reactive ourselves and

366
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:24,060
have all this extra suffering we're actually modeling a way of being in the world that teaches

367
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:30,000
kids to be distressed but if we can model being calm

368
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,460
being caring but being untroubled by how they are

369
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:44,820
I think that then they start getting sense of something that was another possibility in the world and so certainly your daughter needs you

370
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:49,920
so anyway so those are those are kind of my preliminary thoughts I don't know if they

371
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,440
give you enough to reflect on it it does thank you thank

372
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,619
you

373
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:07,920
thank you I really empathize with what she said I suffer from the same thing

374
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,500
you know over and over again uh in my case a lot of it has to do with the fact

375
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:19,079
that overly over synthesized to the uh to the suffering of my

376
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:25,380
offspring she's a very very hard charging hard driving individual and she's pregnant

377
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:31,320
and she's also getting a degree at the same time she's raising an infant

378
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:38,220
she's got all these plates in the air and my wife and I have distinctly

379
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:46,020
different approach to how we observe her mind causes a lot of suffering here's for by all appearances doesn't seem to

380
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:53,640
and that has to be the fact that I'm constantly tuned into everything she does and if I can just learn to step away

381
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:58,859
from it and just calm down the very first step is to be less sensitive or

382
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:05,099
synthesized to what's going on I'm hoping that then the second step is all

383
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:11,579
these things that you wonderful things that you describe come to play but I won't allow it to happen because I'm so

384
00:41:11,579 --> 00:41:18,839
constantly tuned into everything that's going on so I've got to detune myself first before I can more or less get into

385
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:27,359
that state of calm and Equanimity or whatever you want to call it so if hopefully you'll allow me to give you a

386
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:34,740
carrot if you could stop being so overly

387
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:40,800
concerned with your daughter and thinking about her staying in touch with her finding out what's going on all

388
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,859
the time and just constantly kind of being with her challenges if you could stop doing that and calm

389
00:41:46,859 --> 00:41:52,980
down in a deep way and really take a vacation from that you know whether it's a few hours or a few

390
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:58,380
days or just long enough then when you're with her when you're in contact

391
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:04,500
with her you're probably being bring much more benefit to that relationship

392
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:11,579
so when you're not with her you're preparing yourself to be with her and her suffering

393
00:42:11,579 --> 00:42:16,980
if you're not with her don't bother suffering so much let it be

394
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:22,619
in the background because you have something much more important to do so you can be a good father a helpful

395
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:26,720
father that's the carrot

396
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,480
so maybe one more

397
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:41,579
hi um so can people hear me yeah I really enjoyed your talk guilt um I have

398
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:46,760
something a little less meaningful and deep than the other two questions

399
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:52,380
I was just protesting some parts of your

400
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:58,440
speech because sometimes the compulsion or the attachment isn't really rational so for instance if I see a plate of

401
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:06,900
french fries and I have this deep craving for it or something I really want to buy then I could think well just

402
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:12,599
uh investigate the desire let go of the attachment but I really really want it

403
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:18,660
to so there's some kind of compulsiveness there um I'll probably just reach out and have

404
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:26,400
the rest of the phrase so I just was wondering about the irrational parts of it or the compulsion the kind of

405
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,410
holding on really tight yeah well that's the way people are sometimes

406
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:37,880
[Laughter] and um and so

407
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:43,260
uh classically in Buddhism one of the most important practices that are the

408
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:50,700
entry-level practice to really get started so you can really do everything else and and I don't entry entry level

409
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:56,220
doesn't mean that it's like remedial it just means it's it's so important it's like that's what I'm emphasizing how

410
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:03,980
important it is classically with we don't teach much in the West and that is restraint

411
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:10,020
so look for opportunities where this compulsion operates and practice some

412
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:16,640
kind of wise restraint I don't know about French fries because they're going to get stale if you don't eat them right away

413
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:24,359
but uh but uh the shopping thing make a commitment to yourself maybe

414
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:30,780
that whenever you feel compulsion to buy something you always wait a day

415
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:35,819
and that's the restraint part and then the next day maybe you're you

416
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:41,099
know it all it all changes in your view of it changes but to practice restraint

417
00:44:41,099 --> 00:44:48,000
and don't order french fries and uh and so with your compulsions that

418
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,579
are irrational um you know you can't go back and look

419
00:44:53,579 --> 00:44:58,800
at the cause or why it's working it's just so hard but by practicing restraint you

420
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:07,200
cultivate something strong in you and that becomes stronger and stronger that hopefully you find the light and joy in

421
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:14,460
having that kind of autonomy look there's a compulsion and I'm not going to do anything isn't that

422
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:21,020
great how does that sound yeah that sounds good thank you

423
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:30,119
great so um thank you all very much for being here and participating and

424
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:37,380
um I don't know if it's if it's if it's not raining it's just cloudy I'm happy to meet is it is

425
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:43,980
it yeah yeah but in here but is how's is it raining outside

426
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,400
and

427
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:57,960
because some of you like it's nice to meet with some of you some of you like doing that and I like it in the parking lot so if it's not raining

428
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,359
um you know I think there was supposed to be a little Gap today

429
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:09,900
it's sprinkling okay let's not do it then so and then we have here in a I don't know in 15 minutes or so we have

430
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,940
