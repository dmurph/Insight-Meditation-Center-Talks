energy or effort and um

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,379
just want to mention that it's part of a five-part series many of you have been

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,960
to the other parts of the series this week which is on the bay seeds or

10
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:03,660
roads to spiritual power and meditative success

11
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,920
so we'll start with a guided meditation invitation is to

12
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:18,240

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,640
back and forth a little like I'm doing feel your weight

14
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,220
forward and back side to side and come to balance

15
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:36,240
come to balance in the center [Music]

16
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,520
and um can be helpful to start with one or two

17
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:55,340
intentional breaths a little bit longer a little bit slower

18
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,140
and letting go of any excess gripping or tension

19
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,220
on the out breath

20
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,440
you know if you are ready to close your eyes

21
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:30,660
and go inward and tune in notice how the body is today

22
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,900
this moment any places of

23
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,540
holding the review vaccination

24
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,540
any vibrancy or energy

25
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:58,739
softness relaxation

26
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,140
and the other stray and Sensations

27
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,360
noticing this whole body

28
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:28,980
allowing the breathing to settle into normalcy

29
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,439
end of the breath is a good anchor of attention for you

30
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:43,760
the invitation is to settle settle your attention there rest there

31
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,019
while very intentionally placing

32
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,200
attention awareness mindfulness at the Forefront

33
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:12,060
allowing concerns and other experiences anything then and

34
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:20,120
there to fade off into the background

35
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:36,860
foreign

36
00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:02,000
making the intention for this time together in meditation

37
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:11,000
continued to return to this moment

38
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:20,280
a light touch or firm placing

39
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,220
of the heart and the mind and the body

40
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,340
now

41
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,639
noticing the details of what is arising

42
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:59,360
maybe ambient sounds Where You Are

43
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:10,280
the Myriad sensations of breathing and through the aliveness of the whole body

44
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,340
and bringing a sense of Interest

45
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,479
devotion

46
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:47,039
engagement to the details of each in-breath and out

47
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,638
breath each arising

48
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:58,100
noticing if the mind is wandering away

49
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:06,060
and if so with just as much effort as is necessary

50
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:15,260
returning allowing this moment to be predominant

51
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,860
foreign

52
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:55,520
from time to time noticing if the mind is drifted away

53
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:04,220
the attention has become loose and reattuning to the moment

54
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,980
and also noticing if the mind has constricted or gotten too tight

55
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:23,100
and they're so softening allowing

56
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,940
in the moment

57
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,100
foreign

58
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,860
a little moments of this meditation

59
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:07,820
reflecting on any calm or peace

60
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:13,278
any goodness kindness or pleasure

61
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:21,559
even the smallest moment that may have emerged during this practice

62
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:28,700
and if it feels right to share it

63
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:36,140
offer it outwards to the others in your life

64
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,940
so that it may grow in the sharing

65
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:53,120
casting your mind's eye towards those who share your days

66
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,440
people and creatures

67
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:10,820
and offering the wish may they be safe

68
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,679
may they be happy

69
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:25,640
may they be healthy peaceful and free

70
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,260
foreign

71
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:54,340
[Music]

72
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,658
thank you for the sincerity of your practice

73
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,278
foreign

74
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:23,079
[Music]

75
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:33,919
thank you

76
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:46,679
so good morning again sound good I see some notes about refreshing

77
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:52,919
uh YouTube in the chat and just want to mention that we are

78
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:58,320
broadcasting via Zoom that may have a little bit to do with it so

79
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:04,559
if you're a patients with the technology that brings us together and sometimes

80
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:11,280
cause those little glitches these are all recorded they will be

81
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,560
uploaded most of them will be uploaded on Thursday I think

82
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:23,658
they are available on YouTube they will be available on audiodarma.org as well

83
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:31,260
so Sanga the topic for today

84
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:39,320
is um balanced effort energy perseverance

85
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:46,919
so just a brief recap effort or energy is one of the key

86
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:53,700
components of these bases of spiritual power of meditative prowess that the

87
00:34:53,700 --> 00:35:01,440
Buddha practiced before his Awakening and each basis has kind of a tripod of

88
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:08,099
qualities in it one is samadhi what I've been calling immersion or

89
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:13,800
collection sometimes known as concentration or stability

90
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:19,980
padhana engagement and in this case of Veria

91
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:28,079
effort so three main points this morning first varia of fruit or energy has a range of

92
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,240
intensity second it's helpful to balance

93
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:40,140
adapt that energy that effort throughout practice and for that matter throughout any activity

94
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:45,540
and third there's one kind of effort so important to the teaching that it

95
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:55,279
sometimes taught by the Buddha as a fifth basis and that is perseverance or persistence

96
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:01,920
so very effort

97
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,440
is a Continuum that's reflected in different translations of it depending

98
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,500
on the context so just want to invite you to feel in your body

99
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:20,060
how things feel these words feel these different nuances of interpretation

100
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:27,020
and maybe notice any associations that come up with this word cloud

101
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,980
heroic effort

102
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,300
heroic energy strength

103
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:44,780
courageous effort vigor

104
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,820
perseverance

105
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:57,799
balanced effort continuous engagement

106
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:05,400
gentle persistence light touch

107
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,859
and receiving or allowing

108
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:18,420
so feeling those in your body feeling those in

109
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:24,900
your mind your heart and no one is better than the other at

110
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:33,319
different times in meditation practice each one of them has an appropriate place a helpful place

111
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:40,440
the key is to take an Adaptive approach fluid flexible to how effort and energy

112
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:47,400
come up in this practice the Buddha likened this process to

113
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,400
tuning a stringed instrument like a loot it's the example used in in the ancient

114
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,920
Indian texts but these days it might be more like tuning a guitar or violin or

115
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,500
banjo it's worth noting that with these stringed instruments

116
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:09,780
changes in the weather will change how the tuning needs to

117
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:16,440
happen the appropriate amount of um turning required to get a good

118
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:22,740
pressure the same is true for different meditation conditions which are kind of

119
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:29,760
like the weather right there's a tuning or odd tuning to the appropriate amount of energy that's a

120
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:37,640
little bit different each time we sit down to meditate and throughout the course of a meditation

121
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,240
there's also in the course of a meditation maybe different phases for many of us

122
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:52,320
it can be like running or riding a bike on a hill courageous effort vigorous

123
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:59,160
effort is required to get moving and on the flats once

124
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,380
pedaling has gotten some momentum it's okay to Coast

125
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:09,660
and then downhill you can just enjoy the momentum

126
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:15,960
speeding right along cuddling gets easier lighter and lighter

127
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:21,500
touch sometimes hands off completely just to allow the flow to happen

128
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,740
and this relates to the engagement patana

129
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:34,320
I want to be lightly touching the handlebars keeping tabs on where we're going

130
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:40,200
maybe the break to moderate the speed and enjoying the immersion the

131
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:46,520
intentness the samadhi that flow

132
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:53,820
so that's one simile or example of how varia energy effort can work with these

133
00:39:53,820 --> 00:40:00,720
two complementary qualities another important way of adapting energy

134
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:06,180
and effort is to notice what's being cultivated with it and this

135
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:12,420
goes back to what we talked about yesterday which is noticing

136
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:19,640
or akusala skillful or unskillful application of effort

137
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:25,619
the Buddha talks about this in a teaching called the four great efforts which I'm just very briefly going to

138
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:31,440
mention they're called wise exertions why why is engagement

139
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:39,900
or padanas that same word in brief it's to prevent the unskillful

140
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:48,359
the rising in the mind and heart to abandon it if it's arisen to cultivate what's good and skillful

141
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:54,540
and then to maintain that those are the four sometimes this involves

142
00:40:54,540 --> 00:41:00,660
backing off if we're Tangled Up In aversion or or frustration

143
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:06,839
grating of the teeth furrowing of the brow that kind of thing other times it can be

144
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:11,880
a total Act of courageous effort place the attention where it's useful

145
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:20,660
and move it off of where it's not useful so it's a range right

146
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:29,160
finally one kind of effort is so important to this teaching on spiritual power that it sometimes caught taught as

147
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:35,180
a fifth basis and that is the poly is um

148
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:43,020
Usso L with a DOT under it h i and this translates in many ways

149
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:48,780
sometimes even as enthusiasm or Vigor but the translation I like the

150
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:54,660
best is perseverance persistence it's this staying with the meditation

151
00:41:54,660 --> 00:42:00,000
practice over the Long Haul keeping coming back

152
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,299
staying engaged not too caught up in outcomes

153
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:12,380
it's like keeping on keeping on in a long journey

154
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,320
this kind of perseverance persistence is just vital

155
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:23,700
to successful powerful meditation practice over the Long Haul

156
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:31,260
and the Buddha talks about it in different ways in different teachings but it's that stick-to-itiveness

157
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:38,700
you know any one given meditation session might be beautiful or not but it's the accumulation

158
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:47,000
all of these sessions over days or months even years or decades that add up

159
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:55,859
so effort energy is Central to this teaching on the spiritual power

160
00:42:55,859 --> 00:43:01,319
and um so much so that each that the overall

161
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:09,020
basis of success contain these three related Concepts varia effort or energy

162
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:16,920
the wholehearted engagement and sometimes this special shout out to

163
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:24,200
persistence perseverance so it's kind of layered in there in three different ways

164
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:30,480
so I just want to encourage you to pay a special attention this week to the

165
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:37,740
