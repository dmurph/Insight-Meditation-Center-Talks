1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:11,200
hello everyone and welcome and welcome to this meditation

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,920
session and um

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:26,080
one of the ways of maybe getting a little more feeling for

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,640
the potential of meditation is to have a very clear

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,719
bracketing putting aside of the past and the future

6
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,920
when you meditate now the past and the future have their

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,520
certainly have their importance in human life and in fact it's a bit of a problem if you

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:03,680
don't remember anything of your past in the future but there's also something very valuable

9
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,200
about putting it aside so that you can have a very

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:18,000
different experience of yourself or experience of life without that reference of the past and

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,960
the future that to understand to really experience

12
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:35,119
something qualitatively valuable about the present

13
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:41,439
and so we're not forgetting about the past but we're putting it aside for the duration of a

14
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,640
meditation session adam will come back thoughts will come about the past and

15
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,840
the future but in mindfulness meditation we're not interested in those

16
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,960
but we are interested in recognizing them as present moment phenomena

17
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,840
here is a mind that's thinking about the past here's a mind concerned with the

18
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:14,560
future here it's like this and for this it's for this it's kind of

19
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,160
like for the duration of the meditation you're forgiven

20
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,560
about whatever happened in the past whatever you did in the past you don't have to be blamed for anything

21
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,319
when you're meditating it's kind of a time-out zone a neutral zone

22
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:40,400
and it's like in the old days people would go into the church for sanctuary and

23
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,840
the legal authorities couldn't go and pull a personality was in the

24
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,239
sanctuary of a church so you are in the sanctuary of your meditation

25
00:02:52,239 --> 00:03:00,800
and you're safe here now from the past everything is forgiven for now

26
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,840
you don't have to do it after the meditation and you don't have to think about the future

27
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:16,400
for time being meditation you're not responsible for the future and what will happen and don't need to plan

28
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:25,040
so that just here just this experience it's kind of like

29
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:35,120
here is a door and you walk through that door to a deeper intimacy deeper connection

30
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:43,360
to the lived experience of the moment so take so entering into this door

31
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:54,159
through your body and entering into a meditation posture

32
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:01,840
and part of the value of being intentional with the meditation posture

33
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:14,480
it's beginning this process of entering into the present more fully

34
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:29,840
and doing so through your body

35
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:40,479
and also stepping through this door of the present moment into the present

36
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:49,840
stepping out of the past and stepping out of the future to just here to take a few long slow

37
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:57,680
deep breaths

38
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,440
breathing in deeply

39
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,720
and relaxing the body as you exhale long

40
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
exhale

41
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,160
and if you take a long exhale a long ride into the present

42
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,680
let there be a momentary pause at the end of the exhale

43
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,479
a fuller acknowledgement here

44
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:53,840
maybe a silent acknowledgement feeling here

45
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,840
letting your breathing return to normal

46
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:16,638
and because the body is such a wonderful vehicle for sliding into now

47
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,840
as you exhale

48
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,199
relax your belly

49
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,520
and sometimes if you relax the belly all kinds of other things throughout the body will relax

50
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:48,080
as well

51
00:06:48,080 --> 00:07:03,840
as you exhale relaxing the shoulders

52
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:17,840
and softening them up the face

53
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,039
and perhaps also calming the mind

54
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,360
cooling the thinking activity

55
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:45,520
quieting your thoughts

56
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,639
and as part of present moment experience

57
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,840
there is awareness of the present

58
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,400
awareness is always a present moment event

59
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:13,840
if you are aware the awareness is occurring here and now

60
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,640
and for these minutes you are allowed you have permission to put aside the

61
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:44,399
past and the future enter and to enter into the door

62
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:54,320
through the door of the present moment

63
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:00,240
not to attain anything or get anything or make anything happen

64
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,920
but to abide

65
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,959
aware mindful

66
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,839
of your experience as you hear

67
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,680
and letting the comings and goings of breathing

68
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:36,480
support you to be here as breathing is also a present moment

69
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,120
phenomenon

70
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:51,839
riding the breath riding the sensations of the body breathing

71
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:05,839
like riding on the present moment

72
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
so

73
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,960
putting aside the past putting aside the future

74
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:56,559
for now for now so you can be here

75
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,840
whatever the now is for you now

76
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,720
it'll never be exactly this way again

77
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:18,720
it's worthwhile resting awareness grounding awareness

78
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,880
in this unique lived experience of now

79
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:31,759
letting the thinking mind take a break

80
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:40,400
just aware just

81
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
mindful

82
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:21,840
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

83
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:30,480
from time to time when you consider other people or

84
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,679
even more so when you're together with them

85
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:41,039
it's useful to put aside the past

86
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,559
and put aside thoughts of the future

87
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:56,080
so that you can really see the person in the present

88
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:03,840
certainly there's a time and place for the past and the future to be considered

89
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,520
but there's also a time and place to put those aside

90
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:17,039
and to meet someone in the fullness of how they are in the

91
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:24,240
present with whatever fullness you are

92
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:30,080
in the present

93
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,960
to connect to the humanity of another person

94
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:40,880
as they are in the present moment with a beating heart

95
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:49,360
breathing lungs with blood coursing through their body

96
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,399
with their vulnerability and their strength

97
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:03,278
with their good qualities and not so good qualities

98
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:13,840
to just to be there feel and sense and be with a person

99
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:22,640
and having that capacity can be a vehicle or a means

100
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:31,919
for greater respect for the other for greater care and friendliness

101
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:40,640
a greater good will well-wishing

102
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:49,919
greater empathy maybe even a sense of shared humanity

103
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,840
sharing in the difficulties and the joys of this life

104
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,640
from time to time to put aside the past and the future

105
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:14,158
so that we may have greater goodwill and compassion and love

106
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:23,840
kindness for the people we're with in the simplicity of the moment

107
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:29,440
and may it be that this meditation practice we do

108
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:35,120
supports us to be present with others

109
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:42,559
in a fuller deeper richer way

110
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,640
and that we bring a heart

111
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:55,360
that is inspired by the welfare and happiness of others

112
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:05,440
may we live contributing to the happiness the safety

113
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,518
the peacefulness and the freedom that others can have

114
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,960
may this practice spread from us the benefits of this

115
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:26,080
practice spread from us for the welfare and happiness of all beings everywhere

116
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:33,840
may all beings be happy

117
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
this

118
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,840
um so

119
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:59,600
so as a way of continuing the discussion of the buddha's teachings

120
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:06,799
on anapanasati mindfulness of breathing

121
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:13,919
the buddha is presenting these 16 steps for mindfulness of breathing

122
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:21,760
and then clearly showing their connection to two other important teachings

123
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,600
meditation teachings he has and one is the teachings on the four what's

124
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:33,200
usually called the four foundations of mindfulness and what's usually called the seven factors of

125
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:39,039
awakening and um it's really wonderful the way

126
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:45,360
that rather than many people will feel that you know that practice is practicing

127
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,880
those who know about the practicing the four foundations of mindfulness we'll see them as a very different

128
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,159
practice than practicing mindfulness of breathing

129
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:02,720
and certainly the way they're taught is often the case but they also come together

130
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:10,878
especially in mindfulness of breathing really becomes some point or enters into the same

131
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:18,480
domain the same area of life as the four foundations of mindfulness

132
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,280
and and the way the buddha does this is that there's four tetrads in the 16 steps of

133
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,480
alapanasati and each tetrad he says corresponds to one of the foundations of

134
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,158
mindfulness so as it usually said the foundation of

135
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,440
mindfulness that's based on the body corresponds to the first

136
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,118
four steps of breathing being aware of the long breath being

137
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:53,200
where the short breath being aware of the whole body as you breathe and then being aware of

138
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:59,359
the body calming and relaxing as you breathe so it's all about the body and when that

139
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:06,400
becomes really well established all four of these steps and really awareness has become strong

140
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:13,040
then the awareness is based on the body in the first

141
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:19,680
and the first foundation of mindfulness it's really about establishing awareness

142
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,200
on the basis of the body and classically there's a series of exercises to giving

143
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:31,599
or different ways of practicing mindfulness practice all for the purpose of establishing a

144
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,400
strong mindfulness awareness in the body

145
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:43,520
in the second tetrad steps 5 to 8

146
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:50,160
they are that corresponds to the second foundation of mindfulness the foundation

147
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:56,160
of mindfulness on feelings and so the second tetrad of anapanasati

148
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:03,200
is experiencing as we breathe feeling joy as we breathe feeling happiness as we

149
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:11,200
breathe experiencing the mental activity and then relaxing the mental activity

150
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:18,000
and this expert experiencing could also be translated as feeling it has the same word that we

151
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,200
translate as feeling is embodied in the word experiencing the way the pali

152
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:30,480
grammar is or l the words are used and so ex feeling

153
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,800
joy feeling happiness feeling uh the whole the mental activity and then

154
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:43,839
relaxing the mental activity so this corresponds to this the foundation of mindfulness on feeling

155
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:49,359
the third that threat has to do all about the mind and the third foundation is all about

156
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:54,720
the mind so in the breathing exercises it's experiencing

157
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,960
the mind not just the activity the whole mind gladdening the mind settling

158
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,280
stabilizing the mind concentrating the mind and then liberating the mind in the four

159
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,480
foundations of mindfulness um the uh

160
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,599
it's in part understanding really high quality states of mind

161
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,440
maybe first the mind itself in some certain ways particular ways and then these high

162
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,200
qualities of mind that correspond with gladdening roughly corresponding gladdening

163
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:37,119
concentrating and liberating the mind and then the last tetrad is observing

164
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,160
all about observing observing impermanence observing fading away

165
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,880
cessation and relinquishment and these are the insights deep insights and the fourth foundation

166
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:55,680
of mindfulness is also about about insights it's really uh insight also into seeing the arising and

167
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:03,520
passing how hindrances arise and they go and seeing the suffering how suffering comes

168
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,800
and goes and now that's the first uh of the

169
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,800
uh observations of the fourth tetrad observing in constancy or change

170
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,560
and and the others follow in the wake of that so the buddha corresponds these two

171
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:27,520
these the four foundations are equal to the four tetrads but not just automatically it's when

172
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,040
awareness is well established in each of these areas when it's when

173
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:39,200
when when we're really grounded and centered and present in a full way without being distracted or

174
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:46,480
thinking a lot about the past and the future this precious precious thing that we have being aware

175
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,320
being able to really experience the present moment sense the present moment feel the

176
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:59,119
present moment know the present moment in all its all the dimensions of knowing

177
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,960
and not just know it fleetingly but to feel that now we're centered we're at

178
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:13,200
rooted we're grounded here and this feeling of being really here definitely be grounded resting here

179
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:19,760
it's kind of like the difference between maybe being in a rowboat being tossed around the sea and then

180
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:26,800
coming up on dry land now you feel like it's stable and strong here we are and there's a qualitatively

181
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:33,440
shift a quantum shift that can happen inside when boom we're here

182
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:40,160
we don't have to work at being here and come back and come back and remember to be here and present we're

183
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,920
not liable to wander off and the awareness then becomes strong

184
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:53,119
and uh and that awareness is established and uh so the translation i like for the

185
00:39:53,119 --> 00:40:00,480
four foundations of mindfulness is uh is the four ways the four basis

186
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:07,520
for establishing uh awareness and um and then in the when the buddha

187
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,720
correlates these four these these foundations and the four tetrads

188
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:19,280
and the fourth one he says then mindfulness of the ma of the dharmas is well

189
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,520
established so there's a strong level of equanimity and this is one of the kind of

190
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:32,240
directions the practice goes when there's a stability boom we're here that then we're here in

191
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:38,000
such a strong way that we're not easily tossed around by

192
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,839
the changing circumstances of our life we're not easily losing our equanimity

193
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:51,040
our balance our peacefulness when difficult thought arises the days rise

194
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:56,079
and they go when there's difficult painful sensations in the body arise and

195
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:01,680
we just can feel them and know them and and but the mind doesn't get agitated or

196
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,800
disturbed and this is called equanimity and lack of agitation and lack of

197
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,920
being disturbed and so both these practices the four

198
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:18,160
foundations of mindfulness whatever way you've been taught to do them and there's many ways that be possible

199
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:24,800
mindfulness is taught or the mindfulness of breathing one of the ways of doing this

200
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:32,480
whatever those practices are they're all for the purpose ultimately in buddhist practice to

201
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:40,960
come to a kind of dwelling resting abiding aware in the present moment

202
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:47,280
without any tendency to leave that and wander off from that

203
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:53,280
and some people then will use the kind of the expression lucid

204
00:41:53,280 --> 00:42:00,560
awareness when awareness is not ruffled when our sense of mindfulness not ruffled by

205
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,560
what we know that knowing becomes

206
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:14,079
free and independent of what is known we can't separate what

207
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:20,640
we know from knowing completely but but the knowing

208
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,480
is not ruffled it's not agitated it's not entangled it's not

209
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,520
clinging to what is known and this idea of knowing something and that kind of

210
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:37,359
freedom that equanimity is then um the

211
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:43,359
the the really the place where all the different practices of mindfulness all the different ways might be past

212
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:49,040
night practice come together and uh and set the stage

213
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,880
for uh for awakening so then tomorrow i'll talk about how

214
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,160
this goes to is connected to the seven factors of awakening

215
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,920
and i love this because um there's kind of a creating of a harmony or unity

216
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:12,880
in in the buddhist teachings we start seeing how they all come together as a whole and

217
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:20,240
in the way that this discourse on anapanasati begins where it begins with the the senior

218
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:27,280
disciples of the buddha coming together with all their disciples and living together for a period of

219
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,880
months in unity and in harmony receiving the buddhist teaching

220
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:39,040
so to have that sense of unity and harmony with all the different sides of who we are

221
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:45,440
that we could all come together and live under the full moon of our

222
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:54,240
lucid awareness so um thank you and um

223
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:00,000
and we'll continue along this path of the anapanasati and tomorrow's the seven factors of

224
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,520
awakening and then we'll see by thursday how the seven factors of awakening

225
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:11,839
are practiced the practice changes when a person has not just learned how

226
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:18,240
to be stably aware here but has experienced a degree of real liberation freedom from clinging

227
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:25,920
and how the practice of changes at that point so so we continue and we're almost at

228
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:36,160
the end of this anapanasati series thank you
