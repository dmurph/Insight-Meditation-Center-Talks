1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,240
good day everyone and

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:13,519
welcome and welcome to here

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,920
wherever here is for you

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
so

5
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,480
so the theme this week for meditation especially has been their

6
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,160
their capacity for recognizing what's happening in the moment in the present moment

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,199
and recognizing it clearly clear recognition

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,640
and clear recognition is this uh capacity to know what's happening

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,479
in the most obvious way perhaps that's clear to us it doesn't have to be some deep

10
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,400
analytical way but as things are observed those things they're experienced in the simplest way

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:20,080
that we can know them but that knowing is clear enough

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:28,479
strong enough emphatic enough that the knowing the recognition itself

13
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:34,400
is its own um event it isn't that the recognition is

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,320
just casual thing on the side bystander of our life we kind of know what's going on and we recognize what's

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:48,240
going on but we're barreling ahead and involved in what's going on the the knowing is its own event if

16
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,840
anything we are resting in the knowing or where we are emphasizing knowing as

17
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:03,280
over time in meditation sometimes it's the most important thing that's happening uh rather than the usual idea of of

18
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,399
looking at pleasure or success or attainments or or avoiding

19
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,480
something or figuring something out this the activity is being important whatever where it's happening

20
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,520
it's the knowing which is important the activity can continue but it's like

21
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,879
changing the paradigm or changing the the center for uh where our life is

22
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,720
based at least for meditation it begins being more and more centered in the recognition

23
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,200
more than the experience that we're having they're recognizing the experience and this becomes particularly

24
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,720
significant in relationship to thinking and

25
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:53,280
to clearly clearly clearly recognize thinking is happening this is thinking

26
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,560
so we're not kind of writing the thoughts we're not in the thoughts we're not being swept away in the river

27
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,920
of thoughts we're not going to kind of know we're thinking but really what we're doing is we're centered in

28
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,440
our thoughts and moving along it's almost as if like we we're not like

29
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,959
we're stopping our thinking but it's like we're stepping on the dry riverbank and the side of the river and

30
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,720
seeing oh that's a river that's thinking going on with such clarity with such

31
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:30,400
you know strength in a sense calm strength relaxed a peaceful place

32
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,599
well that is a thought so in this meditation what i would like

33
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:43,120
to suggest you do is you give a little bit more emphasis on mindfulness of thinking

34
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,120
and and not just to be aware that you're thinking but see if you can um increase the

35
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:57,840
volume or the the volume or the clarity of recognizing or that is a

36
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,040
thought and you might even use that expression that's a thought

37
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:11,120
or just a thought and it doesn't matter if it's a true thought or a false thought or if it's a thought

38
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,560
about the past the future even the present doesn't matter the nature of the thought

39
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,680
the idea is to keep stepping away upon the dry riverbank of

40
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:29,120
peace and recognizing oh that's thinking thinking has a tremendous influence on

41
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,720
our attitudes our moods our uh our uh the image in which we live

42
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,120
our life within the projections the assumptions we have it's like very insidious how they kind

43
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,880
of are involved in our perceptions and to start kind of stepping back so

44
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,639
that's a thought that's a thought that's a thought

45
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,520
i clearly recognizing at that so as we do this meditation the way you might do it if it's helpful

46
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:09,600
for you you might just do it just kind of in a relaxed way and and maybe that's the primary

47
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,360
thing that you recognize just like instead of breathing but or

48
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,720
you might stay with your breathing and on every exhale recognize whatever

49
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,720
thought has arisen and no judgments about the nature of

50
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,240
thoughts no animosity criticism for them it's simply the

51
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,560
the clarity of oh that's a thought and maybe as i talked about yesterday

52
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,840
it's possible to discover a kind of freedom and peace in stepping back on the bank of the

53
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,120
river and watching the river go by step back away from our thinking

54
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,240
and recognizing it's a thought just a thought no more no less than just a thought it's

55
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,960
an idea it's a concept it's an image i just recognize it as such

56
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,720
so sitting in a posture that's supportive for you

57
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,319
and perhaps closing your eyes

58
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:25,280
and taking a few long slow deep breaths

59
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,960
a long leisurely inhale and a long leisurely exhales

60
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:49,840
long as it's comfortable

61
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:24,240
and then letting your breathing return to normal and relaxing in your body

62
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:31,840
especially as you exhale

63
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:56,840
and then set centering yourself more on the body breathing the simplicity of

64
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,960
breathing and as you exhale

65
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:13,840
recognize thinking if there's thinking

66
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,840
a kind of clear recognition that's not the same thing as letting go

67
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,319
of your thoughts but it's similar

68
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,680
in not being engaged or involved in the thinking

69
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:40,479
but rather being engaged involved in the simple recognition recognition

70
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:47,920
this is a thought and to do that over and over again

71
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:55,200
perhaps to discover a peaceful place

72
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:09,839
that is not entangled in thinking

73
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:49,039
recognize yourself thinking including how subtly thoughts will creep

74
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,400
in on the side or

75
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:00,320
be like in the background slipping in

76
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,000
recognizing one thought another has

77
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,880
begun some are so much part of the background

78
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:25,840
that it doesn't occur to us to recognize it

79
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,519
and as we come to the end of this

80
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
sitting

81
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:52,080
the ability to see clearly is the goal of vipassana practice

82
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:58,799
oftentimes it's thoughts and ideas and judgments and agendas

83
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:03,519
that get in the way of our ability to see clearly

84
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:11,279
so to see and recognize clearly your thinking

85
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:17,360
is a step towards not having those thoughts interfere

86
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,840
with seeing the world clearly

87
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:30,320
and to see other people with some clarity

88
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:38,320
in our ability to see others hear others

89
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:45,520
perceive others in a direct way without

90
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,480
a thick layers of

91
00:27:51,600 --> 00:28:00,398
ideas and thoughts and judgments and fears and desires bias

92
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,039
memories hopes

93
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:14,720
is a gift that we give to others to simply see them as they are to be open and present

94
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:24,080
in fact to see someone clearly to listen carefully

95
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:31,600
these are forms of love when people really feel seen

96
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:38,720
there's there can be love it's difficult to have real love

97
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:45,840
if people don't see each other

98
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,640
and may it be that our meditation

99
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,960
practice prepares us for the world

100
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,240
prepares us so that we're more inclined or more able

101
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:18,000
to see others clearly to pause to be open to take the time

102
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:26,960
to really see and listen and may that be the vehicle a channel

103
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:41,840
for our care and our love

104
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:50,240
may the benefits of our practice together today travel from us our community out into

105
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,840
the world

106
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,480
through our ability to really be present for others

107
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,480
may all beings

108
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:14,880
be happy may all beings be safe

109
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:25,919
may all beings be peaceful may all beings be free

110
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:37,840
and maybe we recognize that as a possibility for all of us

111
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,839
[Music]

112
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,640
so we come to the last uh talk in this five part series on clear

113
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:09,039
comprehension or clear recognition some pajama

114
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:15,679
and the um

115
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:24,240
so there are a variety of ways that we can

116
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,760
become or things we can become clearly clearly recognize and

117
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:36,720
clearly kind of know and see and the fourth one of the four is a

118
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:45,039
clear comprehension of non-delusion and it's kind of a mouthful and what is

119
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:50,399
what is this how do we clearly comprehend non-delusion

120
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,320
and i think one of the ways of understanding this that i really

121
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:01,519
appreciate and delighted and sometimes i'm amused by

122
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:07,440
is to is to have a clear comprehension of

123
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,880
thinking to really recognize when a thought arises as a thought

124
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,960
i find it interpersonally very helpful because i might have a thought about someone i'm with

125
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:26,960
and um the other day i i met someone for the first time in an unusual situation and and

126
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:32,480
given the context of situation given the something about how that person

127
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:40,000
appeared to me um i had a a predisposition or a bias

128
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,919
to a certain kind of stereotype oh this is that kind of person and but because i have this practice of

129
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,519
watching my thoughts arise i could see that thought arise

130
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,960
and immediately i knew oh gil this is just your thought this is

131
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:05,440
your interpretation of the situation you better kind of stay open here to find out what's really going on here

132
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,360
what this person is who this person is and in fact very quickly i came to see this person was

133
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,760
not my stereotype not what i thought the fact that i have you know this bias

134
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:24,880
or stereotype these thought these thoughts came up and assumptions that came up in person that you know i think all of us have

135
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,080
that that's a normal part of a mind that that is operating in the world in a way

136
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:38,399
that um uh needs to have kind of simplistic sometimes understanding of complex world

137
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:43,840
to find our way uh so it's just kind of a thing that mine

138
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,640
does and that thought that arose about this person i it wasn't like my thought it wasn't like i was behind

139
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,320
the thought or or i was attached to the thought and i didn't criticize myself for having

140
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:04,240
it i just saw immediately oh this is a stereotype this is an idea and then

141
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:11,358
could adjust accordingly and and if i'd stayed in the stereotype and

142
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:17,040
got caught in it and involved in it then i have some responsibility then it's in my court to really

143
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,839
you know that could cause harm that way

144
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:29,839
so in seeing the stereotype come up this idea come up and to see it as oh this is just a

145
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:35,200
thought let's be careful here let's find out let's investigate more

146
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:41,440
that was clear comprehension of non-delusion the non-delusion of questioning my

147
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,599
thought then stepping back and saying wait what's going on here

148
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:55,280
it was also some non-delusion and not taking it too personally oh this is just a rising of a phenomena

149
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:02,079
and just phenomenal arising and and i see it just as phenomena and

150
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:08,240
because of that clarity of seeing there's a kind of freedom from it and i

151
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,640
don't have to interpret it or berate myself or identify myself with having that thought

152
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:21,359
it's just a thought and so there also i can be aware this is non-delusion

153
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:28,400
to to just leave it very simple and kind of belongs to kind of an impersonal not-self world

154
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:35,920
to see it it's just a thought coming up i recognize it it's not fixed it just arose and it's just here

155
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,839
for a moment i don't have to get involved and pick it up it's in and of itself is a

156
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:49,040
impermanent a changing temporary phenomena to see that thought as a temporary

157
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:55,119
phenomena also is clear comprehension of non-delusion i'm not deluded by it

158
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:04,560
i see it as a certain kind of way not self i see a certain kind of way as as as temporary

159
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:10,079
if i took it as being permanent this is it this is the truth that i'm going to hang on to it and stay with it

160
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,839
that is delusion and so this uh ability to clearly

161
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:22,480
recognize uh our thoughts that arise uh can be quite i find it kind of

162
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,480
delightful and sometimes amusing more than distressing

163
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,800
when there's such clarity of recognition that i know i'm safe i'm safe from getting pulled into it be

164
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,560
involved in it or act act from these thoughts that come up

165
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:46,400
and that the light can be there even when the thoughts are true then i might with my wisdom decide

166
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,920
whether to act on them or not or speak them or something but even is kind of stepping back and

167
00:36:51,920 --> 00:37:00,480
just oh look at that it's just there's a thought and there's a perception an assumption an idea

168
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,920
and that kind of distance and like wow it's kind of like uh amazing phenomena of nature looking at a

169
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,520
tree in a park or lately we had sunflowers growing in our

170
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:22,480
garden and these are beautiful sunflowers it's bright yellow and i just lightened them and um and so to

171
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,680
have that kind of delight with what gets a rise in one's own mind

172
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,240
um and even when things are uh there's uncomfortable to have certain thoughts there's kind of stepping back and

173
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,440
clearly seeing and so this clear recognition also

174
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,920
that the knowing the awareness is not caught is not entangled it's not

175
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,040
reactive to it's set to uh the thinking i'm

176
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:59,200
having to the situation i having oh this is really good to have this freedom this space

177
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:04,560
this uh interval where there's some clarity can arise and wisdom can arise

178
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:09,680
this is also a clear comprehension of non-delusion

179
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:17,440
and i love this expression non-delusion because it's the absence of delusion to say

180
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:24,000
a clear comprehension of wisdom means i have supposed to be wise i'm supposed to have good thoughts or

181
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,760
wise thoughts or something like that and but rather to see oh here there's no

182
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,800
delusion there's no clinging or aversion there's no i'm not living in the judgments i'm not living

183
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:43,200
in the thoughts and seeing the world through the thoughts there's a place of non-delusion which is

184
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,839
not exactly a thing or a form of wisdom or that i can propositional say this is

185
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:56,240
true exactly the non-delusion is kind of the in the nature of the stepping back and being

186
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:02,240
clear and this clear recognition this clear freedom this clear spaciousness

187
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:08,480
that allows thoughts and feelings and emotions and impulses and desires and aversions they

188
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:15,920
can all arise but there's non-delusion about them it's just a thought it's just an

189
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:23,760
aversive thought or feeling it's just a desire that arises and whether or not i act on

190
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,880
any of this there's space to make that choice there's an interval a time

191
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:36,640
there's ability to do that but the non-delusion sets the foundations as the context for

192
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:42,960
living a life of greater clarity greater generosity greater freedom

193
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,839
to come from a place of non-delusion allows us to see others better to be

194
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:56,000
better friends or better listen better to other people to be attuned to other people because

195
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,560
we're not seeing them through the filter of our delusion or our projections or our

196
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:09,839
assumptions our bias our stereotypes it's so useful and

197
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:16,880
and then as we meditate and we become more still and quiet

198
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:24,640
it's useful to become attuned or to recognize how subtle these thoughts creep in

199
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,560
even the thought you know you're sitting quietly peacefully mine is silent and you have the thought i'm not

200
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:37,599
thinking anything and then you believe that's true even though you just had that thought

201
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:45,200
and um and don't see the thought itself is kind of contradicting itself

202
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:51,680
the but all these little thoughts come in and some of them are evaluations judgments commentary but what's

203
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:56,720
happening in the present some of them are just kind of like in the background far away

204
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,960
quiet we're thinking about you know things in the future or fantasies or

205
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:09,040
whatever but to really kind of get quiet really get it start getting more and more sensitive

206
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:16,160
to how these thoughts arise beginning when they're there this is not meant to be a lot of work

207
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:23,760
but as we train ourselves and mindful to keep showing up and being mindful and being present for what's here and recognizing what's here

208
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,880
one of those things is without recognizing thoughts and if you can see a thought when it

209
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,560
first arises there's tremendous potential there to discover

210
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:42,400
non-delusion as well the non-delusion that the thought is temporary the non-delusion that the thought is

211
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:50,160
that of not identifying with thought and making it me myself and mine the non-delusion that is not entangled

212
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,599
or caught in the thought or reactive to the thought or swept away by the thought the

213
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:04,000
non-delusion that's kind of akin to space to peace to openness to uh

214
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,760
to non certain kind of non-involvement

215
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:18,400
but a non-involvement that's automatic and habitual and maybe even neurotic at times but rather

216
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:25,200
a non-involvement that is a whole different paradigm a whole radical different way of living

217
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:32,160
our life that's not centered in our thoughts our beliefs our assumptions our ideas

218
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:38,240
but it's centered in clarity and peace in non-delusion

219
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,640
so um

220
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:52,560
i hope that uh maybe you'll experiment maybe you'll try over this weekend to um

221
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:59,200
see if you can notice or for those thoughts that you notice when they first

222
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:05,359
arise the first appear see if in that in that opportunity when they first

223
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:13,200
arise whether you can find non-delusion there a non-entanglement and have certain kind

224
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:20,880
of clarity and wisdom and freedom because you see it when it arises as just a thought

225
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:35,440
so thank you and i look forward to continuing on monday on probably a different topic
