1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:09,960
hello everyone and welcome so we're here to

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,920
meditate for 30 minutes one of the associations many people have

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,960
with Buddhist practice is that it's important not to become

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,019
attached that we're supposed to somehow let go of our attachments

5
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:34,140
and this of course has some truth to it but it leads people to sometimes

6
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:40,680
um let go of things that don't need to be letting go let go of

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,940
the things don't have to be let go of it's our attachment to them that we let go of

8
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,500
the clinging to them but also sometimes people confuse

9
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:01,559
holding on to the things which are healthy and appropriate to hold to have to stay keep close

10
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,740
with attachment with clinging and there is a healthy way of holding

11
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:12,780
things closely to prioritize certain things to emphasize

12
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:19,799
certain things to hold on to certain things in a non-clinging way

13
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:26,040
and one in this family of things that are sometimes not seen as appropriate

14
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:34,680
is uh safeguarding there are some things that are worth safeguarding protecting maintaining

15
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,320
and maybe even developing and so wholesome qualities

16
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,280
wholesome sense of being alive and think ways of being that feel peaceful and

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,360
calm or wise or peaceful joyful happy

18
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:03,000
connect even and so in meditation sometimes there's a deepening sense of intimacy or calm or peace or inner

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,479
well-being of some sort or other some people feel that they have a connection to a spiritual dimension of

20
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:16,739
Life a Dharma dimension and all these might be very wholesome to

21
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:22,879
have and part of the path to practice something that supports the ongoing movement

22
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:29,160
through Buddhist practice and these should be safeguarded

23
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,400
protected to some degree not with attachment not with holding tight or not

24
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,160
with the kind of disappointment and grief if we lose them but we also don't

25
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,620
have to be casual about it we don't have to kind of they come and go as they wish

26
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:52,980
when we feel something positive useful significant through say meditation

27
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:58,080
practice through mindfulness practice there's an art

28
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,180
to keeping that close to appreciate that this has priority in

29
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:09,920
our life and not to give it up easily by doing something

30
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,620
that overrides it or pushes it to the side some of the things that we do in daily

31
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,900
life maybe are not as important as the kind of spiritual connection we feel in

32
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,480
meditation uh or when we're present and calm for our life

33
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,200
and so to safeguard that to not give it up easily is part of the art of this practice

34
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:42,959
so meditation can also be this way that as we settle

35
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:50,700
into meditation but you want to safeguard protect the

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,260
the mindfulness that's developing the sense of calm or subtleness that's coming and so in meditation we mostly

37
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:04,260
watch our mind and are very careful not to become

38
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:13,200
interested in thoughts and stories ideas and feelings which maybe does maybe has less

39
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,620
value for us than staying close to the ongoing practice of meditation being in

40
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:25,979
the present mindfully with the breathing so we're allowed to safeguard we're

41
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:31,400
allowed to prioritize we're allowed to um

42
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,600
stay close to something and not give in to whatever whim that comes up in the

43
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:43,979
mind so assuming a meditation posture

44
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:51,060
and maybe rocking a little bit back and forth

45
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:58,020
or forward and backwards in order to help you find a midpoint if you're

46
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:04,500
sitting upright where you feel balanced and aligned in your body

47
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:11,639
if you're lying down then maybe there's a way of adjusting your back or your shoulders

48
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:18,320
your shoulder blades that makes it a little bit more comfortable or alert for you to be

49
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,479
on your back and

50
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,580
lowering your gaze and if it's comfortable for you

51
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:35,900
to close your eyes

52
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,600
and then as if you're gently

53
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,979
stroking a cat or stroking someone's hair or

54
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:10,759
gently

55
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,820
cleaning a surface with a soft cloth gently

56
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:26,479
allow yourself to take a few deeper breaths

57
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:34,800
maybe there's a smooth movement of breathing as you breathe in a little bit

58
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,680
more deeply than usual full more fully than usual

59
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,440
breathing in more deeply and then a little longer exhale

60
00:06:52,440 --> 00:07:00,479
a gentle m kind of flow of releasing letting go and

61
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,960
settling

62
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:40,819
and letting your breath return to normal

63
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:47,060
and continuing to relax remember every exhale

64
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:51,080
soften some part of your body

65
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:38,640
as you exhale softening the thinking mind

66
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,159
maybe a quieting of thinking

67
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:11,040
and somewhere within you maybe somewhere deep in within

68
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:19,760
below where you're thinking below maybe even some of the difficult maybe emotions if there are

69
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:27,980
might there be a place of calm or quiet

70
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:35,120
or a place of some kind of sweet intimacy or

71
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:43,620
gentleness Within or some way of feeling sensing yourself

72
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:48,560
here alive and breathing

73
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:55,220
that feels good to you that's worth safeguarding

74
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,940
and to have that support your mindfulness

75
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:15,980
and your present moment mindfulness supporting staying close

76
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:22,100
maybe to a wordless place within

77
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:32,160
that has a wholesome quality or a welcome feeling of being alive and

78
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,519
breathing

79
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,519
perhaps safeguarding or protecting your attention

80
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,579
to this place so it supports

81
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:54,800
your ongoing practice of mindfulness

82
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:12,380
foreign

83
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:45,959
safeguarding your practice is to not allow your mind to drift away

84
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:54,379
in thoughts concerns which are second best

85
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:01,620
at the at the best to being here close in

86
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:07,699
safeguarding a way of being that

87
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:14,180
feels more connected or intimate

88
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,880
foreign

89
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,940
and as we come to the end of this meditation

90
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:13,020
is there some way that you're settled or calm or quieter

91
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:18,559
some way that your inner life has shifted or changed

92
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:27,440
that feels satisfying or feels right feels good to be this way

93
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:33,799
maybe the mind is quieter and

94
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,740
more grounded here in the present

95
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:51,179
and consider as you come to the end of the sitting what are the ways that you can

96
00:26:51,179 --> 00:26:57,020
easily appropriately Safeguard how you're feeling

97
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:04,980
keep it close in close by so it's not completely lost as you

98
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:10,460
go on to the next thing that your life will be about

99
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:49,200
and as we finish this sitting May whatever benefit we've received

100
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:56,279
through this visiting any way that we feel more settled and more connected or

101
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:02,279
content anything any benefit we've received

102
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:09,419
may we also consider how we can share that with the world or how we can

103
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:15,240
based on that that we might

104
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:22,220
offer a more kindness friendliness generosity to the people we encounter

105
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,440
that we somehow walk through the world

106
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:38,419
benefiting the world with how we are friendliness our kindness

107
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:46,140
our respect for others may all beings

108
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:52,440
be happy may all beings be peaceful

109
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:58,320
may all beings be safe

110
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:02,600
and may all beings be free

111
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:09,740
and may we somehow contribute to that possibility

112
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:33,500
thank you

113
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:42,960
foreign welcome to the second talk

114
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,059
on a 10-part series on the the poly word

115
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:53,880
is translated into English as the protectors that which we can rely on or

116
00:30:53,880 --> 00:31:00,600
call upon for a certain kind of protection safeguarding

117
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,700
support and these things support and Safeguard

118
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:13,340
our inner life and our outer life and um it's a way of living in the world

119
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:19,679
protected from harm inner harm that we cause ourselves and outer harm

120
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,899
and um so it's an interesting list that the Buddha came up with for this purpose

121
00:31:24,899 --> 00:31:32,159
yesterday it was a virtuous conduct that if we live with a life that doesn't

122
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:39,960
harm others or harm ourselves there is a kind of protection we're protecting something that is protect worthy in

123
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:46,860
ourselves the sense of Compassion Care respect we have for ourselves and others

124
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:52,380
and also we tend to lessen

125
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:59,279
the anger hostility and even violence that others will

126
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:05,520
harm that others will do to us and um

127
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:11,820
so the today the second from the list is to be

128
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:19,799
well learned and the ancient language the literal meaning is to be to have heard a lot

129
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:27,059
and and why it says that isn't it why it's worded that way is in in the old uh

130
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:35,580
in the time of the Buddha there were no books there were no people weren't reading and um and so the only way for

131
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:42,299
learning something what information was to hear it so to have heard a lot means to be well learned

132
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:49,679
and um and so for people who are doing Buddhist practice this I think this implies that

133
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:57,120
learning learning about Buddhism learning about the Dharma and this can be you know

134
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:02,279
have benefits and be distractions to do this too much learning too much studying

135
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:09,539
of Buddhism and it's a distraction it becomes sometimes an abstract exercise and philosophy and

136
00:33:09,539 --> 00:33:16,980
Doctrine but there are many ways in which learning about the Dharma uh

137
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:22,799
teaches us where to be oriented the values we want to have the practices we

138
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:28,620
want to do the ways of being in the world that protect us from ourselves and

139
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:33,720
protect us from mitigating the possibility of harm from

140
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:40,740
the world around us so for example it's one thing to learn mindfulness it's another thing to learn

141
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:48,480
how mindfulness is integral to the Eightfold Path to write view write intention write

142
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,880
speech right action write livelihood right effort write mindfulness and then

143
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:00,419
right concentration that these learning these and learning how to practice these or bring them

144
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:06,779
forth into our life helps develop the mindfulness more strongly it gives a kind of feat to the

145
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:12,240
mindfulness it also um uh

146
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:18,300
shows us more of what we bring into bring ourselves into the Dharma more

147
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:24,358
completely so that the mindfulness can be more effective it can be more

148
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:30,960
effective in recognizing what's going on inside of us outside of ourselves and so we're living a life a life a

149
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:39,060
lifestyle that is more beneficial so studying the Dharma learned the hateful path provides that kind of support

150
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:44,460
some people come to Buddhism with erroneous ideas

151
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:49,500
some of them which are can be harmful for them I've known people who've come to

152
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:55,378
Buddhism from a religion the religion they grew up with where the

153
00:34:55,379 --> 00:35:01,740
understanding was that if you're part of a religion you had to believe everything the religion said and there was no

154
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,900
questioning it so they come to Buddhism and they think well now I have to believe all of this

155
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:14,400
and some of the summer Buddhism is hard to believe for many people and so then they're struggling and and maybe I can't

156
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,220
be a Buddhist but if you study Buddhism you realize quickly that uh there's no need to

157
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:26,460
believe all of Buddhism that Buddhism has a pragmatic practical side that is

158
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:32,280
the emphasis which is you we study Buddhism in order to help us on the path

159
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:40,380
to Liberation to freedom freedom from attachments and we can a little bit pick and choose within Buddhism what we want

160
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,480
to study what helps us and supports us so I've asked vast supply of teachings

161
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:51,780
and practices in Buddhism and then we are responsible for our own practice and

162
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:58,079
how to navigate the different choices of practice and finding what is most useful for us finding what teachings are most

163
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:04,320
useful for us so for example learning well might be to learn not only mindfulness practice but learn loving

164
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:11,940
kindness practice or compassion practice or Equanimity practice and and then knowing when those are

165
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:18,720
useful to practice and when they're useful to support us um it also helpful to know learn that we

166
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:25,260
don't have to believe all of Buddhism some people come to Buddhism and believe that the precepts are these hard and

167
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:31,320
fast rules that you if you commit yourself to the precepts that if you break them you're kind of doomed it's

168
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:38,820
kind of like you create so much bad karma or sin almost if you again people coming with other religious ideas and

169
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:45,599
and using them to understand Buddhism and in in Buddhism the precepts are

170
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:52,140
actually literally called trainings and so to learn their trainings rather than Commandments can make a huge

171
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:57,720
difference to how people approach Buddhism Buddhist precepts

172
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:04,619
so um part of learning is to learn the

173
00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:11,400
importance of the motivation for which we're practicing and so then learning motivation is very

174
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,800
important then we do the inner work of ourselves what is my motivation is my

175
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:23,400
motivation useful and um and what motivations does Buddhism encourage us to have and why

176
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:28,980
does it want the motivations for example to Liberation Liberation from suffering

177
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:34,380
there are some people who feel like the end of suffering is not really spiritual

178
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:41,460
even it's the end of suffering is nice it's therapeutic but it doesn't connect us to what they think is a spiritual

179
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:47,040
world of deities or Cosmic ultimate meanings and

180
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:52,140
different things and number why does Buddhism early Buddhism put such a big emphasis on the

181
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:57,599
end of suffering as being really the ultimate goal of the practice

182
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,119
and so that might you really know that can give can help kind of refine how a

183
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:09,359
person's involved in Buddhism or maybe decide that Buddhism is not for them they have other purposes they want and

184
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:15,960
there's other completely worthwhile religious practices orientations that the person could have but by learning

185
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:22,320
learning the teachings of Buddhism studying them then a person can know oh this is actually not for me and I think

186
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:29,820
I would rather have some other approach to how to live my life so um to study Buddhist to study to

187
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:36,180
study well and also in daily life to not take things on

188
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:44,040
on faith to not read something or learn something and have opinions about it

189
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:50,339
without having studied it I know in my life I've had opinions about things that I actually didn't know

190
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:57,359
so much about and then I felt quite um kind of uh

191
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:02,520
you know kind of you know quite

192
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,940
concerned about myself that I would do this and so one of the purposes of

193
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:14,280
reading and studying is so that we don't rely on unfounded opinion even if

194
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:23,099
opinions seem logical or seem like a lot of people believe them there are all kinds of opinions opinions

195
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:30,660
that travel around our society around politics and and economics and racism and all kinds

196
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:36,359
of things some of these opinions and ideas don't even present themselves as opinions and

197
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:42,119
ideas they're presented as the truth and if some person of authority says them then they must be true

198
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:50,220
but to go behind underneath and see where does the ideas come from and what history do they have

199
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:55,320
and it doesn't mean you have to do an extensive study of something but even if

200
00:39:55,320 --> 00:40:00,660
even a small study of a kind of a summary of some of the background for

201
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:06,440
some of the opinions people have can be eye-opening and it can be a safeguarding the truth

202
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:11,820
safeguarding ourselves from holding on to opinions tightly Without Really

203
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:17,400
knowing or if we keep the opinion then we're better informed and so then we're

204
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,500
safeguarding the truth the thing when we say I have this on

205
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:29,720
um you know I believe this because I read it in this book or heard this teacher say it I believe it because I've

206
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:35,940
reasoned it out my reasoning leads me to believe this you know so the the Buddha emphasized

207
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:42,660
some something called safeguarding the truth being really clear about the basis upon which you have an opinion or a

208
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:51,359
belief that's the same it's true for Buddhism itself on what basis do you believe uh your your beliefs

209
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:58,619
this is something you know from experience is something you know from a book um and so to say that as opposed to saying

210
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:04,859
Buddhism says or the Buddha said you can say the Buddha said in a particular

211
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:10,740
and uh and it kind of creates a little context for what you're what you're doing

212
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:17,220
so uh uh I like to think that this uh teaching

213
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:25,560
on um learning a lot learning well uh is away from not a way of becoming

214
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:31,560
complicated and filling our head with ideas but it's guided with the idea that if

215
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:37,859
you study well it actually allows the the mind to become simpler quieter not

216
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:43,460
simplistic but uh wisely simple wisely uh

217
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:48,619
uh appreciating the depth and the great value

218
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:56,099
of showing up with the Simplicity of being with mindfulness and Care in situations

219
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:01,280
of all the situations in our life and so safeguarding

220
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,780
our inner Simplicity of being or any inner sense

221
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:14,099
of being at home with ourselves at peace with ourselves and something study to learn a little

222
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:21,060
bit about oh the beliefs we have that take us away from that and understanding a little bit how it's

223
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:26,400
appropriate to find a Simplicity of being to rest in and to be with

224
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:31,500
that there's so much goodness that flows from that and then the Simplicity of

225
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:39,500
being that protects some of the most beautiful qualities of Who We Are and so they can be shared with the world

226
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:45,780
so um I do recommend that people who want to

227
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:51,000
do a regular Buddhist practice spend a little bit of time sometimes studying Buddhism

228
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:58,020
getting the basic ideas and one of the consequences of that is that even if we

229
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:05,160
don't understand all the teachings now as the practice continues as we our practice matures we'll be able to

230
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:12,780
identify and recognize what's happening to us because we have the language the context the concepts to oh this is good

231
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:18,420
this is what's happening so one example was that um

232
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:25,020
um you know uh I had learned a little bit about meta kindness loving kindness just the ideas

233
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:30,839
of it and at some point in my meditation practice on Retreat this unusual feeling

234
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:36,839
arose up in me and at first I didn't know what it was and then but because I had learned about loving kindness which

235
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:42,720
I had no idea about before I started Buddhism I said oh this is what it is

236
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:49,079
and having that simple recognition made it come alive and really let it grow for

237
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:54,660
me so part of the purpose of being well studied in Buddhism

238
00:43:54,660 --> 00:44:00,720
well enough is to learn the basic ideas so that when it's appropriate we can

239
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,119
recognize them and see how they grow in US so for and again when one example would

240
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:13,020
be to learn what the seven factors of Awakening are and then it's as you practice at some

241
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:19,920
point each of these seven factors of Awakening might appear for you and you can wreck oh this is what it is that

242
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:26,339
this is useful this is something to safeguard so um

243
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:32,720
so these of these 10 protectors the second one now is being a

244
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,940
well-studied well learned and um and then I'll continue with this series

245
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:42,500
tomorrow thank you
