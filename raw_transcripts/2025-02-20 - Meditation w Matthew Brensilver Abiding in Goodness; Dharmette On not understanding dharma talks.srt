1
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,920
when the Dal Lama said uh that kindness and

2
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:27,920
compassion are Necessities not luxuries

3
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:33,840
what uh did he

4
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,239
mean discover the the necessity of

5
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:04,080
love in the baren desolate Landscapes

6
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,840
of hate misattunement

7
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:45,200
when the heart's been drying out in the sun or

8
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,759
uh becoming more brittle the

9
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,759
intensity life

10
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,920
the heart's been living in a kind of state of

11
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:15,400
forgetfulness around the necessity of kindness compassion

12
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,040
love it uh can be very powerful just have a

13
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,000
moment of reunification with love

14
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,680
our whole body

15
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,959
can and quiver with it

16
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:35,680
the Mind goes to work figuring out how to trace out the implications of our

17
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,040
love what to do in the face of the the

18
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,319
enormity

19
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:56,400
hate just put down those details for now those

20
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,040
details of the effect of dampening the brightness of the

21
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,879
love don't worry in other words about anything except caring for your

22
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,400
heart in this

23
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,759
moment the only nourishment for your

24
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,720
heart it's wisdom and love

25
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
for

26
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,680
e e

27
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:30,120
without uh flirting with any tribalism sense of homogeneity of this

28
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:37,280
group we can say can take

29
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,560
some Refuge the fact that

30
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:55,039
um sa is uh gathered

31
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,199
around uh commitment to goodness

32
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,440
to

33
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,840
nonharming to restraint and care

34
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:40,319
part of why s feels good is

35
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:48,520
uh this um mutuality and the sense of uh oh this is

36
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,440
a an ethical

37
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:03,039
culture a little community within

38
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,440
society that uh is trying not

39
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,080
to trespass on the hearts of others

40
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,760
whatever goodness means to you

41
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,440
abide in

42
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:14,600
it an image or word or

43
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:28,480
phrase uh kind of vibrational frequency in your own body heart

44
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:43,760
just abide one form of or another abide

45
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,760
in

46
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
love

47
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

48
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

49
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,279
e e

50
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:33,240
there's a recognition that um every movement of

51
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,480
uh our mind and

52
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:47,720
body uh expresses this longing to be

53
00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:02,920
happy and yes some of those movements are unwise May maybe they don't work out

54
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,959
but this uh thread of longing to be

55
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:18,880
well runs through the entirety of our life

56
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,120
and the recognition of that engender a tremendous amount

57
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,760
of compassion for ourselves

58
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:08,000
one who loves thems that budha says uh will not harm

59
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:16,360
another CU it does not take much work to trace out the

60
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,199
implications of our own

61
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:30,839
experience to recognize

62
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:39,199
how urgently all beings long to be

63
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,360
well safe protected

64
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:12,800
so we kind of melt into

65
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:20,360
uh web of uh billions of beings

66
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,199
abiding in a sense of goodness ringing the bell of Love

67
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:49,959
reminding our self Moment by moment of its

68
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
necessity

69
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

70
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

71
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

72
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,840
e e

73
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,880
sometimes touching into

74
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:45,279
goodness is uh like

75
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:54,400
grief and sometimes like ecstasy

76
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:20,840
just stay uh close in

77
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:44,799
strong back soft front Joan alifa says

78
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:05,080
the fleshy underside of our bodies that we

79
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:13,919
call our face and chest and

80
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,320
belly

81
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:37,600
soft but the trust courage confidence that love Eng

82
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,679
genders the strong

83
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
back

84
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

85
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

86
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
e e

87
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:19,760
sometimes love feels like love and sometimes love just lets you feel whatever it is that

88
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,480
needs to be

89
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,480
felt e

90
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,799
either way we come

91
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:12,520
to something like a very deep Faith In

92
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
Love

93
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

94
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

95
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

96
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

97
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,240
e e

98
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:24,710
[Music]

99
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,159
e

100
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:59,360
so I got a uh an you know uh anonymous questions I quite

101
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:07,840
quite moving uh to read your your questions and um just answering one but

102
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:13,240
uh maybe we'll get to others certainly they they inform how I'm thinking about

103
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:21,440
the the group so this person um said um said

104
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,600
sometimes your talks uh resonate so strongly it's as though I already knew

105
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,120
and understand all along and you just brought it to the light but then there

106
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,960
are talks that feel out of my reach teasingly standing just outside the

107
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:45,880
realm of my understanding making me feel like I'd missed an important class and I wish

108
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:51,399
there were a Makeup Session I could have attended which brings me to my question

109
00:29:51,399 --> 00:30:00,320
of whether there are there are makeup classes in the forms of readings or books transcripts

110
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,480
of previous talks in some accessible order you could suggest to bring some of

111
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,120
um more complex teachings Within

112
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:19,760
Reach so first off I don't know if I'm

113
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:26,760
teaching the right way you know who who even knows how to do

114
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:33,960
this you you can kind of follow uh the the Buddha's model and

115
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:42,159
pedagogical advice but in the end you have to make a million in any Dharma talk a million

116
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:48,679
editorial decisions and uh teachers can can merely

117
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:55,039
Express their particular loves as best they

118
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:03,240
can and so I don't know if I'm teaching the right way and just because certain ways

119
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:10,960
of teaching get reinforced by the SAA you know doesn't mean they're

120
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:20,240
optimal like sometimes I wonder maybe I should be tougher much

121
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,919
tougher and then I think but I don't want to and then I'm

122
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:31,158
not but maybe I should

123
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:38,360
be so you know that's kind of like the footnote on all of

124
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:48,480
this there's a kind of uh sincerity in the the question that I found U sort of

125
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,760
charming and uh everything beautiful that happens on

126
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:02,320
this path depends on sincerity and by

127
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:08,320
sincerity I I mean a kind of true willingness to be surprised by one's

128
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,320
Mind by the path and the person says yeah I

129
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:20,559
understood that all along that is that's right that's how Dharma recognition

130
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:28,559
feels something kind of Clicks in and

131
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:35,639
the knowledge feels like remembering knowledge feels like

132
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:43,320
remembering and it's a very very intimate experience to have

133
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:49,919
one's mind spoken plainly by by a stranger and that's an

134
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,480
experience I've had many uh many times as a practitioner you know sitting with

135
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:03,440
a teacher teacher says something and it feels like they're

136
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,679
almost like they're in my mind and that can

137
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:14,039
feel um that kind of like

138
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:20,000
intermingling of beings can feel very

139
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,600
intimate and because that can feel so

140
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:32,440
boundaryless all the other boundaries are so

141
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:41,799
important and it's um it's easy to confuse the the the messenger for the

142
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:50,679
message Dharma teachers kind of all kinds of credit that uh belongs to the

143
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:57,960
Dum so yes there's knowing recognition knowledge as a kind

144
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:03,240
of remembering and there's not

145
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:09,760
knowing there are parts that um that won't be understood and what I

146
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:16,398
say or what other teachers say but the recognition of non- understanding is

147
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:23,200
itself an expression of wisdom to

148
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:29,158
know and respect what one doesn't understand that that

149
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:33,679
is kind of Hallmark of

150
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:43,280
sincerity this um Agnes kard book I mentioned to the um the the dayong on uh

151
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:51,000
Sunday um on uh Socratic dialogue and um

152
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,800
investigation and uh she writes um it's not hard to admit that you were wrong

153
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:06,520
wrong but very hard to admit that you are wrong it is not clear how someone is

154
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:13,160
supposed to ask a question to which she thinks she has an

155
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:18,839
answer when she is currently using that answer to guide her

156
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:26,720
life she's not going to solve the branch she's standing on

157
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:34,440
Dharma practice um involves sawing branches

158
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:41,680
sincerity sawing branches yeah how is one one supposed to ask a

159
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,760
question to which she thinks she has an answer that answer is currently required

160
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,319
for her living but Dharma practitioners and we

161
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:59,640
we see the kind of epidemic of uh

162
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:09,200
overconfidence uh the crisis that actually creates but Dharma practitioners live

163
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:16,400
with an abiding sense of suspect I'm

164
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:25,760
wrong I suspect there are real limits to my wisdom I suspect

165
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:32,640
that my pain in one way way or another distorts my

166
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,000
view and accordingly we have to hedge

167
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,400
sometimes knowing the kesas that our own pain

168
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,559
Infuse infuses our

169
00:36:51,000 --> 00:37:00,280
view when I um when I first got into practice I was too too knowing kind of

170
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:05,520
uh arrogance and

171
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:11,800
um it took me I was sort of like unprepared to be surprised in a way it

172
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:17,800
took me a little bit of time to get my Dharma sea legs and then survey the

173
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:24,960
terrain and the conclusion was like oh my God I don't know

174
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:31,440
anything you know just gazing at the kind of ocean of

175
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:39,520
Dharma so humbled by my ignorance and energized by the

176
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:48,640
possibility of learning and there was a lot of aliveness and so many kind of dramatic

177
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:53,800
discoveries as early years of practice and it felt like my life kind of hinged

178
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:59,520
on understanding more I was living a ordinary life was

179
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:06,599
not a monastic or something but it felt like I know this is the

180
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:14,720
priority and it was really a kind of um a process of falling in love with the

181
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:20,359
Dharma and uh delighting in the revelation of

182
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:25,039
my own ignorance

183
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,200
callard highlights like that one of the um characteristics of Socratic

184
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:40,800
dialogue you know that that Socrates apparently like would be as delighted to

185
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,880
be proven wrong as to prove the other wrong the point is the learning not the

186
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:52,280
being right and so

187
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:58,599
now 24 years after beginning practice

188
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:04,240
um I've been practicing exactly half my

189
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,960
life kind of wild

190
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:17,800
uh things have evened out and some of the dramatic discoveries

191
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:24,160
of the first decade have yielded to more sense of cruising

192
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:31,319
altitude but um sometimes I get too comfortable in my

193
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:39,520
knowing and then my own practice or especially spiritual

194
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:46,920
friendship or students saying things or the world shakes something

195
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:52,560
up and the rugs pulled out and practice is

196
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:58,680
a kind of dialectic between making a comfortable Dharma home [Music]

197
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:06,200
we can't live without a nest you know some of the

198
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,599
time and then the rug being pulled

199
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:19,079
out so part of what I'm saying here to you to you to whoever asked the

200
00:40:19,079 --> 00:40:24,280
question is um is to enjoy the not

201
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:33,520
knowing and your hunger to stand is a very wholesome

202
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:40,640
engine for practice for growth goodness will surely come of

203
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:49,078
it a way it's kind of like the most important ingredient in

204
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:55,520
that and no there are no makeup

205
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,839
classes and uh be

206
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:08,880
patient be patient you kind of can't swallow the Dharma in one Gulp and

207
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,160
there's no cramming for wisdom you know it it

208
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:21,720
kind of just ripens and the circadian rhythms of

209
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:28,480
wisdom are not observable to oneself

210
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:39,599
so patience and when

211
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,359
um I give a a

212
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:52,960
talk I don't need you to understand me I just want you to believe

213
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:58,960
me and understanding that can come whenever you

214
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:06,839
have time I do want you to believe me and believing someone before you

215
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:13,160
understand them a kind of cognitive dissonance opens

216
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:19,440
up and the Dharma flows into that

217
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:27,079
Gap so offer this for your uh consideration

218
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:40,839
um okay folks good to uh good to be with you and

219
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:47,040
