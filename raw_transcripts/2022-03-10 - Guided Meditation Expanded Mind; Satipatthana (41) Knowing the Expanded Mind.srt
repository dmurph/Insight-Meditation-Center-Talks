1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:09,360
so good day everyone and i'm happy to be back i don't know how many of you noticed that

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:16,080
the tuesday and wednesday recordings were the broadcasts were pre-recorded

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:22,480
i i had to go away for a couple of days fun

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:30,480
i had to go off a couple of days to accompany my wife on her

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:39,520
that trip and now i'm back and now it's literally live

6
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,600
so continuing on this

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,039
theme of sati patana there's a paradigm shift that happens as

8
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,840
we do this practice especially the the third

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,640
foundation and that is that we go from a fragmented mind

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,320
to a mind that becomes whole inclusive

11
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:15,759
that a fragmented mind is a mind that uh well one of the things that fragments the mind is excessive preoccupation with

12
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:22,400
desire beginning with any preoccupation any singular focus kind of being caught up

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,798
in desire the mind is limited by the desire

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,400
preoccupation with ill will or aversion and the mind is limited by that and is

15
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,119
narrowed and the scope has become smaller and same thing with delusion

16
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:50,640
with mindfulness we're beginning to expand the scope of the mind of awareness to become not absorbed in

17
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,680
in great hatred and delusion absorbed in the hindrances but rather becoming broader wider

18
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,680
stronger bigger to be able to include all those but not

19
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,440
be limited by them and then at some point the paradigm shift is when we have a sense of the

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,360
mind as a whole the wholeness and how good that feels how satisfying it is and

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,360
how comforting or at home it is to be at home in the in the kind of the

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,200
wide broad inclusive mind and it's a it's a

23
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,319
kind of a it's a kind of a big shift because there can be so much authority

24
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:39,200
so much pull into the world of desires and aversions

25
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,959
and the hindrances and they can feel so compelling i feel like that's the right place to be that's

26
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,720
appropriate it's justified and and

27
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,720
and so and to pull ourselves out of that world is quite difficult

28
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,760
because the the habit of it the pull of it is so strong the insistence of it

29
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,840
but as the sati patana deepens we are able to no longer be limited or caught

30
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:15,599
up in that limited world and start becoming aware of a shift to something that's more holistic

31
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:22,640
sometimes called the expanded mind or a big mind and that can include everything

32
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:31,799
in its scope so so we'll sit a little bit with this

33
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,400
to assume a meditation posture

34
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:45,159
where the posture is the beginning of a shift away from the

35
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:48,799
preoccupations of the mind

36
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,920
to something broad or wider more inclusive

37
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:06,560
kind of like going from uh cooped up in a small little room

38
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,120
beginning to go outdoors wide open

39
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:20,000
so the body can be beginning of that shift assuming a upright posture

40
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,720
sitting strong and present

41
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:40,800
and to take some care to awaken awareness in your body

42
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:49,520
beginning by taking some long slow deep breaths feeling the rib cage stretch and expand

43
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,720
the belly expand as you inhale

44
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,160
and relax

45
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,478
relaxing your body as you exhale

46
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,639
and then letting your breathing return to normal

47
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,960
and allowing your awareness to roam around your body

48
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,520
feeling the different parts of your body

49
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,479
in a way to awaken them or to welcome them into the wholeness

50
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,759
of being here and now

51
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,840
and perhaps as you exhale

52
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,720
to relax more in your body

53
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,479
and as you relax to feel the effect of the relaxing

54
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,800
and then breathing normally and

55
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,199
settling into the experience of breathing

56
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,160
just enough that it highlights any ways in which you are

57
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,440
being pulled into the world of thought

58
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:34,800
and perhaps you can notice if you pulled into thoughts and ideas stories and memories

59
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:43,199
commentary that your attention might become limited

60
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,560
by those concerns

61
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:58,280
and there's a way that if you let go of them relax a thinking mind

62
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,360
you become aware of more than your preoccupation

63
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,919
aware of your body

64
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,120
aware of the state of your mind

65
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:40,039
is the mind contracted or expanded is it scattered or settled

66
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,800
is it possible too is the mind

67
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,320
tight or is it loose and open

68
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,920
is it receptive

69
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,120
or closed

70
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,519
okay

71
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,800
and settling into your breathing

72
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,959
every exhale relax relaxing the mind and letting go

73
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,760
of your thoughts

74
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:04,959
every exhale relaxing every inhale receiving

75
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,399
the experience of breathing

76
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:45,519
if you're involved in your thoughts see if you can

77
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,959
realize and even feel maybe

78
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,880
what is beyond the edges of your thinking

79
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,839
if your thinking has a lot of desire or aversion in it

80
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:21,079
the desire and aversion doesn't fill the universe it's in you

81
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:27,360
in the mind awareness can be expand beyond the edges of desire

82
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,160
the edges of aversion

83
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:52,560
and as you breathe let the breathing expand inhale expand

84
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:59,680
outward in this into this wider world

85
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:08,720
massaging an awareness that's larger

86
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,040
more inclusive than any particular thing

87
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:22,399
in a sense your mind or your awareness

88
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,839
can feel like it's as

89
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:37,560
extends as far away as the furthest sound that you hear

90
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,040
if all the sounds for the sound

91
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,880
occurs within the sphere

92
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,800
of perception

93
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:01,759
on the exhale relax any tension or contraction in the mind

94
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,079
in the brain

95
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,720
the mind becomes broad and still

96
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,679
like the broad and still morning lake

97
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,480
in the windless quiet dawn

98
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:44,400
if you're involved in any thoughts right now see if you can shift your allegiance

99
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,320
from thinking to awareness

100
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:59,760
maybe a broad wide awareness that is able to and willing

101
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:07,280
to be aware of whatever is happening in the senses hearing

102
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,240
smelling tasting touching

103
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,159
seeing even with the inner eye

104
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:34,919
an awareness that's open and wide and receptive

105
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:41,679
to the degree that you're you are relaxed now calm or

106
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:48,799
peaceful does the relaxed state or the peaceful

107
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,120
state calm state

108
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,600
is it contracted more contracted or more expanded

109
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:11,200
is it more a very small little thing or does it have a feeling of being

110
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:18,159
large or not without strong boundaries

111
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,159
edges

112
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:50,919
and if you're aware of some more expanded state of being

113
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:59,200
might you recognize that it is more inclusive or expanded

114
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,960
than preoccupation with any kinds of thinking

115
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:15,960
more expansive and open than any fixation on desire or aversion

116
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,360
and that there's more room for all of who you are

117
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,240
in the relaxed expanded awareness

118
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:51,840
and then to whatever degree that you're calm

119
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:59,360
see if you can now expand the scope of your knowing your awareness

120
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:06,080
your consideration for the people in your lives

121
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,640
your life

122
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:18,880
the people that you will read about in the news the people you'll see in your neighborhoods

123
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:26,559
in your communities and see if they can be included

124
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:34,360
in relaxed awareness relax consideration

125
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,799
and in this open relaxed state

126
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:59,320
to have thoughts of goodwill well-wishing for others

127
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:07,840
thoughts about how it would be quite wonderful if others could be happy and safe

128
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,960
peaceful and free

129
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,880
may all beings be happy

130
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:25,559
may all beings be safe

131
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:33,679
may all beings be peaceful

132
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,480
and may all beings be free

133
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:47,279
and to the degree to which we have an open relaxed awareness

134
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,360
may we have that as the medium through which we contribute to the

135
00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:01,000
welfare and happiness of all beings may all beings be happy

136
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:13,699
[Music]

137
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,039
so hello everyone and

138
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,240
so we're now continue continuing to talk about the third foundation of mindfulness

139
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:42,159
but i would like to point out that in the second third and fourth each of them

140
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:48,320
as the as a description of the practice unfolds there is a shift

141
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,080
and i like to think of each of these three as being progressive or describing a

142
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:00,399
little journey that meditator takes and the second foundation

143
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:05,840
one begins by just becoming aware of the feeling tone of experience pleasant

144
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,679
unpleasant or neutral as we settle in and become more familiar with it more sensitive

145
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,279
we're able then to distinguish between those things which are pleasant of the flesh and those which are not of the

146
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,640
flesh that which is um in the part of the sensual world of mind

147
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:29,039
and body and those which are more spiritual in nature and so we're making a shift this journey

148
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:35,360
from one into the other as we deepen the practice in the second foundation and the third

149
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,640
foundation uh we begin by becoming aware of a mind that's accompanied with great hate and

150
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,200
delusion and then there's a a journey from that state of mind into

151
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,880
what can be called more meditative or spiritual states of mind and

152
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:59,600
and that's what the last four pairs of mind states are

153
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:05,360
but if this journey through uh from these uh mind states that are characterized by great hatred and

154
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:12,240
delusion um have an intermediate kind of a stepping stone to it

155
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,640
and that is this uh the fourth one uh fourth of the of the eight pairs

156
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:25,440
the fourth one is that um is um

157
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,080
um a scattered mind or a contracted mind

158
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,559
when the mind is not caught up in greed hatred and delusion anymore it's sometimes a little bit lost to have

159
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:44,480
great hit and delusion is always to have some focus of attention some concern something that we want

160
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:51,440
something we don't want something we're confused about and and the degree to which we're

161
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:58,240
focused on this object of thought this object of concern it limits the mind

162
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:05,440
the language of the buddha is it's a limitation for awareness of the mind the mind becomes smaller contracted its

163
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:12,240
scope becomes very sometimes very very narrow we can feel the mind gets kind of tight and narrow and just preoccupied

164
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:18,080
with one thing and and it can even feel pleasant a lot of

165
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:25,120
good energy or strong energy compelling energy habit energy around desires and around aversions and

166
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:31,279
around the illusion and the mind just kind of goes into it like because it's like like a black hole

167
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:37,840
where a strong gravitational pull pulls us into this and it can feel so natural so normal

168
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:44,880
that we don't realize how the impact it has on us and how we don't realize so easily that there's another

169
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,080
whole option when the mind is no longer focused on

170
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:56,000
objects these objects in this kind of narrow constricted or forceful way

171
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:02,880
um then it's there's a mind goes through a transition sometimes where it's a little bit confused not quite sure

172
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,878
what what to focus on or what to do it's kind of like if if

173
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:15,599
desires and aversions and delusions are kind of like caffeine it keeps us energized

174
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,720
when we stop taking the caffeine the mind goes through a period of adjustment

175
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:25,919
and that period of adjustment is the mind can either doesn't have a particular object that is particularly

176
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:33,440
concerned with but the mind hasn't developed its capacity for subtle concentrated presence

177
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:38,878
and so the mind then can get scattered just jumps around kind of looking for something to be concerned with but not

178
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:44,079
enough focus to really settle on anything the mind becomes scattered

179
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:52,398
or the mind just comes shrunken it just sinks in on itself sloth and torpor sets in kind of

180
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:57,520
giving up or kind of like deflation that could happen

181
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,359
and so without greed hidden delusion sometimes it's deflation sometimes there's scatteredness of mind

182
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:09,520
restlessness of the mind that can happen but we keep practicing we keep

183
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:16,800
you know it can feel like things are going backwards because where mind is all scattered jumping around or more deflated and and

184
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:23,359
shrunken but it's actually a transition time sometimes we have to go through it be patient with it and just be willing to

185
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,800
breathe with it and be aware of it and then at some point the some of the

186
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,520
fruits of practice come into play in the first one it says in this third foundation

187
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,720
one knows an expanded mind as an expanded mind and one knows a

188
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:46,400
non-expanded mind is a non-expanded mind mahachita could also mean big mind one

189
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,160
knows a big mind so here mind

190
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:59,440
in the in the earlier exercises one knows a mind accompanied by desire as a mind accompanied by desire accompanied

191
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:06,560
by a version as accompanied by a version that the mindfulness shows us or creates a

192
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:15,680
wider context of the mind to be aware of desires and aversions so the desired version doesn't kind of take over fully

193
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:21,200
um and so desiring a version just part of the mind it's big influence on every

194
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:28,480
part in the in this transition after this this contracted or restless

195
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,320
mind there comes this time when the mind starts be feeling expensive

196
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:40,720
open wide large because the mind and awareness

197
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:48,560
become more and more closely linked rather than or overlap or coterminous

198
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:54,320
and and now we can almost talk as synonyms that awareness and mind become almost

199
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,440
the same that awareness becomes broad and expensive that can be include

200
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,040
everything and this idea of an inclusive awareness

201
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,320
an open mind open set of perceptions that everything

202
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:17,119
that happens is allowed to appear in its own time in the field of perception in the world

203
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:23,680
of what we perceive and there's not a for or against our experience is there's not a preference

204
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,599
for one thing over another the preference is to not for the object of attention not

205
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:36,480
for the thing that we're aware of but the preference is to rest in this wide or calm awareness

206
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,400
the awareness that can receive things in a relaxed way

207
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,079
it can know things in a relaxed acts do i perceive and

208
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:54,000
and so in the language of the buddha when we're too concerned with some

209
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:01,520
purpose then the mind is limited by that purpose if the if we're not constricted by a

210
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:07,839
purpose or if the purpose in a sense is to just relax and open up

211
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:13,040
then the mind is not limited anymore it's not bounded it's not con contracted

212
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,560
it's not tight and narrow and it becomes broader and wider kind of

213
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:25,839
like the feeling maybe that if you're inside a small teen little cabin for a long time and all claustrophobic

214
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:31,680
and you go out into the wide open fields open space you know maybe high in the

215
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,760
mountains with a great vista there's something an expansive feeling that

216
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:43,280
arises certainly that the vista is expensive but something like uh opens up in the

217
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:50,400
mind in the heart that makes it also kind of like a breath of fresh air it's kind of expansiveness that it takes as

218
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:57,760
well so you don't have to sit go out to a great vista point to see

219
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:04,160
a great view to feel the mind become expensive even with the eyes closed the mind

220
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,520
becomes quite expensive quite large because

221
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:15,040
it's its nature to be that way it's uh it's how it is

222
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:21,599
awareness is consciousness is when um it's not being channeled into particular

223
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,880
direction it's not being held and contracted or being used to focus on a

224
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,240
particular thought a particular concern a particular desire or aversion

225
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,760
and so to be able to drop the limitations in the mind the contractions of the mind

226
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,839
and that's why a calm meditative state for many people the mind begins to feel

227
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:49,200
kind of expensive or large or peaceful broad

228
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:55,760
and and so here we begin this journey now into more spiritual states or dharma

229
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:01,760
states whereas greed hate and delusion those mind states

230
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,680
are not particularly not particularly dharmic not dharmic at all

231
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,920
the awareness that can include everything and be broad enough is dharmic

232
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,440
and kind of paired up paradoxically or ironically it can also include

233
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,520
the presence of greed hate and delusion nothing is but the difference is that the mind is

234
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:32,640
not contracted or focused on greed hate and delusion it just knows it's there but in this

235
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,640
wide field just one thing about many we're not identified with it we're not prioritizing it we're not

236
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:45,280
bothered by it caught a continent in its grip and uh and this idea the mind that's not

237
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,480
caught by anything does not doesn't stop for anything doesn't get involved with

238
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:56,560
anything entangled with anything is abe the mind that's just able to allow things to arise

239
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:02,720
and pass to be there when they're there but without being for or against

240
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:10,000
and that begins that begins a feeling of a mind that's whole a holistic mind

241
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,720
and this is one of the great delights and pleasures of meditation starting to feel more and more whole

242
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:24,240
that we feel whole our whole sense of beingness feels more holistic and we come into our wholeness

243
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,520
rather than the contractedness or the or the narrowness of particular

244
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:36,079
preoccupations and concerns and how to make that transition

245
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:41,280
from desire and aversion to this expanded state

246
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,560
it really helps if we no longer

247
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,800
are convinced or not us but maybe our mind convinced that what's important is to

248
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:59,520
pursue desires what's important is to be involved in aversion that or even get what's important is to

249
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:05,680
kind of be constantly preoccupied with our delusions our thoughts our confusions

250
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,040
about things all those who can feel how that limits us

251
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:17,760
and to begin relaxing and softening and opening is until we feel like

252
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:25,359
everything is included all of who we are has a place all of who we are has a respected place

253
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:30,960
in awareness and consciousness this is a game changer for people who do

254
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:37,200
meditation and over time it begins realizing we're actually much better off

255
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,359
in this peaceful state than in the desire state in the wanting state or the aversive state

256
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:49,119
and so if you have um you know if you have a half an hour free in the evening

257
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:54,240
and you have uh you know there's a common desire you get

258
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:00,480
pulled into but instead of that you go and meditate or go for a walk and do something that

259
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:05,839
allows you to kind of tap into this expanded state you might find that it's

260
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:11,800
much more pleasant much more satisfying in the long run

261
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:17,680
so um we'll continue tomorrow on this third foundation

262
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:23,440
this these dharma states that opened up in the last four exercises

263
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:28,880
and i want to make an announcement so

264
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:36,880
imc now has started a fundraising drive to support refugees who are fleeing ukraine now

265
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,400
they're supposed to be close to 2 million or so and and the organization that we're

266
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:49,200
supporting is save the children for a number of reasons one is there's a there's a little bit of a personal

267
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:55,599
connection to that they're one of the highest rated charities i think in the world they've been around for a hundred years

268
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:01,520
and they're involved in the ground in some of the refugee camps and some of the reception centers um

269
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:09,839
on the borders uh ukraine offering care for some of the most vulnerable people the children and the

270
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,680

271
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:21,040

272
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:28,480
and the way to do it is that on the what's new page on the home page of imc's website

273
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,240
there's a there's a section in the bottom right called what's new and there there's notice about

278
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:06,400
thirty thousand dollars which was quite impressive and maybe we can do something similar maybe even more

279
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:11,680
