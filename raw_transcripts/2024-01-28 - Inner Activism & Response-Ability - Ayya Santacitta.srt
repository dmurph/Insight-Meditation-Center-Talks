1
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:07,799
and I'm I'm trying and I'm going to do a little bit of a different sequence just a settling in meditation a

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,960
few minutes and then a a a reflection and then a guided meditation

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,080
to illustrate you know and bring into our experience what I'm speaking

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:33,640
about so you're allowing your breath to take you into the

5
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,480
body and arriving here at the

6
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
IMC

7
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,640
and you know taking a screenshot and seeing what are you bringing what are you bringing with you

8
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,400
today you feel a little bit you know stressed or you feel tired or you feel

9
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,560
energized just noticing how you

10
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,840
feel

11
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:43,920
and then I know that you're here with so many others in this welcoming

12
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,280
space maybe you here many many times before maybe it's your first time

13
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,840
here

14
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,800
and a landing

15
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,760
here

16
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,760
for

17
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:23,640
and noticing the weight of the body on the cushion or on the

18
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:31,560
chair the gravity which is you gently pulling you towards the

19
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:39,000
Earth underneath this building then showing us where the work

20
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,400
lies and know the work is

21
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:56,200
embodied and our bodies are instruments and

22
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:03,599
of sensing our present moment

23
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,920
experience rather than thinking about

24
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
it

25
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:06,199
so a few months ago you know an has asked me what I would like to speak about

26
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:13,919
today and uh I said like to speak about inner activism and response ability you

27
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:23,120
know the ability to respond from a connected place not from just you know

28
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:30,600
from the thinking mind but from our full being understanding that our body is

29
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,919
actually a direct line into a much

30
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:42,479
bigger intelligence which you know we can call

31
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,280
Planet Earth which is a self-

32
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,280
regulating intelligent process and you know at this time in

33
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:01,479
history it calls out to us in many ways you know to get our

34
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,240
tension you know as we are coming more and more to the

35
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:14,000
limitations of what the biosphere can sustain with the amount of you know

36
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,639
human beings are living on the planet and how they live and in particular you

37
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,740
know in the so-called U Global North the the

38
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:30,199
[Music] living style is is taking a

39
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:36,280
very big toall on on the resources and you know all of us

40
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:44,360
starting to notice this more and more but there's a lot of confusion around how to meet that

41
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:52,680
cording and uh you know how to be able to respond to it

42
00:06:52,840 --> 00:07:00,960
from from a connected Place rather than from uh a disconnected

43
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:08,080
place and of sending us into

44
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,720
numbness into disconnection

45
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,240
into you know just trying to solve the issue from the same level of

46
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:26,120
Consciousness which created it and there's a lot of speaking about

47
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:35,000
this these days you know that that doesn't really work and it needs grounding in direct experience and

48
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,639
uh through the bodies we have you know those um bodies which are made of the

49
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,759
five elements we actually have a direct Lifeline into this much vaster

50
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:53,159
intelligence which we call Planet Earth because these bodies and the planet are

51
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:58,319
consisting of the same elements Earth

52
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:05,039
element Water Element fire element wind element space

53
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:11,080
element and uh you know this is something we might

54
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:19,840
theoretically know but we have to really bring it into our own experience on a regular basis so that

55
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:27,479
this can really start to sink in deeply and through this uh direct

56
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:33,640
experience you know that our assumptions our narrative about who we

57
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,839
are and you know what it means to be alive

58
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:46,279
so that that will change through direct experience and

59
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:54,440
uh you know starting to attune with this truth which is always already you know

60
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:02,399
functioning but it's hidden you know it's kind of hidden in plain view because the way how we are framing our

61
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,320
experience is very much through a narrative of

62
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:17,480
separation and you know then when we hear these callings you know from from the earth

63
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,959
we get triggered you know triggered into numbness and dissociation and feeling

64
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:31,000
you know feeling overwhelmed because there's a sense this is all so much you know we don't know what to

65
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,399
do and all of our systems you know are not

66
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:43,680
really able to do the uh depths of change you know

67
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,360
which is required to turn this around so we have to really work on our

68
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:56,600
[Music] own minds and the narrative you know we tell ourselves

69
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:01,120
about what it is you know to be alive

70
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:14,360
and this you know this inner work you know to do this this connective or reconnective

71
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,560
work this is what I call Inner activism which is the basis for outer activism to

72
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:27,839
be really working well we have to come

73
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:36,040
from a different understanding and that understanding know that these bodies are

74
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,440
actually say we can say they are sacred land you know they are they are pieces

75
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:49,639
of Planet walking around you know as as human bodies because any any life forms

76
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:56,320
you know we can find here they are all emerging out of those elements and then

77
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,680
when the time comes you know they dissolve back into it it's a

78
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:09,120
constant process and we need to do what we can to

79
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,760
recognize that truth you know that we are really not separate we like waves you know on the top of the ocean

80
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,839
emerging and then you know existing for some time and then going back into it

81
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,959
and that you know energetic connection through eating

82
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:33,600
drinking breathing sweating crying going to the

83
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:40,440
bathroom there's a constant exchange

84
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,560
happening and you know that's easily overlooked because what the eyes show

85
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,120
us is kind of looking we're looking like separate entities walking around but if

86
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:58,040
we start contemplating it it starts to sink in you know it starts to change us

87
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,839
and that's exactly I think um what's needed right now you

88
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:10,440
know this willingness to attune to our own bodies in a different way and

89
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:17,519
starting to resonate more and more with the fact you know that these bodies emerge out of the planet and they are

90
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:26,800
part of it in beginning it sounds all a bit kind of you know superfici um artificial

91
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,839
rather and but then you know if we do this meditation which we are soon

92
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:40,440
starting you know it gives us a direct uh taste of that truth and then something else you know

93
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,480
starts to open up just a little bit and then through like a door opening up yeah

94
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,959
or a window opening up and then if you really take an interest and go there and open that door

95
00:12:53,959 --> 00:13:01,360
again and again and uh move into that space more and more it's starts

96
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:07,600
to change our way of thinking and then if our way of thinking

97
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:15,160
changes then of course our speech and our actions will change from there as well so it's a it's a training

98
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:22,320
really and and you know when we start that

99
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:32,079
training like like any meditation training it needs to be done you know on a on a reg basis and then it will slowly

100
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:37,279
but surely have an effect you know on the

101
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,680
way we are we are in the world and uh you know in the Canon we

102
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:50,199
can find the you know the basic teaching of early Buddhism on the four satiana

103
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:56,880
I'm sure all of you have heard of that the four establishments of mindfulness and the first of those four is

104
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,040
meditation on the body and there is three different meditations

105
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:09,600
mentioned and one of them is a meditation on the elements and another one is meditation on the body

106
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:18,199
parts and there's also meditation on death but today in particular I want to attend you know to the meditation on the

107
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:24,040
elements because it's such a you know really straightforward practice and it

108
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:29,279
comes to us from ion age India it's a really ancient practice and it had

109
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:37,399
is a lot of applicability in this day and age you

110
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:42,560
know where we are meeting the limits of the biosphere of

111
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,120
this planet we are part

112
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:53,880
of and you know just reading about it in the newspaper or you know hearing about

113
00:14:53,880 --> 00:15:01,040
it on different channels is is not enough we also really need to bring it into a

114
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,199
direct experience because otherwise it's so easy to just numb out because that's

115
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:12,720
what the system does if it's overwhelmed it just numbs out

116
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:20,199
and you know that's something to respect and uh bring kindness to but it's

117
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:27,560
important to notice it that's not necessary Equanimity but it's a

118
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,160
pulling back because of

119
00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:40,720
overwhelm and and we need to recognize that and bring something to it which can

120
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,279
help us you know to do that work of reconnecting

121
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:55,920
with who we are and what we are called to work with at this point in

122
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,680
history because our practice is always really

123
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:08,399
connected to what's happening right now in the world in our lives in our

124
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:15,120
families in our societies it's

125
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,040
about being able to

126
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:30,519
respond and not react but responding and slowing down and

127
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:39,519
becoming conscious you know of what is there with kindness and

128
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,839
acceptance and

129
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,720
interest and if there's like a sense of you of numbing and and disconnection to not override that and trying you know

130
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:03,279
push through it but just noticing it for for what it is because it is an intelligent

131
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:09,280
response and it's not an you know an a nothing but it is a something it is a

132
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:17,079
mind state which needs to be noticed the inability

133
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:24,319
you know to really connect just know it for what it

134
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:34,480
is and then starting you know to bring in a different way of working with

135
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:44,799
that so that we are you know more and more able to to resonate

136
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:50,799
with that truth you know that we these bodies of ours and the planet Earth are

137
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:56,360
one and the same process and our bodies are so much Huger you know than what we

138
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:03,559
usually think they're deeply deeply

139
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,919
networked with the planet with the more than human

140
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:19,480
world and with all and we are all together in this and we are called

141
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:27,919
to take an interest in that now so that we will be changed you know

142
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,158
from the ground Round Up

143
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:39,000
basically and also you know passing that on to

144
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,919
the younger generations to the Future Generations which hasn't come yet it's a

145
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:50,799
it's a new narrative which is wanting to

146
00:18:50,919 --> 00:18:56,039
be integrated is a you know an evolutionary

147
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:00,320
threshold really

148
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:07,080
where we start to you know see we can no longer put ourselves into the center of

149
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,280
everything we are just one species amongst many

150
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:20,000
species and we all participate in the same process and that's

151
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,080
amazing to consciously you know be on that threshold and to be able

152
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:35,720
to but participate in that shift to be able to support that

153
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:44,159
shift by just individually personally starting to practice in that

154
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:56,039
way and to do it also together with

155
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
others

156
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:13,880
you just you know and when we look back in history there's been so many times you know this

157
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,799
very big you know shift in

158
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,799
in you know that the world view the narrative had to change like and know

159
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:32,120
when we notice that yeah the planet Earth is not in the center of the solar system that was a struggle you know for

160
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:39,039
that to be recognized and to enter the mainstream but it

161
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:49,640
happened well you know at the Times human beings were thinking the Earth is flat and then that changed that was a

162
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:59,480
struggle and now we again on such a threshold you know where there's a big shift building up and and where we are

163
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:08,440
basically you know forced by by circumstances to go

164
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:16,679
deeper to drop deeper you know to take ourselves off

165
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:21,919
the Assumption you know that we can be masters of nature that we can be masters

166
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,360
of this planet that we can control all of this and just coming down to the

167
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:34,520
ground and and noticing that we are not

168
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,960
different than the planet we have Arisen from

169
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,799
it and we are constantly kept

170
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:53,120
Alive by it we are actually it we are this one and the same

171
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:02,120
process and then you know as we are building up

172
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:08,600
that that resonance by tuning to that truth

173
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:16,799
then through that connection you know a response can emerge from that which

174
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,120
is more attuned to

175
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:29,039
reality rather than you know trying to fix it from the same narrative which

176
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,360
created it in the first

177
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:43,039
place so we can just you know start with uh noticing

178
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:50,039
the Breath

179
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,720
Again The Wit

180
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,880
element then the wind element stands for movement and for expansion and

181
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:11,240
contraction and you can sense that in your tsle with the in breath and the out

182
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:26,880
breath so just let you not let the air come in through the

183
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:32,360
nostrils into your lungs and

184
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:37,840
then with the out breath allow it to take you down you know down into the

185
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,440
ground below your

186
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,240
seat like sending down

187
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,880
Roots into the soil

188
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:14,080
just noticing you know if your awareness you know can can go down with

189
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,760
the out breath no no need you know to put

190
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,760
pressure but just noticing whatever is

191
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:35,320
happening and just slowly allow your awareness to drop down with those roots you know

192
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:41,240
meeting the soil any kind of stress or

193
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:47,799
doubt just let it be received by the

194
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:59,600
Earth and meeting all of the other root systems and meyum

195
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:07,880
all of the data flow you know which is happening in the body of the earth which consists you

196
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:14,159
of so many different ancestor beings bodies of

197
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:21,159
humans and animals plant bodies mineral

198
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:31,240
bodies it's an aliveness we are part of

199
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,279
that and if we do not participate in the earthiness of the earth through eating

200
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:48,919
you know different foods which are growing out of the Earth this body cannot live for more

201
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:55,760
than one or two months without taking

202
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:01,679
in that food F building up the

203
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:09,880
body and you know it said within about seven years you know all of the sales of a body are

204
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:17,360
replaced so you've had many bodies since you know came to

205
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,360
this

206
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:29,600
birth you know that in itself is

207
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,880
it's

208
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:47,640
awesome and just you know allowing that vibration of you know by breathing

209
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:53,360
up the earthiness of the earth that direct experience allowing that to

210
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,000
resonate with the Earth element in your own body in the bone

211
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:06,080
the nails the hair the teeth Earth

212
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:14,600
element Earth element internally and Earth element externally

213
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:20,159
is exactly the same Earth element Earth element is

214
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,919
empty empty of a

215
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:33,000
self and just in this wordless way you know just

216
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,080
resonating with

217
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:59,518
that you know and as we are sending down Our Roots we also meet the water element

218
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:07,279
yeah our bodies you know consist about 70 75% of water

219
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:16,360
element all through the body many many different um liquids are cursing

220
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:23,960
through and we can sense it you know in the softness of the Flesh of the

221
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:34,278
body and Water Element stands for cohesion fluidity and

222
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:43,760
wetness and you know the water element in the earth body and also on the surface of the Earth as the rivers and

223
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:50,039
lakes and oceans is exactly the same Water Element

224
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:55,799
as we can find in our bodies in the bloodstream and the other

225
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:04,518
liquids and if we don't you know drink water for 5 days or so the body shuts

226
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,840
down water element is empty empty of a

227
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:23,120
self and we never cut the umbilical cord towards the planet there's a constant

228
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:33,200
Exchange you and allowing the whole system in a

229
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,158
in a wordless way to resonate with

230
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,640
that it's like updating a

231
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,519
computer and these bodies you know they are very sophisticated bio computers we could say and have been developed since

232
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:59,320
over 4 billion years

233
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:14,840
and but just simply you know changing the framework of how we are experiencing

234
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:21,440
that something else you know becomes

235
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:29,240
available information you know starting to inform us our form form gets changed

236
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,080
through that different way

237
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,000
of opening to

238
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,639
experience and then you if we keep continue to go down we also come to the

239
00:30:55,639 --> 00:31:02,720
fire element at the center of this planet there's a lot of

240
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,158
heat and then also we receive a heat from the

241
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:15,360
sun fire

242
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:26,159
element which you know we experiences hot and cold inside the body and outside on the

243
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:33,760
skin where the air you know in the room touches the skin or maybe in the stomach you know

244
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:40,398
maybe you've had breakfast and you can sense the filament that that chesting going

245
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,960
on this these human bodies of ours you know they can only exist in a certain

246
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:55,559
temperature range if it gets too

247
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:03,519
cold freezes is gets too hot it evaporates it's a delicate balance is

248
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:10,080
needed for the body to live and that balance you know on the

249
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:18,799
planet is now starting to get out of sink more and

250
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,840
more because of our

251
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:44,360
lifestyles and we we can uh do something about this when we are

252
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,039
ready

253
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:12,320
so that's we've experienced the V element through the breathing process

254
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:17,840
the Earth element through the stability and the

255
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:24,120
structure of the bones and the vastness and the stability of the

256
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:30,600
planet the water element which you know stands for

257
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:38,480
cohesion and for flow and

258
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,440
wetness and then the fire element hot and

259
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:55,399
cold and then we can come back to the breath

260
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,440
again and really you know consciously

261
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:09,800
breathing up that energy resource you know which is

262
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:17,280
just below our seats that huge vast planet Earth which is a

263
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,320
living being a living

264
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,878
process which calls for our attention at this time

265
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:36,000
and this is a way you know to attend to it with the whole body rather than just

266
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,560
by thinking about it and it's a very

267
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:50,079
helpful balance you know to getting lost completely in thinking and but grounding

268
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:58,599
that in sensing the resonance between the body and the planet

269
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:05,839
and so that integrating more and more the understanding that this is not two different things this is

270
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:12,560
one process and we

271
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:19,000
can draw on that intelligence if you have the humility

272
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,200
you know to go there go down on the

273
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:34,160
ground and the word you know for Earth another word is humus the black very fertile

274
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:40,599
Earth humus and humility and human those three words you

275
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:47,520
know they all have something in common and this is the the humility and

276
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:54,599
needed at this point in history for us to open up to a different intelligence

277
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:58,800
than the intellect

278
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:07,160
humus humility and

279
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,880
human so so no breathing up

280
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:27,599
that the life force the energy

281
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:33,359
and allowing ourselves to be informed by

282
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,960
it through that wordless resonance by attuning to

283
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:49,960
it you might you know experience it in your own body as a as a vibration as an

284
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,680
aliveness

285
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,839
just you know breathing that up breathing that up through the trunk

286
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:11,280
of your

287
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:25,599
body and then through your organs and your

288
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:32,720
neck behind your eyes all the way up to the ground of the

289
00:37:45,319 --> 00:37:50,880
head and then you know you could with the exhalation just opening up the

290
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:58,240
ground of your head

291
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:05,920
and now we can also you know we put out roots into the sky like branches of a

292
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:14,119
tree because he is also energetically very much connected with

293
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,079
the space and the

294
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:30,720
oxygen which comes to us you know from the tree from plant life on this planet we have

295
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:38,440
also energetic rout into the unmanifest that we can't really

296
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,520
see the

297
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:51,400
spaciousness and just you know sending out these roots or branches into

298
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:58,520
the sky

299
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,680
and I'm drawing on that

300
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,359
power which is also there you know beyond what we

301
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:28,440
can see with our eyes right now

302
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:40,280
and extending the roots or the branches up into the into the

303
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,000
cosmos there's billions of solar

304
00:39:54,359 --> 00:40:00,720
systems also now reaching into that power that

305
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:09,480
energy but just you know the tuning do that opening ourselves to

306
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:19,240
that so on the in breath we can feel the root system in the

307
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:28,319
Earth the energy you know which comes to us from the Manifest

308
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:34,720
planet and our body which is deeply networked

309
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:40,480
into that planet and also from

310
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,920
that which is

311
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,040
beyond and we like a bridge you know between those two Dimensions our

312
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:58,319
bodies

313
00:41:13,319 --> 00:41:19,880
and we can sense our heart you know as being like the Nexus

314
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:28,240
point between those two Dimensions the Manifest and the UN

315
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,839
manifest the like a bridge

316
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:53,440
point you know sensing into the intelligence of the

317
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,240
heart

318
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:06,319
you know the heart of all of us which feel cold you know to evolve in order to be able to

319
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:11,880
respond to the situation this urge to evolve you know which brought you all

320
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,759
here that's why you

321
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:28,160
meditate

322
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,079
and just you know really sensing into that

323
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:48,480
calling and really honoring that calling in

324
00:42:54,359 --> 00:43:02,839
you and you know I noticing you're sitting here with many other people who all feel C in somewhere or another

325
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:11,520
otherwise they wouldn't be here today and another beauty of

326
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:30,920
that and notice if you can you know sense

327
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,680
something in your

328
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:01,280
heart bring in another Brahma vihara of

329
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,960
compassion karuna may all beings be free from harm

330
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,078
and the intention to

331
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:23,559
harm may all beings be free from harm and the intention to

332
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:31,800
harm you know as we are becoming conscious of this

333
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:37,760
evolutionary threshold where we need to go deeper in order to be able to

334
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,480
respond to so much

335
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,960
complexity

336
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:06,920
and noticing that we already have the equipment for that you know through

337
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:14,240
the Buddhist Meditation on the Sati batana and the Brahma

338
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:23,240
viharas we do have you know what it takes to be able

339
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:31,040
to start to attune more deeply with this point in

340
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,838
history in which we are

341
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:48,960
living so now we can't really go back into Iron Age India when the Buddha

342
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:57,880
lived but we can bring this teaching into the present moment and the challenges of the present moment

343
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,800
for

344
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:18,880
in the boundlessness you know of the heart which

345
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:33,599
is able to respond from a place of of

346
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:42,040
compassion and this urge know to evolve in order to be able

347
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,040
to

348
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:54,720
contribute to this shift you know which is uh calling

349
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,720
us

350
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:27,640
you know as we are maturing and growing

351
00:48:30,359 --> 00:48:35,920
not just as individuals but also you know as a species as a

352
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,599
collective

353
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,880
and inviting in the the blessings of our

354
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:26,599
ancestors you know who have uh handed over this very

355
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:29,760
amazing bodies to

356
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:39,599
us so that we you know develop new capacities

357
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:46,640
of attuning and then you know hand that on

358
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:54,359
to the next Generations so that they may have

359
00:49:54,359 --> 00:50:00,119
opportunity to all also grow

360
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:11,319
and benefit you know from this life which we have

361
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,440
got

362
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,880
so you know just the willingness to stand on the

363
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,040
threshold

364
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:52,319
and through a tuning and developing capacity to resonate we

365
00:50:53,960 --> 00:51:02,838
will be Chang changed and then from that our contribution can emerge from

366
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:21,000
that not in order know to take something off the to list but in order to be more a

367
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:28,760
human humility humor human and to also bring him some humor

368
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:31,440
about all of

369
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:54,359
this you to see the Precision you know with with all of this

370
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:57,359
is

371
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:15,240
emerging the mystery of this uh imported

372
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:27,280
life

373
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:35,079
and the choice in know which we have got to turn towards

374
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:56,359
it so in a minute or so I'm going to ring the bell and then you know when you open your eyes maybe just you know

375
00:52:56,359 --> 00:53:01,880
trying to stay connected with the body from

376
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:09,799
inside and you know slowly you know noticing with whom you are sitting here

377
00:53:09,799 --> 00:53:17,880
in the room and then you know if anyone would like to to share something or clarify

378
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:27,160
something we have about 20 minutes or so a bit more

379
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,160
for

380
00:54:00,830 --> 00:54:08,579
[Music]

381
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,079
for

382
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:43,960
so I don't know how you usually do that do you hand the microphone around I will I just want seems a little loud um I

383
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:49,200
especially love the part about that we're pieces of the earth walking around

384
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:57,078
and I and The Roots going down and branches going up so wonderful thank you

385
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:20,760
yeah hold it like a rock as such Fortune to meet you in

386
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:27,559
person thank you um my question is very I think it's s ific which is

387
00:55:27,559 --> 00:55:33,880
about how does the knowledge from the Atma get transferred to the current body

388
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:42,839
what so if we have rebirths mhm we are learning something every

389
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:50,680
birth so how do I you know like the current me get all the knowledge from

390
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:55,839
the previous gmas or the births from what

391
00:55:55,839 --> 00:56:01,240
I don't know Generations did you say no the previous births yes mhm so how do

392
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:07,680
you know it looks like there is an accumulation of knowledge yeah but she cannot I'm having

393
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:13,680
difficulty explaining it to no no but the microphone is good okay so I'm talking about the previous births and

394
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:20,079
the current birth mhm so how does the knowledge from the pr previous births

395
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:25,640
get transferred or it is consciousness you know Consciousness is

396
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:32,839
is like the you know the quality of the Consciousness is is the sum total you

397
00:56:32,839 --> 00:56:40,839
know of that uh of the Consciousness which then you know will be reborn into into some kind

398
00:56:40,839 --> 00:56:47,839
of a body and and that that is you know when a child um do you have children no

399
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:53,920
no I have a dog who you know might like but what I mean you know some people have like two or three children you know

400
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:59,240
they're all different because they all different uh have different Consciousness you know and that

401
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:06,599
Consciousness is is what was cated before you know so my question is if we

402
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:12,039
have been having rebirths so shouldn't we have like you know like smartness not

403
00:57:12,039 --> 00:57:20,400
to do something like repeatedly do stupid stuff what we keep doing stupid things

404
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:27,359
what we keep doing stupid things so why don't we learn yeah so I mean it's very hard you know it's it's when we are all

405
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:33,720
here because we all would like to do less stupid things and do more wise

406
00:57:33,720 --> 00:57:39,880
things but we have very strong habit you know and also like traumas you know when

407
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:45,640
when we had very hard experiences and then those those traumas you know are

408
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:50,720
still in the body stored you know and then if we get triggered we get

409
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:57,480
overwhelmed isn't it and then we do something or say something or drink drink something or eat something we

410
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:03,520
actually don't want to but we feel so overwhelmed so it's a you know we need

411
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:11,119
to um we need to kind of slowly but with a lot of kindness and also support you

412
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:16,880
know work through that digest this undigested okay you know which keeps us

413
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:23,200
disconnected from these good intentions we have you know and this is what I was also kind of guiding Us in the

414
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:29,480
meditation before you know to to do this reconnective work because we are

415
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:36,640
generally quite disconnected from the fact you know that our bodies and the planet Are One process you know we read

416
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:42,960
it and say yes that's true you know but then the way we live is very different you know because we haven't done the

417
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:49,160
work the the we haven't done the digesting you know because number one is

418
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:56,640
we we didn't know how to do it and we weren't aware of the harm it creates you know but but more and more we do become

419
00:58:56,640 --> 00:59:03,319
aware you know and when we see for example what's going on in the Middle East at this point you know where there

420
00:59:03,319 --> 00:59:10,400
is so much the spinning you know of the trauma has gone so so fast you

421
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:16,440
know and we can see you you can't with talking you can't get to that

422
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:22,200
place but it's it's with sensing you know and this is something you know

423
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:29,480
which is we are not very good at that you know because we haven't been conditioned in that way but slowly we

424
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:36,559
start to notice it you know and this is what I also meant with the shift you know we we have to come down try to

425
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:44,799
solve everything here you know because this is so disconnected so it's it's it's a it's a

426
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:50,119
daunting kind of a work you know and this is why I I bring this guided

427
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:56,599
meditation because it's like bringing it down to the very

428
00:59:56,599 --> 01:00:01,640
simple practice you know of of connecting and tuning in and then when

429
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:07,440
we do that what we meet is all of the undigested stuff you know the landfill

430
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:13,240
just put it in the landfill and hope it's just going to be gone you know of course it's not gone neither the

431
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:18,680
landfill is gone nor all of the things which we suppress in the body and now

432
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:25,960
you know this I think we are starting to wake up to this you know as a as a species really and and that's a great

433
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:31,880
thing you know but then at the same time it's very kind of daunting isn't it

434
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:38,079
heaps of stuff you know like internal and external and now we have to find a way

435
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:45,720
how we going to do this together yep you know I mean nobody knows how to do it

436
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:50,760
but we know one thing is we know that the planet is is a self-regulating

437
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:59,200
intelligence you know which is operating since billions of years you know out of Stardust all of that has come to be so

438
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:05,359
why don't we connect with that more deeply intentionally you know and take our

439
01:01:05,359 --> 01:01:11,440
guidance from there you can call that a dhama really but just with a different

440
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:18,920
framework you know it's not just about individual Liberation to get away from here you know to somewhere else or not

441
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:24,000
be born and press for that but also thinking about our responsibility you

442
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:30,599
know because we can't suppress all of that stuff because it's going to explode out

443
01:01:30,599 --> 01:01:35,720
you know and then it Wars come up which are getting more and more violent you

444
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:42,240
know because the the amount of suppressed stuff is just so

445
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:46,920
big thank you m

446
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:55,400
yeah hi hi um uh you're talking about U

447
01:01:55,400 --> 01:02:01,599
uh uh that we're thinking excuse me uh we're thinking intellectually and you

448
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:07,000
know we should be deeper in the Earth but I I want to know uh for me conflict

449
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:13,880
resolution is very important and there have been major people doing things in the Attica prison riots which was years

450
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:19,359
ago uh afterwards the prison guards said

451
01:02:19,359 --> 01:02:24,839
we would all be dead if this mediator had not come into the prison yeah also

452
01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:32,400
someone Robert Reich uh and Berkeley had a meeting between uh uh Israeli people

453
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:38,039
American Jews Arabs people with American Heritage they got together and talked to

454
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:44,839
each other and agreed on certain principles um I know people uh my niece

455
01:02:44,839 --> 01:02:52,440
went to a friends giving a Thanksgiving and the conversation was so bitter the division between people about Gaza that

456
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:58,640
she walked out of Thanksgiving dinner but there are people already uh they

457
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:06,039
don't I don't know if those those mediators meditate you know like the person at Atta prison riot or the or

458
01:03:06,039 --> 01:03:12,880
Robert Reich I have no idea what he does but there are people who are able to do that and I'd like to say I'd like to

459
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:20,680
know more what you think about that there are people who are able to do this and you're it sounds like you're moving towards that too yeah yeah I'm sure

460
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:28,119
those people you know have some kind of a practice you know they they might call it meditation but it must surely be some

461
01:03:28,119 --> 01:03:33,359
kind of contemplative practice you know yeah yeah sure yeah I think that's

462
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:38,480
that's what we need you know we need Collective spaces to digest this stuff

463
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:44,880
together you know because we can't do it all alone because we need you we need to be support we need support you know

464
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:50,079
community and I think you have a great opportunity here already you know you have a

465
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:58,119
community and yeah it's about doing that digesting you know of the

466
01:03:58,119 --> 01:04:04,440
landfill or the trauma you know which keeps us disconnected and feeling like waiting

467
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:09,599
for some big daddy to come and fix it you know that's like the old narrative

468
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:14,760
you know and now we are starting to grow out of that one mhm

469
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:20,359
because it doesn't really uh happen I mean and there is some sometimes there's

470
01:04:20,359 --> 01:04:28,279
some really great um figures you know like Nels m Martin Luther King you know Tian and so

471
01:04:28,279 --> 01:04:34,480
on there is great beings who can you know Inspire us and show us you know

472
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:42,480
what the human potential can be but then we have to bring it back you know into ourselves and not rely on them but we

473
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:48,400
can do this we can do this together because we already have a lot of

474
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:54,240
um you know we have the information you know we have the as I said before you

475
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:59,520
know the meditation on the four saatana for establishments of mindfulness and

476
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:05,200
the Brahma viharas I mean they are the the two basic building blocks you know

477
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:11,319
for starting to connect with oneself mhm

478
01:05:11,319 --> 01:05:17,319
and you know and if we do that work it I think it will

479
01:05:17,319 --> 01:05:24,240
become more and more we'll see you know that if we make ourselves available if

480
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:33,839
really feel like we you know this urge to evolve as I called it you know urge to evolve evolve you know in order to

481
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:42,400
you know face face the responsibility you know what do we leave behind for future Generations you know then AO if

482
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:48,039
that if you connect with that I think situations will start

483
01:05:48,039 --> 01:05:55,039
to emerge you know where we can more and more uh do that work you know M first we

484
01:05:55,039 --> 01:06:02,160
have to just you know start noticing it that's what we would want to do you know and then

485
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:08,319
nourishing that and and attending to it you know and it like to a plant you know

486
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:15,039
and trusting that intelligence which is the intelligence of the heart I think you know and the intelligence of of

487
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:21,599
these intentions if you really nourish it and attend to it like to a plant you

488
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:28,880
know it it it will grow m it's the same you know if you cut your finger if you clean it up and put a banded it just

489
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:36,039
knows how to do you know if you don't cut every day it's going to heal you know without you doing anything much

490
01:06:36,039 --> 01:06:42,240
other than keeping the conditions right for it you know and I think this is

491
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:47,319
something we need to more directly understand through the through certain

492
01:06:47,319 --> 01:06:53,720
practices you know which are which are kind of a little bit let's say designed for that you know where you use some of

493
01:06:53,720 --> 01:07:01,200
the very of the ancient uh teachings you know which we have received from the Buddha from Iron AG India but said it in

494
01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:06,839
a bit of a different framework because we live in a different time you know and

495
01:07:06,839 --> 01:07:15,400
and the challenges are principally always the same you know greed hatred and delusion in action but what we are

496
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:21,520
facing now is different in terms of uh you know the the

497
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:28,920
globality of the issue you know us all together on a planet which has a limited

498
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:34,000
biosphere and there's more and more people and

499
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:40,680
there's more and more polarization is there's like a certain kind of tension building up and we can all sense it you

500
01:07:40,680 --> 01:07:45,839
know we all we all feel it and then it explodes at some of the very vulnerable

501
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:53,359
places you know and if we don't work with that pressure

502
01:07:53,359 --> 01:08:00,520
you know then we don't know what's going to where it's going to explode next you know do

503
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:08,119
you think that um uh your teaching could be combined with teachings in mediation

504
01:08:08,119 --> 01:08:15,279
and conflict resolution sure yeah I think it could be a good combination yeah I just not putting down what you're

505
01:08:15,279 --> 01:08:21,640
saying at all yeah no but but combining them that's what I'm saying I mean you know at at theca Earth

506
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:28,440
room uh you know where where I live M and uh it's in San Rafael you know

507
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:34,920
that's what we are offering there on on Saturdays you know we have uh in person meeting and we're doing these kind of

508
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:41,120
meditations and then afterwards we sit in Council together you know either

509
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:46,679
formal counsel or sometimes more informal practice discussions and

510
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:54,000
we we you know we try to um work with those things you know yes

511
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:01,600
yeah mhm has and there's many places who do this

512
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:09,199
kind of work of course you know but it is yeah it is very important that those

513
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:15,960
spaces you know come into being I think yes thank you so much for all the great

514
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:23,120
work coming from Hoka Earth room thank you also thank you for the meditation so for me when we went

515
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:28,838
through the ments earth water Wind Fire the sense of Peace as well as a

516
01:09:28,839 --> 01:09:34,040
sense of sadness thinking about the wounded planet we live in mhm there's a

517
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:40,719
lot of pain associated with that also like the theme of um inner activism

518
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:47,159
MH I would love to hear from you what is it individually that I can

519
01:09:47,159 --> 01:09:54,238
do to bring this sense of inner activism so that it becomes a larger move moment

520
01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:59,719
more people more care higher

521
01:09:59,719 --> 01:10:08,560
prioritization for the planet related activities that I can engage in mhm I think you know to by I

522
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:16,159
think by really you know doing this these practices you know of of of really attuning to the to the

523
01:10:16,159 --> 01:10:22,840
fact you know that the body and the planet I one process that's one thing and then also really noticing this urge

524
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:30,000
to evolve you know which we're just wording you know and really uh noticing it you know

525
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:38,480
respecting it and then speaking about it with other people you know you're part of the earth C group and then you know

526
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:43,800
by you becoming the medicine you're looking for it's going to be contagious

527
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:51,159
in some way or another and it's not going to be exactly on your time table you know as you know

528
01:10:51,159 --> 01:10:57,080
already but that's the way to do it you know and and really

529
01:10:57,080 --> 01:11:04,400
um you know it's almost like walking a prayer basically you know we can say and

530
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:13,159
and and and just continuing to do that work and and trusting in EM mergence you know

531
01:11:13,159 --> 01:11:21,080
but it doesn't mean that that we are not doing anything but we not seeing the opportunities and and uh I mean that's

532
01:11:21,080 --> 01:11:26,640
how I made the Earth room you know by I'm you know I'm interested in all of

533
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:33,640
that since over 10 years you know so it was like it was a process but then at one point there was the opportunity and

534
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:40,560
then you know we need to act so it's it's a you know it's it's

535
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:47,159
it's this Attunement process you know by resonating with that much bigger

536
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:53,440
intelligence and allowing then that to come forth you know to be informed by

537
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:59,000
it so it's it's a real it's a it's a mysterious process

538
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:05,719
but it's also a very grounded process you know

539
01:12:05,719 --> 01:12:11,840
and yeah because it I think the the resonance which can come through us you

540
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,960
know is always in proportion you know to our openness and then that the gifts we

541
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:25,480
have got you know and the talents we have got they will be used by that process you know

542
01:12:26,199 --> 01:12:34,600
yeah I think we could maybe take one more question and then I think we have to end right yes mhm one or two maybe

543
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:39,880
depends on how long how long did 10:45 10:45 okay I see the clock there thank

544
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:45,880
you thank you yes I really want to thank you so much for coming to IMC today

545
01:12:45,880 --> 01:12:51,719
thank you it is really lovely to see you in person thank you and

546
01:12:51,719 --> 01:12:58,600
um I just want to share my personal story so I do a lot of climate activism

547
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:07,040
and I find that what is so important for me is to replenish my soul and joy and

548
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:14,000
to take action from that place and the thing that I do that is most effective

549
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:20,639
for me is I do habitat restoration and I sit in the dirt right now it's the

550
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:28,400
mud and um as I'm digging around these earthworms come up and it reminds these

551
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:35,120
fat you know beautiful earthworms and it reminds me so much of your earthworm

552
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:41,480
meditation and I want you to know that I stop and really meditate on that

553
01:13:41,480 --> 01:13:48,320
earthworm and join in that earthworm and um and think of you and thank you thank

554
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:55,360
you so much thank you Len even your hair got green isn't it from all of your bir

555
01:13:55,360 --> 01:14:02,960
you're really doing it yeah and I was wondering if you could

556
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:10,520
just say a few words about um taking action from a place of joy as opposed

557
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:16,280
from to from a place of of fear yeah I think you know I can't say to people you

558
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:22,400
need to be joyful because sometimes we are not you know but I think what I can

559
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:29,960
almost access easier is like a sense of awe you know a sense of awe about the fact that my body and the body of the

560
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:38,520
planet are one body I mean that's awesome you know and I can go back to that pretty regularly you know and then

561
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:43,639
sometimes there is a sadness which comes with that or like just like the Mind

562
01:14:43,639 --> 01:14:48,960
goes like wow there's nothing you know and sometimes it is a

563
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:55,600
joy and yeah Joy is definitely you know there's more buoyancy there and that's

564
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:02,800
like it's really feels good you know but I think uh if there's no joy you know I

565
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:09,920
can't steamroll people into feeling Joy but it's more like you know just start

566
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:15,719
where you are and and connect with that sense of awe because I think that can

567
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:21,800
help to make more space you know so we can meet the grief you know because

568
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:31,400
sometimes if the grieving hasn't been done there's no joy you know because the joy is is

569
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:38,400
um I think it's also a the result of of having done the work you know because

570
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:46,239
when we have done some of that work then we can be more connected then we resonate more with what is there and

571
01:15:46,239 --> 01:15:51,400
then the joy comes from that you know yeah but great you know if you do

572
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:57,159
have you know done you know a lot in your life to to get to the place where

573
01:15:57,159 --> 01:16:03,920
you're now and now you know it it it's also the result

574
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:09,520
of uh of you feeling good about yourself you know having really walked your talk

575
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:14,840
right to a certain extent and that can really bring joy yeah that is true but

576
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:20,080
we need to start where we are you know and then we can see you know others who

577
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:27,040
have done it who have gone through the discomfort you know of rearranging certain parts of their life

578
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:33,800
you know in order do to be able to walk your talk that that can bring joy you know and there's like a certain

579
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:40,639
renunciation connected with that and that you know is a scary

580
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:46,760
thing for a lot of people you know but we need to just uh you know start where

581
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:52,800
we are one step at a time and and then that can really bring

582
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:58,800
choice yeah

583
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:12,920
yeah okay maybe I if if if it's okay I just um end with a little chant yeah I

584
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:21,000
just would like you know share the the benefits of the Gathering today you know with uh all of us you know so that we

585
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:28,199
will find the courage you know to to do the work to do the reconnective work so

586
01:17:28,199 --> 01:17:35,440
that we be more in resonance you know with what's asked now from us as we are standing on

587
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:40,920
this um evolutionary threshold you know recognizing more and more that we are

588
