1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,559
so one of

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:17,760
the ways that the Dharma Dharma practice is described is that it's onward

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,800
leading and implies Mo movement and uh there's two kinds of

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,320
movement that most character characteristically kind of represent uh the dark

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,239
uh one is that of a PA usually in English you say a path that we

6
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:42,360
walk and the other is a current of the

7
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:49,760
river that we float in that carries us along the path met

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:57,719
metaphor suggests that we have to engage we have to do something with to bring ourselves along we have to walk walk the

9
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:04,280
path the current and the river current metaphor suggests that not so much we

10
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,360
have to do uh except stay in the current and be carried by

11
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,439
something and uh it's a significant point in the practice when it shifts

12
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:24,240
from one to the other for people who are beginning it can take a lot of effort a lot of walking a lot of engaging in it

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,520
at some point the onward leading feels like it's almost innate and something is

14
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,920
being carrying us uh there's something onward moving and what is that onward

15
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,560
moving that we feel or sense or what is it and

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:48,320
um I find it uh kind of inspiring to think that it's maybe it's somewhat

17
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:58,079
related or similar to the onward moving nature of a little child

18
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,079
growing what is it that propels the growth of a baby child like I used to

19
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:11,720
try to stop my son from growing I put my hand on his head and said stop he would laugh you know because you

20
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:19,480
know it's you know he fed so well in my arms at one point the little baby and I remember those days but nope there's

21
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:26,319
something propelling him to grow and this movement on up onward movement of

22
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:32,560
like you know by the time we had the second child I was wasn't so eager for the Milestones to happen you know

23
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,360
walking and talking cuz for they just meant more

24
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:46,280
problems the first kid I didn't know that like I was like cheering him on couldn't waited you even worry like why

25
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:52,319
isn't he there yet second one take your

26
00:02:52,519 --> 00:03:00,440
time but you know what is it that propels them to learn and develop and grow what is that natural process and

27
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:07,799
what is a natural process that propels us in a sense onward in this Dharma practice maybe it's as natural as a

28
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:16,319
child growing a tree growing or something so this onward leading nature

29
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,640
of the path and there's a very classic description of the Dharma which I find

30
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:27,080
still very inspiring very evocative that the Dharma is something that's

31
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:33,720
immediately visible Here and Now it's it's uh immediate so it's it's

32
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,799
visible here and now it's immediate meaning it's not that's not really part

33
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:45,519
of the past and the future that's not the orientation it's something that really we connect to

34
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,840
here it is um uh it uh it's they use a very

35
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,200
colloquial expression for this um it uh literally in P it's a very simple

36
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,799
ordinary termo means hey hey doesn't say hey but I add that

37
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:10,640
to make it even more kind of colloquial hey come

38
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,280
see and so some people translate it as it invites inspection it invites us to come and

39
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:24,680
look but really just saying come come along come see and um see for

40
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:31,400
yourself and then onward leading and to be experienced personally

41
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:37,800
by the wise so something that each person uh you're you're this the

42
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,919
description you're the wise one that you're supposed to experience for yourself so that's what the Dharma is

43
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,840
whatever you know it's something that's immediate visible experienced for yourself inviting to you to come and

44
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,919
take a look and so one of the most classic metaphors for the practicing the Dharma

45
00:04:56,919 --> 00:05:05,080
is the notion of a path and um and uh I'm inspired by this notion of

46
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:11,680
a path and uh probably because i' under the influence of kind of European

47
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,759
English culture where a path is kind of idelic it's kind of pastoral it's kind

48
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,280
of like you know this wonderful little I love you know hiking in the mountains on little paths and then the forest and

49
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,639
little pass and finding my way and you know it's kind of like wonderful thing and for some of us in the American

50
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:35,560
speaking world at least you know like each person has to you know find their own

51
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:44,080
path great individualistic thing find your own path you know and um so it turns out that the

52
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,400
word in ply the ancient language Buddhist language doesn't really mean

53
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:55,800
path um it's the word for road but road is not so inspiring we

54
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:02,639
associate with roads with asphalt and cars drive on Road roads and um and so

55
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:10,400
you know the eighth full Road let's it doesn't quite evoke something

56
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:16,280
as heartfelt as it for many of us as the the eighth fold path at least we're so

57
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:24,000
you know but there's a difference between a path and a road a path is usually is associated

58
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,120
usually something narrow and uh it's something that's in the woods something in in the wilderness

59
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:37,360
or something and it's usually a narrow thing and it's easier to kind of feel like you're walking it alone when you

60
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,240
walk on a path and even if you go with a group of people they let's say you walk a path the distance between people

61
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,720
stretches out and maybe you don't see the people in front of you because they're like around the curve and or

62
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,199
behind you or something a road is wide and and for the Buddha who spent most of

63
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,960
his adult life on the flat Plains of Northeastern India India you know the

64
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,039
roads were flat a lot solid and wide and and a road is something you can a lot of

65
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,120
people can accompany you on they can walk side by side you walk together

66
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,960
there's room for if you have if you found your road the road you can invite all your friends to

67
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,000
join you you can do it together in a way that in a path that feels more like

68
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,360
you're on your own but the road you can it's wide enough to hold all your friends all your family your whole

69
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,280
Community it's a wide thing and in fact it's very valuable

70
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:43,199
this idea of walking the path walking the road uh together and uh and be

71
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,800
accompanied and I like to think of it is that uh we're walking the road with the

72
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,639
Buddha uh that he accompanies us and um the same road he

73
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:02,520
walked and um at some point uh as we go along with this you have to appreciate

74
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:09,560
that there's all these paradoxes you know that two things you have to hold both in the Dharma so there's a path

75
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:16,280
that path the road that you walk and there's also the river you get into that carries you something at some point you

76
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,520
walk this road enough something begins freeing up opening up begins to grow and

77
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,479
develop and you feel like there's an onward leading momentum in the practice

78
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:34,120
and I have it little bit sometimes when I go for long hikes especially over like you know for many days in a

79
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,560
row after a while um there's a feeling of like I'm not walking there's this

80
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,120
Force this momentum inside of me that energy inside of me like I'm just like you know sometimes I end up walking

81
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:53,240
faster and faster as I get into it I get in shape I get stronger and it's like whoa just you know cruising along kind

82
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,480
of it's onward leading movement onward leading movement of the walking

83
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,560
something I'm in the the stream now of walking and being carried by it

84
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:11,680
somehow and um and so it the onward leading the road implies a destination

85
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,800
that we're going someplace at the same time in some ways

86
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,000
we understand the destination is right here now it's not somewhere else so how

87
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,440
do you hold both of those uh we have the idea that and again

88
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,040
maybe has something to do with some of this Western culture that some of us

89
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:41,720
have grown up in where there's a very strong among many westerners to uh prioritize or emphasize

90
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:48,640
how great it is just to be and not to do and some like like

91
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,120
sometimes that's been really nice for me and helpful for me because in sometimes in my life I've been too much in like

92
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,320
actively anxiously doing doing doing and being told oh you don't have to do you

93
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:05,920
can just be ah so that's nice but actually they both

94
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:13,360
need it for the Dharma practice there's what we have to do and there's what we be and they

95
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:22,079
eventually don't have to be two different things the doing is the is being being is the doing

96
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,880
the two don't have to be separated in fact to have them as two different things sure changes us so all these

97
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,480
things there's a destination but the dination is here destination is here there's what you have to walk but then

98
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:42,079
there's how you get carried along there's how you just be but there's also the doing you have to do so all these go

99
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:48,880
together not to confuse you and get you all tied up in knots but rather to to

100
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:56,040
appreciate the richness of it and but also uh to not short Change yourself to

101
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:03,519
to to to choose any one of these SS sides actually limits you eventually

102
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,800
sooner or later all these sides come together and are working together and one of the one I want to emphasize today

103
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:16,800
is the idea of the of the Buddhist practice being a journey it's onward leading it involves going

104
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,560
someplace and in that Journey it's the point of it big part of it is the journey

105
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:31,040
itself and and maybe not the destination there's a destination freedom oparation

106
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:38,079
Awakening but uh this the the journey itself is what we have to settle into

107
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:45,639
and just trust the journey or just trust the next step be the next step of the journey we'll be changed by that journey

108
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:51,639
we'll keep grow like a child grows we'll grow in the Dharma just giving ourselves the next

109
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:57,959
Journey they still remember my son taking his first steps guess

110
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:03,639
what amazingly a proud parent his first steps

111
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:12,490
were seven but then he fell oh my my son fell he

112
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:18,320
[Laughter] failed I didn't think that but I could

113
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:24,240
have like the point is to walk and by golly he stopped walking he fell and I

114
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,160
could have gotten angry and gave him a talking to explained like this is not how it's done

115
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:37,320
when you walk you really walk that's what they say in Zen when you walk you walk no no you know of course it's the

116
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,680
point is a journey for kid little kid like that the point is the process and of course they're going to fall and then

117
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,720
they get up and they walk some more and they fall and eventually they don't fall so much until they're old enough to start

118
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,760
that again and um so the

119
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,639
U so just part of the life process so we're on the this journey and the point

120
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:07,399
of the lot of Journey is just being on the journey what come what Come What May and we just keep practicing and

121
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:14,279
working but one of the things that can support this journey is and this momentum this both what we do the

122
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:21,320
walking we do and the stream that carries us is to have a

123
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:27,399
feeling and understanding cognitively but also a feeling for what

124
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:33,760
is where is the onward leading nature of this where's the the

125
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,120
inner Sensations the inner sense that oh

126
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,800
this now is onward leading this is where we go forward here

127
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:50,680
there's the next step and that can be not just a cognitive like idea but you

128
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:56,639
can actually feel it in your body there's not so much difference maybe when you do walk I have a friend who

129
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:02,600
loves to walk off Trail off the paths and she explained to me last week why

130
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:08,440
she likes it so much she says because um all her senses are involved if she walks

131
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:14,360
in the mountains off the trail and every step is consequential every step she's

132
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:19,519
she's she say I'm being shaped by the terrain as I walk that's very different

133
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,839
than I walk on the road and and uh and there like every step there's something

134
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:31,480
inside of me that knows to step a certain way to shift my weight a certain way to turn my foot a certain way to

135
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,720
bend a certain way to turn here and there and go and it's not like she's planning it all out but she feels like

136
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:43,639
all her senses are involved and something inside of her knows and feels

137
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:50,800
you know how to make all the little adjustments that have to be made to to walk off Trail in the mountains and she

138
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,959
feels very alive and connected to the Earth connected to the natural world when she does this and so she she finds

139
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:05,040
great Delight in it but so there she has an on there's something inside of her nose the way to how to find her way

140
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,639
that's more than just you know following a map that she knows she has to discover

141
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,320
it as she goes so the onwards onward leading

142
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,120
nature of it so I want to take you on this journey or take you on a journey so

143
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:28,199
many of the teachings in Buddhism are uh organized like especially like a lot of

144
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:35,360
lists that some people are irritated by but part of the lists are they're

145
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,480
actually depicting or representing the onward leading nature

146
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,800
that you can kind of almost if you can feel your way into these lists sense them not just kind of think of them as

147
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:54,680
you know abstract lists but think of them as or feel them as something that is embodied something represents you and

148
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:01,360
your inner growth your inner capacity to develop uh that wants to come forth just as much

149
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,519
as a child wants to grow in a sense and that this represents this onward leading

150
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:16,399
nature of uh of the Dharma as we grow in it so there's a um a list of this this

151
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:23,800
journey called the parames the 10 Perfections the 10 wonderful qualities

152
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:30,079
that are developed can be developed on the path you don't want to take this too seriously you don't want to take the

153
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:35,959
linear way in which is talked too seriously um and uh that you have to fit

154
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:41,880
into all this but um but what I want what I want to do today is to convey these

155
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:49,560
10 um as a journey as as kind of a linear progression one building and

156
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:56,600
setting the conditions for the next to arise and my dream is that uh as I speak

157
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,920
this that I can kind of evoke some inner sensibility in you for

158
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:08,240
each quality that you'll you'll maybe think about a reference point for each of these qualities that maybe once upon

159
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:15,199
a time in your life this you have you felt this you experienced this for yourself maybe in some way that's more

160
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,600
than just you know just an idea but some way that shaped you or affected how

161
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,480
you engage in the world how you were and acted in the world or how you felt and

162
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:34,080
how you experienced yourself in the moment and then as you feel this maybe

163
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,919
maybe you can kind of feel uh into how something inside of you maybe is

164
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:49,200
oriented towards these qualities something inside of you feels yes this can be good this can be this is

165
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:56,440
a place that this is something that's worth making room for in your life yes

166
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:02,679
this is something that you're capable of having your system

167
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:08,240
maybe not in your ordinary thinking mind but something deep inside it's a source

168
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:15,679
inside yes yes you're capable yes in the right circumstances yes this wants to

169
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,360
come out maybe not in all circumstances but in enough

170
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,520
circumstances so um so the onward leading nature so last time I taught

171
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:32,919
here on Sunday I I about the four noble truths at the heart of the Four Noble

172
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:39,320
Truths is our capacity to distinguish between the

173
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:44,720
things that we do that bring

174
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,760
suffering and the possibility of being free of that without

175
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:56,400
suffering the the things that in make it simpler because suffering is a big word

176
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:03,559
that some people don't relate to or just but be able to distinguish

177
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:10,320
experientially between what elicits in you

178
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:16,520
ouch that's a that's not a sophisticated word just ouch oh you know oh that

179
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:23,200
doesn't feel good oh you know that's stressful and what goes

180
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:29,520
ah Ah that's good and a cold windy day you know it's

181
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,400
kind of like you tense up and that's a little bit of an ouch maybe but then you stand in the Sun and

182
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:42,280
something softens and warms up and that's enough we can have the ability to

183
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,480
distinguish between this very simple movement from ouch to

184
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:54,280
ah and there are times where the ah Direction just as a completely natural

185
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:59,960
thing to do I've been tense in my life maybe my

186
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:05,679
shoulders were up in my ears and I've had friends come over and say Gil maybe

187
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,679
they even put their hands you know kindly on my arm and said Gil you know you seem kind of

188
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:17,440
tense and I didn't know it until they said it and just because they said it and

189
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,880
reminded me I could feel it and now I knew it there was an onward leading movement I didn't have to do it I didn't

190
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:31,559
to think about it or plan it out or how I going to do that something inside of me gives gave away and relaxed oh yes

191
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:36,919
I'm tense oh that's true that's the onward leading nature that was something

192
00:20:36,919 --> 00:20:43,039
knows something knows how to go forward in time to create Health to create a

193
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,120
movement of goodness so the for formable truths are

194
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:55,919
partly teaching us pay attention to this notice this and for that you have to be

195
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:02,480
in the present moment it's visible it's experiential here and now to

196
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:09,039
feel ouch and ah it's not really about the past and

197
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:15,120
the future it's about now it's immediate and there's something about

198
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:22,080
this that invites us to come and look to inspect there's something about if you really notice your ouches and AZ it kind

199
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:29,840
of like calls you pay more attention here

200
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:37,320
and it's um something which is onward leading just as just as dramatically as

201
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:45,159
I relax when my friend tells me I'm tense so one example of something onward

202
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:51,400
leading for me when I was a relatively new Zen student I worked with other Zen

203
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,039
students at Zen Center had a bakery back then on Cole and P prases in San

204
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:02,760
Francisco and uh called the tasahara bakery and I worked

205
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:08,000
there and so one of the Zen priests was ran the

206
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,480
bakery and um and one day I was upstairs in the office I don't know what I was doing up there but I was sitting next to

207
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:20,080
him and he was opening opening mail and he read this the letter that

208
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,360
came and he turned to me and asked me how he should respond to the the letter

209
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:32,600
I was just a little kid I was you know you know I didn't know I didn't know much and U and I was certainly surprised

210
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:39,120
that he would consult with me around the letter but what it was was a local neighborhood association that was

211
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,440
fundraising for something and he said how much do you think we should give the bakery should

212
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,679
donate and like what donate what's

213
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:56,279
that I had didn't grow up with any kind of real understanding of donating and

214
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:04,360
giving and while you would and rather embarrassed to say this especially what we are now here at IMC but it was

215
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:11,360
true and uh so I was like a little confused what to say I I don't think I said anything and um and didn't it

216
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,919
didn't compute for me and then uh he said oh I think we'll

217
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:22,520
do $50 which in 1979 was you know more than it is

218
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:28,480
now and um and I said wow like wow

219
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,799
wow that's something that really made an impression on me it touched something in

220
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:40,640
me something was awakened in me it was the birth of some onward

221
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,880
leading movement some growth something that was beginning to open in me around

222
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,600
generosity it was a small little thing and maybe it's not worth even a story to

223
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,279
tell anyone except it made a big big impact on me it was the beginning of

224
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:03,480
something being something was being was born in that witnessing that little experience in what he was

225
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:10,600
doing and as I went along there were other experiences like this and uh then there were experiences

226
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:18,000
where I was able to be generous to others and I felt something inside of me

227
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,600
kept opening something I could feel this momentum how good that was an ah this is

228
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:31,399
good it's not a should it's it's a

229
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:38,200
good it's not a should it's said of course this is what wants to come out

230
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,840
this onward leading nature I learned that when it's a should

231
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,919
and it doesn't come from this onward leading kind of ah yes it's not so

232
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:56,360
healthy for me so the first of these 10 parames this

233
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:02,799
beginning of this journey many times in the Buddha gives kind of description of kind of the path of practice or the

234
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:07,840
teachings he begins with evoking generosity and some people say that the

235
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:16,440
path begins with generosity doesn't have to but it's an inspiring idea because generosity puts

236
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,480
you in community you can be generous to yourself

237
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,200
but I you know it's probably good sometimes to do that but uh generally

238
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:35,000
generosity is something you do with others and to the world and so to be that the Buddhist

239
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:44,760
path begins with generosity means it begins with our relationship to the world around us it begins by rectifying

240
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:51,360
or or adjusting those relationships in a way that happens when you start

241
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:58,960
practicing generosity when you practice generosity from this place of ah rather than should

242
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,720
if you practice generosity not out of you know you know it's a transaction and

243
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,640
I'll get something back but you just this wonderful openness and

244
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,840
giving that um it you have to if you do it wisely you have to pay attention to

245
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,279
the relationships it it clarifies relationships it heals

246
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:26,919
relationships um I've known people people come to me and talked about you know some very difficult relationship

247
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:32,279
they have with some family member or someone especially family members you can't get away

248
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:39,279
from and um and uh seems like the other person is kind of unreasonable in their

249
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:45,279
difficulty and I say what uh just uh start practicing small acts of

250
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:52,360
generosity when you go visit that person bring something you baked or cooked they just little things and and sometimes

251
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:58,200
people come back and say Gil that made a huge difference the person began to relax and began to treat me a little

252
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:05,360
more kindly and you know so so the act of generosity to change and develop and

253
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,480
rectify and establish kind of a healthy relationship to the world around us that

254
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:17,640
I think generosity can do it puts us our practice our life in context of that

255
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:24,679
what we do has an effect on the world around us and the world around us has an effect on us this is a this is where

256
00:27:24,679 --> 00:27:30,760
Dharma practice is not about going sitting in meditation alone or finding

257
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,880
taking your path the narrow isolated path up in the mountains by yourself

258
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:42,480
getting away from all those difficult people I mean for many some of us occasionally it's like life would be

259
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,000
easy if it wasn't for the people and um but in fact the Dharma

260
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,159
practice is to be inclusive of that and so that it starts there so what is this

261
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:59,039
onward move movement of generosity of giving to relate to people to the world

262
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:07,120
from that place where there's a inner growth inner call to get to offer a

263
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:14,440
smile to open the door for someone to not grab the shopping cart at

264
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:20,360
the grocery store because you know because you're it's close one to you and as someone else is getting it you just

265
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:26,000
no I don't that's easier for me just take this one you know but rather this person is a

266
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,080
whole person themselves who knows what difficulty their life has been and what they've been up to in the

267
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:40,200
moment maybe just like here there's a confusion about who was here at this grocery cart first here

268
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:48,200
please and the person relaxes oh thank you it's been a hard day and to have someone just offer such

269
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,919
a small thing who knows what it does for them and what does it do for you if

270
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:59,000
after you do it they say thank you it's been a hard day oh that felt good that

271
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:04,600
was an ah that I didn't wasn't selfishly grabbed it for myself I kind of offered

272
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,799
it to the person so as we practice generosity in

273
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:16,679
this way it provides more evidence more

274
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:22,399
connection to what feels like ouch and what feels like

275
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:28,240
ah we get more sensitive to that as we get more sensitive to that

276
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:35,120
Movement we start seeing it in other areas of our life and it turns out that what is

277
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,640
usually in English speaking world is called ethics there's actually no word in poly

278
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:46,039
for ethics isn't that something that's a whole other

279
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:51,440
story but from our English point of view Buddhism is very ethical they just don't

280
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:59,000
have a word for ethical isn't that great yeah it's hard to believe

281
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,399
but as um but they have a word for uh virtuous

282
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:11,399
conduct so as we go along we start the sensitivity leads us to understand that

283
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:17,720
certain behaviors in relationship to other people are a big ouch you know if you

284
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:26,080
kill people that's that's an ouch if you hit people aggressively it's an ouch for

285
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:32,559
you but to not everyone realizes that not everyone is paying attention to

286
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:39,399
what's going on inside of themselves some people even say it feels good to hit someone but actually it doesn't if

287
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:45,080
you're really attentive and if you're you're you're

288
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:52,279
sourcing your life in this deeper place where children grow where you

289
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:59,480
grow you would feel the difference between Behavior which is an ouch and an ah in English language

290
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:06,880
ethical Behavior which is an ouch and an ah so this is called Sila often in P in

291
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,519
English it's translated as ethics but uh the word really has to do with conduct

292
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:17,720
ethics is kind of a broader maybe more deeper kind of thing but it's so the

293
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:23,039
common translation these days is virtuous conduct so we start practicing virtuous

294
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:28,720
conduct which is the walking is the doing we do things

295
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:36,519
and uh and so where's that onward leading as we live more ethically and

296
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:42,000
feel more these ouch and awe this Movement we have then what do we feel

297
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,039
next so the next part of me so it's first generosity and then we call it

298
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:55,240
ethics for now the next one is um a frightening word for some people off-putting

299
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:01,760
renunciation oh these Buddhists here we go Letting Go

300
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:09,760
H but this letting go in relationship to the ouch and the

301
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:17,039
ah is learning that I don't have to do the ouch thing I don't have to do the greed the

302
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:23,519
hatred I don't have to be so afraid I don't have to tense up so

303
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:30,279
much I don't have to be so caught in things my pre occupations that's an ouge this this way

304
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:35,840
of living actually I'm better off if I don't do these

305
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:43,480
things there's an A in the other direction so renunciation the English word doesn't

306
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:50,120
provide the richness of the word in po which has the meaning of much more what

307
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:57,720
much more has meaning of what you're G what you gain by letting go we benefit

308
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:04,200
this onward leading movement towards growth and freedom is found in

309
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:11,519
renunciation as we renounce as we let go be this this world of ouches and O

310
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,880
becomes more sensitive more richer the sense of ah becomes more stronger and

311
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:23,000
stronger reference point the ability to be calm to be relaxed to be at peace becomes more and more of a reference

312
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:31,000
point so we get more and more sensitive to the slightest little movements of ouch the slightest movement of tension

313
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:37,840
of feeling uneasy and that distinction is the classic

314
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,480
distinction for wisdom the fourth of these Perfections

315
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:49,919
we become wise and isn't that because you read all the books about Buddhism and you know

316
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,799
all about the all the lists and you know it's something really simple this wisdom

317
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:02,399
we're looking for it's this onward leading feeling that we can have when we

318
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:08,280
recognize this is healthy for me and this is not this is beneficial for me

319
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:15,280
and this is not and over time that wisdom becomes more and more immediate

320
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:21,560
more subtle more in all the little details of our life and things that normally we

321
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:28,240
wouldn't think it was being ethical even it could be as simple as how you sit in a chair

322
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:36,158
you can feel oh you know this way I'm sitting is not so good for me I've sat in a

323
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,679
couch in a way that totally expressed my

324
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,878
depression I was couldn't slump anymore and still be in a

325
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,919
couch and um and uh and by doing that I

326
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:57,560
learned I was actually reinforcing my depression

327
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:04,640
it wasn't healthy for me to collapse into the depression physically on the couch that way and I found that if I

328
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:10,160
changed my posture and sat upright in a more you know dignified way it didn't

329
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:17,599
make the depression go away but boy was it a world of difference there's oh there is some here

330
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,800
now there's a some other thing happening here there's an it's kind of an awe there's kind of a movement towards

331
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,960
Health there's something here more than just C cing into the depression so

332
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:35,640
sitting in a chair you know that me I use that as an example that uh you know even subtle

333
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:43,400
things that we don't pay attention to start becoming more and more part of the under the scope of Buddhist

334
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:50,200
wisdom as we become wise like this way then the onward leading nature of the

335
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:56,319
path comes along is that uh we're more motivated and inspired to act

336
00:35:56,319 --> 00:36:01,480
differently to live differently to engage in our life differently and this

337
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,560
is now the parame me of viia Vitality or

338
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:12,160
effort that we be we become more interested in living a different way and

339
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:19,000
sometimes then because of that we make huge behavioral choices some people actually will change something radical

340
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,160
in their life because they realize this what I'm doing doesn't really work anymore I think I have to change

341
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:31,040
something big and so this Vira this change this effort this engagement

342
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:39,000
becomes more important and that's what that's what wants to grow that's what wants to come

343
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,079
out as we engage more making more

344
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:49,760
effort chances are like most people you'll have to be more

345
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:57,079
patient seven steps and you fall luckily there was that had no meaning for my little son he he was 9

346
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:02,520
months old the fact that he fell that was a non-event for him I think it's

347
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:08,960
just like you know that's what happens that's what life is or I don't know he probably didn't think about it he but he

348
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:15,839
he you know the drive to stand again and walk was was there yeah so but as we get older and we

349
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:22,240
know more some of us have to be more patient more accepting more tolerant

350
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,960
more spacious more you know patient with ourselves and patient with the path

351
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,040
patient with our life so effort is

352
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,240
good but we don't want to have the effort get in the way of that inner

353
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:45,480
growth and opening so we need a lot of patience to stand up again and try

354
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:52,440
again as we are patient then the next part of me is a connection to what is

355
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:58,200
really true truth and it's still just this ouch and

356
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:05,680
this a it's really seeing how this applies and works in all kinds of areas in our life and the truth that this

357
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,119
making this distinction and living by this distinction and paying attention to this

358
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:19,240
kind of movement this path this flow this thing that wants to grow or move through us this is

359
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:25,200
true and not being living close to it is really a way of not being true to

360
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:32,640
ourselves so it's some point truth becomes really important with a stronger connection to

361
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:39,280
what feels true and truthful the next of these 10 is

362
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:46,359
resolve and uh and so something inside of us decides to become

363
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:51,800
resolved decides to become intentional decides this is what

364
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:58,520
I'm going to put my into I'm going to give myself to this this is important

365
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,960
and that can make a huge difference some people come to a point in their life like this is really something I want to

366
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,240
do but resolve can make you a bit Stern and strict and

367
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:18,560
tight so luckily the ninth Perfection parm me is loving kindness is Good

368
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,760
Will and this also is part of the natural growth I was blown away by meta

369
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:30,079
by Goodwill when I first encountered it in in this

370
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:36,359
inside tradition we did the teachers were teaching it and at some point I experienced it and I said

371
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:42,560
wow this is something I mean certainly the idea of being kind is a nice one but

372
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:50,599
to experience a kind of onward flow or momentum of Good Will that's deeper than

373
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:57,440
any idea that we have about it's good idea to be kind this was powerful

374
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,560
and this softens the resolve reminds the resolve that the resolve that we have to

375
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:09,560
practice should be relaxed should not have any tension as part of it but it's still a

376
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:16,440
dedication and then the final parame me is equinity and equinity can seem kind of

377
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:23,040
cold and neutral to people but here it's building on all this other growth and

378
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:32,319
development over time all the previous nine and now equinity is something that perfects all the others it's like wow

379
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:38,560
now I understand the ouches and the a of life and how it works and now I can see

380
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:46,800
that it's much better to not get be reactive I can be at peace I can be

381
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,599
still I can be in this world completely without being tripped up by

382
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:58,599
it wow this is possible and what that allows in Buddhist

383
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:06,040
practice is when you're really practicing with a lot of equinity it it puts you in the Stream

384
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:12,720
remember the stream that's part of the onward moving that you just have to trust the stream and float in the

385
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:19,200
Stream then the stream can take you to the in the classic analogy the stream

386
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,359
the current of the river will take you to the ocean the Gangi ends up in the

387
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:30,480
Indian Ocean or somewhere and um so

388
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:37,720
um so a journey a path an unfolding an onward

389
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:45,760
leading something like that is in you part of you just like it was you were a

390
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:52,720
baby once a toddler something in you new to grow and to walk something in you new

391
00:41:52,720 --> 00:42:01,960
to learn speak something you knew to keep growing and developing and and

392
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:07,280
something is here still for you that's doing the same thing that's available

393
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:14,400
can you feel it can you sense it can you allow for it can you take time for it

394
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:22,319
that's what Dharma practices and the Dharma is in you in this way you have to walk it it's a road

395
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:29,000
that you walk with many people it's a current in the river that you can

396
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:36,880
trust and it's it's visible here and now but you have to pay attention you have

397
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,480
to take time to look for it it's immediate there something about

398
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:49,280
it that's right here the next step you take it's it's something about it that

399
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:55,160
invites inspection come look it's onward

400
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:02,400
leading and is something to be experienced by the wise so please be

401
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:08,720
wise so I hope this you could follow this journey I hope it was interesting to do that and maybe that's not the

402
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:15,319
journey you have to take I was just if you could it all kind of follow I was hoping that it would inspire you to pay

403
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:22,400
attention to what your way your journey is it is very personal so this idea that

404
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,599
it's your path it's not off off completely but your path is a road with

405
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:34,319
a lot of people walking next to you everyone's do making their own path on the wide

406
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:39,759
road so thank you for sharing it with us all

407
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,440
today
