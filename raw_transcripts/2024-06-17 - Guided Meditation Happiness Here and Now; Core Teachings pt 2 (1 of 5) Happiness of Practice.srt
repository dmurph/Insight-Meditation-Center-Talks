1
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,080
so good morning everyone here in California good morning from

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:18,880
here and uh good day and I'm sitting here quite happy

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,439
to looking at the chats that are coming through

4
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,960
um wonderful good mornings good morning everyone wonderful good morning so it's

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,320
quite nice to to

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,680
just I have to turn

7
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:36,759
okay I'll try again so happy to be here with all of you and

8
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,880
to start this new week of teaching and uh what I'd like to do this

9
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,600
week is to go back over what I did last week um

10
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,439
I believe that there's much more to say on each each of the five topics and

11
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,479
given how Central these ideas these

12
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:07,240
practice approaches are to my teachings maybe it's not a surprise that

13
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,720
it's nice for me to be able to go through them

14
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:21,239
again so for today I'd like to keep this instructions quite simple and so I ask you

15
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:28,720
to um find a way that you can make these

16
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,360
work for you what I'll what I'm about to say uh it might be challenging for some

17
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,120
some of you for sure to hear this and um or many of you will might come up with

18
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,879
exceptions that this can't be Universal what I'm going to say but um uh probably

19
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:55,480
i' i' would agree with you that that's the case but still there might be a way a perspective that you could use that

20
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,760
you can find this beneficial it's not Universal it's not

21
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:07,000
uh going to be true all the time and it might not address all of your

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,159
concerns in practice but still it might uh at least

23
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:18,680
for these next few minutes and might be a different orientation different

24
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:25,040
perspective from which you can learn something and sometimes we even learn something deep when it something doesn't

25
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:31,239
work for us so the simple idea

26
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,799
is that Buddhist practice is oriented towards suffering

27
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:43,760
and the end of suffering but it's an orientation that one way or the

28
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,760
other um brings happiness is oriented towards happiness

29
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:57,519
as much as it's oriented towards suffering that um the very orientation

30
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,200
the very perspective the very PR ability to practice with

31
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,000
suffering can be a source of joy happiness be so lucky so fortunate

32
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,480
to have a practice in spite of whatever suffering

33
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:22,560
we have wow we can practice with this not many people have that and to

34
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,120
understand that the practice always has something to contribute when we're challenged and

35
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:36,320
when we're not and that there's happiness in just the

36
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,039
engagement or practice the ability to do it happiness of the faith of engaging to

37
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:47,880
it there's the happiness that somehow

38
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:57,039
exists side by side with suffering that these two

39
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:03,639
sometimes don't live so separate from each each other that the more we suffer

40
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:11,160
maybe we can feel our way and to it our way to the other side of

41
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,880
suffering we can maybe even see the possibility of a ending of suffering

42
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:24,560
kind of through the cracks of our suffering so as we sit to this

43
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:33,280
morning we'll sit mostly in silence and now um but Orient yourself

44
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:41,560
towards a realistic happiness and by realistic I mean not a denial of the

45
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,720
challenges you have or the suffering you have the pains that you have no way is

46
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:52,080
this meant to be a denial or a avoidance

47
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:59,759
exactly but it's is a way of Shifting the orientation from being preoccupied with

48
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,758
the suffering from being caught in the suffering reactive to the

49
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,160
suffering to having some form of

50
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:18,840
happiness joy together with our

51
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,160
challenge so that we are more appreciative more

52
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:31,280
nourished more supported by the happiness of practice

53
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,560
and that happiness maybe allows us to be even more realistic in a healthy

54
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:45,440
beneficial way about suffering so assuming a meditation

55
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:55,039
posture gently closing your eyes

56
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:17,599
and gently taking a few conscious

57
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:25,280
breaths with as much Consciousness awareness as you can relaxing as you

58
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,280
exhale

59
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:44,960
and maybe it's not so much that you are aware of your

60
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,479
breathing as your body senses the

61
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:59,960
breathing the experience of breathing senses itself

62
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:16,120
and if there is any discomfort or

63
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:22,800
suffering any UNH wholesomeness or tension or strain dis

64
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,319
stress pain through this

65
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:36,880
sitting perhaps perhaps the experience of breathing or perhaps not the breath the

66
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,479
whole

67
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,839
body or if not the whole

68
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:55,000
body the kind of listening or sensing to the space around the

69
00:08:55,399 --> 00:09:02,640
body allows you to shift from being focused on

70
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:08,880
suffering to feeling the goodness of having a

71
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,519
practice of being

72
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
present

73
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

74
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320

a happiness here and now that

89
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:03,240
orients the thinking mind to become

90
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,240
quieter

91
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:14,320
Stiller so there's a more

92
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,880
sensitivity to being with the

93
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,360
wellbeing that is

94
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720

and as we come to the end of this

103
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,240
sitting to continue breathing

104
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,120
mindfully tapping into whatever sense of ease or

105
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,200
calm or happiness

106
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,398
well-being that might be here for

107
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:29,480
you and with that as a reference point to turn your attention out into

108
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:35,559
the world that you'll encounter today or

109
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:44,240
tomorrow a world that's

110
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:52,960
local that's far away and may it be that your ability to

111
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,840
gaze upon the world kindly peacefully

112
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:07,440
inspire you to go forth into the world that in a world of

113
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:14,799
suffering you bring happiness in the world where people feel

114
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:20,720
unsafe are unsafe you bring

115

safety in a world of war and conflict you bring peace

116
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:38,440
and in a world where so many people are caught in attachments and

117
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:05,120
how to bring the greatest benefits to this world around us may all

118

125
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:44,440
this Wednesday and um it's one of the I think feel like one of the great holidays in the United States because of

126
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:51,039
commemorating a a long overdue Freedom liberation of people here in this

127
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:59,480
country The Liberation From Slavery the people who uh this the date when after the end

128
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:07,159
of the Civil War uh slave owners neglected to tell slaves in Texas that they were free and

129
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:14,760
so it wasn't until this day that um the US Army came into that part of

130
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:20,519
Texas to make bring the news and to free the slaves the final

131
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:28,880
Freedom It's a Wonderful celebration wonderful celebration of painful part of American

132
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:36,760
history and um suffering and happiness together and um so very fortunate to

137
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,519
you so for

138
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:17,760
the the talks for this week I'd like to go through again the topics from last

139
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:24,360
week's talk which were the core foundational teachings that uh I rely on

140
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:31,080
or that are underneath how I teach Buddhism and I thought it would be

141
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:37,120
invaluable for people for me to just lay it out how it is for me so that um

142
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:44,600
you're not guessing or or assuming a lot about me and uh this

143
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:49,639
um um topic I is something I'd like to

144
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:55,960
continue with for this week and go through each of the five topics and um

145
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:04,000
and offer some more thoughts on it uh with partly with the idea that you will reflect on this uh some of the

146
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,240
value of these uh YouTube teachings that I do uh

147
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:16,240
will come to you when you reflect on them and consider maybe have conversations with friends afterwards or

148
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,799
um journal or think about them for yourself and how does this work for

149
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:28,679
you so the first one is uh maybe that's why it's first it is so Central

150
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:34,760
is that um it's an orientation towards suffering and the end of suffering many

151
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:42,760
years ago when I was first getting involved in Buddhism and um and uh I went to have

152
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:48,039
dinner with uh a friend and she asked me you know

153
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:54,279
what is what's this teaching of Buddhism is about what is Buddhism about that you're interested in it and I was a

154
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:59,639
little bit thrown off I was new to all as I was young and so I proceeded to

155
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:05,799
explain to her the four noble truths it was I didn't give it that Dharma talk I just it was relatively

156
00:34:05,799 --> 00:34:12,118
short and uh so that was kind of the end of that part of the conversation and then I went to

157
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:18,280
um as I was walking home afterwards I thought to myself wow uh that was a

158
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:25,480
pretty simplistic uh account for Buddhism and my involvement with it and I felt a little

159
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:33,040
bit uh kind of embarrassed that I would do something so simplistic and uh many years later I

160
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:40,358
came to appreciate no that was really the heart of it that was like the best explanation I could do that uh this

161
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:46,000
addressing of suffering the conditions from which suffering arises the end of

162
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,280
suffering and the path to the ending I mean what a fantastic thing and I've

163
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,839
spent a lot of time in my life reflecting and thinking about the for noble truths and I find them ever FAS

164
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,400
ating and deepening and opening and I just feel so delighted by the Simplicity

165
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:11,359
and the directness of this teaching and one of my favorite kind of reworkings of the Four Noble Truths is

166
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:20,000
um that there is suffering in this world um the um it's actually like goes

167
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:28,000
like this um if you cling to anything you will suffer

168
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,480
if you let go of that clinging the suffering ends the suffering from the

169
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:40,760
clinging so um and uh that's a to me it's very powerful little succinct way

170
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:46,680
of saying it that shows you we have a role to the end of suffering if

171
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:54,000
suffering we're addressing not all suffering but the suffering we're addressing in Buddhism that which arises

172
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,800
out of clinging then we have to somehow take a deep look at ourselves to

173
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:07,280
understand what we're contributing to the suffering so one of the tasks of

174
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:14,240
having suffering at the center of of the Dharma of practice is not to suffer

175
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,960
better but rather but just so just so we suffer better have more suffering but

176
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:25,680
suffer better in the sense that uh to suffer in such a way that we start

177
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:31,000
looking and seeing what's the Ecology of suffering what is this suffering it's

178
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,599
like putting a question mark next to it what is this and in the very questioning

179
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:42,760
of it begin to find ourselves free from it uh very questioning of it we're no

180
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,480
longer locked into it no longer caught in it but we begin to kind of oh step

181
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,280
back what is this and it's a very powerful step to ask that question what is

182
00:36:54,280 --> 00:37:01,040
this and part of this question what is this suffering is the question what is my relationship

183
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:07,720
to suffering that might not go to the heart of suffering yet but how do I relate to

184
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:14,240
it some people relate to it uh with fear some people relate to suffering with

185
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,240
dismay and discouragement some people Rec uh relate to it with attachment

186
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:26,800
there are people who are attached to suffering uh who hold on to it in some way and it's it's a bizarre some people

187
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:33,839
think it's bizarre that they're told that maybe they're attached to suffering but uh or enchant would have talked

188
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:39,440
about people being enchanted with suffering and uh somehow uh uh some

189
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:44,680
people are so familiar suffering has been such an important part of their life such a big part of their life that

190
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:51,400
they can't imagine who they'll be without it and they're afraid of letting go of it because then who will they

191
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:59,560
be some people form a very strong identity around their suffering uh and so and it's an identity

192
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:04,839
sometimes that um other people support and in fact part of the reason for the

193
00:38:04,839 --> 00:38:10,599
identity is to get other people to relate to them through the lens of that suffering feel sorry for them or take

194
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:16,920
care of them or something um so the relationship to the suffering

195
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:23,359
and one of the core ones that reference a core practices we do to look at this

196
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:29,200
is a teaching called the five hindrances when we suffer when we are

197
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:36,599
feeling emotional distress of any kind at all then um do we succumb to some

198
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:43,440
kind of Desire sensual desire take us away from it um addictive behavior for

199
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:51,800
example um or when we have this kind of psychological distress do we um have

200
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:58,319
aversion do we get caught in blame or aversion or hostility towards anything the suffering or or others or the

201
00:38:58,319 --> 00:39:09,560
situation or ourselves do we get do we freeze do we get rigid do we get uh um

202
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:16,240
uh resistant do we get do we shut down in some way do we fall

203
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:23,280
asleep um do we um uh then the fourth hindrance is do we are we do we get

204
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:30,760
Restless running around in circles or do we um uh get full of remorse and regrets

205
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:37,640
because of what we've done or because of how we are and then the final is U doubt we

206
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:44,760
have just lived in indecisiveness uh not be able to make any commitment not knowing which way to

207
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:50,079
go so these are all this is very you know just basically giving you the list

208
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:56,560
but we're beginning to question what is my relationship to suffering and that's a different question is why am I

209
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,720
suffering and sometimes in this practice it's more useful and more important to say how am

210
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:10,240
I relating what's the that's kind of like the outer layer of the shell and without having some sense of

211
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,960
of the relationship we have to it we can't really ask the question why or how

212
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:23,800
or what's underneath it we have to kind of clear out the air clear out this Mi space around our suffering and not be so

213
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:30,040
locked into it or caught in it and so uh uh being caught in suffering is the

214
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:36,920
relationship being resistant to suffering is the relationship and learning slowly you see that suffering

215
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:43,960
and the way that we relate to it are two different things and uh and as we start teasing

216
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:50,079
those apart we see that we can create space we can create distance we can create

217
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:56,319
Freedom towards the suffering if we're so locked into the idea that suffer

218
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:03,319
happiness only happens when the suffering goes away we miss a very important part of what this Buddhist

219
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:08,599
practice can bring us and that is a certain kind of well-being a certain

220
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:14,920
kind of delight and joy that comes from freeing our relationship to

221
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:21,359
suffering and I'd like to propose that that's an easier job than getting rid of

222
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:28,599
suffering but if we think that our Rel if we don't see the difference between our relationship and the suffering

223
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:34,720
itself then um you know it makes the task so much more difficult and part of

224
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:43,520
the reason why people practice concentration practice is that it's a way of kind of

225
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:49,560
um uh shifting that relationship uh by not understanding

226
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:55,040
what it is we get really concentrated and the complicated relationship Falls

227
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:00,960
away and we can see more clearly but in mindfulness practice we want to

228
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:09,079
understand how we relate to suffering how we're caught in it and resistant to it and all this and then be so happy be

229
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:15,000
delighted that we have a practice that helps us to understand that that helps us to kind

230
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:22,200
of separate out the extra that we add to it and so we can learn to suffer with

231
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:28,319
nothing extra and that is special to have no

232
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:34,520
just I don't know if it's a inspiring concept just pure suffering this

233
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:41,480
Simplicity just the suffering itself without the stories we add to it without the predictions of what means in the

234
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:46,760
future without the fantasy and Concepts and constructs we layers and layers we

235
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:52,640
add to it just this is painful this is difficult this is

236
00:42:52,640 --> 00:43:01,680
hard whatever is going on in the Simplicity of that that statement and then to find there's a happiness in

237
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,839
having a practice that puts a question after suffering that we have happiness

238
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:15,160
and joy and faith and inspiration that oh we have a practice that addresses this um I can sit and

239
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:24,079
meditate I can follow my breath I can do some concentration practice just little just enough to be able to look more

240
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:30,599
carefully and um and uh and then in the process of that there's a way in which

241
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:37,000
we are so happy to engage in a practice to give ourselves

242
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:44,040
to a practice of u meditation of Med mindfulness of honesty of Engagement

243
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:51,119
with this process that the very engaging of it starts to kind of feel almost

244
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:57,280
physiologically good almost like you're involved in a craft or an art or some AC

245
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:06,480
ity that you really get absorbed in and just the activity of doing it feels so good so believe it or not really giving

246
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:14,839
yourselves over to a practice to come to the end of suffering brings happiness and um and

247
00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:19,960
so uh in the kind of simplistic way that I think sometimes is helpful to

248
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:26,319
hear um so there there's Buddhism teaches there's suffering and the end of

249
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:32,119
suffering the path in between those two how to get

250
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:39,480
from suffering to the end of suffering is a path of happiness happiness is that

251
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:47,880
important and uh and uh and it's realistic to engage in our practice in

252
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:54,040
our life and pra in such a way that happiness is the guide

253
00:44:54,040 --> 00:45:02,720
well-being uh is the guide to the end of suffering so Buddhism offers a

254
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:10,200
realistic assessment engagement with our suffering an honesty that about our fact

255
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:19,599
that we're suffering and that realism is a is a catalyst for

256
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,720
happiness not to take not to paper

257
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:31,079
over the suffering but rather in the midst of it to know there's another way

258
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:36,559
to know there's a possibility of freedom and to be delighted to engage in a

259
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:43,200
practice that is honest about suffering and has a also a realistic

260
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:51,800
sense of a joy a delight a happiness that can come from a path a practice to

261
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:58,920
the end of suffering so may you

262
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:09,319
um find the Delight The Joy the happiness that can

263
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:14,440
come when we practice with

264
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:23,559
suffering so thank you and um I look forward to it tomorrow
