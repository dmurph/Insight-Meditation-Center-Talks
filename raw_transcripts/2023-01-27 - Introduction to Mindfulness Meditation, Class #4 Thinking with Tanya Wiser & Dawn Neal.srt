1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,360
okay how is the volume vent okay

2
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,780
good

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,519
sorry about that I thought I turned it off so welcome to the fourth in a five week

4
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:33,719
series on introduction to mindfulness meditation in the past three weeks we covered

5
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,920
breath body and emotions in kind of co-centric rings the breath being in the

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,800
center as Tanya mentioned last week kind of the most focused object

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,980
opening the attention up a little bit to everything that's happening in the body especially Sensations

8
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,739
and then to emotions last week and I'm just going to give a very quick

9
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,920
overview of what we covered so far to kind of ground us before we start this

10
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,320
week's instructions so the first week we covered what is

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,439
mindfulness meditation which is being with our direct experience rather than

12
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,500
thinking about it being with experience as it's unfolding

13
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:26,640
intimacy with our lives it's watching

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,259
and observing with awareness like a naturalist might observe the environment

15
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:41,880
all the interconnections between it as Tanya mentioned that first week this

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,500
cultivates the capacity for choice rather than reaction

17
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:55,200
another really important theme we've been returning to time and time again is

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,680
this idea of relationship with what is arising

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,380
how are we relating to what is arising what is the internal posture inner

20
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:13,860
posture or attitude towards experience and recognizing this

21
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:20,640
is greatly facilitated by anchoring our attention in what is here

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,620
and now the breath the body those are always here they're always now

23
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,900
so the first two weeks then we did focus on breath and body the breath being the

24
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,900
often preferred object of attention or anchor tether

25
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,840
and that it helps to build Focus because it's changing it's Dynamic and for most

26
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:53,400
people it's pretty neutral right for some people the breath doesn't work

27
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:00,300
and that's okay the two simplest alternatives if you're finding that's true for you is

28
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:10,280
to notice what's happening overall in your body Sensations or to notice hearing sounds

29
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:18,780
and that brings us to body our bodies have a kind of intelligence

30
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,300
our systems have a kind of intelligence and it can be helpful to think of it as

31
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:30,360
three centers of intelligence there's the head which in this culture we often

32
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:37,500
associate with intelligence but there's also the heart and the gut

33
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:42,780
and Neuroscience Bears this out there are actual neuron cells basal ganglia

34
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:50,280
around our hearts in the center of our chest and in our bellies so we really are getting

35
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,340
information that's moving both directions

36
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,620
the vagus nerve is kind of the pathway and it's worth noting that the

37
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,739
intelligence of the body the intelligence of the heart they operate kind of on a different timeline

38
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:16,040
and it's really helpful to begin to tune in and listen and that listening is a skill

39
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:24,300
Sensations are the language that the body and heart communicate feelings for the language of

40
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:31,880
the hard emotions right so

41
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,479
the experience of Sensations or emotions

42
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:47,240
can increase or decrease based on the ways we relate to it

43
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:53,400
resisting or being angry or reactive to pain for example can make it much worse

44
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,100
being kind and compassionate towards sadness can help to transform it

45
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:06,979
so the principle applies like how we relate to the experience is key

46
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:14,220
last week we covered emotions and they can range from

47
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:20,820
the absolutely Sublime to the downright awful

48
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,940
right emotions are ways that our minds our

49
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:32,220
hearts interpret or encode our experience they're kind of their own

50
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:38,820
form of communication and while they're happening in the present they can either be based on what

51
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:46,380
happens in the present or they can be triggered by reacting to

52
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:52,080
something very innocent in the present that is actually

53
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,720
um carrying an overlay of the past so emotions can be

54
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:04,740
as Tanya said earlier in this course tricky to work with because they feel very authoritative

55
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:10,259
but they're not always responding to what's happening in the moment accurately

56
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:16,320
so it can be as simple someone can say something perfectly innocent to me but if it sounds like something the bully in

57
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:22,080
seventh grade said I'm off right I might not recognize

58
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,660
that this is that deeper part of me my Windex system might not recognize that

59
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,720
this is now and that was then it's still in a reactive mode

60
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:41,460
seen early Emotions Don't Have to escalate as we talked about last week they're

61
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:47,699
kind of have like a 90-second half-life process as long as we don't interfere or

62
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:53,759
interact with them emotions fuel thinking and thinking

63
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,699
fuels emotions so last week's topic and this week's topic thinking are very

64
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:05,340
closely related they're like symbiotic species in the

65
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:11,300
same Forest they just they're constantly an interaction

66
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:18,419
so the topic of thinking is very close to the topic of emotions

67
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:25,080
and how we relate to our thinking how we relate to it is very close to how

68
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:31,680
we relate to reality itself and mindfulness mindful awareness can

69
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,979
can help us transform this relationship to a relationship of choice awareness

70
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:43,979
and wisdom and Tanya will talk more about this relationship and how we begin to shift

71
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:50,039
it in a few minutes first though we're going to take questions from the past week or anything

72
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:58,080
earlier that we've covered and before we start I'll just give a very quick tutorial on um using the

73
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,500
microphone

74
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:08,940
so these mics they kind of they pick up sound at the top so it's really helpful

75
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:15,900
to hold them like this the classic construction is like you're going to eat an ice cream cone so very

76
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,180
close to your mask if you need to turn it on there's this black on black button here you just

77
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:28,199
press it for a couple of seconds and the light will turn green and then it'll be ready and we ask that you pass it softly if

78
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:34,200
you can if you want to turn it off between people you can but it's not necessary

79
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,760
so anybody have questions

80
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,540
oh yes and yeah since we're a fairly small group tonight if the mic is far

81
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:52,560
away it would be great to help pass it to someone or help them get to it if you're closer to it than they are

82
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,800
so since we've got one there I'm going to put one over here

83
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:08,760
we would love to hear any questions you have comments you've had things you've been exploring in your meditation

84
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,600
floor is open

85
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,779
even questions about what I just said

86
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:36,540
okay and if you could please when you're about to speak give your name hello good

87
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:42,540
evening Anne Rose um well you just have really resonated with

88
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:48,839
me in terms of the emotions and how our actions can be

89
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:55,680
driven by them but that through this practice I can be more mindful of them but then I

90
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:03,480
found myself especially today getting caught up in something and

91
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:09,300
it was then I realized it was because I was afraid and triggered by a previous

92
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:16,339
incident and just trying to prevent anything from escalating

93
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,100
and then I and then I wasn't mindful of my actions and how I

94
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:29,339
spoke to other people and that was like the whole purpose of like my meditation

95
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:35,399
Journey just mindful of how my interactions and just how I talk

96
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:42,779
to myself and others and it's just so easy to get to go back I mean the other day I was

97
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:49,320
just like oh this is really working and then today got caught up I've had you

98
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:55,140
know I I was unanchored or whatever and

99
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:02,160
got swept away again and I just having that compassion talking to myself

100
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:10,860
like talking myself through it without feeling like it's a hokey thing like it's okay and Rose but without I

101
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:17,640
don't want it to be kind of like a cop-out to like oh you messed up but it's okay no I want them like well

102
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:24,360
you can do do it differently next time and I just there's a balance at least for me and my

103
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:32,040
internal dialogue and thank you for listening what a beautiful sharing I really I love

104
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,079
what you just said and how even in the triggering it sounds

105
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:43,560
like there was still mindfulness present right the way you're describing it I'm

106
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,320
like oh I need to be mindful about how I'm speaking because these emotions have come up

107
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:55,200
yeah I guess I was trying to and in that because I I was mindful of the fact that

108
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,959
it was angry I I was angry about that and I

109
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,800
sometimes in the effort of not trying

110
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:12,600
it's just that I just don't I'm just trying to figure out that balance

111
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,000
but I if that makes sense knowing and acknowledging

112
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,279
whatever it is that I'm doing and if it's not how it's not the best response

113
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,680
it's just but yeah and Rose I think um one thing

114
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,019
that's important is but uh it sounds really important to

115
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:40,500
acknowledge your own anger and not to try and make your anger just go away that there's a reason you're angry right

116
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:46,740
yes yes and so um we don't want to kind of bypass

117
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:53,279
stuffing by stuffing or denying and so sometimes if I'm feeling angry

118
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:58,440
and I know it's I need to be with it I just I actually try not to say or do

119
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:05,160
anything I try and wait because if in the moment when I'm

120
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:11,880
feeling that if I'm trying to act like something's different there's a disconnect or something

121
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:17,220
and maybe I need more time to process what I'm feeling what I'm angry about

122
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:24,240
what is it I need you know I need to talk through it and sometimes we don't have the luxury it's like we just have

123
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:31,139
to respond right then and then we can just sometimes I'll just say I'm I'm just angry I just need to name

124
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:38,880
that I'm triggered I'm angry right now and I'm trying to be reasonable but um you know these feelings are up

125
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,240
I'm not mad at you or it's you know I'm not trying to blame you or whatever it is that's honest and real

126
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,940
I just wow I'm having a lot of feelings

127
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,940
thank you

128
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,680
uh hi I'm Varun I have a question about what you just said Tanya so sure I've

129
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:15,060
been trying to like you know stay with my emotions more like anger sadness

130
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:20,639
to process them but sometimes I wonder okay like when is the when have I

131
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,399
processed it enough and I'm just staying in a bad mood for no reasons how do you

132
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,880
know kind of that's a great question yeah last week we taught a practice called

133
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,839
raft so you might want to listen to that because I won't be able to um you know tell you all about it but it

134
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:46,079
helps you walk through when you're feeling and break apart things a little bit like recognize how you're feeling

135
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:52,980
what's going on except that that's what happened is happening because it's like well you

136
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:58,440
know we may not want to be sick but we're sick so we need to accept that we're sick so we can make decisions

137
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,600
right so same thing with emotions and then the next part of the practice

138
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,240
is to feel it in the body because here you know there's this dynamic between

139
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:14,339
our thinking And the emotions the thinking we trigger

140
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:21,120
the feelings and so this this part of the practice we're really directing just toward the

141
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,240
true felt sense hot pressing

142
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:34,139
pounding sinking whatever it is kind of in that way and try and be with that a little

143
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:41,880
bit and then the the there's two T's in my raft and the first T is kind of like

144
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,579
um tees apart all the different parts oh this is the feeling this is this

145
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:56,699
situation this is my memory of another situation this is my value that's being violated this is their value this is

146
00:15:56,699 --> 00:16:02,180
um the circum this the culture I'm living in or working in or the job

147
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:07,800
expectations there's all these different parts that are coming together and

148
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:14,040
fueling what's happening for me emotionally so I try and we tease that apart and then we can start to look at

149
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:21,300
each piece individually because as a cluster it has a lot it's a lot harder to work with it

150
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:28,199
and then in this practice the next part would be kind of to find a some a spot to rest in like trust what can I trust

151
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:33,959
about what's happening here myself my capacity breathing time will help trying

152
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:39,079
to help yourself kind of let go of the busyness of the practice

153
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:48,680
is that feel like giving you something that you could think about doing with your emotions in a different way yeah

154
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:54,899
yeah great so last week in the class which is you can find you know and

155
00:16:54,899 --> 00:17:01,860
listen to it and and see that Mark and go through a guided practice on it yeah yeah

156
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:09,798
so the you know there is this real kind of idea that we need to sit with our feelings but very often we're

157
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:15,600
refueling them or actually making them worse the way that we're talking to

158
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,760
ourself about the story and and you know sort of

159
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,938
what we're saying to ourselves about ourselves or others would just end up kind of making it worse and worse if we

160
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:33,960
just stay in the thinking mind so um and you know what's true about like

161
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:41,520
an anger is that underneath it it's usually coming from something that we're afraid of or that we're been hurt by so

162
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,340
often emotions are you know there's there's stacking on top of each other there's the first emotion and then

163
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:55,020
there's a reaction to the emotion or you know so sometimes we also need to say well what's underneath this you know

164
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:01,080
um and sometimes we just need to kind of chill out and just let it you know distract ourselves

165
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:07,440
and and kind of let it relax and then it's like have you ever had that happen where you like and then you come back

166
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,539
later and you're like what was I was so UPS I don't really

167
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:19,620
even remember why I don't know why I got so upset right it was maybe just you know an

168
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:25,440
accumulation of stress and situations that just you got overwhelmed by

169
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,980
so yeah thanks for the question

170
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:43,320
uh my name is Brian I have a good question how do you sit

171
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:49,799
with the sit with it any longer you feel like

172
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:57,059
you're going to go into like I don't know uh is the green light on

173
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:04,080
it is now yes great hi everyone uh name is Brian yeah I was just asking how

174
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:10,740
like is there any technique that I could use if like my feeling is so intense that I

175
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:16,039
feel like if I sit with it any longer I'm just gonna freak out

176
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:27,059
I'm happy to start and I would also love to hear what you have say about that so when I first came to

177
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:33,900
this practice I had a lot of anxiety so I can really relate to your question thank you for asking it

178
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:40,620
honestly something Tanya mentioned a few minutes ago is really helpful which is if it starts to get overwhelming

179
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:47,820
distraction is a completely valid way of relating to it so if you're

180
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:54,900
trying for example through the raft process if if you're trying to you know recognize and tease apart and everything

181
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:00,299
in between and it's just mounting that's a good time to if you're

182
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:05,580
meditating and you can keep meditating shift to a different object go to sound

183
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:12,299
go to the body go to the breath isn't always helpful if the panic attack is coming

184
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:21,720
feet and hands open your eyes and also it's okay to shift entirely

185
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,559
right so when you're sitting with it

186
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:34,919
is it describe how you're being with it when the anxiety starts to build

187
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:41,120
it smells like um like a fight

188
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:47,640
you know like one layer and then another layer and another layer and it's like oh man it's

189
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,820
getting to be a little too much and then I'm just like it's the whole like thinking right and I

190
00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:00,780
think okay this is not good and then that just makes it worse yes good recognizing very good recognizing you're

191
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:07,320
recognizing that feedback loop that cycle right so what we've resist persists right

192
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:13,559
we're adding fuel to the fire by resisting it so one thing that really helps for me is

193
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:20,299
to take a step back and notice the Judgment this is not good okay

194
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,640
okay and be with that like you can always take another step back and be with

195
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,100
but the emotion itself might not be the best place to be and this area of your

196
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:38,340
body tends to be where our emotions live and that's not the most helpful place if

197
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:45,900
you're going into a fear spiral an anxiety attack so I find looking at the attitude the

198
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:51,419
contention that inner fight itself is something to notice and be gentle and

199
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:57,559
kind with Tanya I'm sure you have something wise to add here

200
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:07,799
I'm truthfully trying to figure out how I'm gonna adjust my time so it's a little

201
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:12,900
bit hard for me to access a response right now just like

202
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:19,980
um but I think the my main thing that I want to want to say to you Brian is to honor what you feel like

203
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:25,320
is your capacity if you feel like it's too much

204
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,539
then say okay right now this feels like too much so

205
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:35,880
I'm gonna do something different it's okay that's part of me listening to what

206
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:42,240
what I can take you know and um especially when we find our minds are in

207
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:49,340
these really active kind of they're just not you can move that chair

208
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:55,620
yeah yeah please um you know when the mind is so kind of

209
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:02,460
intense and demanding and has that kind of momentum it's better just to not try

210
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:08,580
and argue with it and just go do the dishes

211
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:14,100
you know like go do something different but do it mindfully

212
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:20,880
you know and um and it's like it's not a problem you're just gonna honor the conditions it's like you want to go

213
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:27,659
outside and for a walk but it's pouring down rain so you know either it's a good idea or

214
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:33,780
it's not a good idea or you have a the rain jacket or you don't and you you make your choice depending on the

215
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:40,940
conditions right if you're sick and it's raining maybe it's not a good idea to go for a walk

216
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,480
does that make sense

217
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:52,440
okay so I do want to tell you about thinking

218
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:58,440
shall we shift is it okay all right so I want to do something

219
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:05,400
um for you know to introduce this topic I want to invite you if you want to this

220
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:11,700
is an invitation to kind of close your eyes and do an imaginary I'm going to do

221
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:17,760
an imagination thing with you and if you don't want your eyes closed just gaze or do whatever you want if you don't like

222
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:24,960
what I'm saying don't pay attention okay it's okay so I'd like you to imagine that you're

223
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,740
you know oh let's say you're three years old

224
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:36,780
and um somebody maybe even your teacher is

225
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:41,820
reading a book and the name of this book is you are not

226
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:47,460
your thoughts what

227
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:54,299
and you get to look at this picture book and it says thoughts come and go

228
00:24:54,299 --> 00:25:02,539
they never last long one minute they're here the next they're gone

229
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:07,760
when you look up at the clouds and the skies of blue try to see the whole sky

230
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:15,179
as the clouds pass through the clouds are like thoughts

231
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:20,480
the sky is like you

232
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:28,380
now fast forward to your eight years old

233
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:34,380
and you're on the playground or you're in a class and something

234
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,679
happens and you have a thought like

235
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:47,220
I'm stupid or nobody likes me

236
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:52,799
and you remember oh first you react and then you remember

237
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:59,760
you know I'm Not My Thoughts I'm not stupid because I'm having this

238
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,980
thought I'm not unlikable because I'm having

239
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:12,020
this thought this is just a thought and it will come and go like the clouds in the sky

240
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:17,760
and imagine this in another situation where you had a thought

241
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:23,360
and you realize oh it's just a thought

242
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,940
imagine you've been able to practice this your whole life

243
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:35,820
and what would it be like to be here now how would you have a different relationship with thinking

244
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:40,700
if you'd been read this story many times

245
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:46,100
and when you're ready you can just open your eyes

246
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:54,539
and do you think it might have made a difference for you if you'd been taught

247
00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:59,179
you are not your thoughts

248
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,200
no yes maybe yeah okay

249
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:14,100
so thoughts are one part one part but we tend to really

250
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:20,039
give a lot of weight to our thinking it's a we identify so much with our

251
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:26,700
thoughts so it's a it's a sticky place

252
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:33,179
it's a very sticky place for us to start to work on being mindful mindful

253
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:40,140
of thinking so

254
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:46,080
this idea this remembering when we're having meditations and we're thinking it

255
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:52,919
can be very helpful to remind ourselves I didn't ask my mind to have that

256
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:58,140
thought right I have thoughts that I feel good

257
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:04,919
about and I have thoughts I don't feel good about they can be about the same thing and be very different clearly I'm not my

258
00:28:04,919 --> 00:28:10,080
thought right thoughts are part of our narrative they're part of how we make sense of

259
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,419
life and often they're also conditioned by

260
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:22,080
what we've been taught different values or beliefs or things that we've been told our

261
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:29,100
thoughts also come from what other people tell us they're not necessarily even you know something we would choose

262
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:35,059
to have be our our thinking process over time that changes

263
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,919
so this idea of kind of being a little less attached to them like letting them

264
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:47,820
be those clouds that come through the sky right that as you're meditating

265
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:54,480
working on sitting back and opening up and just okay there's a thought I don't

266
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:02,100
have to change it I don't have to agree with it I don't have to disagree with it but literally to create some space

267
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:07,700
between the thinking and the awareness does that make sense

268
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:14,220
another way to put this is that as you're meditating thinking is going to be happening right we don't get to have

269
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:21,059
that on off switch thinking not thinking right so when you're meditating

270
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:26,580
you can let thoughts be in the background instead of in the foreground

271
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:31,860
so choosing to keep your attention more closely focused on the breathing or

272
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:36,899
Sensations or sound and letting the thoughts be kind of what

273
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:43,260
we give you know we just know they're there kind of more like we know the Train sound is there but

274
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:48,980
we're not giving our most of our attention to it kind of like that

275
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,200
foreign

276
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:10,919
to help yourself if you're having really sticky thinking

277
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:18,500
is to ask yourself what am I feeling in my body right now

278
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:24,720
sort of helping you kind of get out of the

279
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,539
dream or mini movie of the thinking and helping you connect your your self to

280
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:34,220
the direct experience in the moment

281
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,820
our mind works to kind of weave together all the things that are happening at

282
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:47,760
once to create a cohesive experience for us so that means the emotions the thoughts

283
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,840
the sensations in the body The Sounds the plans the what people are doing there's a lot that gets kind of

284
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:01,320
kind of woven together in our mind so part of what we're doing tonight you

285
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,600
know is unraveling the thinking from the rest of the experience right now trying

286
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:14,240
to let thoughts be something that we pay attention to in a different way

287
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:21,720
remembering they come and go remembering they're not Who We Are and um

288
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,559
let's see

289
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:37,020
another what we'll do in our meditation this first meditation is to notice the

290
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:42,419
different kinds of thinking so thoughts

291
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:48,720
um maybe that's right now just close your eyes and just sit and just notice what

292
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:56,779
can you notice about what what's happening in your mind about thinking how are you thinking

293
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:03,899
are you hearing a dialogue are you seeing words

294
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:11,720
are you seeing images are the images moving are the images like a movie

295
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:21,260
what can you notice about how your mind thinks

296
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:29,419
how did your mind think about hearing a train

297
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:37,278
how do you know you're hearing a train

298
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:51,020
and can anyone say anything about how their mind thinks

299
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:08,159
let's just move right into the meditation you guys are all nicely settled so

300
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:15,059
just being aware yep adjust your posture that's right take a moment

301
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:21,620
get your feet grounded upright

302
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,360
maybe lift the shoulders roll them back

303
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:36,960
and feel into your breathing just take three a three breath Journey

304
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,880
kind of really letting yourself become intimate with the experience of breathing

305
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:04,278
so we use this term an anchor

306
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:11,940
and is the breath and anchor for you does it help you come into the present moment is it useful for you

307
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:17,280
if it's not is it hearing or Sensations

308
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:24,060
oh whatever your anchor is if it's not the breath taking the equivalent of a three breath

309
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,200
Journey without anchor

310
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:53,460
next we want to kind of tune into that inner

311
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,859
attitude or the relationship or the posture inner posture right now

312
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:06,920
sort of invite a sense of trust trust in being aware

313
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,480
and our capacity to have mindfulness

314
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:18,540
inviting a sense of caring and kindness

315
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:24,200
with ourselves and with whatever experience arises

316
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:35,300
inviting the mind to attend to experience

317
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:14,720
and as this is a meditation time to practice with thinking

318
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,760
just remind yourself that at any time if you get caught up in the story of the thinking it's okay to bring yourself

319
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,859
back to your anchor it's okay to RECenter

320
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:36,140
that we're going to get lost in thinking it's gonna happen it's normal

321
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:42,839
and as soon as you become aware that you're lost in thought you're already back

322
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:48,780
and we can just Savor that backness that awareness

323
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:55,880
rest into that there's no need to get angry at ourselves or critical

324
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:08,220
so over and over again we can re-center re reconnect with the breath or

325
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:13,440
sound and help ourselves feel our body feel embodied

326
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,720
feel like oh I'm here

327
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:27,000
I'm right here just hear this now

328
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:34,820
this breath this sound

329
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,299
and when you feel some stability

330
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:50,160
you can ask what AM how am I thinking right now our

331
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:59,339
thinking is thinking happening if so can I be aware of it

332
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:06,000
like for me a lot of it is just this narrator this inner coach or narrator

333
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:13,320
kind of telling me what to do and then as I get caught in the thought

334
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:19,800
it starts to become like more planning and thinking

335
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:27,359
seeing images seeing what you can witness while

336
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:33,980
feeling your feet or your hands placed together or your breath

337
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,240
and what am I aware of now

338
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:29,240
are there images in the mind is there talking in the mind

339
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:38,160
is there's this concept this thought that I should be having a

340
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,359
particular experience

341
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:02,339
just seeing if you can't focus more on the process the way you're thinking

342
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:07,920
rather than the content or the story or the material

343
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,060
sort of preferencing noticing how the thinking is happening

344
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:52,940
sometimes the Mind needs a lot of

345
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:02,520
um I don't know maybe a more strong intervention like thinking just naming

346
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:08,940
thinking or naming planning or seeing and just sort of the mind is seeing for

347
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:14,460
thinking we might need to say a full sentence sometimes

348
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:21,420
it's just the lightest little thing it's like oh there's a thought and just it's like so soft

349
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:26,880
so subtle so experimenting a little bit with your

350
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,300
own mind right now and seeing how it responds

351
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:41,400
to just a very light touch and then a more kind of

352
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:47,160
more wordy response more specific response

353
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:54,200
being careful not to think about thinking you know in your meditation

354
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:05,640
we're trying to get to know our own minds the way our minds work and notice

355
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:10,099
they need different things at different times

356
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:17,520
sometimes the Mind needs a lot of help bringing the awareness back to the

357
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,820
present moment sometimes we can just sort of sit back

358
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:29,280
and we're like it's like laying on the grassy field and

359
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:35,300
looking up at the sky and just letting the clouds move

360
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:22,200
try being really generous with your thoughts just allowing them space

361
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:28,260
one way to do this is to actually imagine space around the thinking

362
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:33,720
like small tight room can be what you know

363
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:39,599
we're in this thought small and tight and then imagine the room gets really big

364
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:47,180
and there's all this space around the thought other things can be there too

365
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:23,700
thinking's nature is natural no problem

366
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:29,940
we need to think you just don't need to be ruled by our

367
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:32,359
thinking

368
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,339
and if you happen to have one of those moments where

369
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:07,200
you realize oh I was lost in a thought

370
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:13,700
see if you can kind of notice what knew that

371
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:28,319
wow I'm unstuck

372
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:32,780
I'm aware I was thinking I'm free

373
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:40,500
in the last two minutes of the meditation I just want to invite you to try a

374
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,880
little less hard right now

375
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,660
just relax a little bit

376
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:59,599
see if you can't connect with some sense of ease

377
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:41,300
isn't it amazing that we can think and see our thoughts

378
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,660
and not be them sometimes

379
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:56,869
[Music]

380
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:11,400
so what did you learn about your thinking tonight and how your mind is

381
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,900
thinking what did you notice

382
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:40,160
great

383
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:51,900
I learned that I'm afraid of negative thoughts um wow what a powerful thing to

384
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:57,259
to recognize how did you how did you notice that how did you learn that

385
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,980
I I think

386
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:11,400
like when you said create a space for for thoughts I think then it was like

387
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:17,640
I didn't immediately go back to my breath and I let some thoughts so then I recognize oh there's

388
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:24,839
some fear and then at the end when you said try less hard it was also like it was kind of a signal to allow more

389
00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:31,380
thoughts and then you could you noticed you that there was a fear of having negative

390
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:36,540
thoughts yeah exactly yeah yeah so this the space

391
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:41,880
like sort of trying to invite this maybe a little bit more awareness of the

392
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:50,540
thinking gave you the capacity to see oh I'm reacting to the to negative thoughts is that right yeah that's right

393
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:57,680
that's a good thing to know yeah yeah yeah thank you

394
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:08,640
anybody else willing to share what their experience of thinking was in this 15

395
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,119
minutes

396
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:25,680
thank you um well I noticed

397
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:31,220
I think I found that in the time that I have been meditating

398
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:37,560
the awareness has grown but in a like

399
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:43,880
like I know that I'm thinking when I'm thinking it's just

400
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:51,240
like I would tell myself oh this is the other arrow that I'm adding

401
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:57,420
but then I still do it and it's that's what's for us or you know I I still go

402
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:03,119
back to that tendency and it's just

403
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:09,780
you know I thought I I was kind of conceited in the I I

404
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:18,420
thought I'm like oh I'm I'm getting this this is good like I'm finally so aware that if I'm ever gonna be upset

405
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:24,720
I'm gonna be Beyond angry and that was not the case today and

406
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:31,099
I'm like what is this I'm like I thought I could maintain calm

407
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:36,480
but emotions or emotions and my emotions

408
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:44,099
I can be rather emotional so I but I I do like how I'm trying to

409
00:51:44,099 --> 00:51:50,460
practice more or that I am practicing more um loving kindness and compassion with

410
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:58,920
the the talking to myself and the thinking just sometimes I think too much

411
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:06,500
right so thank you for listening thank you Tanya thank you

412
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:12,359
thank you Anne Rose I appreciate your being willing to share

413
00:52:12,359 --> 00:52:17,359
and uh you want to respond on

414
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:27,780
it sounds like you're really exploring this and learning a lot even the Oh I thought I was beyond anger

415
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:34,680
or emotion and then observing the effect of emotion right

416
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:43,440
so um I guess my main encouragement would be

417
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:49,619
to trust the awareness that you're developing that this is a

418
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:56,400
slow process for almost all of us and that the awareness the mindful awareness has the capacity

419
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:03,000
to strengthen all of it over time and this is part of the learning process it's not a mistake

420
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:09,059
it's not a personal feeling it's not a backsiding it's seeing more and more and

421
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:14,540
more and and to really trust that

422
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:22,020
and you know really it's just the thought that you had that you would be able to not get angry that

423
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:27,240
was just a thought [Laughter]

424
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:33,900
you know and oh without someone said you know it was very seductive that was it you know oh yeah I like that thought I

425
00:53:33,900 --> 00:53:40,800
want you know that's what happens we have thoughts that we like and then we're like oh yeah I'm and you know

426
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:47,220
we're duped because you know this because our conditions are always changing

427
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:51,140
you know it's always changing

428
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:57,799
yeah yeah

429
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:07,460
hmm yeah have great grace do you mind um

430
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:21,420
since I've been practicing meditation um I did become a little more present

431
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:30,420
with my daily life like I enjoy looking at Clouds more or just listening to the

432
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:36,900
sounds as they are more um so as I go my day

433
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:44,280
um you know I feel like a minimal presence I'm really happy about that but in the evening when I'm trying to go

434
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:50,400
to sleep I just thought this thoughts come back

435
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:58,380
when I just thought I had a great day and then so I bought I'm going to sleep sometimes

436
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:03,780
I have bad dreams and

437
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:11,960
I kind of know where they're coming from [Music] I've had some therapy

438
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:20,040
and I may have to be in therapy more but I guess my question is

439
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:25,079
you know I'm trying to deal with this kindness and you know toward me and others

440
00:55:25,079 --> 00:55:31,380
but how do you forgive people who have no abused you hmm

441
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:38,460
you know emotionally and physically yeah I'm sorry the family yeah I'm sorry

442
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:44,059
Grace yeah yeah

443
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:51,780
I uh the first thing I would say is forgiveness is a process

444
00:55:51,780 --> 00:56:00,059
it's a long process I feel like I have to do this like the rest of my life

445
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:07,920
yeah and that's okay and maybe having them as part of family is a

446
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:13,079
constant reminder and yeah I have you know um

447
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:19,200
but just um

448
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:25,380
you know they don't think it's so really they're about to anything so I know I

449
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:31,140
can't change their thinking I can only change myself right okay

450
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:37,079
for um I have found uh Jack cornfield

451
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:44,099
do you know who he is no he's a Dharma teacher and also a psychologist and he has a lot of YouTube

452
00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:50,780
videos Jack cornfield okay forgiveness those those

453
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:59,460
k-o-r-n-f-i-e-l-t so um he has some wonderful YouTube videos

454
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:06,359
and he also has a book a little small little book that's like loving kindness

455
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:13,740
um forgiveness I don't know there's three words the art of love and kindness forgiveness and peace yeah it's a great

456
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:21,300
really great lovely little book okay I can look it up yeah each time I

457
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:26,760
do something you know to help I feel like oh I think as I only got hold of it I got it

458
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:32,160
and then you know it just comes back this was frustrating

459
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:37,680
well um Don I'll let Don you want to add anything

460
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:42,960
um only that um to recognize even that the wish to

461
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:48,180
forgive is a really beautiful wish to be having to really

462
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:53,460
that itself is the first step of forgiveness

463
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:58,500
and it's not totally clear from the way you're talking but of course to keep

464
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:07,440
yourself safe right forgiving in the midst of ongoing harm oh I mean appropriate right

465
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:13,020
I don't feel unsafe right now it just happened before when I was wow

466
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:18,359
this child right so to even hold that child and help that child feel safe in

467
00:58:18,359 --> 00:58:23,880
your own heart second to what Tanya said some of Jack

468
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:30,079
kornfield's work is really beautiful on this and um

469
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:35,460
it's on your timeline as is good for your heart

470
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:41,280
and you know when it's right you can experiment Grace with this technique

471
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:49,140
that we did with your own thoughts about your history your memories their thoughts too

472
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:55,740
you know you don't like they can can you give space and let them kind of move

473
00:58:55,740 --> 00:59:01,500
through the sky and just sort of shift your awareness you don't have to get rid of them you can play around with some of

474
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:08,220
this and try different ways of kind of responding to those thoughts

475
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:14,040
when they come up and one of them might be just like yes I remember I see you I

476
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:19,980
bow to you yeah I'm so sorry oh I'm so sorry you know just like that kind of

477
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:27,180
like yeah trying to fight it just to come to it yeah and just like you know about like

478
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:33,299
yeah and I'm right here right now

479
00:59:33,299 --> 00:59:38,579
I'm right here right now and it's really safe and I'm now however old I am and

480
00:59:38,579 --> 00:59:43,339
it's you know I survived

481
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,838
okay thank you yeah

482
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:07,380
so we're going into a second little talk about working with thinking

483
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:13,380
working with thoughts and

484
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:18,540
Tanya was just talking about even when working with really challenging material

485
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:27,180
there's such a benefit to finding a little bit of space so there's a visualization I think Gil

486
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:32,940
franstal is the first person I've heard give this but I've heard other teachers give it so I'm not sure where it came from

487
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:38,940
but it's um kind of like imagining yourself on a riverbank

488
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:43,980
this is a big river like maybe the Mississippi River or another large river

489
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:49,799
and there are different kinds of boats going down the river

490
01:00:49,799 --> 01:00:56,339
Showboat that's one kind of thinking right like a maybe a casino boat where there's always

491
01:00:56,339 --> 01:01:02,400
a party going on or The Love Boat or there's love

492
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:10,740
Romance and each of these signifies a different whole realm of thought

493
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:19,020
right so the way mindful awareness works is it keeps us on the bank of the river

494
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:25,559
able to have healthy distance from whatever those thoughts are as they go down the river

495
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:30,900
and the way our minds work we can be transported like that

496
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:37,799
onto one of these boats maybe without having even realized it so maybe you're just

497
01:01:37,799 --> 01:01:43,559
sitting on the bank meditating minding your own business and

498
01:01:43,559 --> 01:01:49,020
a warship goes by anger resentment battle

499
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:55,140
next thing you know you've been on that boat for who knows how long

500
01:01:55,140 --> 01:02:02,119
the minute you wake up you're back on the bank and the boat goes on

501
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:08,940
right there's all different kinds of little realities

502
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:14,460
that seem huge when we're on them and mindful awareness can pop us back

503
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:18,380
off the shore off to the shore

504
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:27,599
so that's the Observer perspective The Knowing perspective

505
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:35,720
to be able to look at these different boats going by

506
01:02:37,079 --> 01:02:43,200
some of them can be I mean speaking from earlier in my own practice there's the poor me vote

507
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:48,480
right which is like this decrepit awful Little Canoe thing next thing I know I'm

508
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:57,020
like half a mile down the river in that thing right poof mindful awareness back on the shore

509
01:02:57,299 --> 01:03:05,460
so to recognize the process that these just keep going and they are substance substantial and immersive

510
01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:10,619
as we sort of allow them to be we get

511
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:18,180
sucked into them and they kind of become reality for a little while but then poof back out on the shore

512
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:24,180
they're just another boat moving along on the horizon just another cloud in the sky

513
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:30,599
that's all they need to be so learning to

514
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:37,619
stand in the place of the kind of Observer perspective the awareness perspective the knowing

515
01:03:37,619 --> 01:03:43,380
that's a skill any of us can develop and it takes time it takes time to kind

516
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:49,380
of build the muscle build the habit of popping out of these

517
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:56,838
very kind of authoritative kinds of movies sometimes in our minds right

518
01:03:58,319 --> 01:04:03,720
all kinds of things as we've been talking about kind of fuel our thinking

519
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:10,140
emotions past or present physical Sensations

520
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:15,900
the interest in the thought itself the really big one the identification

521
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:22,440
with the thought itself or I'm like this or this means I am blah blah blah that's

522
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:30,260
a big hook very sticky it can be quite a feedback loop right

523
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:38,339
the stickiness psychologist and Dharma teacher Rick Hansen talks about that

524
01:04:38,339 --> 01:04:45,000
stickiness of thoughts being like velcro our minds just gets kind of stuck

525
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,220
to a thought I'm sorry no yeah I like velcro but then

526
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:56,640
as mindfulness gets stronger and stronger and becomes more like

527
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:02,160
a bead of water going along a leaf or along Teflon

528
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:08,160
it can just flow through just Flow by this is powerful

529
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:13,740
right just to notice the difference notice the difference and trust that

530
01:05:13,740 --> 01:05:22,020
that will build over time this capacity thoughts are kind of insubstantial right

531
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:26,119
they're flipped they weigh less than nothing

532
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:33,920
so Tanya talked about different kinds and modalities of thoughts earlier like

533
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:39,740
visual or that narrator we've all got a narrator

534
01:05:39,740 --> 01:05:45,839
movies some people even have sort of a certain kind of

535
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:51,119
thinking that appears as a feeling of movement or expression in their bodies

536
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:58,680
can aesthetic thinking Concepts words

537
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:06,298
and then there's the different processes planning remembering fantasizing

538
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:13,200
those those can be helpful to name and then the Buddha made one other

539
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:20,220
distinction that I found really helpful I have found really helpful in my practice I still find it helpful

540
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:28,440
who just simply noticed when one of those showboats is increasing Affliction or suffering

541
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:35,640
or if it's decreasing it right how is this thought making the

542
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:42,240
body feel what's the effect of this thought on the emotions I'm having that are arising

543
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:48,200
right now but to notice that impact

544
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:54,500
it can get to the point where even just experiencing

545
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:00,720
an afflictive kind of feeling is a clue that there is

546
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:07,520
a thought that's not so helpful happening you can follow it like a breadcrumb trail

547
01:07:07,859 --> 01:07:14,099
so to notice what increases suffering and what helps suffering decrease in

548
01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:20,280
thinking the very simple heuristic very simple toggle

549
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:27,059
we don't have to do anything it takes time and often our systems need to be exposed

550
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:34,799
to the different kinds of thinking and the different effects of thinking but for most people most of the time

551
01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:39,900
this learning process if it's done with mindful awareness with that inner

552
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:47,099
posture of kindness allowing it will the system will heal itself it

553
01:07:47,099 --> 01:07:52,920
will write itself over time to be patient with it

554
01:07:52,920 --> 01:08:00,420
by noticing what's helpful what's not thinking arising sometimes that's just

555
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:07,319
huge when I first started practicing I realized that my entire life I had been

556
01:08:07,319 --> 01:08:13,680
living as if through a television screen or kind of like a virtual reality engine

557
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:19,140
of my thoughts and I remember sitting I used to sit in

558
01:08:19,140 --> 01:08:24,179
front of a window I started indents and my eyes were open and there's this filmy

559
01:08:24,179 --> 01:08:30,600
kind of curtain that was between me and the outside and one day I realized that those thoughts were like that foamy

560
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:37,338
curtain they were kind of partially obscuring reality every minute

561
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:43,258
so notice when the curtain's there and when the curtain's not it's like Tanya said there's space in

562
01:08:43,259 --> 01:08:49,520
between the thoughts for most of us we can make it sometimes it's just there

563
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:58,100
so are you guys ready to meditate again and settle in

564
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:01,818
settle your posture

565
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:19,520
finding a sense of balance in your posture

566
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:26,100
maybe weaving back and forth up and down a little bit until you feel a sense of

567
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:30,080
of balance in the body

568
01:09:32,940 --> 01:09:41,298
and noticing to the inner poster

569
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:49,580
what's the relationship right now in your mind and heart

570
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:56,360
I'm just acknowledging that whatever it is whatever attitude is there

571
01:10:00,120 --> 01:10:05,360
settling in on whatever anchor of attention

572
01:10:05,880 --> 01:10:12,360
works best for you coming home to the body the breath sound

573
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,139
and resting

574
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:34,440
inviting privileging perhaps the experience

575
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:38,300
of any thoughts that arise

576
01:10:41,159 --> 01:10:48,199
just noticing I was just noticing that they're there

577
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:56,640
returning to the sensations of breathing body

578
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:59,480
this moment

579
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:23,219
and then turning in perhaps to what kind of thinking

580
01:11:23,219 --> 01:11:30,540
is arising commentary

581
01:11:30,540 --> 01:11:36,060
planning remembering

582
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:42,739
whatever it is perhaps giving a soft gentle label

583
01:11:53,880 --> 01:12:00,000
and if it subsides stepping back to the riverbank

584
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:06,239
returning to the body and breath the observing

585
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:08,840
faculty

586
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:19,880
resting in the body breathing

587
01:12:52,320 --> 01:12:58,460
if the mind is pulled into a boat of thinking

588
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:04,679
noticing appreciating the arising

589
01:13:04,679 --> 01:13:08,780
of awareness mindfulness

590
01:13:10,699 --> 01:13:14,960
savoring returning here

591
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:02,600
your thinking arises

592
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:10,280
noticing is this a new thought or a repeat

593
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:33,080
returning to body breath this moment this sound

594
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:52,760
stepping back and allowing space

595
01:14:55,580 --> 01:15:03,780
between the observing in the process of thinking

596
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:07,400
flowing down the river

597
01:16:12,840 --> 01:16:14,960
thank you

598
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:57,020
and has this short meditation begins to draw to a close

599
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:02,360
taking the moment to notice the relationship

600
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:09,260
how is the attitude of the heart and mind

601
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:13,040
what's been observed

602

comments

606
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:31,820
we'd love to hear how how you're kind of taking all this in what you're noticing

607
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:44,400
please thank you don't I have a question regarding you mentioned the film in front and that

608
01:18:44,400 --> 01:18:50,040
it can be pulled away or at least I would like to be able to pull it away it's just sometimes I find that the

609
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:59,040
reassurance that I seek is outward so I'd like to be able to do that for myself

610
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:05,460
in inward do you have any tips as to what I can say because I I have found

611
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:10,920
myself you know stopping myself from okay don't you don't have to share you don't have

612
01:19:10,920 --> 01:19:17,040
to tell you don't call your sister right now to tell her what's going on he could figure it out

613
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:23,100
and then I still do and then I anything would help

614
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:28,920
thank you for the question so I I want to understand more about the

615
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:35,580
relationship between the film and the reaching outward for Assurance can you say just a couple more words

616
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:41,880
about that I I noticed that when I think or

617
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:47,580
whenever a problem arises that I allow myself to be consumed by it

618
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:52,679
and and then I'll try to distract myself and

619
01:19:52,679 --> 01:19:59,820
get busy with work or whatever and then it still persists in the back of my mind

620
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:06,600
and then for a time I'll forget it but I'll but it's there and I I just know it's

621
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:14,119
there and I so that's the film yeah and in a sense and I just

622
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:19,679
I would like to be a better companion for myself I heard someone say that

623
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:25,800
but I I often just call you know seek it from someone else

624
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:31,679
and I would like to be there there for them without always having you know I

625
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:37,620
just I don't always have to do that to my sister so yeah

626
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:44,040
it's a really you're asking a powerful question really powerful question

627
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:50,820
so um I don't know if it's exactly a tip

628
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:56,699
but this process of turning towards your own experience that you're talking about

629
01:20:56,699 --> 01:21:01,920
is building that muscle that capacity and

630
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:07,199
um for myself the process of recognizing the film

631
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:13,159
of whatever sort of subconscious half distracted story or or thoughts or

632
01:21:13,159 --> 01:21:19,500
anxiety is going on was a really key part of the process of

633
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:25,800
like turning towards that with loving attention and just sitting with it

634
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:31,560
for a while offering that care in that way mindful awareness is a lot like love

635
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:37,760
it's undivided attention right divided attention

636
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:44,940
sometimes it can be helpful to just kind of rest your hand on your heart and on your belly

637
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:52,620
one of my teachers used to model just like doing this self-talk of oh it's okay it's all right

638
01:21:52,620 --> 01:21:58,860
I'm here for you and that too is a way of beginning to cultivate that compassionate

639
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:04,860
companioning you're talking about how does that sound so far to what

640
01:22:04,860 --> 01:22:11,460
you're what you're asking am I I try to to do that like may I be

641
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:17,040
you know happy safe at peace be Spirit whatever that stuff but

642
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:22,140
um I suppose I could do that on the on the daily I do find myself saying you

643
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:29,219
know it's okay don't worry about it just like Let It Go but then I I still dwell on it that's my

644
01:22:29,219 --> 01:22:35,820
problem I do like to ruminate a lot and that's a that's a sticky that's a

645
01:22:35,820 --> 01:22:44,000
sticky thought that I wish turned to Teflon but I think I I'm recognizing him now more so than I have in the past so

646
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:50,640
uh just continuing yeah I think the way that you talk to

647
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:55,679
yourself is really important and I saw Tanya turn on the mic so I

648
01:22:55,679 --> 01:23:03,780
think you have something to add here so have you ever tried to do an uh writing

649
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:09,060
exercise where you do an inner dialogue like

650
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:14,580
yeah so for example because it sounds like um you're getting upset about

651
01:23:14,580 --> 01:23:20,280
something and you you're telling yourself it's okay it's okay but it's kind of like

652
01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:25,500
telling a little kid that is upset about something that it's okay it's okay and

653
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:32,040
the little kid just feels a little bit like brushed to the side does that resonate

654
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:38,280
so um it's a little bit hard sometimes to get this feeling of how to relate to

655
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:44,940
ourselves so one way can be to like have it like

656
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:51,239
you know oh for me it's like oh the part of me um that feels hurt

657
01:23:51,239 --> 01:23:56,580
my hurt part says this and I write out what the hurt part would

658
01:23:56,580 --> 01:24:01,860
say I let it say in the sentence or paragraph whatever it wants to say this

659
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:07,679
is not fair kids are really mean whatever it is okay and then

660
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:14,460
there's another part in me like a compassionate self or a wise self

661
01:24:14,460 --> 01:24:21,000
or uh you know a good friend what I would be if I was talking to my other

662
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:26,520
friend this is what I would say to her so let me say this back to myself

663
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:32,460
and then let the hurt part hear that and then respond

664
01:24:32,460 --> 01:24:39,120
and then let the you know good friend part hear and respond

665
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:47,940
so to help you practice how to have this and create this inner exchange right

666
01:24:48,239 --> 01:24:53,699
I think it's hard to start to tease apart our parts

667
01:24:53,699 --> 01:24:59,520
and so doing it on paper can be helpful because then it's like oh

668
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:05,760
you know oh yeah I'm I'm actually really hurt and frustrated oh look I'm

669
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:13,800
resentful oh I I'd stomp my feet right now if I could you know and sort of there's a way of letting that be named

670
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:21,960
and seen and say okay okay well what what do I need what does that part of me need right now

671
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:28,500
what would be helpful like yeah that was rude you know or you know well maybe

672
01:25:28,500 --> 01:25:34,440
we're overreacting right now you know whatever it is that we need to say to ourselves so

673
01:25:34,440 --> 01:25:39,320
but mostly it's like helping tease apart the parts

674
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:49,679
thank you I think it's time for us to close huh yeah it is so but you know if

675
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:56,400
anybody has any comments or questions after we we'll just try and formally close on time and then you feel free to

676
01:25:56,400 --> 01:26:03,300
come up but um I'll start by with two announcements um you've got your handouts which have

677
01:26:03,300 --> 01:26:11,880
your homework outlined on them okay but um this Saturday is coming Saturday in a

678
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:17,040
couple of days Dawn and another teacher are offering a day-long retreat called

679
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:22,380
the seven factors of Awakening so it's a really nice opportunity to come and

680
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:28,199
practice back-to-back meditation with instructions and support and a community

681
01:26:28,199 --> 01:26:34,500
and then next Saturday the 4th Bruni Davila who's another teacher here is

682
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:44,219
doing an introduction to mindfulness Meditation day-long Retreat from 9 to 4 30. so two opportunities

683
01:26:44,219 --> 01:26:50,460
which you know we don't have that many day longs these days we're trying to have more of them but really great

684
01:26:50,460 --> 01:26:57,239
opportunities you can come for half the day if you you know don't have the whole time you can bring your lunch meet

685
01:26:57,239 --> 01:27:04,199
people like I don't know what you're going to do sometimes the teachers will you can talk outside it's kind of one of

686
01:27:04,199 --> 01:27:10,920
one of the things we've been doing with covid is to let people talk outside during the lunch otherwise it used to be

687
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:20,040
that would be silent all day but because we don't get much chance to interact that might be possible so anyways I just

688
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:26,940
I want to encourage if you have any interest at all and you're free um to try try it's really supportive and

689
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:34,620
it can take your practice to another level so I'll let you read your handouts for

690
01:27:34,620 --> 01:27:40,679
your homework just keep practicing that's really the most important thing

691
01:27:40,679 --> 01:27:46,080
every day even if it's for five minutes it makes a big difference

692
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:51,620
you know it really really helps to take the time

693
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:58,940
so may this class May our time together maybe what you may what you each shared

694
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:04,800
be fruitful and beneficial not just for yourselves but for anybody who listens

695
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:10,500
to the class who was watching with us on YouTube and

696
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:17,699
and for yourself and each other when you go out into the world may this be of benefit for all beings

697
01:28:17,699 --> 01:28:23,420
everywhere without exception thank you for your practice

698
01:28:24,540 --> 01:28:30,159
