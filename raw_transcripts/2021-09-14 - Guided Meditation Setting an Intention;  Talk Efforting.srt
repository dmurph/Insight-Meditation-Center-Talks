1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:08,320
welcome welcome good evening good evening or maybe it's not evening when you're

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:16,039
listening to this so whenever it is a really warm welcome

3
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:26,160
so we'll begin with a guided meditation

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,120
i'm just taking our seat our meditation posture

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,680
and it's worthwhile taking some a little bit of time to get the

6
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,600
seat in a way that we feel balanced and

7
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,600
supported

8
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,880
and allowing this sense of balance and support to

9
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:18,080
maybe infuse our mood our experience of being here at this

10
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,080
moment

11
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,840
so we can sit and know that we're sitting

12
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,719
checking in with the body

13
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,720
can we have a warm welcome for whatever

14
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,160
experiences we're having at this moment doesn't mean they're pleasant

15
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:25,120
it just means that we're not slamming the door in the face of these experiences

16
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:43,920
maybe there's some tension in the neck or the shoulders

17
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,560
can bring our awareness and see if that allows some of the tension to dissipate to

18
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,720
soften of course without making it a project

19
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,760
that it has to go away

20
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:26,879
bringing attention to our jaw and the area around our eyes

21
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,280
other places where we often hold tension

22
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:57,480
and then to rest our awareness on the sensations of breathing

23
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:18,000
feeling the sensations maybe with the movement of the chest or

24
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,560
the belly

25
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,840
maybe feeling the air going in and out of the nose

26
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,759
it might be that when we first sit down there's

27
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,240
just a cascading waterfall of

28
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,560
thoughts and we only every now and then catch our breath so

29
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,719
to speak remember that we're oh yeah i'm supposed to be meditating

30
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:29,639
that's okay we just begin again with the sensations of breathing

31
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:57,199
it absolutely doesn't matter how many times we have to begin again

32
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,080
each time we do we're strengthening the capacity

33
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,520
with the mind to turn away from thoughts

34
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:21,720
and towards something else in this case the breath

35
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,759
maybe we find that we're more with the idea of the breath

36
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,960
rather than the actual sensations

37
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:37,039
that's okay we don't have to make it a problem

38
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,919
but the movement is towards actually feeling the expansion the contraction with breathing

39
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:52,159
the stretching with breathing

40
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,520
not so much the idea but the experience

41
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,920
and it can be helpful to support our being with the sensations

42
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,680
of breathing it can be helpful to

43
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:33,360
set the intention okay i'm going to be with the entirety

44
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,839
of the in-breath

45
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,959
setting the intention to be with the beginning middle and end

46
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,360
of the in-breath

47
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:51,120
maybe we set the intention supports our practice for a few breaths and then

48
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:58,240
maybe the mind drifts away doesn't have to be a problem

49
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,880
we just again set the intention

50
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,240
to be with the entirety of the in-breath

51
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,680
of course we can enlarge our intention to be

52
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,319
with the in-breath and the out-breath

53
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,920
we can use setting an intention as a gentle way of

54
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,760
helping us connect with the sensations of breathing

55
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,880
without using a sledgehammer or

56
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:45,839
pouncing on the breath just simply setting an intention

57
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:54,920
to support just a little bit more connection just a little bit more effort

58
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:40,240
so we can use this practice of setting an intention

59
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:46,080
in a relaxed easy way and not a

60
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,640
ambitious intention necessarily

61
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,840
but to set the intention as a way of just applying a little bit more effort

62
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,200
so that our [Music] mindfulness can be a little bit more

63
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,559
connected with the sensations not so much just about the thinking or

64
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,840
the thoughts or the ideas

65
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:25,559
setting an intention as a way of making effort

66
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:38,400
[Music]

67
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:39,360
so welcome welcome welcome everybody it's nice to be here practicing together

68
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:45,919
so tonight i wanted to talk a little bit about effort

69
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:52,799
and this recognition that some type of effort is required if this path is

70
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:59,840
going to become something more than just theoretical i remember when i heard gil use this

71
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:06,880
expression of a book stand buddhists i think that's what he said but this idea of you know just reading

72
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:14,960
lots of buddha's philosophy just great but it's not the same right of course as

73
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:22,159
practicing it's the if we want to make this transition or

74
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:28,559
this movement or bridge the gap between aspiring

75
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:34,480
to and actually living this path of practice

76
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,000
this path of greater wisdom greater compassion then some effort

77
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,039
is needed some energy some activity right there's some doing

78
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:50,640
that needs to happen because certainly it takes effort to go

79
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,840
against the stream of our habits to go against the

80
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,320
stream of these patterns of that we have of body and mind that we've

81
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:08,799
been cultivating for a a lifetime and these patterns of our relationships

82
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,559
these patterns of social structures right that kind of like keep us in a groove

83
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:20,240
and if we want to do something a little bit different or a lot different

84
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,399
then it's going to require some energy some effort some activity

85
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:32,240
and we might say that right effort that is the sixth step on the

86
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:38,320
eight-fold path many of you are familiar with this we use this expression right effort we

87
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:45,200
could also say wise effort i first learned it as right effort and somehow that just that expression stays

88
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:53,200
in my mind samavayama so right effort we could say is swimming

89
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,240
against the stream perhaps but swimming towards the wholesome

90
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,720
and away from the unwholesome that's maybe one way that

91
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,559
we could think of right effort and this way that we can make our aspirations

92
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:17,760
be transformational and to for whatever it is whether it's the

93
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,519
buddhist path or learning calligraphy or pottery or

94
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,960
tennis or bringing along some changes in our

95
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:34,399
social world working for justice and peace all these things right

96
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:41,039
take effort and of course effort depends on energy

97
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:49,519
and we could say that or maybe i'll define for myself here that effort is like at the application of energy

98
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:56,399
is this way in which we are you a particular way in which we're using our energy but what

99
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:03,200
is energy we can think of energy we can be something that we can feel in the body

100
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,878
is maybe it's the sense of vitality a

101
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,960
maybe a really fine vibration [Music] i don't know i don't know really how to

102
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:22,240
ex explain it maybe you have your own words that you might say when you feel energetic or you

103
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:29,200
feel like you have energy how that feels and in the mind we might say that energy

104
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:35,760
is associated with a little bit of maybe glee gladness

105
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,118
or also with that being engaged with material with whatever material it is

106
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:48,079
we're looking at whatever media whether it's just what the senses are bringing us what we're seeing smelling

107
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:54,878
tasting etc or whatever that is that is arising

108
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:01,359
so some energy in the mind is being engaged and connected with what's happening as well as maybe

109
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:06,480
some happiness so but we don't always feel like we have

110
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:14,320
energy of course so what are some things that can support some energy one is

111
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,400
bringing attention to this experience of energy so maybe we feel like we don't

112
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:27,200
have quite enough but maybe we can bring to mind or feel into

113
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:34,480
sometimes we feel energy with our hands there might be a little bit of tingling or something there

114
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:40,960
or maybe there might be a way in which we can sit upright and that takes a little bit of energy so

115
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,240
tuning into that because just like everything else

116
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,839
when we bring our attention to it it brings some energy

117
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:56,880
so if we bring our attention to energy it's likely that the energy will

118
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:03,280
increase if we can do this in a way bring our attention in a way that

119
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:09,119
is not demanding that the energy be there it's not uh requiring things to be

120
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:15,920
wavered so it's not um have some secret aversion tied up with it but just resting our attention on the experience

121
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:24,000
of energy whether we have that in our mind or body is one way to bring to increase it

122
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:31,040
another way is just recognizing especially like with meditation practice or this buddhist path is to practice

123
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:36,560
with others whether that's virtually

124
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:43,839
as we are right now those of you who are on youtube with me there's something that's helpful

125
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,880
to sit with others we're you know irc we're offering these uh meditation

126
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,920
retreats online this recognition that it helps to be together even if we're not

127
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:00,160
physically together it kind of helps the energy there's a sense maybe encouragement

128
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:06,160
and the creating a container or maybe some inspiration maybe we're

129
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,760
inspired by somebody else's practice so it's another way in which we might

130
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:19,040
increase energy is to be with others whether physically or virtually

131
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,960
another way is when energy is aroused when we play at the edge of our comfort

132
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:32,079
zone that is when we get out a little bit of our grooves of these habits

133
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:39,119
but instead we touch into something a little bit different or maybe it's just a glimpse

134
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:45,040
of another possibility like oh oh what was that oh there's something

135
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:51,359
here this direction i know for me that's often has happened

136
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:57,599
that when meditation practice and often i feel like when stumbling into some new territory i know i've had this

137
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:04,000
experience a number of times like oh that was different and then this kind of tends to be a

138
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,400
little bit more engagement so whether it's with our meditation practice with our daily life

139
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,320
but i like this word kind of play play at the edge of our comfort zone

140
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,839
using this word comfort zone but we could also say the edge of what's familiar

141
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:29,440
or edge of kind of these grooves sometimes we get in so just explore

142
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:37,520
and then buna talked about um arousing energy not so much how to well maybe it is a

143
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,960
little bit about how to but also um some encouragement and this is just an

144
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,000
excerpt from a suta that's longer and has more elements to it but

145
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,960
i don't know why i kind of get a kick out of this so this uh suta goes like this

146
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:01,200
well here again here's just an excerpt a mendicant a biku a practitioner

147
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:08,560
somebody who's practicing amending kent has some work to do and they think i have some work to do

148
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,680
but while doing it my body will get tired

149
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:20,560
so let me lie down so they lie down and don't rouse energy

150
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:27,359
for attaining the unattained for achieving the unachieved and for realizing the

151
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:33,280
unrealized so this idea just thinking about doing work things like okay that's going to make me

152
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:39,680
tired i better lie down and then the buddha of course he contrasts this well

153
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,520
a mendicant has some work to do and they think i have some work to do

154
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,880
while working it's not easy to focus on the instruction of the buddhas

155
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,640
so i better preemptively rouse up some energy for attaining the unattained

156
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:02,560
for achieving the unachieved for realizing the unrealized

157
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:08,160
so they're seeing like oh okay i'm not going to be able to practice i won't

158
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,079
awakening i don't expect is going to happen in the next moment because i'll be working so

159
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:20,800
let me uh work let me apply energy effort towards my practice

160
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,839
now rather than lying down

161
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,680
there's a few more but um has work to do furthermore is to go on a journey

162
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:37,599
um i have to go on a journey but while walking my body will get tired

163
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:45,680
so let me lie down and they lay down and they don't rouse energy and then in contrast

164
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:50,960
a mendicant has to go on a journey while walking it's not easy to focus on

165
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:57,200
the instructions of the buddha i better preemptively browse up energy

166
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:03,920
and the suta goes on with six other cases i'm going for alms rounds not having

167
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,200
enough food and having finished work and some other things but i appreciate very

168
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:14,800
much kind of the buddha recognizing yeah we often do this i better conserve my

169
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:22,000
energy there i'm not going to practice or it's i have other things to do that

170
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,280
are pressing i can't practice while i'm doing that i i have this either or

171
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,839
idea and instead the buddha is saying no we don't have

172
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:38,560
to believe these ideas that we have that that we can't practice while we're doing

173
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,760
something or that we can't use these as encouragement to practice some of these

174
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:48,800
other responsibilities that we have they can be a support for practice as opposed

175
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:56,079
to a distraction so an opportunity to rouse energy

176
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:02,640
i think um yeah so maybe that's not language that i would use but you know just to bring up

177
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:08,319
a little bit more energy so we can have some effort

178
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:15,400
and so right effort is about

179
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,838
yeah i'm sorry about that having to cough kind of uh with some urgency there

180
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:51,200
the right effort as swimming towards the wholesome and away from the unwholesome

181
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:59,040
so gregory kramer he uh summarizes this uh as this practice of right effort as out

182
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,359
with the bad and in with the good whereas we could say the bad refers to

183
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:11,440
those actions that bring harm either to ourselves or others or those

184
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:20,720
mental qualities that keep us from settling down and seeing clearly headed towards more wisdom

185
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:27,359
so this classic core of what is abandoned or i'm just going to

186
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:33,200
name a list of lists here many of you will be familiar with this

187
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:39,599
these five hindrances maybe the three unwholesome roots that

188
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:45,680
is greed hatred and delusion the taints

189
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:53,119
this uh intoxication with sense pleasures intoxication with self-making and ignorance

190
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:59,359
so these are the some of the things that we're abandoning of course we're abandoning clinging

191
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:06,319
upadana clinging to the aggregates clinging to this conceit of i am

192
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:12,640
clinging to views so this is so much like buddhist practice right

193
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:18,400
it's like abandoning what is unwholesome and cultivating what is wholesome and

194
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,160
often we give dharma talks just on one little aspect of this

195
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:29,440
but just many of you are familiar with this kind of these are some of the unwholesome qualities that we're

196
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:37,119
abandoning and then of course on the other side the wholesome ones the seven factors of awakening

197
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:42,480
the wholesome roots of non-greed generosity

198
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:49,280
non-hatred which is love and non-delusion which is wisdom

199
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:56,560
we cultivate the five faculties we cultivate the brahman faharas the pyramids i had all these lists so i'm

200
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:02,079
just giving you a list of lists just to help maybe kind of

201
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:07,520
sometimes for me it's helpful to have like really that 10 000 foot view like

202
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:13,760
okay sometimes we're abandoning things sometimes we're cultivating things but

203
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,040
of course there's this interrelationship between abandoning the unwholesome and

204
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:25,760
cultivating the wholesome it's not like they're completely independent sometimes it's helpful to

205
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:33,119
organize our thoughts thinking that there's that which to be abandoned in that which to be cultivated

206
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:39,200
but there's this dynamic process or this dynamism between

207
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:45,599
these two and we can work with us so of course we notice

208
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:53,839
that when we're cultivating calm with our meditation practice

209
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:58,240
then some agitation is getting abandoned

210
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:04,400
when we're cultivating loving-kindness it will

211
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,240
is getting abandoned

212
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:18,079
so we can use this when we this want to abandon the hindrance of desire

213
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:23,839
we work with the entrances often by just bringing our attention to them

214
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:30,000
as we abandon the hindrance we can see that

215
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,079
more settledness arises more able to be present

216
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:41,599
so this inter-relationship between them and sometimes it might be that

217
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:47,920
what's unwholesome is really predominant in our mind predominant in our experience

218
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:54,480
and that's what we work with maybe we're already a little bit more settled and able to cultivate

219
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:01,119
some of these other qualities whether it's the brahma vahrehs the paramis the

220
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:07,200
factors of awakening just simple mindfulness or concentration

221
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:17,520
but there's if we're going to be applying effort on either of these ways of abandoning or

222
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:25,440
cultivating but there's also the way the manner in which we do it like how we

223
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:33,119
do it one thing is the direction where we're going but another is how we do it

224
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:38,400
because it's really easy to conflate effort like this word effort with this

225
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:45,200
kind of uh intense maybe we want to say over intense like focus kind of like a

226
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:52,400
bearing down sometimes i use this expression of a sledgehammer there's this feeling of you

227
00:47:52,400 --> 00:48:00,400
know i'm going to do this now and there's this sledgehammer with our attention or

228
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:06,559
with our focus perhaps or maybe we have some kind of dharma

229
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:13,920
ambition which is beautiful to have these inspirations but this dharma ambition for greater peace

230
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:19,280
and freedom gets translated into this over-striving and

231
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,640
efforting in such a way that is not sustainable

232
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:31,599
and ends up being unhelpful i i learned this the hard way probably

233
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:38,240
it's the only way to learn it i would say i'll say that at one retreat um in a

234
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:43,760
practice discussion with one of the teachers the teachers said to me that i'm a striver and i was

235
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:49,079
like quite offended i am not a striver

236
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:55,920
of course later i saw i was driving so much but you know i didn't realize it

237
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,640
and i have certainly spent many of retreats where you know kind of like this real bearing down on trying to get

238
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:09,680
concentrated and certainly i could get concentrated but there was a brittleness to it there was a kind of a little bit

239
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:16,240
of a unhealthiness to this like kind of this aversion almost a hatred towards

240
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:22,960
everything that wasn't supporting my getting concentrated so there can definitely be this

241
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:29,440
over efforting over striving in a way that isn't healthy but at the same time especially with

242
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:36,480
meditation practice or any of the buddhist practice that we do if we don't apply enough effort

243
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,040
if we're a little bit cavalier

244
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:49,040
lexidasical perhaps then this just leads to discouragement because we don't see the fruits of

245
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:54,240
effort if we're not really placing effort and then this leads to doubt

246
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:01,359
often like does this work does this practice work do these teachers work teachings work what about

247
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:07,280
these teachers do they know what they're talking about so if we don't we have to apply some

248
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,400
amount of effort in order to see some of the fruits

249
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:18,400
so and just maybe some different levels of effort are needed at different times

250
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:24,000
and again uh gregory kramer he says that sometimes right effort is like the

251
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:29,680
strenuous effort required to turn the soil and plant our gardens

252
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:35,520
let's work to turn the soil and plant the gardens

253
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:42,880
and then he continues at other times right effort is like the steady application of the sun's heat

254
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:49,200
as it slowly penetrates the soil and warms the seeds

255
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:56,240
if we want to see the fruit of our efforts both are required turning the soil planting the seed

256
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:02,480
letting them have sun letting them have water just soaking up the water

257
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:08,079
so discerning which type of effort is needed for whatever we're doing is part

258
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:13,599
of this practice of right effort and i would say is also part of the art of

259
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:20,319
practice is knowing how much effort and not only knowing how much but how to

260
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:28,319
turn the dial like how can we back off and how can we apply more

261
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:36,000
and so notice one way we can do this is to practice during meditation

262
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,640
with a mindfulness of breathing

263
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:49,680
as i did in the guided meditation we can just first allow the attention to

264
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:55,839
if we notice that they were lost in thought a lot just allow the attention to begin again so the kind of the energy

265
00:51:55,839 --> 00:52:01,838
is to like just begin again with the sensations of breathing in this example

266
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:07,920
and then when we starting to feel like okay there's a little bit more attention to breathing there's a little

267
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:15,760
bit more capacity or a little bit more ability to be with the breath

268
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:22,640
then we can look at what is the effort that we're applying and just

269
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:27,920
ask ourselves this question in a really gentle relaxed way

270
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:33,839
not in a demanding voice but what is the effort and we can as i had said in the

271
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:39,359
guided meditation we can use intention to help turn up the effort if

272
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:44,800
we feel like we need it so we could see

273
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:52,400
are we pouncing on the breath are we like really holding on to it straining

274
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:58,000
or perhaps there's another way in which we're kind of mindful like yeah okay

275
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:03,839
i'll get around to it i know the breath is there but this thought is very

276
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:10,319
provocative and i'll kind of do both at the same time there's this kind of mindfulness where yeah we know we're

277
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:15,680
breathing but we're also kind of simultaneously thinking

278
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:22,000
and because there isn't a lot of clarity it feels like there's two parallel tracks going on and because we have

279
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:29,599
mindfulness of the breath we feel like we're mindful actually what's happening if we had a little bit more focus we could see that

280
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:37,760
it's mindful of the breath and then a thought and then the breath and then thought we're like the mind is actually wavering back and forth

281
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:46,800
so we don't need a lot we don't need strong effort but sometimes we might need just a

282
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:52,400
little bit more effort and with great meditation we can set the

283
00:53:52,400 --> 00:54:00,160
intention it's one way of just dialing up the effort a little bit setting the intention okay i'm going to

284
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:07,200
be mindful for the entirety of the in-breath so it's not a very ambitious intention

285
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:13,599
but it's something in which we can do setting the intention is a way in which

286
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:18,880
we can it makes it more likely that in fact that will be with all of the in-breath

287
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:25,520
and chances are we'll be with a number of in-breaths and then the

288
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:30,640
the mindfulness will start to wane and when we notice that we can set the attention

289
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:36,000
again and so

290
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,520
we might if we need to lessen the effort during the meditation if we find that we

291
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:48,319
really are kind of really tight and this often can happen when we're trying to get concentrated we might have

292
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:55,200
this idea that we really have to i think gill uses this expression bear down

293
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:00,640
this real way we have to strive strain maybe

294
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:08,160
so one way to lessen the effort is to open up the awareness

295
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:16,880
so one way to open up the awareness is if we're being with the breath is maybe to just be more broadly with the body

296
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:23,920
sometimes we i say that expression to sit to know we're sitting maybe that's one way maybe that's too

297
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,960
broad maybe just to choose some contact of the body where

298
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:34,640
it's touching the seat where your feet are touching what your hands are touching

299
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:40,880
as well as the sensations of breathing so not such a small point

300
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:48,079
but a little bit larger or another way to broaden our awareness is to bring it to

301
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:54,799
sounds kind of like open up the awareness to sounds and just allowing sounds to arise

302
00:55:54,799 --> 00:56:01,359
so we're still being mindful but not bearing down and straining quite so much

303
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:07,760
so that's one way in which we might be able to decrease the effort

304
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:15,359
but we might also have this fear of and resistance to

305
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:21,839
the application of this energy or this some exertion or zeal

306
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:27,520
sometimes in this who does those of you are familiar with this that language this seal

307
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:33,280
exertion and i think even this language often gets translated as strive

308
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:38,319
so we might have this fear of this or this real resistance to that might feel

309
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:45,440
like the last thing we want is somebody telling us to strive this feeling of a having a

310
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:52,720
what is that you know kind of like the the whip but can we come to an understanding

311
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:58,640
of right effort that's helps helpful and wholesome

312
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:04,319
that recognizes that there there can be a joy that's associated with a heartfelt

313
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:12,319
commitment commitment to something that's wholesome

314
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:19,280
and and like this joy arises when the it's the effort isn't too much

315
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:24,799
but instead is more like a commitment yes i am committing myself to this practice

316
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:30,000
for this next hour or maybe buddhist for this next half hour however long you're sitting

317
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:36,078
or for just buddhist practice more in general taking the refuges

318
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:42,960
and can we also allow ourselves to apply ourselves with

319
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:48,880
confidence like that we can back off if it's too much effort and we

320
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:54,000
can turn it up if it's not quite enough effort

321
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:02,160
can we come to this understanding of applying effort through investigation through exploration through noticing

322
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:07,920
in which we can appreciate that applying effort to this practice is

323
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:13,520
such a beautiful way in which we can get out of the streams of our habits

324
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:19,359
the streams of our social structures and our relationships and help us to find more and more

325
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:25,040
freedom more and more ease while we are

326
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:30,400
abandoning the unwholesome and cultivating the wholesome

327
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:38,240
so may our effort be a support for us not feel something burdensome something that we have to do

328
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:45,359
not something that is overly taxing so that it is not sustainable

329
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:52,960
but instead that allows us to have this commitment to practice this commitment to

330
00:58:53,839 --> 00:59:00,000
non-harming this commitment to greater peace this commitment to

331
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:07,520
discovering more freedom so that those we come in contact with and

332
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:13,599
spreading out from there so that our practice and the way we apply effort

333
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:19,680
can be a support not only for ourselves but for all beings everywhere

334
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,920
thank you
