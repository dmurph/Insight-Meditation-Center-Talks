1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,680
hello and

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,160
welcome welcome to this

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:20,439
meditation and one of the part of the art of meditation the skills of

4
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,680
meditation is to have an infinite

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,320
patience and the closer we get into

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:39,040
samadei the more patient we need to be not patient because it's not going well

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,079
but because it becomes more and more important

8
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:53,039
to simply set the course and

9
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:58,879
to stay on the course as if you're going to do this

10
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,040
forever you're settling in and less and

11
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,600
less orientation towards accomplishing doing

12
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,960
anything less and less orientation around having desires for something or escape from

13
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:24,360
something less and less trying to make something happen

14
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,600
this orient this way of practicing is useful all along to a certain degree but

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,520
it becomes more and more important the quieter stiller the mind becomes because

16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:43,960
the slightest little desire slightest little pushing and wanting um agitates or

17
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:49,880
interferes with the samadei itself

18
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:57,640
so to assume a meditation posture

19
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,799
and taking a little bit of time to be careful and

20
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,719
caring about the posture you'll meditate

21
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:18,840
in almost like like a ritual of arriving here

22
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,760
part of that ritual might be to gently close the

23
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:36,159
eyes and as they close to have the gaze turn

24
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:50,519
inward the gaze turn inward as if there's a homecoming here

25
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,599
and gently in a way that feels really nice

26
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,519
for you take some fuller breaths with the

27
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,680
whole torso just enough to feel

28
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:25,560
like full or satisfied with breathing

29
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:33,680
in and then a longer than usual exhale slow

30
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,159
steady steadying yourself in your

31
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:45,560
seat in the place that you're meditating

32
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,560
breathing in relaxing on the

33
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:12,280
exhale and letting the breathing return to

34
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,639
normal and for a few breaths more let your attention travel around

35
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:24,600
your body to places of holding or

36
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,960
activation and on the exhale gently

37
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,960
relax it might feel good to pause at the end of the exhale

38
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:45,280
sometimes the body can relax more in that

39
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,440
pause a pause at the end of the exhale gives you a chance to feel the global

40
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:07,320
body a bit more and allow more letting go in the body

41
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,360
and then letting the breathing return to

42
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:48,199
normal and with a normal breath on the inhale

43
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:57,360
feel the thinking mind feel it if possible with patience

44
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:04,520
acceptance just to feel it and know it as if you're saying

45
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:10,639
hello and then on the exhale to relax the thinking

46
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,560
mind

47
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,039
feeling the thinking mind feeling the whole

48
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:51,759
mind on the inhale and on the

49
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:58,560
exhale to settle steady the

50
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,400
mind on the

51
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:09,360
breathing orient the

52
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,639
mind towards the

53
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:31,080
breathing organizing the mind for the whole mind to

54
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:37,520
be centered on breathing in and breathing out

55
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:46,400
as if there's a light from the back of the

56
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:56,120
mind that directly settles on the breathing

57
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,400
feeling the body's experience of

58
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:43,399
breathing and feeling it being aware of it in a gentle steadiness

59
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,440
not fixating the mind but a gentle massaging of breathing

60
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,720
in the body awareness with the

61
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,639
breathing a gentle flow and

62
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,320
orientation feeling whatever

63
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,720
sensation feeling there is in

64
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:47,760
breathing that feels sweet

65
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,080
pleasant enjoyable

66
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,440
it might not be with the sensations of breathing

67
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:18,519
directly but it might be a feeling of being cozy or at

68
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:25,760
home around the breathing like the body around breathing is a nest where

69
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,920
breathing settles and moves

70
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,680
and as we enter samadei there might be the kind of

71
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:47,680
subtle sublime feelings that come with quiet creativity

72
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,240
a kind of cozy feeling of intuition

73
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:18,680
maybe a kind of subtle sublime feeling of listening to very reassuring

74
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:28,519
music that [Music] somehow touches us deep inside

75
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:45,680
breathing in the middle of it all holding the course

76
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:54,519
steady content to be with a breathing as if

77
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,720
forever in infinite patience

78
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:13,600
remembering not there's no need anymore for desires or

79
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:21,959
aversions simply accompanying breathing

80
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,040
And to evoke a little bit of pleasure or joy

81
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:54,079
delight in this steadiness with breathing you can turn up the corners of

82
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,120
your mouth just

83
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:05,360
enough to elicit some pleasure

84
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:12,079
joy lightness

85
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:21,160
openness to support the

86
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:26,480
patient accompanying of each breath

87
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:29,480
there can be something satisfying with sitting meditating

88
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:35,440
quietly without desires and without diversions

89
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,639
a cozy

90
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:50,679
patience to accompany breathing

91
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,400
continuously

92
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,960
taking a few moments to

93
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:09,679
feel deeply within deeply within within whatever

94
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:17,840
else you normally feel is there something that feels

95
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,720
satisfying that feels sweet or

96
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:40,840
beautiful that feels cozy or an at homeness

97
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:53,400
or maybe a sense of ease or peace calm

98
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:09,520
gently let yourself feel

99
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:17,880
receive the influence of this deeper sense of

100
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:23,640
well-being however subtle it might be

101
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:44,158
and imagine that it has no edges that in some way the

102
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:55,600
well-being deeper feeling is open wide to the whole world

103
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:06,760
an open transmission on

104
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:12,840
which can travel your goodwill out

105
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:20,080
into the world and may these words represent your

106
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:25,039
own goodwill your own well-wishing for

107
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:31,919
others and may you

108
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:37,840
cherish your capacity for

109
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:45,080
goodwill may all beings be happy

110
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,120
may all beings be

111
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:58,799
safe may all beings be

112
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:07,960
peaceful may all beings be free

113
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:24,080
and may we each stay close to the deeper place

114
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:30,399
within from which good will can flow

115
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:40,000
may this practice we do help us spread well-wishing

116
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:48,039
goodwill and friendship out into the world

117
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:57,909
[Music]

118
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,080
thank you

119
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:22,360
so welcome to the continuation of this series of talks on

120
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:30,720
samadei i think we're now on the 40th talk and

121
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:37,279
um what I hope is that these guided meditations that go along with it and

122
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,720
these talks um more than teaching you techniques

123
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:49,640
more than teaching you how to do samadei practice it's pointing you to

124
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:55,640
feeling something meaningful and satisfying

125
00:32:55,640 --> 00:33:04,600
within the normal state that people live in is involves some kind of

126
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:10,799
tension some kind of stress it might be a low level and it

127
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:18,640
might not be recognizable by people that they're living with stress and tension because it's become normalized

128
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,679
it's expected it's just how it is to be in the world how it is to be a human

129
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:29,679
being and the person might have a reference point for something that calls stress or

130
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:39,080
being tense that's some kind of serious level or quantum leap above their normal

131
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:47,039
state but still often people live in this normal state and what that means is

132
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:53,840
that um the thinking that comes from tension also has become normalized also

133
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,760
seems just as this is how what it is to be a human being and uh and we're supposed to do

134
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,799
this or we may even be almost invisible that we're constantly chattering talking

135
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:09,878
having conversations remembering reviewing

136
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:17,440
planning and um but to enter into samadei is to drop into some place

137
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,760
that's below any level of tension or stress that we can experience

138
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,599
and in a sense uh we are now in samadei

139
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:35,760
um dropping below the stress level of our life the tension level sometimes the

140
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:43,040
stress and tension kind of start continues to be there in the body and heart or someplace but is now moved a

141
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:49,358
little bit to the periphery because we feel at the center or underneath it all

142
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:58,359
a place where uh there is no stress there is no tension there is no operating

143
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:04,640
on clinging desires pushing desires needy desires

144
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,920
that are there without any kind of uh hostile aversion

145
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,440
pushing away wanting it to be different it's it's like we're dropping into a

146
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,920
much more of a na can be a natural state of who we are when there is no tension

147
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:29,040
when there is no stress at all in the system and um and this gives rise to deep

148
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,359
feelings of satisfaction relief

149
00:35:34,359 --> 00:35:39,400
well-being joy and each person is going to experience this

150
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:45,520
differently but sometimes it comes along with um the kind of feelings you would

151
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:53,400
have uh if you were peacefully creative maybe writing poetry or reading

152
00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:01,160
poetry or maybe um you know uh peacefully

153
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:07,680
quietly involved absorbed in a very simple craft or very simple playing of

154
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,440
music where there's some kind of almost emotional feeling that wells up or is

155
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:20,400
there that feels susive and spread through the body and um and it isn't that we can so

156
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:26,960
much make this happen in somebody but um it begins to show itself because it's

157
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,200
there almost it's almost like it's always there is underneath the tension underneath

158
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:38,240
distress and uh it's kind of like the a uh treasure house within that's waiting

159
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:45,800
to be opened and it's important not to think that the treasures are too you know

160
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:52,400
fantastic not not don't important not to look for peak experiences and dramatic

161
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,640
uh you know feelings of samadei but uh it's actually better to have it be be

162
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:06,079
kind of very deep contentment a deep satisfaction a deep aha this is good to

163
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:12,560
be here like you've gotten really cozy in bed and now you're safe now it's good

164
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,599
nothing has to happen nothing has more has to be done nothing has to be said

165
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,839
and now this is good and to be able to recognize that uh

166
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,880
so we can move towards it or settle into it in meditation so we can recognize

167
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,160
that this is important this is valuable it's a treasure uh because sometimes the

168
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:42,200
orientation is so strongly towards safe towards uh thoughts and uh tension

169
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:47,760
stress that often driven by the desire to be safe because we're afraid the

170
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,280
desire to want something because we feel like uh insufficient in some way or we

171
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,520
just want more pleasure or something um and to have and to no longer be

172
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:05,440
attracted to that no longer be hooked into it or to to be mesmerized by

173
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,480
desires and aversions um and to settle

174
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:18,560
quietly into a much more deeper sense of contentment deeper sense of satisfaction

175
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:25,200
and um at some point because uh uh we start seeing that having any we start

176
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:32,560
seeing that desire or when we see that desires aversions thoughts are actually

177
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:39,040
agitating the mind keeping us separated from this deeper place that's satisfying

178
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,160
deeper connection to breathing and the underlying kind of

179
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:51,320
um peace or this joy or well-being in which breathing

180
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:58,079
occurs we see that thoughts and desires are agitating it then it's easier to

181
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,200
just let those go let those become quieter kind of let the mind become

182
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,480
stiller and quieter uh let the heart be more settled

183
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,400
um but we might need to see the the that certain kinds of activities of the mind

184
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:21,680
are not so satisfying or maybe a little bit alienating a little bit uh keeping

185
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:29,040
us away from something deeper satisfaction so that it's easier just to let it float away there comes a time

186
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,760
when the desire to not have those desires is too much to have and so it's

187
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:41,839
almost like we just learn to leave it alone we have desires we have aversions

188
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:48,320
we have thoughts and there comes a time when there's a just feels like the best thing to do is just leave it completely

189
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:53,599
alone don't be involved it recedes the periphery it's not being reinforced

190
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,800
maybe it floats away maybe it's kind of quietly in the background but in the

191
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:04,560
foreground is where the action is the action of contentment the actions of

192
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:11,680
deep satisfaction deep immersion in this lake of

193
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:19,200
samadei and um and in this space of samadei there can be pleasures there can

194
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,960
be pleasantness there can be joy there can be strong sense of happiness

195
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:31,599
sometimes people feel rapture in these states and um but the idea is to somehow

196
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:37,200
be at ease in the middle of them don't push for anything don't try to pump

197
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:43,040
anything up just try to be at ease and allow make it space allow it to be there

198
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:48,720
let each thing of these well-being kind of have space breathing room to live the

199
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:54,640
way it wants to live sometimes these states get stronger sometimes they fade away

200
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:02,720
um don't have an agenda but be hold it steady and uh and what happens with uh

201
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:09,520
as we go through this approach stage the steady staying here becomes stronger and

202
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:17,680
stronger or sometimes it feels almost like we're clicking in and when there's a kind of a shift boom and now we're re

203
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:23,040
now we've really arrived boy are we ever here now with this experience and it

204
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:28,240
doesn't feel like there's any movement to get distracted or wander away

205
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:35,520
sometimes that is a very slow steady movement of like that we slowly um

206
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:43,079
settle into we don't see sometimes it almost coming until we find ourselves in a state where we're now we're

207
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:49,920
really here and um and you know there's if there's thoughts it's only thoughts

208
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,119
that are pleasant pleasant nice good thoughts about what's happening in

209
00:41:56,119 --> 00:42:03,400
meditation about the experience here and out that supports us to be with it and

210
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:09,520
um and very very quiet and and and to some people have the experience we're

211
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:17,040
locked in to this now sometimes it's just really like there's um um we're at

212
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,920
rest where now we're really rooted here and now and

213
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:28,400
so the kind of the fruition of this approach stage is

214
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:36,160
because we're so patient so willing to just stay here and be here for as if forever that the desires to be anywhere

215
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:42,319
else begin to fall away and um and the familiarity with just staying here with

216
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:48,000
the breath staying one breath after the other inhale exhale riding the breath

217
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,560
staying with it continuously in an easeful way at some point we're we're rooted

218
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:01,640
we're there we're we're we're not not going away for a while and

219
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:08,880
um and then in without exactly desire

220
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:15,920
um we're allowed to enjoy that and this is where the art of enjoyment is an art

221
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:24,760
it's the enjoyment enjoy it in a way that helps the minds be

222
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:33,520
quiet without thoughts with less thoughts calm and um and then just just oh just

223
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,800
stay there and you can feel that having thoughts takes you away from it but

224
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,720
you're allowed to be there in that well-being of deep samadei it's actually

225
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:52,880
part of what we become rooted in or connected in it supports us to be right there in the

226
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,880
practice so whether you understand what I'm saying now and you any reference

227
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,160
point your own experience or not um I think it's good just to hear these words

228
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:10,400
hear these descriptions uh so that you can um recognize it or

229
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:16,400
appreciate it or be inspired by it uh so some characteristics some qualities of

230
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,319
this can um actually be there all along in your practice in your meditation even

231
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:28,480
times when you are much more restless and filled with thoughts that this is the orientation this is the the

232
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,599
simplicity of it and um and so we'll continue on

233
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:39,680
Monday and on Monday we're going to start going into uh some of the

234
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:46,240
characteristics of when the samadei really becomes clear full samadei which

235
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:53,200
in the our tradition is called Janna and um and I'm not expecting you to be in

236
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,720
Janna but uh some of the qualities characteristics of it are useful to know

237
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,839
even even when you're not in Janna but in the meantime if you have

238
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:12,240
feel like any kind of ongoingness momentum that's happening from you from this samadei uh series I

239
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:19,480
would recommend that you be sure to meditate this weekend through the next few days next two days so that there's

240
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:24,800
some continuity through the next two days that you can pick up with or

241
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:32,560
continue into Monday when we start again so thank you very much and um I

242
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:38,440
appreciate your attention your being part of this journey with somebody and

243
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:45,560
um and I look forward to continuing thank you
