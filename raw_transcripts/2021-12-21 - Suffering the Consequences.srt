1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:06,000
good evening welcome welcome

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,799
nice to see you all and how is the volume does it sound okay

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:18,720
is it okay yeah yeah okay i'm not sure if we're live on youtube

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,240
but if we are welcome to everybody out there also

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:32,239
i had a little bit of technical difficulties earlier but what is it like okay great

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,559
maybe before i turn on the recording i'll just mention that um

7
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,239
there are conversations about with the omicron variant whether imc should

8
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:53,120
consider closing again no decisions have been made and right now we're the plan is to stay open

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,680
but i just want to let you know that that might change in the next week or two or something like this so

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,320
just a heads up about that okay

11
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,479
so really warm welcome it's nice it's nice to practice together

12
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,560
while we were sitting you know sometimes we hear the rustle of somebody shifting their posture and somehow it just made

13
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,119
me happy there's you know human bodies here individuals here together you know

14
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,078
practicing it was so thank you

15
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,880
so tonight i want to talk a little bit about something that seems so obvious

16
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,280
like it seems like we shouldn't even have to talk about it and yet there's a way that there can be

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:55,040
a depth about it and there can be some real awakening or some new understanding when we really

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:03,200
look at it we kind of unpack it or explore it in some kind of way

19
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,360
and that is this idea that that actions we take whether they are of body speech or mind

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:19,599
so whether they're thoughts i'm i'm putting thoughts in there with this uh category of uh actions

21
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:25,120
actions have consequences there's a cause and effect

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,640
and this is not anything new to anybody in this room

23
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:37,760
in fact i think there's even like a physics law about this right for every action

24
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,879
there's an equal and opposite reaction right it's so fundamental that even the physicists are

25
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:48,000
have talked about it and so

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,920
we know this that if we are dishonest with a friend and

27
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:01,680
our friend discovers this or even if they don't discover it but it there it affects our relationships

28
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,040
if we spend a lot of time being angry at the news

29
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,000
then our minds get filled with being with angry thoughts

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,440
and we tend to just be have a lot of tension

31
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,799
and anger inside of us and of course there's this teaching that

32
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,840
that which one ponders becomes the inclination of the mind

33
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,920
right so we're kind of like priming the the mind to just be more readily angry

34
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,879
if we're just fueling it all the time so to be sure some things have little

35
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,640
impact on our lives that we experience maybe

36
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:58,000
there's not a big impact that we have to wait in line a little bit longer at the grocery store for example

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,080
some things have large impact if we find ourselves behaving unethically this

38
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:10,879
could unfold in a way that has large impact if we do a lot of meditation that can be

39
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,000
a way that also there's a big impact so some of the impacts some of the

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,639
consequences are small it might even be dismissive and some are large

41
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,919
but there is nothing that doesn't have any impact and part of the buddhist practice is to

42
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:36,800
just thoroughly recognize this and to thoroughly understand this

43
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,600
that of course things have consequences and this simple idea

44
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:50,560
which now is so commonplace for all of us wasn't so obvious at the time of the buddha

45
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,840
in fact there's um another teacher a non-buddhist that the

46
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,240
gets described in a number of different places in the sutas and a little excerpt of what this other

47
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,680
teacher would say makali gosala he would say there is no cause or

48
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,360
condition for the corruption of beings there is no cause or condition for the

49
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,880
purification of beings all beings all living creatures all

50
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:26,880
sentient beings that control power and energy instead they are molded by destiny

51
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:32,880
by circumstance by nature so this idea that something out there

52
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,240
was responsible for whatever happened to a person

53
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,840
so it didn't matter what a person did there was something out there and it wasn't ever

54
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,199
for this particular teacher wasn't clearly described what that was

55
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,360
but this idea then that people doesn't matter what we do doesn't matter

56
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,319
no consequences

57
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:07,440
we might say but the buddha's teaching on the four noble truths

58
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,400
is the opposite there are consequences

59
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,520
there's a number of different ways in which we can approach the formal truths we can emphasize different parts and

60
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,560
we can translate some of the words a little bit differently but one way to look at this is

61
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,880
that there is dukkha right the first noble truth there is dukkha

62
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:39,440
we can translate dukkha as just this dissatisfaction like just things are not

63
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:46,240
quite right and maybe we can't even like necessarily put our finger on it

64
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,440
it just feels dissatisfying or just not not

65
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:58,639
not perfect all the way to dukkha being the suffering of

66
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,680
tremendous physical pain that humans can do experience

67
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,599
tremendous emotional pain that humans can experience so this dukkha from

68
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,599
just the something not quite being right to great pain

69
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,680
first normal truth there is dukkha and then the second noble truth there is a cause

70
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:28,638
for dukkha is a consequence of something else

71
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:37,199
there's a reason that it's there it doesn't mean that we know it it doesn't mean that it's obvious to us but it does mean that

72
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:43,680
it's not like magic or you know sometimes or somehow it's uh

73
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:49,520
have been happening from some other reason that has nothing to do with

74
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:56,319
humans or i guess it might be right i mean weather and these types of things that

75
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,560
happen but i'll unpack this a little bit more about what i mean by dukkha

76
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:10,000
so the second noble truth there's a cause third there is a cessation of dukkha and fourth there's a way leading

77
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,759
to this cessation so practicing this path

78
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:22,720
requires that we recognize that there are actions that bring us dukkha

79
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:31,280
and there's actions that bring us non-duka we might say freedom peace ease

80
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,560
and so much about this practice is just recognizing okay

81
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,959
is this going towards dukkha or no is it going towards freedom and we could interpret the four noble

82
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,800
truths this way and without this understanding of course it's really difficult to have our lives

83
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,959
unfold in a particular way that everything has consequences and we can consider whether

84
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,800
those constant consequences are more duca or less duca

85
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,480
maybe what i've been saying it's like okay okay diana we know this isn't our

86
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,160
first dharma talk we've heard about the formidable truths we've heard about dukkha

87
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:23,120
but something that i appreciate so much about the dharma is how it's there's this depth and this breath

88
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:29,120
when we really explore we can find something that

89
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,440
meets us wherever we are we hear about teachings we read suitas we practice

90
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:42,720
again and again and then sometimes our understandings start to shift our

91
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:49,200
the way it touches us starts to shift and we start to even though we might have seen it so many times we might see

92
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,399
it in a new way and understand something differently and that we didn't understand before

93
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,160
and i'd like to suggest that our understanding of dukkha shifts

94
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,720
as we practice probably many of you have this experience

95
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,320
i know that i remember this so clearly that um a dharma teacher

96
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,640
i was having a practice discussion and a dharma teacher said something to me about

97
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,399
suffering and i said i don't have any suffering

98
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:33,279
you know i had just quit my job at that time and i was feeling you know pretty great like wow i had attributed like all

99
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,720
my difficulties with you know having this job but

100
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:45,519
not realizing that this is our meditation

101
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,279
practice starts to grow and we start to experience more and more calm

102
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:58,880
as we start to experience more and more peace then our definition of dukkha kind of shifts along with that

103
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,720
and we start to notice oh yeah there are more and more subtle

104
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,120
experiences and expressions of dukkha

105
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,279
so we can start to become that it starts to become that which is less calm

106
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,880
that which is less open

107
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,600
that which is less quiet so dukkha can be understood as

108
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:36,640
this tightening as this constriction which can be really subtle

109
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:44,399
and maybe it shows up primarily in our meditation practice or maybe it shows up in really obvious gross ways in our

110
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,800
daily life as well but we can explore this world of actions

111
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,000
and consequences by looking at duka

112
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,240
because for some people they're suffering their difficulties their why things aren't going the way that they

113
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,720
wish it's a little bit of a mystery to them why isn't my life the way that i

114
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:16,639
thought it was going to be or why is i why is there this suffering why is there this sense of dissatisfaction and often

115
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,839
we look in the wrong places for the cause

116
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:30,399
it's a habit that many of us have it's a human habit to blame

117
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,399
somebody else did something wrong this has to be fixed somebody better fix it

118
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,600
this is not right with we might blame ourselves

119
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:49,519
if i only i were a better meditator if only i were a better this better that it would uh

120
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,519
then this uh suffering wouldn't be here often people are looking outside

121
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:02,880
themselves okay i have to fix this out there i have to engineer manipulate can

122
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:11,200
manufacture you know somehow create some different conditions in order to see for the dukkha

123
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:19,480
or sometimes people just are complaining not even having some clear idea of what is the source of dukkha

124
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:27,200
we can bring attention bring care to this dukkha

125
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,480
without self-pity without blame but to look at it and to see the action

126
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:38,000
that is underlying that is fueling that is the cause for

127
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,040
this uh constriction that is dukkha

128
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:49,040
very often that action is attachment or clinging and

129
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,399
so much about practice can be loosening the constructions kind of be about

130
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:00,399
loosening this uh the tightening that happens around

131
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:03,839
that causes stuka

132
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:11,760
so this clinging this attachment can be really subtle and when we find ourselves experiencing

133
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:18,880
duca we can just ask okay what is where is there any sense of tightness any sense of holding on

134
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:25,920
any sense of clinging it's likely that we will discover that

135
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,360
this clinging this tightness that's holding on this contraction

136
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:38,160
is related to having a sense of self stuff that we want to be a particular

137
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:45,320
way or we want to not be a particular way

138
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:52,160
and there's a particularly strong sense of self when there is blame

139
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,480
there's this often a sense of self-righteousness that arises like don't they know who i am what what are

140
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,760
they thinking or when we make a mistake or something goes wrong we most

141
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:15,040
often are turning towards blame and there's this exaggerated and flexible sense of me or you

142
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:21,760
and the kind of he said she said i said i don't think that happens often we're

143
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:27,839
blaming ourselves or blaming others and then these negative self views or

144
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,440
these negative views of others they tend to like fuel themselves or fuel each

145
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:40,360
other creating this vicious duka cycle

146
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,560
so i would like to propose or suggest there's a way in which we can find our

147
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,839
way out of this that we can uh interrupt these dukkha

148
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:57,399
cycles and one way is to

149
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:04,720
re-look at re-analyze and experience experience in which we're having dukkha

150
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,399
and look at it again maybe it's on the cushion or outside of the cushion as a way to understand

151
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:17,040
what are the conditions that came together that are supported this experience of

152
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,720
difficulty this experience of dukkha

153
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:30,399
is there a way that we can look at that from a different angle with maybe a heart of compassion

154
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:36,480
and with it in the service of compassion to recognize that there are so many different

155
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,600
conditions that come together so many like countless conditions that

156
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,639
come together and whenever is happening right something is the consequence of all

157
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:52,079
kinds of different things us being here together as a consequence

158
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,360
of this building being built and

159
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,079
things on the internet that's on the calendar and however transportation you use to get

160
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:10,959
here right it's countless things that come together so to illustrate this i'd like to share

161
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,480
a story this story is from rob verbaea and

162
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,360
it gives an example of how one might do this

163
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,000
so imagine that you're or perhaps this actually happened

164
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,400
you were with a friend and your friend is telling you some difficulty she is going through

165
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:41,440
and you're listening as attentively or sympathetically as you can but at the same time

166
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:46,799
you're also aware of some disquiet within yourself and

167
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:54,000
you're vaguely worried that maybe you should have a little more empathy or you should have some more compassion

168
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,640
for your friend some but they're telling you this story about difficulty somehow you feel

169
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,919
unmoved not really touched by what this is saying and

170
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,039
later when you reflect on this it bothers you and you wonder is there

171
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:17,039
something wrong with me why wasn't i able to connect with my friend

172
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,360
and maybe you have this idea well i've been doing all this practice

173
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,760
and am i just a cold-hearted person after all how come i couldn't uh connect with

174
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:38,400
this person that i care about but that way of considering

175
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:45,520
that particular activity or that particular um experience

176
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:53,039
is where you're focusing on yourself and holding only yourself responsible for how things went

177
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:59,840
fails to see it fails to take into account a whole range of other factors

178
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:06,559
that contributed that's contributed to limiting the connection you felt with your friend for

179
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:13,280
example it could be something really basic

180
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,720
maybe you had a headache and you weren't quite feeling your

181
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,960
the best version of yourself a little bit feeling a little bit off maybe you were tired

182
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:32,400
we shouldn't underestimate right how human beings are not the best versions of themselves when they are tired

183
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,320
and when we are often sometimes when we are putting pressure on ourselves to feel something different

184
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:46,080
than what we're actually feeling we have this idea i should really be more sympathetic or

185
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,840
empathetic or compassionate towards my friend and yet i'm not when we are putting pressure on

186
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,200
ourselves to feel something that we're not then often we feel disconnected from

187
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,280
ourselves and disconnected from other people around us so maybe even just having that idea i

188
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:10,640
should be different kind of created the conditions for things to unfold a little bit in a different way

189
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,000
so maybe that's one thing that was happening but maybe that's something a little bit

190
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,039
more complex maybe there was some slight tension between you

191
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:28,559
and your friend that was left unresolved the last time you met and something

192
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:36,320
small that at the time seemed insignificant but now is affecting you

193
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:44,159
maybe it's enough that it affects maybe your openness maybe you're feeling a little bit more guarded

194
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:52,559
or maybe there was something in the way that your friend herself the way that she was uh telling the story

195
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:59,600
like maybe she was telling the story that she was exaggerating in a way that felt a little

196
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,360
bit off like she herself was disconnected from the story

197
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:12,159
or maybe she felt like she was holding back or she was uh hamming it up being

198
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:19,440
dismissive whatever it meant whatever it was there might be a way in which she was behaving

199
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:26,720
so it's not that we definitely would now like blame our friend oh i felt i couldn't feel connected because she was

200
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,120
behaving in some particular way because right there's all these conditions of why she was behaving this way

201
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,559
the point here is that there are different types of

202
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:45,760
conditions that come together for every moment every one of our experiences and they

203
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,200
all have an impact on our experiences

204
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,799
so sometimes when we blame ourselves or we blame others

205
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:02,080
we're not taking into into account

206
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:09,200
these other conditions so one way we might do this to re-consider

207
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:14,320
review re-analyze an experience we had in which we feel like there's a lot of

208
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:22,559
blame either for ourselves or for others or that we feel constricted about or any time in which there's a lot of duca

209
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:30,240
for example is um and there are some tools that can be helpful it can be feel cumbersome

210
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:37,520
also so i offer these just so that they might be helpful i myself i find i do this when i get

211
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:43,600
stuck when i feel like i'm blaming myself or blaming others about some difficulty

212
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,640
i sometimes use these different tools as a way to help

213
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:55,760
kind of kind of help like flesh out everything that happened so for example

214
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:03,520
what are some of the present inner conditions that happened at the time so what do i mean by that

215
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:10,320
what was the mind state that you had what was the what was the

216
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:15,440
emotional state what were beliefs or perceptions that were really active at

217
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,559
that time and the example that i gave tiredness

218
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:30,000
would uh be an example what are at the present outer conditions

219
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,640
for the story that i told it was the way in which your friend was relaying the story when she was telling it maybe

220
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:43,120
there was something that wasn't quite right or didn't feel quite right

221
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:49,200
so in the present moment what was happening in the inside your inner experience and what was happening in the

222
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,919
environment but then of course what were some of the conditions in the past

223
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:03,840
that related to this maybe there's habits of mind or

224
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:11,440
some um inner states that are affecting us and in the story i told

225
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:18,880
that would be that maybe there was something unresolved between you and your friend maybe there was some slight tension maybe you felt just a

226
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,240
little bit offended by something she said or you know and the time passed and so now

227
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,559
you're showing up just a little bit differently

228
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:37,600
or maybe there's these past uh outer conditions these impressions or influences we have from

229
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:44,240
our friends for or from our history so we can look at these different

230
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,520
categories as a way to help us see oh there's so many different

231
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,120
conditions that led to this consequence

232
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,799
of not feeling connected with my friend in this story

233
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:07,679
so rather than there's a having to blame or rather than saying okay i'm at fault or my friend is

234
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:16,320
at fault or or something like this instead we can just soften that whole idea of blame

235
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:23,200
soften the idea of that there's a self at the center of everything and recognize that there are so many

236
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,640
different things that come together and came together for that particular

237
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,080
experience and that has now gone away those

238
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:41,600
conditions are no longer there it doesn't mean that there still isn't some maybe some harm or some

239
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,760
feelings about it but now there can be some moving forward often when there's we're stuck in a

240
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,799
sense of blame there's a real stuckness we can't find our way forward

241
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,799
so this and i'm not saying that we don't um

242
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:09,360
accept responsibilities for our actions either and just say oh it's just conditions there's a no responsibility

243
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:15,279
this is so much about practice as recognizing yes there's these conditions that come together and we have

244
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:20,880
responsibilities to accept the consequences of our

245
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,000
actions and this is a big part about what it

246
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,919
means to be a mature practitioner too right is to recognize that some of the

247
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:38,720
consequences of our actions are uncomfortable dukkha

248
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:45,919
and then we practice with patients we practice with forbearance we practice with equanimity

249
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,120
we learn from these things so that we can in the future

250
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,120
perhaps not have as much difficulty

251
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,480
but this idea of looking at actions and consequences

252
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,600
that they can and rather than there being a self

253
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:14,400
which is often associated with blame not always but often it doesn't have to be at the center it

254
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:21,200
doesn't have to be like this stuckness there instead just to see oh all these things came together i had a part there

255
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,320
was these other parts and those they've gone away now and there's these

256
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,159
further consequences but just feel the

257
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,840
freedom that is available there when we don't have to make ourselves or

258
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:44,159
somebody else at the center and taking responsibility for everything

259
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,760
and so this part of practice is to recognize we take responsibility for our actions and

260
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:58,960
we recognize that lots of conditions come together including clinging

261
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:07,679
and often the clinging is so a sense of self so if we can soften the sense of self if we can soften the clinging

262
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:14,559
there'll be less duca and often this clinging is taken the form of blame not always not always but

263
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:19,919
often so in that way we might take this

264
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:27,279
idea of that actions have consequences a humdrum everyday thing that we know

265
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:34,880
and just more thoroughly apply it to everything everything in our life

266
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,320
and to help us kind of find our way with more ease

267
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:47,840
and less dukkha less dissatisfaction less suffering

268
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,158
so thank you

269
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:08,159
so i'll end there and um if you'd like you're welcome to

270
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:14,159
come up and and talk to me or i don't know if i yeah let's because i

271
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:20,399
already turned off the recording i was gonna say maybe i can do some q a in the whole if if somebody has a question that

272
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:26,200
they'd like to ask but yeah we don't have a microphone so

273
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,398
i don't know if anybody does

274
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:48,000
how do we use meditation to prevent future suffering i'm sorry i didn't tell you the first

275
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,440
part how do we use or how do we continue practicing or how does meditation essentially help us to prevent future

276
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:02,960
suffering yeah thank you that's a good question so i uh hinted at this at the beginning

277
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,240
as the mind and the body settle as we start to get more quiet with our

278
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:13,279
meditation we start to notice these movements of the heart these

279
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:21,520
movements of the mind that uh are more towards construction that are more towards a clinging

280
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:28,720
and so we start to just notice oh yeah when there's this movement towards letting go there's more ease and when

281
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:35,279
there's this movement towards clinging there's less ease and just that recognition that you have

282
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:42,080
to see ten times a hundred times a thousand times ten thousand times before we really start to see oh yeah

283
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:49,200
this movement of letting go is where the freedom is so in our regular ordinary life we often

284
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,640
don't see these subtle movements of constriction and and selfing because so

285
00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,480
much of society really supports us to have a strong sense of self and

286
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,919
us versus them right there's so much of that out there but that's not the way towards

287
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:11,200
greater freedom and less dukkha was that helpful

288
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,880
yes bill

289
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,440
the longer i'm in buddhism

290
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:36,880
the more i start to get the feeling that even the slightest

291
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:44,000
little um pursing of the lips or knitting of the eyebrow

292
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:49,760
or maybe you know or clenching of the jaw just the slightest little facial movements

293
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:55,600
or maybe leaning forwards or leaning backwards in social situations

294
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:01,840
um have these or can have these subtle

295
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,600
effects or consequences that you mentioned

296
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:12,240
and so

297
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,960
and uh so i i think that's i think that's a good thing uh

298
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,799
to notice and to um try to

299
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:31,200
come back to just like mountain pose as we go through life or especially in social situations and

300
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:39,039
be relaxed i find when i'm in front of someone who is really relaxed around me

301
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,320
something in me just relaxes too so um

302
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:51,279
so i'm trying to pay attention to these subtle little things i do um uh what do you think is that sound good

303
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,720
i think that's fantastic bill and you're highlighting also kind of like the link between the body and the mind you know

304
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,399
of course but so often we're not we don't really know what's

305
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,600
going on there might be some tension but we don't know it until we notice something happening with our mind

306
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:13,519
i know for me this was a big impact years ago i found myself standing there with my hand on my hip like this

307
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:19,679
and i realized like oh i guess i'm feeling indictment you know i didn't even know i was right and

308
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,120
you know or tapping my foot you know this like feeling impatient or something like this but

309
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,799
absolutely and right we wouldn't maybe even notice this unless we really know what it's like to be

310
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:35,919
calm and settled then these little ways in which agitation gets expressed

311
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:43,120
really gets uh highlighted yeah thank you bill uh just just to add

312
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:50,159
it's it's been helpful for me to realize that people's antennae are very

313
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,279
sensitive they pick up all this stuff they may not fully

314
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:01,360
be aware that they're picking it up but maybe it's just part of evolutionary

315
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:07,840
biology but but i think we we do notice almost everything that goes on between

316
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:13,679
people yeah thank you i i would agree yeah we communicate so much right by our

317
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:20,440
body language in subtle ways yeah yeah thank you

318
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:26,520
anybody else ever have a comment

319
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:43,440
thank you for your talk uh one of the things that caught my attention i think one of the areas

320
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,599
that i struggle with the most is when you were talking about taking responsibility

321
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,040
because sometimes i think i rarely

322
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,079
consciously take on responsibility it see it always seems and maybe this is

323
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:06,800
wrong that the responsibility is laid on me from the outside

324
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,560
and so um i don't know if you've ever had that

325
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:18,800
experience but i was wondering how how do we work with

326
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,920
the dukkha that arises in not meeting

327
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,839
responsibility the duka that arises with not meeting

328
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:38,800
our responsibility yes or the i don't know if it's dukkha or just the

329
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:45,838
you know kind of seeing the con the consequences that come from not meeting responsibility

330
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,280
so but those are the consequences of so you're asking how to deal with the consequences of not taking consequence

331
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,400
or not taking responsibility and how would that be different than any

332
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,279
other consequence

333
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:10,560
maybe i'm not understanding the question yeah well i probably don't understand the

334
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,000
question either excellent that's great we'll find our way

335
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,079
otherwise it would probably be clearer to me but for example at work i you know i've

336
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:28,160
been assigned certain tasks to do and i just find

337
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:34,400
a resistance or you know it's just it's almost like i know yes that's my

338
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,160
responsibility and i'm pretty sure i'm not going to meet it

339
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:47,280
you know and so maybe that's the census i don't know if it's just the sense of self like i want to think of myself as a responsible

340
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:54,960
person so there may be some selfing involved in it some of it may be sloth and torpor that

341
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,359
i just don't have the energy to do it some of it is just there's some like

342
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:08,880
internal resistance of you know you know some sort of passive resistance

343
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:16,640
of being told what to do yeah so that that's that's kind of where i'm

344
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,920
it's the fuzzy edge of practice for me yeah i think that microphone maybe went

345
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,160
out

346
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:41,920
so what happened what would it look like if you were to do what i'm just suggesting here to look

347
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,200
at the different conditions that are coming together what are the

348
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:53,280
conditions inside of you in the present moment when you receive that email or your boss tells you you

349
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,359
have to do x y and z and you there's resistance what's that present moment experience and you maybe there's

350
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:04,800
times in which you get some responsibilities and you're okay with it and this time you're not or maybe you're

351
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,480
always not okay and what are some of the um

352
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,160
outer ones maybe it's the way you get asked or or you know something like this

353
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:22,400
and then there's the past also past inner ones like well i have this experience every time i do this it

354
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:29,040
doesn't it does it doesn't turn out in a way that makes me happy or something like this i'm making these up jim you

355
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:35,760
you would know for yourself but there's these are a way in which we can unpack it and

356
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:42,400
and so that some of the dukkha flows away and then there's a way in which uh

357
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,480
we can start to see oh yeah i see how i have this habit of showing up in these

358
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,320
situations in a particular way and then maybe we can work with that this one particular habit instead of

359
00:38:54,320 --> 00:39:00,960
something that's a little bit bigger and complicated with lots of these different aspects playing together

360
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,838
does that make sense

361
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,359
thank you jim thank you

362
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:21,440
okay okay so with a deep bow of appreciation really

363
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:27,440
for your practice it's a it's lovely to practice together to

364
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:34,160
share this practice so thank you and if i don't see you before then i'm

365
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:41,040
wishing you all a happy new year and uh wishing you to take care and stay safe

366
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,839
thank you
