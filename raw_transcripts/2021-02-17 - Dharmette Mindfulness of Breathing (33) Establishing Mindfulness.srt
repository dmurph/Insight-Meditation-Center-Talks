1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,040
so

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,080
for those of you who came to the

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,880
meditation just now

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,519
thank you for those of you who came at

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,280
the 15 minutes earlier and

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,840
had this longer sitting and thank you

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,279
for those of you who might have joined

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:20,880
at the regular time

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,080
or anytime it's always what you're

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,119
welcome to come

11
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,560
and what's wonderful about

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,760
this electronic medium for meditation

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,440
together is that

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,320
it's uh everyone enters the meditation

15
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:36,960
room and

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,160
in a sense quietly

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,840
so um

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,520
so some of you will find i see that the

19
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,039
idea that

20
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,280
the 15 minutes extra meditation is a lot

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,760
longer

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,120
and certainly if you're used to one

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,760
length of time it takes a while to

24
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,799
kind of get used to the the longer

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,159
period

26
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,240
uh and once after a while it becomes

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,400
normal the longer period it can seem to

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,479
go quite quickly and

29
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,880
and anything shorter feels like we're

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,240
not quite

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,960
you know finished maybe

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,240
so it's well worth doing the stretch

33
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,600
so hopefully this week is is um

34
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,320
nice for you and if it's not nice i hope

35
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,680
that it's educational

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,280
you learn something about yourself that

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:41,840
you wouldn't have learned otherwise

38
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,960
so

39
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,680
you know in the overall series on this

40
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,520
mindfulness of breathing

41
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,200
we're halfway through the 16 steps

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,479
but we're kind of taking this week to

43
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:01,119
kind of review or just kind of begin

44
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,759
over again in a certain way

45
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,280
and beginning over again is not really

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,280
starting over completely

47
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,840
but meditation it's often useful to

48
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,319
think we're always beginning over

49
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,520
that often you know our lives are ups

50
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,640
and downs we've

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
been active in our life and we sit down

52
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,319
to meditate and we don't

53
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,959
sell them we just drop into you know the

54
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,959
depths of where we were before

55
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:31,040
but rather it's always kind of a

56
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,920
beginning over

57
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,560
and now learning how to be a beginner

58
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,080
learning how to engage in it

59
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,360
in a in a way that is harmonious with

60
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,440
meditation or

61
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,040
supports the enjoyable settling in

62
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,160
is part of this art and not to be in a

63
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:50,720
hurry

64
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,440
not to be striving but to be diligent

65
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,519
and to be you know wholehearted

66
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,840
and showing up in a way that ah this is

67
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,480
really good to be here

68
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,840
and in the instructions the buddha gives

69
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,040
the preparation for

70
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,400
the first step is the is the

71
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,200
instruction to establish mindfulness

72
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,280
and this idea of establishing awareness

73
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,640
i i like the expression awareness

74
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,280
establishing attention here

75
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,440
i've asked a number of people how they

76
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,280
understand this idea of establishing

77
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,799
awareness

78
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,159
and many people respond that it for them

79
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:36,879
it means

80
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,959
to allow for it to enable it

81
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,200
awareness or attention is a kind of a

82
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,560
capacity that

83
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,640
in all our conscious moments is

84
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,080
operating

85
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,360
and to establish it is to open up more

86
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,239
fully to what's already here

87
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,840
and and maybe to center oneself in that

88
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,040
awareness to be rooted in here

89
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,879
some scholars have said that the pali

90
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,640
word for establish

91
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,879
could also mean to stand next to or

92
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,120
stand close to

93
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,959
it's to to really accompany something

94
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,239
and now this idea of having awareness uh

95
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,720
established like it's like it's really

96
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,759
rooted here in the present moment

97
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,280
and to do that a fair amount of what we

98
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,199
have to do is to let go

99
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,199
we have to let go of the ways that

100
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,479
thinking

101
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,520
preoccupier so much that we don't even

102
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,479
know we're aware

103
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,479
we get pulled into its drama as its

104
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,720
stories its concerns

105
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,080
and there's something about letting go

106
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,639
enough

107
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,520
of the storylines the thoughts the ideas

108
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,360
the preoccupations

109
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,800
so that we're clearly cognizant that i'm

110
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,520
here in the present moment

111
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,199
and something as simple as uh i'm here

112
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,479
in this body i'm here in this place

113
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,759
begins to establish

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,080
and um and so the question is uh you

115
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,919
know more fully for you

116
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,240
what does it mean for you to establish

117
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,919
yourself here

118
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,120
in awareness and attention and how do

119
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,039
you do that establishment

120
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,000
that that you're finding a place that's

121
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,360
wholesome

122
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,840
finding a place that's a healthy or

123
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,960
helpful or even

124
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,160
healing a way of being really being here

125
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,960
in the midst of what's going on it might

126
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,560
be that there's a lot of emotional

127
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,520
turmoil or difficulty in physical pain

128
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,240
there might be challenges that go on

129
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,919
there might be challenges around you in

130
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,360
the environment

131
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,919
but if it's appropriate to be meditating

132
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,800
what does it mean to establish yourself

133
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,160
peacefully or another way of saying

134
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,280
which i like quite a bit for myself is

135
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,039
the idea of

136
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,000
becoming sitting and practicing without

137
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,680
being in conflict with anything

138
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,800
and what does it mean to sit here uh

139
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,160
without conflict and so then you know

140
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,080
we're kind of looking around and seeing

141
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,919
where is their conflict

142
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,880
where am i caught up in responsibilities

143
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,319
or desires or

144
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,520
resentments and what are these

145
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,919
and not necessarily to make them go away

146
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,919
or to let go of them if it's not easy to

147
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:28,960
do so

148
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,960
but what is it like to be sitting in the

149
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,360
middle of it

150
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,560
established and uh

151
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,360
so this image of sitting in the middle

152
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,039
and just being present for the

153
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,479
experience

154
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,800
i think i've said this recently my son

155
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,360
when he was

156
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,880
he went into kindergarten and he was

157
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,560
kind of young for

158
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
kind of in the younger end of i forget

159
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,080
exactly what he was but i think he was

160
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,400
still four or something

161
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,680
and four and a half maybe and

162
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,440
and he went to kindergarten and and uh

163
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,759
the first month or two he would find a

164
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,599
small little kids chair

165
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,000
and place it right in the middle where

166
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,440
all the kids were playing in the

167
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,880
classroom

168
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,120
and he would just sit there and watch

169
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,800
everything that was going on

170
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,160
and it was only after a couple of months

171
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,919
that he left his chair and started

172
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,880
interacting and playing with the kids

173
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,199
and

174
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,599
no one ever felt that he was troubled or

175
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,759
upset or afraid

176
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,599
he was just that's what he did he just

177
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,120
sat right there

178
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,880
confidently in the middle and just took

179
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,240
it all in and this whole new environment

180
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,280
and so he established himself in the

181
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,000
room of

182
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,919
you know probably chaos kids

183
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,280
kindergarten kids playing and running

184
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,960
around

185
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,000
and so

186
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,400
to establish oneself to root oneself

187
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,120
here to i know some teachers who have

188
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,160
emphasized

189
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,400
that simply no having your two feet

190
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,520
rooted

191
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,240
you know firmly on the ground or in the

192
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,520
cushion meditating

193
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,479
your butt firmly on the seat that's you

194
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:10,800
know

195
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
that's really where the heart of it is

196
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,360
really here established here

197
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,720
i had one one teacher who

198
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,120
gave this wonderful teaching and he said

199
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,720
that a successful period of meditation

200
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,000
sometimes sometimes because it can be so

201
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,440
wild and

202
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,560
so maybe agitating or

203
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,200
what's going on within as we meditate

204
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,399
that a definition of a successful

205
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,200
period of meditation is that we did not

206
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,518
leave

207
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,800
our seat and he said sometimes like the

208
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,800
rodeo but you stay in your seat

209
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,080
stay on the saddle and

210
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,000
and the reason he called it a success is

211
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,519
that

212
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,519
we don't give into it we don't give up

213
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,279
because of it

214
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,040
and sometimes just simply hanging in

215
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,560
there and staying

216
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,320
it doesn't look like it's a wonderful

217
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,920
meditative experience

218
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,160
but it takes a we're cultivating a lot

219
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,959
of strength

220
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,000
a lot of stability and the ability to to

221
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,279
keep our seat

222
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,760
to hold our ground here i'm staying here

223
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,360
and and so

224
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,160
what's the nature of how we establish

225
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,480
awareness what's the nature of the way

226
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,640
that we practice awareness practice

227
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,839
attention

228
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,360
and this took me a long time to

229
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,200
understand for myself

230
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,000
because i had a lot of agendas sometimes

231
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,360
when i was practicing like

232
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,880
sometimes i had the agenda to get

233
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,120
concentrated and i was pushing and

234
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,080
straining

235
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,480
and trying my best and judging myself

236
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,279
and

237
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,279
and comparing myself to the when i was

238
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,279
meditating in a room with other people

239
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,120
kind of part of me was comparing myself

240
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,440
with others those you know and

241
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,640
trying to catch up or be as concentrated

242
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,920
as them or

243
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,720
be as mindful as them or so or as still

244
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,160
as them or something

245
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,959
and all this swirl of comparative mind

246
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,000
swirl of

247
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,519
needing to accomplish something needing

248
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,760
to prove myself

249
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,440
and then there was a the attitudes of

250
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,279
not liking what i saw in myself and

251
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,279
being upset with this and that

252
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,279
that happened and the mindfulness then

253
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,880
had a sting to it

254
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,560
that it wasn't just being mindful of

255
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,560
something but there was little barbs

256
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:20,880
like

257
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,120
i was like poking at myself or

258
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,320
criticizing myself

259
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,560
kind of together with being mindful

260
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,160
and slowly to learn to simplify

261
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,440
and simplify and simplify the awareness

262
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,560
all this extra stuff that we bring along

263
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,560
so much so that some people can would

264
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,440
say that the whole process of meditation

265
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,120
like the whole process of the 16 steps

266
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,800
of anapanasati

267
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,920
is a process of simplifying awareness

268
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,880
so it becomes comes into its pristine

269
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,680
purity

270
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,040
or its pristine simplicity just aware

271
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,480
to see clearly without the seeing

272
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,000
having any filters without the seeing

273
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,040
having any obstructions to it

274
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,160
and just to see just to see

275
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,120
and to trust that that's enough is

276
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,800
supported with the idea

277
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,120
that the actions how we take care of

278
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,000
things that will come later

279
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,959
first we're learning this ability to see

280
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:25,920
in this clear

281
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,440
simple way and that allows us to see

282
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,320
better what can be done and what should

283
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,959
be said or can be said

284
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,480
there's more wisdom that way

285
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,680
so finally this is a quest for

286
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,640
simple awareness tranquil awareness that

287
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,680
is committed and

288
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,760
established just stays here with

289
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,399
experience

290
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,720
maybe it's inspiring for you to remember

291
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,639
the little saying

292
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,959
that if you want wisdom the wisdom of

293
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,120
how to live in this world

294
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,120
become tranquil have your awareness

295
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,240
established in its simplicity

296
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,120
and learn how to be content with that

297
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,040
that's enough

298
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,240
that in them for now just enough to

299
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,360
sit here and be present later

300
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,160
can come the action the response

301
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,240
so establishing awareness

302
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,240
so thank you very much and

303
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,000
let's all of us continue with our

304
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,279
awareness

305
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:39,839
practice thank you
