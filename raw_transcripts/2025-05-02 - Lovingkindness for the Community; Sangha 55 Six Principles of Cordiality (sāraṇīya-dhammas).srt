8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:56,399
importance of community of spiritual friends and not just our receiving of

9
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:05,360
community which is where our mind goes usually but but um how can we be a a

10
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,880
caring kind beneficial member of the community

11
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:18,600
so we've been covering different themes different aspects uh this week and

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,320
um and today I wanted to uh speak about

13
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,280
the um the six principles of

14
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:39,560
cordiality and um the Buddha talks about these six principles and and yes the

15
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,360
um Buddhism has a lot of lists the Buddha loved a lot of uh lists i love

16
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,560
lists i hope you love them too and um this particular list of six principles

17
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,840
of cordiality are from Angutan Nikica 612

18
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:05,600
the the S ra the

19
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,840
Siauta and a difference between the the teaching today that

20
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,879
these are the the six principles and I'll mention them very briefly and then

21
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:25,360
I'll guide a meditation uh aligned with them is the way we think the way we hold

22
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,360
others in our hearts and minds minds so the three of the six aspects have to do

23
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,680
with loving kindness actions of the body actions of speech actions of thought how

24
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,959
do we think about others do we think of them with kindness and

25
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:49,680
um and the uh the other ones also have to

26
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:57,920
do with sharing virtue sharing views uh li uh this this living ethically whereas

27
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,200
what we covered yesterday just to bring a distinction was the four principles of

28
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,400
embracing the four grounds of embracing others so there were more um

29
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:15,720
actionoriented yesterday we talked about generosity Donna we talked about kind

30
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:22,640
speech and uh uh service acts of service

31
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,280
as well as uh embracing others with equality with openness of heart with

32
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:37,120
with um seeing them on the same level as as I so so nuances in the teachings and

33
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,920
maybe I'll expand it further so so without further ado the guided

34
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,959
meditation today as we settle um after we settle in the body of course

35
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,000
mindfulness of the body mindfulness of the breath first and then inviting some

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,080
of these principles of how do we hold in our hearts ourselves others these uh

37
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:09,560
these principles ways of being in community ways of being in

38
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:15,320
community practicing ways of being in community so so with

39
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,720
that let's um let's sit

40
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,160

119
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:15,720
goodwill not condoning the harm but seeing allowing their

120
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,720

122
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,880
perhaps with some relationships where there's been strain for a long time

123
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:02,679
unresolved it's time to move on and share goodwill

124
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,919
move on from holding on grasping to the

125
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,919
hurt not being so loyal to our

126
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:46,519
suffering moving on to possibility

127
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,440
and we allow and invite our heart to grow to

128
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:09,919

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:56,799
invites us to be in our hearts and minds the way we share of ourselves and our

166
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:02,480
mind space and heart space and again it's a little bit different from the

167
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,480
teachings that I shared yesterday and uh the teachings yesterday as I mentioned

168
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,839
earlier um where uh basically what they

169
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:22,560
the um they are referred to as the sana vatuni the four saha vatuni

170
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:28,560
And those four principles those are known as the four means of embracing

171
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,919
others the four ways and they're more actionoriented if you remember the list

172
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:41,040
yesterday again Buddha loves lists um the on the list yesterday was um donna

173
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:48,480
generosity acts of giving sharing of resources and goodwill there was kind and affectionate

174
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,960
speech uh pavaja uh there was beneficial action or service for the sake of others

175
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:05,560
atacharia this um beautiful term atachara beneficial action and sama

176
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:14,160
sama I'll say it again sama sama tata

177
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:20,460
sama how many t's wait hold on I lost track of my t's sama

178
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:26,000
[Music] samaata samaata there we go samaata

179
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,240
which means impartiality equality which basically is this beautiful idea of of

180
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:38,560
embracing others as equals not with pride not looking down on others that's

181
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:46,320
the way to embrace others so these ways of embracing others again with generosity with with kind speech with

182
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:54,200
service and with equality this open heart um being equitable humble fair

183
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:01,359
open so those four principles of of embracing others beautiful teaching now

184
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:10,240
today these another way of seeing this and the Buddha's teaching the the six um ways of

185
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,000
the six uh qualities the six principles of cordiality and as we I talk about

186
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,119
them and and the six are maybe I'll just mention what the six are first so the

187
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:28,160
six the first three of the six are loving kindness in bodily action meta

188
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:35,119
kayakama so meta in bodily action pra uh practicing acts of kindness towards

189
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:41,520
others helping protecting nonharming service the second is kindness in a

190
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,880
verbal action loving kindness and verbal action in poly meta

191
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:53,400
viama meta I'll say that

192
00:36:53,400 --> 00:37:00,640
again meta so kindness in words uh speaking

193
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:07,640
kindly encouragingly honestly gently avoid avoiding harsh and divisive

194
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:13,440
speech and the third principle of the six is loving kindness in mental action

195
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,640
i love this one in particular the teaching on this one in particular

196
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:25,280
this is about uh thinking of others with kindness so

197
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,839
meta kama so silently thinking thoughts of

198
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:36,320
goodwill about others wishing them well in your heart even if there is no

199
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:42,800
outward expression of words or actions but but thinking about them in in kind

200
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:50,880
ways giving them the benefit of the doubt i especially love this one is really the way we silently in in our

201
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:58,839
thinking even when we don't see them how we regard them what we think of them do we regard others with

202
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:08,480
kindness so the first three of the six principles again have to do with loving kindness in action in speech and in uh

203
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,480
thoughts and so you see that loving kindness really meta goodwill has is is

204
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,079
six is 50% of these six principles right one two three have to do with different

205
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:26,079
aspects of meta and I love that the Buddha has unpacked it it's not just oh

206
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:34,320
go do meta now just go do it in your in your thoughts it's it's there is this nuance of oh do it in in your actions do

207
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,519
it in your speech do it in your thoughts silently

208
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:47,440
Um again putting so much emphasis on goodwill and then the fourth here the

209
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:55,079
fourth principle here is um is sharing of material possessions sharing material

210
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:02,240
gains uh sa da ran boi

211
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:11,480
s I'll do it again maybe I'll put also these polies in the chat afterwards sa

212
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:18,520
sabogi sa this one is a tough one for me uh sa

213
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:24,960
dan boi which means sharing of uh sharing

214
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:32,160
with our reservations but it always good to have a sense of humor of course about uh about oneself and and the the the

215
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:39,760
beautiful poly language with all the dietitics so um so the sharing this

216
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,640
sharing of of uh one's resources um it

217
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:51,079
it brings it creates a culture of a

218
00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:57,040
generosity trust non-possessiveness and non- jealousy so

219
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:04,400
so especially in uh in the Buddhist communities when uh monastics for

220
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,400
example uh monastics live together the invitation or the teaching here is for

221
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,720
them to be sharing of all sharing alms foods with one another so often only one

222
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:23,440
one monk goes to the village and gets alms food and brings it back and shares it with everybody else to share medicine

223
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:29,160
to share ropes to share all the resources that they have which is very

224
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:36,680
little the fifth one of the principles is sharing ethical conduct

225
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:46,280
sila sa mana this one is easier to say sila the word for ethical conduct sila

226
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:56,400
sa sila sila sa which is sharing our ethics sharing

227
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,839
our ethics with one another living ethically with one another the five

228
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:07,119
precepts the five ethical trainings to live according to to them with one

229
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:13,040
another which again ensures a mutual trust and stable foundation for deeper

230
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:18,319
practice because when we trust that this other person is not going to lie to us

231
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:24,400
or or steal or take or harm us this just automatically creates a sense of trust

232
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:31,530
in the community so sila sa mana sila sa

233
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:40,240
[Music] mana and the sixth and the last one in the series is um is sharing of right

234
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:48,000
view which is di sa di sa di is wise

235
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,680
view right view sana is to share it with others

236
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:59,040
so here is about um sharing this view be

237
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:06,000
in this community having speaking from living from sharing the the perspective

238
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:13,680
uh that is uh that that one that upholds wisdom and wisdom and compassion and the

239
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:23,040
various principles wise view the four noble truths the eight-fold path it's basically this view of uh of as if we

240
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:30,000
had um we had the wi uh awakened perspective as if we had the awakened

241
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:38,560
perspective in the way of you know fake it till you become it so so living from that place treating ourselves living um

242
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:49,200
and exuding this this sense of um this vision of a bigger a bigger sense of of

243
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:56,400
possibility um of ourselves and each other and community so living sharing that view

244
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:03,480
with one another not living from this smallminded place but but sharing

245
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:10,000
um living from this this higher this this more expansive place of our hearts

246
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:17,119
uh with with one another and again when I say community there's so many different shapes uh and forms to a

247
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:24,800
community there could be community of two your spiritual friendships could be the community of hundreds here on online

248
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:33,079
etc so many different ways to really consider the teachings on community

249
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:40,160
so so um and and these teachings really allow for a nonvisible

250
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:47,680
uh field of safety and trust in in the way that we interact with each other and

251
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:55,040
with ourselves and we hold ourselves and there's so much more dignity also the sense of dignity that arises for us as

252
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:03,119
we um live in this way so so I want to leave you with some reflections as um I

253
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:10,560
have every day of this week so um here are the reflections for today uh which

254
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:17,359
of these six principles are most alive for me today um in this moment that I

255
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:24,079
want to really take on and and feel into today um and how can I more fully

256
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:30,400
support the harmony of my SA through conscious daily practice of of these

257
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,960
principles of these six principles and I and here's a third I I'm particularly

258
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,319
fond of this reflection I'm about to give you um what might change if I

259
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:48,160
silently if I silently held others with goodwill throughout the day what might

260
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:53,800
change if I silently held others in goodwill throughout the

261
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:59,560
day and maybe I'll leave it at that i think that's enough those three

262
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:07,920
reflections and I want to thank you all actually um and I want to thank IMC for
