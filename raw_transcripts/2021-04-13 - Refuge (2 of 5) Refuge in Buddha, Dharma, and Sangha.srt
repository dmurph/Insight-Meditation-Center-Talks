1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,440
so maybe we just sit quietly

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,120
for we have about 10 minutes or so and

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,880
we'll just sit and meditate and then

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,120
we'll

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,920
continue as usual

6
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,279
so then as we come to the end of this

7
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,839
sitting

8
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,600
the idea of refuge

9
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,839
is incomparable to the idea of saying

10
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,519
yes

11
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,160
to a way of being

12
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,839
that's not caught in

13
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,800
anxiety or caught in

14
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,320
distractions or desires or what if or it

15
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,440
should be different

16
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,959
or caught in

17
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:37,680
aversion or

18
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,040
ill will or disappointment or

19
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,839
discouragement

20
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,279
a way of being a yes to a big yes to a

21
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,360
way of being

22
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,320
it is not taking us away from ourselves

23
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,560
but a yes to the possibility of

24
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,240
being really here without agitation

25
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,560
and the confidence in that

26
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,079
makes a huge difference

27
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,560
an antidote to a kind of unconscious

28
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,079
confidence

29
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,200
in agitation and all the way different

30
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,160
forms it takes

31
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,320
and that's a big yes

32
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,519
that can allow us to

33
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,079
give us room in the heart and the mind

34
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,279
to have an unagitated

35
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,800
attention presence connection

36
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,519
with others

37
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,680
to have an unagitated

38
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,399
space to look upon others with

39
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,760
out our agitation being contagious

40
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,680
without our ill will hostility

41
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,440
frustration disappointment

42
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,200
desires expectations

43
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,839
unduly challenging others

44
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,120
instead we can be

45
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,200
someone for whom it's comfortable to be

46
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,680
around

47
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,959
we offer people a refuge

48
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,839
a safety

49
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,160
a peaceful and calm presence perhaps

50
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,600
or maybe just a attention a focus

51
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,279
of safety

52
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,040
and may it be that through this

53
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,160
meditation practice

54
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,120
that we become

55
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,639
a refuge for others

56
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:19,040
may it be that we are able to

57
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,600
breathe and live and walk and speak

58
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,079
in ways that promote the welfare and

59
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,199
happiness of others

60
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,160
may all beings be happy

61
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,800
may all beings be safe

62
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,079
may all beings be peaceful

63
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,839
and may all beings everywhere be free

64
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:05,699
[Music]

65
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,720
so thank you for those of you who have

66
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,680
persisted to keep coming back and coming

67
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,199
back

68
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,199
it's a very like meditation we keep

69
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:53,839
coming back

70
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:56,959
and starting over so we kept

71
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,839
needing to refresh and refresh and come

72
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,399
back

73
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,959
i think the issue was in the end i

74
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:06,560
believe the issue

75
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,360
was uh either with our internet service

76
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,959
provider

77
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:13,519
or with the router to the service

78
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,880
provider

79
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,839
we have two

80
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,440
wi-fi systems here at imc and so i

81
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,959
switched to the one that we usually

82
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:23,680
don't use

83
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,480
that's kind of the backup and the backup

84
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,360
seems to be holding strong

85
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,839
so why what happened i don't know

86
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,639
but i'm glad that it's working now and

87
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,880
um

88
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
so

89
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,959
so continuing on this topic of refuge

90
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,959
the primary kind of

91
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,360
and the most well-known aspect of refuge

92
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,639
in buddhism

93
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,199
is the idea of going for refuge in the

94
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,480
buddha the dharma and the sangha

95
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,480
and the word foregoing

96
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,000
gotcha me and pali literally means to

97
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,880
walk

98
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,279
but to go i think it's just a perfectly

99
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,800
good translation

100
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,920
but i like walking because it implies

101
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,240
that

102
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,000
when we walk we bring all of ourselves

103
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,440
along

104
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,480
and and so this idea of that

105
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,519
going for refuge is to bring all of

106
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,160
ourselves

107
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,480
into the refuge and

108
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,160
and so it's something that's deeply

109
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,920
personal and very

110
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,160
individual and involves a real

111
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,480
commitment a real dedication

112
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,639
to really step forward step into

113
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,480
something

114
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,560
and um and that uh

115
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,440
and so it is um both something personal

116
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,279
the eye

117
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,839
there's something that uh involving a

118
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,639
certain intentionality or commitment or

119
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,160
sense of purpose uh going

120
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,519
and then going to the buddha the dharma

121
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,079
and the sangha

122
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,720
and and it's i think it's useful to

123
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,759
consider

124
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,320
that there's two versions of buddha

125
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,000
dharma in the sangha

126
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,880
there's the external ones and the

127
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,639
internal ones

128
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,920
and external are what most people think

129
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
about it's a literal meaning of these

130
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,560
words buddha dharma sangha and the

131
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,600
internal

132
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,720
has to do with how we find uh

133
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,639
the reference point for those or

134
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,160
recognize these

135
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,519
somehow in ourselves and

136
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,040
so the external buddha is

137
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,839
is the historical buddha who functions

138
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:52,639
uh

139
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,000
probably one of the most important

140
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,240
functions of the buddha

141
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,240
for practitioners is he's an exemplar

142
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,600
he's an example of what's possible that

143
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,000
it's possible to become free it's

144
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,438
possible to

145
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,199
really to uh shed

146
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,319
thoroughly completely fully uh

147
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,079
all the different forces of agitation

148
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,360
of attachments of fear

149
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,798
of hostility ill will

150
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,640
that lives within us and

151
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,440
and so the buddha represents that he's

152
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,919
an exemplar of that

153
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,880
and and that's inspiring because unless

154
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
we have exemplars of what

155
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,679
this dharma is about then we have no

156
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,840
proof it's possible

157
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,960
and i think of a little bit like the uh

158
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,600
in the 1950s when there was the first

159
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,480
person who broke the four minute mile

160
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,280
running and it was said bef that that

161
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,360
can't be done it wasn't humanly possible

162
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,400
to

163
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,559
run uh a mile faster than four minutes

164
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,640
but once someone broke that barrier that

165
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,000
line then

166
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,679
many other people followed and so

167
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,160
um uh so once the buddha

168
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,320
you know showed it was possible attained

169
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,679
what's possible

170
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,559
many people have followed his example

171
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,960
and have attained the same degree

172
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,480
of liberation as he has

173
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,880
the and so to have him as an example and

174
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,960
be inspired by that be guided by that

175
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,360
and

176
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,000
you know have sense oh it is possible

177
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,320
and it doesn't that doesn't involve the

178
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,360
blind faith or allegiance to the buddha

179
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,280
the buddha then becomes a mirror for

180
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,400
ourselves

181
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,160
to engage in the practice this is

182
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,640
possible for me as well

183
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,320
the external dharma is his teachings

184
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,240
his the truths the practices the

185
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,760
the what flowed out of him

186
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,200
uh as a way of pointing us

187
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,640
to our own potential and they're a

188
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,080
remarkable set of teachings the

189
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,919
teachings of the buddha

190
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,280
and i still find them there's a vast uh

191
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,640
corpus of text that uh claimed to

192
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,760
represent the records of his teachings

193
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,440
it's a fascinating body of text it's a

194
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,280
little bit hard to get into

195
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,360
but it's so multi-dimensional and so

196
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,640
rich and it's kind of care in which it

197
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,520
really

198
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,679
addresses the issues of practice and

199
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,559
philosophy

200
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,919
or views and self

201
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,080
and all these things that we really want

202
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,240
to kind of shine light on

203
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,039
to really understand and find our own

204
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,720
freedom

205
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,960
a lot of what he has to teach is meant

206
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,080
to be practically

207
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,960
applicable in fact one time in one place

208
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,000
it says that

209
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,160
when someone teaches a dharma it should

210
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,880
be practical

211
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,679
and and then the dharma the sangha

212
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,000
are the community of witnesses those who

213
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,280
have witnessed

214
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,080
what he teaches who've attained a

215
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,559
similar

216
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,360
you know the similar form of liberation

217
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,880
as the buddha

218
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,320
and and to know that there are these

219
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,679
people who

220
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,360
not just not the buddha's not the only

221
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,440
example there's lots of examples down

222
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,000
through

223
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,880
time and even in our our our time

224
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,480
there's many many people who really

225
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,240
tasted some of the fruit

226
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,520
of what the buddha was pointing to

227
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,640
and and

228
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,559
they're there to guide us and support us

229
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,840
and to teach us

230
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,559
in our own idiom in our own cultural

231
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,320
form

232
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,559
maybe adapting the teachings according

233
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,159
to what's appropriate in different

234
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,520
environments and

235
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,840
different countries and different you

236
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,880
know cultures

237
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,480
and um so um

238
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,000
that's the external the internal

239
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,280
buddha is uh to re is when we see in

240
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,480
ourselves

241
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,400
the qualities of freedom inner freedom

242
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,360
and the qualities of compassion or care

243
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,559
or love

244
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,840
that that the buddha had

245
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,200
and dharma is to

246
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,159
recognize that some of the values and

247
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,919
some of the practices

248
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,039
that come that come out of that freedom

249
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,880
or to lead to that freedom

250
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,159
also is found in us one of the primary

251
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,400
characteristics of the dharma

252
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,080
is non-harming and so

253
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,280
to recognize in ourselves that there is

254
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,960
a force there is a

255
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,559
reference point for really not wanting

256
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,200
to harm

257
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,240
any living being at all a reference

258
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,240
point of feeling a sense

259
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,000
that where there's integrity where

260
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,440
there's wholeness

261
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,760
is not to lie uh not to harm

262
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,400
and not to steal the

263
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,320
not because it's the ethical thing to do

264
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,080
in the sense of abstract ethics or

265
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,200
morality

266
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,080
but because um it something lives in us

267
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,559
that feeling a sense of integrity

268
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,080
that's the dharma that's living in us

269
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,400
and there's a the dharma that's internal

270
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,760
is the dharma that

271
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,120
uh of practicing of saying yes and

272
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,600
bringing mindfulness and showing up and

273
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,440
being settled and

274
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,440
keep coming back to these qualities of

275
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,559
practice

276
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,000
that begin feeling like this is

277
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,159
this is a valuable and important way of

278
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,360
being

279
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,760
this is where home is this is where

280
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,520
to not be here it feels a loss

281
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,520
feels like a a um a diminishment of my

282
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,600
life to be caught in agitation

283
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,480
caught in desires and expectations and

284
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,960
frustrations and disappointments and

285
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,400
resentments and envy and jealousy and

286
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:15,280
um you know uh acquisition

287
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,440
well i wanted to acquire um

288
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,520
just you can feel how we come out of

289
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,120
harmony or we kind of

290
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,120
a little bit uh out of kilter when we

291
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,880
end up in these kinds of unless

292
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,240
unnecessary

293
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,280
and agitated states and

294
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,360
and to begin to really recognize these

295
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,200
settle state wholesome states

296
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,960
nourishing states peaceful states within

297
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,000
is to recognize the dharma and to

298
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,919
recognize the sangha

299
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,039
is to recognize that the inner sangha is

300
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,720
to recognize

301
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,360
how we in our personal way live in

302
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,600
relationship to other people

303
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,159
that we live in relationship to others

304
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:58,799
who

305
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:00,720
not necessarily are buddhists but

306
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,840
certainly buddhists are included

307
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,640
who share some of these values who

308
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,960
resonate with us with those values

309
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,000
who guide us or support us or encourage

310
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,480
us to live by these values by this

311
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,960
attention this unagitated place of peace

312
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,240
and wholeness that

313
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
the dharm liberation the dharma points

314
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,840
to

315
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,360
and then we live in a relationship to

316
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,240
that to others and in that relationship

317
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,600
then there are certain relational

318
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,320
motivations qualities that they're part

319
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,799
of this refuge and sangha

320
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,000
generosity friendliness good will

321
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,520
compassion honesty that have to do with

322
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:41,840
our

323
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,400
relationship with each other that's to

324
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,840
take refuge in the inner sangha

325
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,120
and and both external

326
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,039
and inner and the inner sangha are

327
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,159
valuable and some people orient one to

328
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,039
one more than

329
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,559
no the other at different times

330
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,080
and but ultimately the

331
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,120
idea is to have something within

332
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,080
that we recognize oh that's what the

333
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,279
buddha is

334
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,279
not that we have all the full qualities

335
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,120
of a buddha for sure

336
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,120
but some things all this is what the

337
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,799
buddha was talking about

338
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,440
this is what the dharma is this is where

339
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,200
where you know the sangha is found or

340
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,480
awakened or connected to

341
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,840
and uh and so we're talking about an

342
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,400
inner transformation that happens in

343
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,520
practice

344
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,880
and at some point as people practice

345
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,320
there's a recognition that

346
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,400
of a way of being that is valuable

347
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,520
a way of being that is more valuable

348
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,159
than almost anything else and for some

349
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,679
people they'd say it's the most

350
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,559
important thing for them not as i said

351
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,080
yesterday because other things that are

352
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:02,640
important

353
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,840
have become less important but rather

354
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,400
let the people in our lives there's some

355
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,120
of that

356
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,880
purposes we have that we live our lives

357
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,880
form some things can be

358
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,720
remain just as important as they always

359
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,000
have been

360
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,559
but maybe sometimes the dharma the

361
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:19,919
practice

362
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,520
the refuges become the most important

363
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,520
because they're the very thing that

364
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,799
feeds into a healthy way of really

365
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,720
beneficial way of relating to all the

366
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,039
other things that are important as well

367
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,760
it's like the common denominator or the

368
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,840
source from which

369
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,120
flows out a way of being that

370
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,919
really brings benefit to what we love

371
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,840
and people we love and

372
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,880
what's important for us

373
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,440
so to take refuge in the buddha the

374
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,919
dharma the sangha

375
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,960
it's not a passive thing it involves

376
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,440
understanding knowing something for

377
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,880
oneself

378
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,600
and so with practice deepens to learn to

379
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,840
appreciate what we're getting to know

380
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,600
and then what we're knowing and

381
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,039
recognizing

382
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,720
to let that live as a kind of big yes

383
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,679
this is important this is inspiring

384
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,240
um and it's an orientation it's like

385
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,559
this is the direction i want to go

386
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,120
it's an intentionality and orientation

387
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,039
the refugees are kind of a guide

388
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,640
oh yes this is the way and um

389
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,399
and they're an inspiration there's

390
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,200
something that's can be very heartfelt

391
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,080
and for some people it's quite emotional

392
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,520
that's a very deep emotional connection

393
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,760
so it's something intellectual something

394
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,600
intentional and something emotional

395
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,000
it's very rich this going for refuge

396
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,240
so

397
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,039
finally i like to say that

398
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,320
in some places in buddhism the maybe

399
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,200
some of our own

400
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,240
buddhist circles that what gets

401
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,360
emphasized a lot

402
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,399
is the goals of liberation and freedom

403
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,159
awakening

404
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,240
and and certainly that's important

405
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,158
but for many people

406
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,320
comparably of comparable importance a

407
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,279
comp

408
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,640
comparable magnitude of impact and

409
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,399
transformation and and a real kind of

410
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,520
turning point in a life that's you know

411
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,960
as valuable almost as liberation itself

412
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,880
is when there were really clearly

413
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,480
a change inside that is represented by

414
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,679
refuge it's a big kind of yes this

415
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,200
is what my what i what i'm dedicated to

416
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
this is important this is where my faith

417
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,240
is

418
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,480
and so this refuge is a very can be for

419
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,960
some a very important turning

420
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,320
decision turning point

421
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,440
that though this is important

422
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,440
and it said that when that happens for

423
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,559
people

424
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,799
that it gives their life a sense of

425
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,640
purpose meaning

426
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,120
it gives a certain order or

427
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,320
understanding for

428
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,440
all of our how we live our lives so it's

429
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,000
it's

430
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,360
and with that it can give a lot of peace

431
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,360
and reassurance

432
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,679
that that

433
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,520
we found a way to be in this difficult

434
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,600
world

435
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:48,559
so thank you all very much and

436
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:55,840
we'll continue on this topic tomorrow
