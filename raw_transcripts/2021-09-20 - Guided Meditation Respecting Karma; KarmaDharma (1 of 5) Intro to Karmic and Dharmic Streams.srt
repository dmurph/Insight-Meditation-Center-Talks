00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:12,000
okay thank you for the messages about no sound

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,520
so now i think it works so hello everyone and

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,039
welcome to our monday uh beginning of the week and also

4
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,640
i'm happy to be back here i was away teaching

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:38,000
a retreat in a way teaching retreat from this very spot online and the retreat continues this week and

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,800
but i'm very happy to be here and and

7
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,440
so um

8
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:58,399
when we sit and get quiet sit or try to be quiet in meditation sit and be still

9
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:05,680
one of the things that sooner or later becomes very clear is that we carry with us the momentum

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,280
of our life the momentum of our thinking our concerns

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,400
our preoccupations our desires our aversions we carry with us the momentum of the

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:26,159
different life experiences which have influenced us the life experience of things we've done

13
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:34,479
in our lives and still resonates or still kind of lives somehow with us

14
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:42,000
one teacher once said that when was asked you know what do you do when you meditate and she said

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,759
we confront our unresolved issues so that's certainly much more than we do

16
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,079
than that but sometimes that's one of the things that arises and although that whole package of

17
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:02,079
things that we come into touch with our momentum of our life is sometimes summarized in buddhism

18
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:09,119
under a simple maybe simplistic term that it's karma and i'll talk more about that

19
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,959
later but uh whether that's the right label for it all or not

20
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,720
the um the it's nice to kind of gather in a sense

21
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,120
in your mind gather at heart gather it all together all these influence all's momentum that we have that

22
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,400
from a lifetime of habits and concerns and preoccupations and influences we've

23
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,720
had and um and bow to it deeply

24
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,879
to offer our respect to have tremendous respect for this part of our lives

25
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,879
and bowing to it and respecting it and acknowledging it's there

26
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,800
maybe that can allow us to step away far enough to

27
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,120
ease up on our concerns with it preoccupations with it trying to fix it

28
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:10,239
trying to ameliorate it whatever and step away and

29
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:16,840
recognize us there be respectful but to for the time of the meditation

30
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,640
to cease picking it up c is getting pulled into

31
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:27,760
it and keeping it going with thinking and concerning and remembering and planning

32
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,680
and judging and criticizing and all that all those things can go on

33
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,599
but as we meditate we want to give breathing room for ourselves

34
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:47,840
the kind of space that sometimes is not available when we're locked into these things or caught in them

35
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,680
and often meditation we talk about letting go of such things so we can focus on the breathing

36
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:00,400
but it's important to also respect it and maybe in a deep respect it's easier

37
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,080
to let it be and for these moments not to pick it up

38
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,720
and one of the functions of the meditation of breath meditation is to help us

39
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,959
disentangle ourselves from all that influence all the momentum

40
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,240
it still comes through us but you can imagine that you're standing on dry

41
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,280
riverbank looking at the river going by the river is massive you respect the

42
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,720
river but you don't you know get into it

43
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,520
i've been in big powerful rivers with

44
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,520
big rapids and my way of respecting it was not to stand

45
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,199
right on the edge of the river but to be back maybe three feet four feet

46
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,280
so to be able to watch it go by without being involved

47
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,680
so this is one of the functions of breath meditation it takes us to dry ground

48
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,800
helps us to disentangle and maybe it's easier to give yourself over to breathing

49
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:21,520
after you've respected this karmic stream that is part of who we are in a sense

50
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,400
so assuming a posture

51
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,840
that maybe promotes disentangling

52
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,240
promotes us stable confident presence

53
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,240
that's not easily swept away kind of like you're standing strong

54
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,080
with your feet firmly rooted in the ground

55
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,319
so that you don't get pushed over by the wind

56
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,919
so taking a posture that's grounded and firm

57
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,120
and lowering your gaze relaxing your eyes

58
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,360
and perhaps closing your eyes if that's comfortable

59
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:35,840
and to begin this process of disentangling to take a few long slow deep breaths

60
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,840
as you exhale letting whatever

61
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,840
momentum that's here relax and settle away

62
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,400
deep breath in and as you exhale

63
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:10,120
become rooted relaxed stable rooted here in this body

64
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,759
letting your breathing return to normal

65
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,599
and sometimes by continuing to relax the body

66
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,919
it's a way of continuing to ease up

67
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:49,919
on the way that we're concerned about things and involved in thoughts and fantasies

68
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,440
he's up on our emotions that we might have

69
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,879
so as you exhale to relax the belly

70
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,680
maybe maybe even letting the belly become

71
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:16,960
a little heavy to feel the pull of gravity

72
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,720
on the exhale to relax the chest

73
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,839
and then to relax the shoulders

74
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,040
and then to soften the muscles of your face

75
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,800
and then on the exhale maybe on the inhale

76
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,640
feel any tension or pressure in your thinking mind

77
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,360
and as you exhale to soften the thinking mind

78
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,519
relax

79
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,440
and then with respect for this thoughts you have the thinking you have the

80
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:02,120
feelings you have maybe even acknowledging their presence

81
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,639
center your attention on the body breathing

82
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,120
so that this precious resource that you have your attention

83
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:31,040
is no longer involved in your karmic stream

84
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:40,040
that can just go on by itself but your precious attention

85
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,680
is devoted to the experience of the body breathing

86
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,720
as you exhale

87
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,519
giving yourself over to the full exhale

88
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,760
as you inhale receive the

89
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,320
inhale

90
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,320
feeling the rhythm of breathing in and out hanging in there is a way to make lots

91
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,760
of breathing room for all things

92
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:23,720
well you're rooted devoted to the simple experience of breathing

93
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,679
stepping away from our thoughts concerns

94
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
respectfully

95
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:09,520
disentangling and using the attention to breathing

96
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,200
is a way of staying on dry ground

97
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:22,240
so the river of karma can take care of itself without our needing

98
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:29,000
to do anything about it just breathing is enough

99
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,400
um

100
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,200
so

101
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,720
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

102
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,360
if we appreciate and respect our karmic stream

103
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,240
all the influences and experiences and

104
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:39,679
concerns hurts and joys and

105
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,240
ups and downs that somehow still have their life within us

106
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:55,679
we can appreciate maybe the that's that's the case for many other people as well

107
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,240
then all beings all people

108
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,840
the influence of this difficult life streams through them and

109
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,559
their karmic patterns concerns preoccupations

110
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,840
stored in their body mind and heart

111
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:28,799
and to have care and respect and certain kind of reverence for other

112
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:33,760
people for what they carry

113
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,240
their challenges they live with

114
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:47,440
at the end of the sitting to extend our care compassion our kindness

115
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,519
our deep respect for what people

116
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,679
deal with in this human life

117
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:06,399
and to offer our ability to be companions on this journey

118
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:13,799
so people are less alone less forgotten

119
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,799
until you turn our attention outward

120
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:28,480
considering how we can support others

121
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:37,919
in finding a way in this life may it be that through

122
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,519
the goodness of this practice that we do

123
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:53,279
that our attention can go outwards for the welfare and happiness of others

124
00:29:53,279 --> 00:30:00,159
may we contribute support

125
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,559
the possibility of all beings being happy

126
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:14,158
all beings being safe all beings

127
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:21,520
being peaceful and all beings being free

128
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,760
may all beings everywhere be happy

129
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:40,239
[Music]

130
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,159
so

131
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:34,320
so hello and as we begin this series of talks

132
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,960
on this monday that the topic this week

133
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:47,600
is to talk about two streams of our lives

134
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,960
the karmic stream and the dharmic stream

135
00:31:52,960 --> 00:32:01,760
and the dharm extreme for is the buddhist language to talk about uh what unfolds what can develop

136
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:07,200
when we free ourselves from the karmic stream

137
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,120
we free ourselves respectfully respectful of the karmic stream

138
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:21,840
and in particular the way the stream of karma contributes to our ongoing suffering

139
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:29,039
and that's one of the reasons why buddhists focus on karma the karmic stream

140
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,080
because of how much suffering it perpetuates it's kind of like being caught in a

141
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,960
perpetual renewal of suffering pain despair

142
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,559
challenges and but then there's this other whole stream

143
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:53,919
that is not karmic but it can be called dharmic the dharm extreme

144
00:32:53,919 --> 00:33:01,279
so to give a uh and you know language like karma and darmok evoke all kinds of complicated

145
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:08,240
ideas and karma people have a lot of associations already with what it means

146
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,840
and i'll talk about it in a particular way this week and kind of and hopefully in a way to

147
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,200
normalize it as something that we can see operating in the day-to-day

148
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,559
activity of our life putting aside ideas of karma being

149
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:31,840
you know something influencing us over the lifetimes

150
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:38,559
so if a person went through life

151
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:46,399
with their fists clenched that's never opened up

152
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:52,559
that would influence their life in all kinds of ways

153
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:58,960
that would be very different if someone went through their life their life with their hands open

154
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,960
relaxed soft open ready to operate in all kinds of ways and

155
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:12,320
all the kind of ways that fingers can move and hold on and do things

156
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:17,520
and um a person who has a hand that's free to open and be used

157
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,800
their life will unfold very differently the person whose life is always clenched

158
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,158
the fist is always clenched

159
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:36,158
you know it's best not to stretch this analogy too far but just in a simple way

160
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:42,000
and then if someone is similarly

161
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:50,560
if someone is their heart is clenched their heart is closed and it's closed

162
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:58,720
for decades that life unfolds differently than if a heart is open

163
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,880
if the mind is closed in some way constricted narrow

164
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,960
that life unfolds very differently than a person whose mind is

165
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,680
open open-minded so

166
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:23,760
the way that we live day by day in the present moment

167
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,200
can influence how we live in this life

168
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:36,240
if we live a life that is uh with recurring kind of chronic

169
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,839
hostility or aversion that puts together certain conditions

170
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:48,000
that are very different than if we go through our life with generosity and love

171
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:56,160
if we go through our lives with greed and lust and that's the predominant mindstream that we keep flowing in

172
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,079
that life uh opens up or moves ahead or unfolds very differently

173
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:08,560
than someone's life who is generous and kind and and uh thinks about the welfare of

174
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:16,240
others so these very broad kind of strokes are pointing to different directions life

175
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:22,800
can go and it's certainly different directions that ways that we influence ourselves

176
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,160
um we are not um all these ways that we operate

177
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:34,160
consciously or unconsciously has an impact and influence on ourselves

178
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,880
so that if we are chronically aversive that the there's traces there's lingerings

179
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:48,320
there's uh uh feelings there's ongoing impact on ourselves because of that

180
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:56,640
if we're loving this has a very different impact if um we um

181
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:04,560
uh and one of the ways that we can see one of the powerful ways to see the operation of operation of karma

182
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,480
is in our thought streams and probably that's the single most

183
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,480
effective way to understand karma to see its influences and how it operates

184
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,720
day by day kind of in our lives and not to kind of be involved in the more metaphysical ideas of karma

185
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:29,599
but to see that thinking has a big influence on us

186
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,880
and it said that rumination is one of the leading causes of depression

187
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:41,520
if we're ruminating in such a way thinking in such a way that the thoughts are deflating the thoughts are discouraging

188
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:47,520
that thoughts are critical and kind of frightening to listen to or

189
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,839
discouraging to listen to and to have that discouragement and that fear kind of chronically kind of

190
00:37:53,839 --> 00:38:01,040
move through our system and move through our system our whole body and mind and heart will be influenced by the

191
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:07,040
ongoingness of those thoughts and we can feel that the impact it has on us

192
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,040
and it's a and the kind of kind of rebirth the constant renewal

193
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:18,960
into this karmic stream is that as we feel lousy

194
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,720
that's kind of a fuel to continue having these kinds of difficult thoughts these

195
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:31,440
undermining thoughts the undermining thoughts make us feel worse and so it prompts

196
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,480
certain way of thinking and so it's cyclic it kind of gives birth to itself

197
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,480
over and over and over again and sometimes it's so chronic that they become almost

198
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,320
invisible to people it's kind of like the the this if it's true that the fish

199
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:55,200
don't see the water they swim in now we sometimes don't see the water the the mood and the attitude that we swim

200
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,680
in we move through because it's been reinforced and so the ongoing

201
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:08,880
and so sometimes all this karma stuff is described as habits

202
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:16,240
ongoing habits and some of the karmic habits are healthy you can be great habits of love

203
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,720
and generosity and and that creates a very different influence

204
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:29,440
on us ourselves and that provide a very different conditioning influence in our body and mind

205
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:36,400
but there's a stream we enter into and we participate in and and and part of that stream there's momentum

206
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,839
from the past that's continues into the present and then there's ways in which we keep

207
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:48,880
adding to the momentum in the present moment and what dharma practice is trying to do

208
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,920
is trying to free us from continuing to reinforce continuing to

209
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,359
add momentum to the stream to be respectful of how much it's flowing

210
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:05,280
but to step back on dry ground and watch it go by the stream go by

211
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:11,359
without adding to it and as we step back um then it's kind of

212
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:16,560
like when the hand's been closed in a cleansed fish for a

213
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:24,560
clenched fist for a long time and then it's opened uh things begin to happen there's an

214
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,720
unfolding that has an influence on us influence on the hand influence us it's inspiration it gives us ideas of

215
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,760
what we can do and um but um

216
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:42,480
but uh it starts setting emotion a goodness inside of us a movement

217
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,839
towards freedom we get a sense that oh the hand can be released that's nice

218
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:53,599
i bet now my shoulders can relax maybe this clenched stomach has a

219
00:40:53,599 --> 00:41:01,520
possibility of relaxing and um and some there's a path that begins opening up and some of that uh

220
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:07,200
that that path as is the natural unfolding

221
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,480
of what could be called the dharma the dharma stream and it's the dharma stream is that

222
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:18,640
stream of releasing ourselves from our contractions our tightness our holdings

223
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:26,319
and then experiencing the goodness uh the joy the well-being the tranquility that comes flowing

224
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:33,280
from that and leads to deep insights at least a deep understanding to this world

225
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,960
and so uh and every day we have we're in this every moment where

226
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,000
kind of both streams are available and a lot of what people spend their

227
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,839
time with doing is living in the karmic stream and a very easy way to see it i believe

228
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:58,079
is that is to notice what you're thinking as you go about your day

229
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:05,599
and if you are thinking about something which is not in the present moment

230
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:12,000
that's the karmic stream and

231
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,760
and you might if you as you're sitting in that stream thinking about the future the past

232
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:24,160
fantasy anything like that you might take time to see what is that what kind of influence is

233
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:29,359
this kind of thinking having on me is it a beneficial influence is it not a

234
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:34,560
beneficial influence is it neutral what is that influence on it on it

235
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:40,079
and to stop and take that kind of look is to is to uh

236
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,839
beginning to stop also from reinforcing that stream

237
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:51,200
but if we just let our minds kind of flow along happily thinking about

238
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,640
resentments in the past or the desires we want in the future then we're

239
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,960
adding momentum to it keeping it flowing keeping it flowing and some people like that they want to

240
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,480
they justify it and the cost of that of keeping it going

241
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,760
is that we don't allow this other whole stream to unfold

242
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:20,160
the dharm the dharma stream so that's the topic for this week and

243
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:25,680
so this is uh the introduction to it and it's kind of setting the stage and

244
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:32,960
it's uh considered to be a very important topic in buddhism and perhaps not talked about that much

245
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,839
and so we'll try to talk about it this week so thank you and look forward to being here with you

246
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,839
tomorrow
