1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:12,240
welcome to our meditation time together and i'm happy to be here with you

2
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:22,320
one of the aspects of meditation that

3
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,039
is obvious if it's pointed out is that most people when they just

4
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:36,239
decide to meditate do something different with their bodies

5
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:43,040
they bring their bodies to a particular place they place their bodies in a particular posture

6
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:51,440
and um and it's one of the first things we do is this uh bring our body along

7
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,640
and um and if that can easily be overlooked

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,920
but the tremendous value on

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,640
the body's role in meditation and in life in general is one of the

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,159
things that zen and vipassana have in common

11
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:21,680
and in in all my practices of zen and there was this kind of implicit and

12
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,479
at times explicit way in which it involved a growing

13
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:37,040
center of gravity center of life being rooted in the body not in the mind and in vipassana the

14
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,759
same thing one of my teachers in thailand um made an assad at the end of a dharma

15
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:51,520
talk one day the talk had ended and people were leaving and he kind of looked up and said oh and by the way

16
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:59,759
don't do anything that takes you away from your body and and

17
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,360
to go back to teachings of the buddha he stresses over and over again how

18
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:12,480
important mindfulness of the body is now mindfulness of the body that little

19
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:20,319
word of is a little bit ambiguous it can mean for some people that

20
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:28,080
there's a tension attention is directed to the body and therefore it's of the body but another way of

21
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,599
understanding it is that mindfulness of the body is the body's

22
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:41,599
mindfulness that becomes a little bit clearer if we translate the word for mindfulness that's the

23
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:48,640
word sati i don't know if it's really mindfulness is the best translation in english and i often prefer the word

24
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,640
awareness for it and and so we understand that mindfulness

25
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,959
of the body is the body's awareness and we're beginning to center ourselves

26
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:08,480
in the experience the body has of our life the way the body is aware of itself

27
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:16,000
and and this is a wonderful shift out of being mind-centric

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,440
where we're or thinking centric which is where many people live their lives

29
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,920
and to shift and have the the center of our lives not our thoughts these thoughts have still very important

30
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,560
part of life but not have them at the center and have the body at the center

31
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,319
and uh and uh and the body is a place where we have direct

32
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,480
experience much more so than if we just think about things

33
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,840
so to training to be present for the body's experience of

34
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,000
itself so to begin this meditation i'll do a

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,239
little warm-up in a sense and then i'll do a little exercise of mindfulness

36
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,439
bodies mindfulness bodies awareness that maybe gives you a feeling for how this

37
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:18,799
entering into the body in a deeper way to be aware of breathing even can operate

38
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,960
so to assume meditation posture that's appropriate

39
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,840
for you

40
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:40,840
and that posture is also a little bit of an attitude a posture that has an attitude of

41
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:48,639
attentiveness of being embodied being

42
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:55,040
so there can be a rootedness a intentionality

43
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:02,319
in being here in and with the body

44
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:10,320
so the body is just nothing aside to be made comfortable and forgotten

45
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:17,360
the body is in a sense the meditation hall the temple

46
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,880
and some of you will feel more comfortable with the eyes open

47
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,919
the meditation and some of you can gently close your eyes

48
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,840
it might be nice to take a few long slow deep breaths to settle in

49
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:49,440
maybe extending the exhale to allow for greater release in the body

50
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,840
really relax on that exhale

51
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:07,840
exhaling and letting the shoulders soften

52
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:21,840
the belly relax

53
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:30,478
and then letting your breathing return to normal and taking a few moments to

54
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:37,360
become aware of the body's experience of itself as

55
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:45,680
if awareness is not up in the control tower but awareness lives in the body

56
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,880
an awareness is closely associated with sensations

57
00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:03,840
or more precisely the sensing of the sensations

58
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:31,840
and as an exercise bring your attention into your left hand

59
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,599
and become aware of the sensations in your left hand

60
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,919
there might be coolness and tingling and warmth

61
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,639
pulsing vibration there might be a contact of the hand

62
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:01,520
against another part of your body pressure and

63
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,240
weight

64
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:16,560
feeling the sensations in your hand in your palm of your hands the back of

65
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,039
your hand

66
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,840
in your fingers

67
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:35,839
and allow the hand to have its own experience as if the hand is getting to know itself

68
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:42,399
feeling and sensing the sensations

69
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:51,920
by which we know the hand and perhaps this exercise is it's useful

70
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:59,440
to close your eyes if they're open so that the only real

71
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:08,000
data coming in for the hand is the in the hand itself we don't

72
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,760
see the hand we just feel it

73
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:23,839
and with the eyes closed maybe there's no clear sense of a boundary of the hand

74
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,959
within the buzzing changing shifting sensations that make up the hand

75
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,480
the hand is open boundaries

76
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:51,839
just the hand

77
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,519
and you might have ideas about your hand thoughts and histories and memories of

78
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,959
your hand but that is to to bring those up it

79
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:11,680
means to go back into the mind and there's a way in which putting all

80
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:17,920
that aside there's a generosity in allowing the

81
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,480
hand to be just as it is at this moment

82
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:33,200
in a sense no future no past no judgments just the sensations of the

83
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,839
hand some pleasant some unpleasant

84
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:47,839
are allowed to be just as they are

85
00:10:51,519 --> 00:11:00,079
and now shift your awareness your attention

86
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:06,240
to wear in your body you usually experience your breathing

87
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,519
and not so much that you are focusing on the breathing from the

88
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,480
control tower

89
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,079
but rather you're becoming aware of the general area in your body

90
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,839
where you tend to experience breathing

91
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,040
and as you are feeling the hand feel this general area

92
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,839
the sensations that are there

93
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,040
some sensations might be closely connected to

94
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:57,839
the experience of breathing and but there might be other sensations there

95
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:11,839
and let that part of the body have its own experience of what's happening there

96
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,120
noticing the particular sensations that come into play

97
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,839
that appear and disappear

98
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:40,720
and how that area about your body maybe has no clear boundaries

99
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:46,320
in awareness in its own experience

100
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:54,880
it's kind of open boundaries allowing the permission to be there

101
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,920
with no future and no past

102
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,560
where we're not centered in our thoughts and judgments about it all

103
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:13,360
those can recede to the background and instead

104
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:35,839
to let the center of experience be the body's experience of breathing

105
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:51,680
and if you find yourself drifting off in thought very simply recognize that's happening

106
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:59,040
and recognize how it's taken you away from the immediacy of your embodied

107
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,839
experience of breathing

108
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:14,800
and then begin again centering yourself in your body

109
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:31,839
in the breathing body

110
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,680
where the boundaries to the body's experience of breathing is open and can

111
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:00,800
in fact include all other things happening in your body

112
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,800
maybe peripherally nothing is held

113
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:13,040
nothing is pushed away or denied or but centered in the body in the

114
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:18,320
breathing allowing the body to have its own

115
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:27,839
experience breathing with it all breathing in and breathing out

116
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:39,520
are you in the control tower of thinking or are you in your body

117
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,240
what happens if you

118
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:51,279
center yourself

119
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:56,400
in the body and the experiences the bodies have

120
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:03,360
having the immediacy of the body

121
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:19,840
with no before and after just now

122
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,559
and as we come to the end of this meditation

123
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:51,279
for the next few out breaths as you exhale relax

124
00:26:51,279 --> 00:27:00,080
your body further release any holding in your face

125
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,840
any holding in your shoulders

126
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:20,399
in your chest and your belly

127
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:26,240
and if there's any global way in which you're bracing yourself against life

128
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:34,240
perhaps at the end for a few breaths can you relax that

129
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:49,840
and relax into your body more fully

130
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,759
and when we're relaxed in our body at ease and at home in our body

131
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,840
it can give us a greater capacity

132
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:11,919
for kindness friendliness

133
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,840
good will

134
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:33,360
and to consider at the end of the sitting how is it that

135
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,600
the benefits of this meditation

136
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:47,279
or the challenges of this meditation can inspire you to contribute to the

137
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,640
betterment of our world

138
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,600
that the deep letting go of meditation

139
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,000
is not to take us away from the world

140
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:14,720
but to be more open aware of this world that we live in

141
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:27,840
and to care may it be that

142
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:33,200
we contribute to the welfare and happiness of others

143
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:39,039
may all beings be happy

144
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,960
may all beings be safe

145
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:51,600
may all beings be peaceful

146
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,559
may all beings be free

147
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,840
and as we relax deeply into our own bodies freeing it from our tensions and

148
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:15,840
tightness and holdings may we support

149
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:37,840
others to do the same may all beings be free

150
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:08,640
so one of the surprises and treasures of

151
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:18,640
practicing buddhism for me has been a growing and still growing

152
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:27,200
the delighting or valuing the body the experience of the body

153
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:35,519
and um and there's a difference but what i just said between the body and the experience of the body

154
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:42,240
and i think at the heart of what is most significant for dharma practitioners is

155
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:47,600
the experience of the body more than the body itself

156
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,960
and um and it's hard to separate out these two things the body

157
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,960
and the experience of it but this is at the center of uh

158
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,720
kind of the tremendous appreciation that the buddha and nothing much of buddhism has

159
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:10,480
with being really centered or connected to one's body

160
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,600
is that it's not the body as a physical object as a physical thing

161
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:22,399
but rather the experience the body has of itself and we see in the ancient teachings of

162
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:29,679
the buddha that he used at times different words if he was referring to the physical body

163
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:36,480
in and of itself or the experienced body the body that we can experience

164
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,600
and so the physical body the one of the words for his physical body

165
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:48,960
in ancient languages sarira s a r i think i r a

166
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,559
and uh in sanskrit it's sharira it's often translated into english as a

167
00:32:54,559 --> 00:33:00,000
relic a relic of someone who's died and that bone or some kind of little

168
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,519
something from left over from the cremation and it's a long custom in different

169
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,559
schools of buddhism to save these relics and maybe put them on the altar

170
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:17,200
and and sometimes the word sharira is used actually to refer to a corpse

171
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:24,640
but it's what it refers to also for a living person is the physical the pure physical

172
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,640
body itself the word that's used for especially in

173
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:36,840
meditation practice that's used for body is kaya

174
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,760
k-a-y-a and people who do zen practice know this word because it's often chanted

175
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:49,200
this nirmanakaya the sambod kayak

176
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,039
and

177
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:03,919
and this word kaya in their earliest teachings when it's talking about the meditator

178
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:11,280
it refers to the body as it's experienced and how we experience the body is partly

179
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,800
dependent on the state of our mind that and this is a fascinating part of

180
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,919
being a meditator is to feel how the state of the mind changes

181
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:27,280
and the experience of the body changes and sometimes even the posture will change

182
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:34,079
depending on how concentrated the mind becomes how focused and still and quiet

183
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,358
and and the mind stops becoming claustrophobic and caught up in its thinking and

184
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:45,040
thoughts but becomes spacious and open and more quiet and soft

185
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,560
it can have a huge transformation in how we experience the body

186
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:58,400
and the experienced body to it often becomes soft and transparent or very soft boundaries or

187
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,000
no boundaries at all and even sometimes the feeling of the body can disappear entirely in

188
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,240
meditation and i've actually opened my eyes

189
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:16,400
in meditation to see if i the physical body was still there because with the eyes closed there was no

190
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,839
evidence of it the mind was so still and so quiet

191
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:29,040
and and this interplay between the mind and the body is uh so intimate that

192
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,880
in buddhism there's a tendency not to make a strong duality between the mind and the body

193
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,320
but to see them kind of as a unified whole and one of the place that unified whole

194
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:48,079
plays out is in the is that the emphasis on being present for the

195
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:54,640
body's experience of itself an experience which is not exactly right to say that way but an experience which

196
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,320
is conditioned on the quality state of the mind and of course it goes the other

197
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,800
direction as well that the state of the body affects the mind if we're in a lot of pain that can have

198
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:13,359
a big impact on the mind we can get contracted we can get caught up in certain thoughts and judgments and

199
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:18,960
fears and projections and all kind but it's not necessarily so

200
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:28,880
and one of the great lessons i had from sitting zazen where at zen center where

201
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,200
i wasn't supposed to move i would have a lot of knee pain and i noticed after a

202
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:43,280
while that the pain actually got worse if i had self-pity for myself

203
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:50,960
i think you know what was happening was these little micro muscles would tighten up when i had the self-pity and the only way that i could

204
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:57,680
manage with the pain was if i let go of my self-pity and uh and then this micro muscles would

205
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:03,359
relax and then the pain was manageable and uh and i found that the less i got caught

206
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:09,839
up in my thoughts and my reactivity in my mind and my projections and

207
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:16,480
into the future what this all meant that the pain in and of itself got

208
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,760
simpler and simpler and simpler and to have a simplicity of physical

209
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:28,160
pain without the add-on of reactivity showed me how much the experience of

210
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:35,280
pain was a product of the quality of state activity of my mind

211
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,320
not all of it of course and the buddha himself said that when there's extreme

212
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:46,000
pain then it's the pain of the sarira the pain of the corpse of the

213
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,680
of the the pure physical body but many times these two are real you

214
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,599
know the mind and the body have such a big interplay with what we experience as pain and discomfort and all kinds of

215
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:05,599
things in the body that um and so one of the things we do in vipassana practice is learn to center

216
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:12,400
ourselves in the body to um to really allow ourselves to experience it

217
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:19,920
and the body's experience of itself and um and as we do so it

218
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,839
has an impact back on the mind and because these two are so closely related

219
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:33,440
and it has a huge impact on the mind in fact the conditioning and the shifting and changing of the bodily experience

220
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,760
is a reconditioning of the neurotic mind or the fearful mind or the traumatized mind

221
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,880
even and so to begin to soften and relax

222
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:52,000
and so the buddha was very explicit about this he talked about cultivating a mindfulness of the whole

223
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,880
body opening up becoming aware of the whole body not just the body that's breathing

224
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:06,320
but the whole body kind of like a global experience of this body's experience of itself and a global

225
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:11,760
experience is one where the mind is not contracting or fixating on any

226
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:18,480
particular thing or creating a boundary to the body but just kind of open to experience it all

227
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,920
the buddha also talked about as the mind does get settled and concentrated

228
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:30,720
that if there's any feelings of well-being that dwell up feelings of joy and happiness that to

229
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:36,800
take and spread that throughout the body and allow that those feelings to spread

230
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,240
and and so the experience about it begins shifting dramatically and i think this

231
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:48,320
is partly in mahayana what's being referred to in the three bodies of the buddha

232
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:54,000
that there are three different ways of experiencing the body depending on what's happening in the

233
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,280
mind and the mind state that we have and

234
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:06,480
it becomes such a delight such a joy to

235
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:11,839
rest and experience these kind of bod the body becomes freer and free or a

236
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:17,359
liberated body there is an ancient mahayana sutra

237
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:24,000
that emphasizes that liberation doesn't happen in the mind it happens in

238
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,040
the body that the awakening is a embodied experience

239
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,880
more than a mental experience but in fact what we know now is that you can't really separate these two the mind and

240
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,720
the body so in vepasana practice one of the ways

241
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:49,759
that there's many ways in which the mindfulness of the body is practiced but one of the ways is to

242
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,760
is to bring the kind of attention that i suggested to you in that exercise with a

243
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:02,720
hand to bring that to whatever is the compelling physical experience of the moment if

244
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,960
there's some predominantly compelling experience in the body either pleasant or unpleasant

245
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,079
that's more compelling than the breathing then it's fine to let go of the

246
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:20,880
breathing not keep that focus but bring the same kind of careful attention

247
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:27,920
careful kind of sensing and feeling into that part of the body that has this strong sensations

248
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,359
and what happens is if you if over time different parts of the body will speak

249
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:39,040
up and show itself and it's kind of like doing body work

250
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:45,839
over over months and years and by bringing this careful attention just opening the attention open allowing the

251
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:51,680
sensations to be there not reacting not forcing them not spending too much time relaxing around

252
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,040
it either just feeling and sensing and slowly the body begins to wake up

253
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:05,040
and become more aware and more uh sensory sensate

254
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,440
ascentian body as opposed to a conceived body and body that we're

255
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,040
thinking about so much of our self physical self-consciousness

256
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,560
has to do with ideas and images about what the body should be like or can be like and

257
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,839
comparison of my body with other people's bodies and it can be so much pain that goes on

258
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:33,040
our society around body and skin color and all kinds of things

259
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:40,000
having to do with the body and meditation is one of the ways to free ourselves at least personally

260
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:45,760
from all these ideas comparative thinking and concepts and allowing the awareness of the body

261
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:51,839
arise from the inside out and we find out the body is much happier

262
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:57,520
than often we are much more content when it flows and we have the experience

263
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:06,400
from the inside out so mindfulness of the body

264
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:13,040
is the body's awareness of the body is the body's awareness and one of the things in meditation

265
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,160
practice is to learn to abide or rest in that experience of the

266
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:23,599
body and when it's the most compelling part

267
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:29,599
of it or the center of it we can stay with the breathing because it's an embodied experience to

268
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:36,000
breathe and breathe with all things

269
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:45,119
breathe with the body all of the body so um i hope this made some sense and

270
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:51,680
i hope it also uh points to one of the places where zen and vipassana overlap in some ways

271
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:57,760
this emphasis on body and and the importance of it in the practice

272
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,880
and in the kaya and maybe what we can call

273
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:09,838
our own dharmakaya so thank you all very much
