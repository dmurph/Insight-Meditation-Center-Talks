1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:11,679
so hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
and

3
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,400
one of the ways that the buddha talks about realization or about the depths of possibility in

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,840
this practice is that it's something to be known and experienced

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,840
through the body and the emphasis on embodiment or the body

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,640
is is uh quite strong in these early teachings of buddhism

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,199
and so we begin with our body and taking a assuming a

8
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:59,680
bodily posture that might support bodily awareness

9
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:07,040
the process of coming maybe home to your body or settling into your

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,840
physical experience here and now

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:22,320
i think of our physical experience as adding the full dimension that dimensionality

12
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,439
to our life that we live in our thoughts only it's like living in

13
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:34,159
two dimensions and with the body it becomes three dimensions maybe something like that

14
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,960
so assuming the meditation posture that you for this period of time

15
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,438
and gently closing your eyes

16
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:58,799
and attuning yourself to your body kind of like as

17
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:06,159
from the inside out not from your mind so much as thinking

18
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:14,400
about it but feeling and sensing and there can be an intimacy

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,840
in sensing and feeling our bodily

20
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,840
experience and maybe this allowing ourselves to feel and sense the body it's a little bit

21
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:37,680
like someone putting a gentle hand on your shoulder reassuring hand or a loving hand

22
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,920
that's something reassuring and of making that connection

23
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,840
with our body touching it and being touched

24
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,800
and then from the depths of your body whatever that means deep inside

25
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,159
gently arising from that depth

26
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:19,040
deep full inhale

27
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:26,239
arising from the depths stretching outwards into the ribcage the shoulders

28
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:33,840
kind of stretching and expanding of the torso

29
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,840
and as you exhale a settling

30
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:47,840
a calming a returning to the depths within

31
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,759
and then letting your breathing return to normal

32
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:37,759
and to relax your body on the exhale

33
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,840
relaxing the face

34
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:57,840
softening the shoulders

35
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:11,840
softening the belly

36
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,080
and then settling in now

37
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,840
to the body's experience of breathing

38
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:09,199
as if in this body of yours you will find the path of meditation

39
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:16,960
you will find the path for where to place your

40
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,319
attention where awareness can be awakened

41
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:35,840
in the body breathing mindfully

42
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,479
feeling the vitality

43
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:10,400
the aliveness of the physical body the hum of

44
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,840
the body's aliveness

45
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:24,879
and to relax and settle more deeply into

46
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:33,520
an embodiment of the body here body is always in the present

47
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:41,919
moment here in this body gently

48
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,240
quietly feeling the embodiment of the body

49
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,800
breathing

50
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,840
just here body breathing

51
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,080
letting go of your thoughts maybe sometimes letting go of

52
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,840
whatever you're thinking every time you exhale

53
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,639
letting go of thoughts and letting go into the body

54
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:27,840
breathing in and breathing out

55
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:30,800
letting go of your thoughts unless navigating from your mind

56
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:38,880
but more navigating meditation through your body

57
00:13:44,399 --> 00:14:03,839
awakening capacity to be present with your body

58
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,919
you

59
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,919
you

60
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,840
again

61
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,840
and as we come to the end of the sitting

62
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:41,600
even more we are connected to our body the more likely we are to be close to

63
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,600
the source of love within

64
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:55,600
and what would it be like to let yourself become quiet and still so that

65
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:01,440
the place of tender care and love and kindness

66
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:11,840
is something that you can feel more connected to

67
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,039
allowing something to settle and let go and feel

68
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:24,480
the place within

69
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,360
where there can be a warm regard for others

70
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,240
where there can be a generosity of heart

71
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:53,840
a willingness and capacity to appreciate other beings

72
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,240
and from this place perhaps

73
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:12,158
to intentionally conclude your meditation

74
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:19,040
with a wish for the welfare and happiness of others

75
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:26,158
may it be that others can be happy

76
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:34,560
may it be that others can feel safe

77
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:42,079
may it be that others can experience peace

78
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:49,040
no a peaceful life

79
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:57,200
and may it be that others could wake up to freedom

80
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:05,440
to experience the heart free and unknown unfettered

81
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:16,240
and may the benefit and goodness of this meditation this day may those benefits

82
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:22,240
be shared widely to the welfare and happiness of all

83
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:31,839
beings may all beings be happy and free

84
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,920
you

85
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:22,000
so this uh sunday talk could be seen as a continuation of the

86
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,359
last three weeks of early morning talks on greed hatred and

87
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:34,240
delusion and now this is a theme that comes up repeatedly for the buddha

88
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:41,520
and in some ways it's important because it's the goal of practice is to wake up be

89
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:48,400
experience the peace wake up to the absence of greed hate delusion to wake up to the presence of

90
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:55,359
the peace that's possible without it so what i want to do today is uh maybe a

91
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,880
little different than just usually on sundays i want to tell you a little bit about a discourse

92
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,720
uh ancient text that purports to talk about the teachings and

93
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,880
conversations the buddha had and it's uh the talk that um

94
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:19,920
it's a suta which is maybe one of my favorite maybe the top 10 if i had a

95
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:28,800
list like that of ones that i value and it's called the chunky sutum

96
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,920
and it's in the middle length discourses number 95

97
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:40,560
and and why i like it is one of many reasons but one of the reasons is

98
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:47,760
how it talks about truth it talks about protecting truth and who doesn't want to

99
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,760
protect truth and then discovering truth or awakening to truth

100
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,480
and finally uh the talks about the final arrival to truth so what is a final arrival a

101
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,640
complete coming into truth and

102
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:14,480
so i'm not going to tell you the full story of the text but the basic idea is that

103
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:21,200
uh the young very well-educated uh brahmana comes to

104
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,320
the buddha and asks a simple question he says that

105
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:33,359
the brahmanas in my tradition they claim that their scriptures

106
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:39,200
contain the only truth and no one else has the truth and what does the buddha think about

107
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,599
this instead of answering it directly the buddha says well do any of the

108
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,680
brahmanas in the present generation do they themselves say

109
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,359
i know and i see this truth or is it the truth that they've just

110
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:04,160
taken from the texts and they could believe it because they have faith in it because in the texts and the young man says well

111
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,200
no one says that they have seen it for themselves or known it for themselves

112
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:15,839
and the buddha says well what about their teachers and the teachers before them and back seven generations has anyone

113
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:21,760
said that they themselves have seen the truth or they themselves

114
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:28,400
have known the truth directly and he says no and the buddha says well basically then

115
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:35,920
he would indicate he's kind of a little bit dismissive than ever or there's not much you know value

116
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:43,359
in a statement this is only the only truth if for many generations no one's actually known it for themselves

117
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:50,400
so it's little bit challenging i suppose to the brahmana because they're back then their religion is

118
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:57,359
based on the ancient texts and they are taken on faith i guess

119
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:04,160
and so the buddha says well if you want to so the man asks the buddha well how do we protect the

120
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:10,800
truth and probably he asked the question because they thought they were protecting the truth by

121
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,880
protecting those texts protecting and meant memor there's no writing back then so memorizing them and

122
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,920
passing them down to generation to generation and the buddha says well you

123
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,359
protect the truth if you when you talk about what you think is

124
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,720
true like religiously true you indicate

125
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:39,520
on with a reason for why you take it to be true the basis for that statement

126
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:45,680
so if you take it on faith preface your your your conversation with i have it on

127
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:54,079
faith that this is true if you believe it's true because the tradition tells you so then say

128
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:02,000
based on the tradition i take this to be true if it's a matter of um

129
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:09,119
because it's in in your in your sacred text say uh because of my sacred text

130
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:14,480
i take it to be true and uh if it's because of your reasoning and

131
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:20,400
your logic say that and if it's just because you have some intuitive sense that this is true

132
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:27,280
say that i have some intuitive sense of uh of this is true so

133
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:34,960
it's kind of a very helpful thing for other people to know that if you make a truth claim on what

134
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,800
basis do you make it it's on faith it's on whatever

135
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,319
so the young man says okay but can't you discover truth for yourself

136
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:53,520
and the buddha says yes you can and so the man says how do i do that how does one do that

137
00:42:53,520 --> 00:43:01,119
and this is the oh another wonderful part of the text is the buddha then describes a process

138
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:06,880
by which someone can discover the truth but the young man is not he's just

139
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:13,520
replying to the man's question how how does one discover the truth the buddha provides a means a

140
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:19,040
process and the buddha doesn't directly proselytize he doesn't really

141
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:24,079
directly say what's important for him what he the buddha's truth is what he has realized

142
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:31,280
he just informs the man of a process but indirectly the the buddha's goal

143
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:38,240
of their spiritual life is emphasized and it's kind of a slight of hand perhaps

144
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:45,760
or maybe you have to be really attentive to see that he's what he's doing here so i'll try to uh explain this

145
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:54,240
um that i see you trying to spell the text the chunky it's uh usually um uh see

146
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:01,680
a n k i that's the poly spelling c a n k i but it's pronounced uh chunky

147
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:08,000
like with ch and um so he discovers

148
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,640
so the so the buddha says so the buddha is going to describe the process of discovering the truth and so and this

149
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:21,440
is important from the buddhist teachings because the buddha really wants everyone to discover it for themselves and don't rely on texts to know what's

150
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:29,280
true but to really know for yourself in some direct way but it's a process for doing that and

151
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,800
so you have to realize that in the ancient world there were no books so you couldn't say well go to the

152
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,960
library and read up on it at the teachings but you if you want to hear and learn

153
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:47,280
spiritual teachings learn about a process to become discover the truth you have to go

154
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,880
find someone who would teach it to you and so the first criteria for this

155
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,720
process has to do with a relationship we have to a teacher

156
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:05,200
the teacher teaches and so the next part of the process is the relationship we have to teachings

157
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:12,800
and the final step of this steps of this process has to do with the practices we do what we engage in

158
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:20,079
so that we can discover the truth but these three areas are important the teacher the teachings and then the

159
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,800
practice so the buddha says that

160
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,560
first you want to find yourself a teacher

161
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:38,400
and to do so uh go find find the teachers in your area a little bit paraphrasing here and um

162
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:43,760
and investigate them uh investigate the teacher

163
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,880
and then he gives goes to great detail how are you supposed to check them out

164
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:56,560
but they all have to it has to do with checking out whether the teacher in the teacher there's a presence of any

165
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:02,160
greed and any hatred and any delusion

166
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:09,440
because of which they will uh twist the teachings they will kind of

167
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:15,839
not quite give real teachings or somehow influence the flavor the texture

168
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:21,760
of the teachings they give because they're infused with the teachers greed hatred and delusion

169
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:27,200
and you want to have a teacher who they're they're not going to have any greed and hatred and delusion

170
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:35,599
which influences what they say and so there's this wonderful instruction is check out the teacher

171
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:42,800
and so to really check out a teacher it takes time uh you know

172
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:49,440
don't rush headlong into a teacher and but really kind of tune in and pay attention and see how they live their

173
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:55,599
lives maybe and um and to see you know this are they free of any great hate and delusion

174
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,640
that's going to that's going to skew the way that they teach the simplicity or the clarity of

175
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:07,520
what they have to teach and and so if if you decide that they

176
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:16,480
have don't have that kind of greed hate and delusion then um pl have some confidence in that

177
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:23,040
teacher offer some have some faith some trust in that teacher that's then the teacher is worthy of

178
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,079
some degree of trust and trust enough so

179
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:35,119
the next step is go visit the teacher so in the ancient world again you couldn't read the teacher's books

180
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:40,640
watch them on youtube you had to go and go find a teacher so go visit the teacher it's important

181
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:46,000
to be in the presence especially that back then in the oral tradition

182
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,880
and offer respect to the teacher there's a long ancient tradition that

183
00:47:52,880 --> 00:48:00,400
some modicum of respect prepares the listener to listen well it kind of clears a

184
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:05,760
certain certain degree of clouds or agitation

185
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:12,319
that kind of genuine respect or care is a kind of willingness to be open and

186
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:19,280
and give a kind of a willingness to listen well to what a teacher has to say

187
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,559
but remember this is after having really checked out the teacher and decided okay this person is

188
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:31,760
worthy of some respect and then listen to the teacher so listen to what

189
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:39,760
they have to say in the modern world we might say read the teachings carefully

190
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:46,480
you know listen read well take your time back then there was only listening there

191
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:52,319
was no libraries no books so the so the process with the teacher

192
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:58,720
is to investigate to have faith trust some degree

193
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:04,559
to visit to offer respect and then to really listen to the teacher

194
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:12,559
listen to the teachings from the teacher um then as you listen listen and

195
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:20,880
hear the teachings fully take them in as you hear them memorize the teachings

196
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:26,960
so that make again a lot of sense back in the ancient world because you didn't have a book to refer back to

197
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,880
and people didn't know how to write so they didn't take notes when the teacher was teaching and so you can go to the

198
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:38,240
library or something and check out a book to find out if you wanted to review and and read

199
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:44,240
again and think about what was being taught you had to memorize what was being taught

200
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:51,440
and people back then almost certainly had a much higher ability to memorize than we have today because that

201
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,720
was the medium for knowledge in a way that is not the case today

202
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:03,359
and then having memorized them or have them in writing or some way examine them reflect on them

203
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:10,319
think about them and uh so here again just like with a teacher you don't accept teachings you don't

204
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:15,520
accept a teacher blindly quickly but you really check it out there's a process of

205
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:23,680
checking it out thinking about it looking at it not automatically believing

206
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:30,960
the teacher or believing the teachings but really reflect on them examining them when one has examined and

207
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,880
thought about them deeply and if they really from your best

208
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:43,520
understanding seem to be good teachings then accept those teachings

209
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:50,720
enough to be willing to begin the process of practice so hear the teachings memorize the

210
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:55,839
teachings and reflect deeply on the teachings and

211
00:50:55,839 --> 00:51:01,119
then some modicum of accepting them as something that

212
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:07,920
is accepted well enough now you can practice with them it's kind of like you've gotten the ingredients for the experiment and now

213
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,520
you have to run the experiment if you want to discover something so

214
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:20,400
then comes the practice and the practice is first by understanding the teachings by

215
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:29,200
having faith in the teacher this whole process is to have their spring up

216
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:38,960
arise out of yourself the desire to practice without some inspiration

217
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:45,200
some enthusiasm some feeling of yes i'm going to practice you know then

218
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:51,440
the experiment is not going to really going to work so we want to listen to teachings take them in until we

219
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:57,520
really feel like yes and it might be part of that yes to practice is comes from having checked out the

220
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:03,280
teacher wow if it's possible to live without great hatred and delusion

221
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:09,920
this is a worthwhile path this is good this is inspiring and so that inspires us to want to do it

222
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:16,960
for ourselves to discover how to do it so um then there's preparing oneself the

223
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:22,720
text says being fit to practice so preparing ourselves to practice

224
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:28,240
whatever that means getting ready for practicing or

225
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:35,280
getting established in practice and then once again the word examine

226
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:40,400
when we have a practicing meditation for example and gets quiet and settled and

227
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:46,960
really able to be in the present moment there is a non-discursive non-analytical way

228
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:52,000
of looking examining more and more deeply what is our experience what's really going on

229
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:57,119
in our direct experience and so here we give again this exam examine the teacher

230
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:03,040
you reflect on the teachings and now we're examining and looking deeply at our own experience

231
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:11,920
because that's where the discovery of truth is going to be and then a person continues practicing

232
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:18,240
and endeavors and makes more effort and you kind of really uh as as practice moves along there

233
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:23,280
comes a time when this becomes kind of like we give ourselves over to it

234
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:29,839
um give ourselves over to really see the experiment all the way through

235
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:38,559
and then at some point one realizes one has a realization

236
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:44,079
of ultimate truth with the body one realizes with the body

237
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:51,599
ultimate truth and i believe the experience with the body is being said to emphasize the direct

238
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:57,599
personal way in which we see and perceive and experience the

239
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:04,720
truth this is not from a book it's not ideas it's not it doesn't exactly belong to the mind of

240
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:10,160
analysis and and cognitive beliefs or even maybe

241
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:16,079
a certain kind of not even cognitive understanding in a certain way but uh first and foremost it's coming

242
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:21,359
it's so obvious that oh this is this this so you know if you

243
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:27,520
um are really hot and hot day and you go stand in a shade of a tree

244
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:33,920
that's what's cool you know you experience the coolness the truth of that

245
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:41,520
coolness with your body it's a really a felt sense experience and this uh

246
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:48,960
this kind of realization of the truth with the body directly is called discovering the truth

247
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:55,040
this young brahmana asks the buddha then is this the final arrival at truth is this the final

248
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:02,160
complete experience of truth and the buddha says no in order to

249
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:08,640
really arrive at it fully be centered in the truth then you want to do that process that he

250
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:14,400
described before over and over and over again i imagine

251
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,440
you don't have to keep doing the checking out the teacher at some point you have to check out the teaching so

252
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:24,559
much but to do the practice part of it over and over and over again

253
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:29,839
and uh and it's the repetition of basic practice and repetition of coming back into the

254
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:36,559
discovery of the truth discovering this truth over and over and over again that begins to expand and fill out and

255
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:45,040
develop this capacity of so we become the truth we arrive in truth in a full way

256
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:51,920
and in this uh teaching the buddha does not say what the truth is so the

257
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:57,760
young brahmana does not ask the buddha what do you teach and what do you teach about the truth

258
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:04,559
he's really asked first and foremost asks about his own religion and then he asks maybe to understand it

259
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:12,559
better his own religion he says how do i protect the truth how do i discover the truth how do i

260
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:17,760
finally final arrival that truth and the buddha just then

261
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:24,480
answers in a kind of a generic way perhaps or a vague way without specifying any particular teaching of

262
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:30,960
his own almost and but uh this is where there's a slight of

263
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:36,079
hand maybe or a keto move because um

264
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:42,400
what the buddha says at the beginning the very first step is check out the teacher to make sure

265
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:50,160
the teacher doesn't have great hatred and delusion well this is the goal of the buddha the

266
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:56,640
goal of the buddha is for people to come to a place where they're free of greed hate and delusion

267
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:02,400
and so by having this young man first and foremost check out you know be told this is what

268
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:07,920
you have to check out first um it does a number of things it means

269
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:15,680
that he's only going to study with people who have realized the absence of great hatred and delusion

270
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:21,440
and and because they've realized that they know the value of that maybe they have other all kinds of

271
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:27,839
non-buddhist ideas maybe believe in all kinds of things but for the buddha that's maybe secondary

272
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:34,240
what's really important what's primary is this freedom from clinging freedom from grasping that

273
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:41,440
the freedom from greed hit and delusion represents and also by uh telling a young man

274
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:49,200
to pay attention to check out the teacher in these states of greek hate and delusion it's actually a beginning of attuning

275
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:56,880
him to this possibility of being free of great hate and delusion and to really study someone else and

276
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:03,760
investigate someone else and really see the way that they are free of great hate and delusion that they have this amazing freedom from

277
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:09,440
these kind of powerful forces that are so big in our society um

278
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,559
it i imagine it's really inspiring inspires a possibility

279
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:20,839
and also i can't imagine that the the young man if he did this would

280
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:26,960
begin uh becoming having spent time studying greed hating delusion or the absence of

281
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:35,680
another person would start becoming more self-aware of uh one's own great hatred and delusion

282
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:41,839
uh seeing it more likely and seeing maybe the uh the unfortunate nature of it being there

283
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:47,119
and and the teacher is without it but i have it there might be kind of an inspiration

284
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:52,240
to maybe that's important not to have it to work through it

285
00:58:52,240 --> 00:59:00,079
and so i believe that the buddha is kind of like one of his primary messages he kind of kind of in a kind of side

286
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:06,240
door gets through to this young brahman who's talking with him and so that by the time you get to the

287
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:12,079
full discovery of truth the full attainment of truth the idea that it involves the absence of

288
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:18,559
greed hate and delusion is not very far away because if you want to become what the teacher has attained

289
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:25,280
that also has to be an absence of greed hector and delusion and that is what the buddha was teaching

290
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:33,520
and and the idea of religious truths doctrines beliefs that are

291
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:40,559
maybe are not that important for the buddha unless they interfere with the

292
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:46,640
possibility of this radical freedom but this radical freedom perhaps

293
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:52,480
can it can exist without too much concern about what people believe if it's not

294
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:58,400
harmful if they believe all kinds of religious beliefs and ideas that come from

295
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:05,760
their tradition from faith from their logic whatever um may it be so or let it be that way

296
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,799
um provided that we discover how to live together on this planet

297
01:00:10,799 --> 01:00:18,880
uh free of greed hatred and delusion so protecting the truth i think is a

298
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:24,400
generous thing to do if we tell other people the basis upon

299
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:31,599
what we know what we believe to be religiously true by faith by tradition from the texts from my

300
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:38,640
teacher or whatever and then then engage in a process of discovering

301
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:44,960
the truth for ourselves this is a great thing to do and

302
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:51,200
and and not only maybe we can't discover what that is

303
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:57,839
while we are ourselves still involved in greed hate and delusion because just like a teacher maybe skews

304
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:04,079
their understanding by the influence of great hatred and delusion so we would skew

305
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:11,200
our discovery of the truth by those forces as well and so to cleanse ourselves to learn to

306
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:18,240
to empty ourselves of these forces is possible and it's worthwhile

307
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:26,960
and it's one of the great instructions from the buddha to do so so
