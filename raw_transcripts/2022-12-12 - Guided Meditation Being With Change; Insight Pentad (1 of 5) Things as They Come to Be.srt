00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:11,160
hello and this Monday welcome happy to be here with you and

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,340
some of you participated in this Saturday morning a Saturday day long and

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:22,460
so there's maybe perhaps more continuity in that practice

4
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:30,560
between the Friday and the Monday that you carry with you and um

5
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:36,620
and um

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,160
one of the things I said uh Saturday about practice of mindfulness is there's a

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,320
comes a point where it's kind of a paradigm shift we see things in a different way than

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,620
we usually do and then I want to emphasize that here as we begin this meditation

9
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:02,640
that there's a natural I think tendency enough to focus on if we're in the present moment

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,840
really with the experience with what's happening to be concerned with how things are

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:17,040
and so the that expression how things are focuses on the present moment existence

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,380
of what's Happening and if you ask you know how are you

13
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,600
there's a lot of things that might contribute to that answer

14
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,640
but if you try to explain it you know really how you're feeling sensing what you're

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,979
experience is here you might say something definitively

16
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:46,680
with the Buddhas uh but that kind of focuses on the on a kind of a static the

17
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,200
things as they are as little but can be seen a little bit static unchanging

18
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,420
the Buddha's way of saying this um and then what he emphasized in terms

19
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,579
of inside practice was not how things are

20
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,920
but how they come to be how they become

21
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,040
how they arise and it's a difference between

22
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,620
uh is focusing on the static part of our reality to the

23
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:25,980
dynamic to focus on how things are arising appearing in the moment that being

24
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:33,660
present right there at the Edge of Time the edge of that time keeps arising appearing is

25
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,360
here with particular experiences that arise that they appear

26
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,680
certainly some things persist but um but to be a little bit kind of like

27
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,620
on the front of a boat just watching the boat move through the water as opposed

28
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,680
to being in the back of the boat or being at a large ocean liner where

29
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,900
you're not even looking at the water because you're maybe inside in some

30
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:11,099
some big room but to um to be kind of right there with how

31
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:17,580
things appear how as the water comes and meets the boat does the both meets the water

32
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:25,280
so things as they as they come to be and we can begin this with um

33
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,739
this paradigm shift with our breathing if you say how's your how is your

34
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,959
breathing you might say my breathing is tight my breathing is loose my breathing

35
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:44,720
is fast it is slow and those are all accurate but how's the breathing

36
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,920
arising how's the breathing the breathing coming to be Moment by moment

37
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,080
and now we're into the process seeing the process nature of our

38
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:01,019
experience not the static kind of stepping back and generalizing oh the

39
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:07,680
breathing is this way is that way as opposed to how is the breathing come to be

40
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,860
and then now we're focusing on how it's coming into awareness how it's coming into experience

41
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,959
the beginning of the in-breath the arising of the in-breath expanding of

42
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:26,639
the Torso perhaps the beginning of the exhale and how it what happens the cascading sensations of

43
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,740
exhaling has the sensations come into being there

44
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:38,960
at the beginning of experience so hopefully that's uh clear enough

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
so to assume a meditation posture

46
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,340
that's stable rooted grounded

47
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:59,120
so that you can sit the bow of the boat

48
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:08,120
without being tossed around too much by the waves that keep coming

49
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:18,560
and if it's if your eyes are open gently lower the Gaze

50
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:26,759
and then with a gentle relaxed gaze if it's comfortable you can close your

51
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,940
eyes

52
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:55,320
and then to receive the appearing of an inhale

53
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:03,300
the whole process of breathing in taking a long slow inhale

54
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,478
they're coming to be of an inhale

55
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:19,259
maybe that and then at the top of the inhale there's the coming to be coming

56
00:06:19,259 --> 00:06:26,039
into begin it's beingness its appearance

57
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:34,800
the beginning of an exhale long exhale it's not just a single thing

58
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,160
it's the unfolding of a process of the body Contracting

59
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,720
diaphragm lifting

60
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:01,039
in a sense breathing the body of breathing is not a thing

61
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:05,780
but it's a dynamic process of change

62
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,800
we're constantly something new is appearing

63
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,039
something new is growing fading

64
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:37,380
relaxing into the breathing relaxing the whole body

65
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:43,860
as much as you can a tense body is kind of stationary

66
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:50,880
static her relaxed body has room and space

67
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,120
for change for movement for

68
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,220
breathing to be unencumbered

69
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:09,660
chances desire that if the mind is preoccupied in thoughts

70
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:14,940
it's concerned closer with how things are

71
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:21,120
what kind of relating to thoughts as things as Concepts

72
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:28,200
as opposed to the process of thinking the coming into being of a thought

73
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,800
every moment things are coming into being

74
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:41,580
this is the place where the meditation becomes settled

75
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,320
focused relaxed

76
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:54,980
allowing things to come into be moment to moment getting out of the way

77
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:05,399
letting the physical mental experiences arise and pass

78
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:13,160
as if there is a lot of space for things to come into being

79
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,800
and that you're ready and available for the next and the next

80
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,899
like an open window is available

81
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:31,940
for the wind that blows through it

82
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,700
sometimes what arises

83
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:19,040
elicits a response within us a reaction

84
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,139
that is just another arising another appearing

85
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:32,579
another thing that comes into being stay there at the edge of things coming

86
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:38,639
into being allowing them to fade away

87
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:45,019
from attention so you can be there for the next arising

88
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:53,160
we've got a bow of a boat that meets the water and then lets the water just slide off

89
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,639
the side

90
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:41,539
even within the in-breath and the out breath

91
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,700
being available for the process of what comes to be

92
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:54,559
in breathing the constant process of change

93
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,559
thank you

94
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,240
okay

95
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:42,600
to be at ease with the ever-changing nature of

96
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:50,400
experience to be available ready and opened

97
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,100
to Ride Along with how things change

98
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:00,980
as they're always changing in some way or other

99
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:09,140
to do so is to let go of fixations on anything

100
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:16,039
and without fixations without dwelling on anything in particular

101
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:26,340
there's more possibility for being with what's ever happening in

102
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:30,440
a friendly way in a kind way

103
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:36,620
with generosity and care and

104
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,520
as things come to be

105
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:56,000
may we meet it with our care

106
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,700
may this meditation teach us encourage us Inspire us to meet

107
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:09,140
everything with open care kindness

108
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,980
so that this meditation that we do can benefit the world

109
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:26,100
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

110
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:34,580
may all beings be peaceful may all beings be free

111
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:50,190
[Music]

112
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:00,139
thank you

113
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,880
foreign

114
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:57,440
so hello everyone

115
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:06,600
we will um so today being Monday we start kind of a new theme

116
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,640
and kind of because in some ways the theme this week will continue last

117
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:18,779
week's theme last week was What's called the gladness pentad

118
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:24,440
and these five qualities of the gladness pathetic gladness Joy Tranquility

119
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:30,419
happiness and concentration also appear in a longer list

120
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:36,419
that continue the pattern continued the flow of the practice

121
00:31:36,419 --> 00:31:42,320
and for five more qualities and these can be called the inside

122
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:49,500
insight pentad the five factors that arise in the wake

123
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:56,899
of insight so this is Insight Meditation that we do

124
00:31:56,899 --> 00:32:04,740
and here in this teaching last week the idea is that there's preparation done

125
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:12,600
for real deep insight and the ins insight into suffering into insight

126
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:19,020
into the into constant nature of our experience some deep kind of paradigm

127
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:26,659
shift that the first insight the part of the insights pet Tad is

128
00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:32,760
seeing things as they've come to be knowledge and vision of things as

129
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:42,919
they've come to be and uh the often we this the poly expression

130
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:49,880
y-a-t-h just means like as

131
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:58,200
BH long u t a and and this is a past participle it

132
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,080
means that not things as they are but things as they come to be things as they have come to be

133
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:10,380
and the focus here is not an insight into how things are

134
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:18,720
as things things as things but rather focus into that the process

135
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,880
things as processes things as Dynamic and changing

136
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:30,559
and it's very easy for us to be concerned with particular things ideas

137
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:37,440
experiences sometimes we hang on to an experience for a long time carrying our resentment or our desires and around it

138
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,019
our regrets and we maybe carrying some fixed idea of

139
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:48,720
that what happened somewhat fixed and but we're kind of focusing on that as

140
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:54,659
opposed to the process of thoughts arising memories arising the thoughts of

141
00:33:54,659 --> 00:34:01,260
regrets are rising and um and if we're settled enough we

142
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:08,878
see that these are actually a relatively inconstant process in the sense that it's repetitive that keeps

143
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:16,099
reappearing and reappearing but there's a kind of a it's not a static flat

144
00:34:16,099 --> 00:34:21,839
preoccupation be concerned with the mind is constantly regenerating

145
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:27,480
itself in terms of uh what it's focused on what it thinks about

146
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:32,878
but we get enamored we get caught in the ideas the ideas of things being a

147
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:38,638
certain way they're fixed they're this is how it is and um

148
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:46,679
and uh the alternative offered by the Buddha is this nothing is everything is

149
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:53,460
a process of becoming everything um is unfolding

150
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:59,660
so that there's always a possibility for change always a possibility for something new

151
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:07,440
the the world is not a you know are suffering our personality are not static

152
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:14,040
big icebergs that don't change they are more like water that is

153
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:20,520
constantly moving to the degree to which we live in an iceberg we live as an iceberg

154
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:27,180
the the gladness pentad is a process of thawing of relaxing the places of

155
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:34,160
tightness and holding the places where we're caught the places where we're

156
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:40,260
fixated on things and this the practice of the pentad the

157
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:46,940
gladness pentad is to free the fixations of the Mind the fixations of the heart

158
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:53,040
so we're available ever available for What's Happening Now what's happening

159
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,680
next what's happening in this moment and if we're able to see the constant

160
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:08,160
arising and passing the constant things as they come to be then we live in a world that is is full

161
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:14,880
of potential full of possibilities that grow the less we fixate

162
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:22,980
the possibilities the potential of how we meet any situation becomes not only becomes can be more and

163
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:29,460
more creative and more and more varied it becomes a meeting reality with freedom

164
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:36,500
a fixation focusing on really tight this is how it is it has to be this way

165
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:41,520
is not a space where there's for freedom for freedom of the heart the openness

166
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,760
the availability the Readiness for something but if we see it oh this is not how

167
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:54,900
things are this is how it's coming to be then the the fascinating and Powerful

168
00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:03,060
question is given that's coming to be this way and again it's uh let's see and how we

169
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:10,760
can shape it how we can let it pick come something next be something else

170
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:16,859
how do we respond creatively how do we respond with newness to allow

171
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:21,960
things to keep unfolding in a good way to take everything that appears

172
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:29,220
as not a fixed thing but as a platform or means or a condition

173
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:34,619
for responding in a new way so if

174
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:42,060
so for example if someone offends you it's easy to get upset and angry

175
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:47,640
and then this person has offended me and that offense has become a thing ecstatic

176
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:53,220
but if rather we see it as a process an ongoing process

177
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:58,619
then we ask ourselves oh that was a that seems offensive that hurt

178
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:05,280
given the flow like the flow of water how do I now navigate in this to make it

179
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,640
better how do I navigate this to Res to understand it better to myself be better

180
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:16,740
with it and maybe respond to the person in a better way if I meet it with

181
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:22,140
resistance then I'm stuck maybe there's less flexibility

182
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:28,020
but if I meet it with something fluid then maybe something different can become and arise

183
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:34,140
so I I can't do this necessarily so well but I know people who will meet offense

184
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:39,599
with humor and it de-escalates it quickly it kind of changes the whole nature

185
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:45,660
I know people who will meet offense with curiosity what's really going on do I

186
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:54,000
lean into the person what's happening here for this person I know people who meet offense with

187
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,040
letting people know well that that's that's happening to you let me tell you

188
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:07,140
what's happening to me I feel hurt I feel afraid I feel concerned I feel

189
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:12,420
angry given what's happening and so we're kind of expressing talking

190
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:20,599
about what's happening in the moment as they come to be and so maybe saying wow

191
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:25,980
uh this is how it's come to be wow this is a difficult situation that's come to

192
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:32,099
be here given that that's what's come to be what's next for us

193
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:38,820
given that this was difficult to hear what you had to say um what should be next how do we go

194
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:44,400
forward from here so always this movement how do we go forward where's the dynamism where's the

195
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,859
movement that it's more difficult to happen if we're dwelling fixating on

196
00:39:49,859 --> 00:39:56,240
this is how it is so things as they come to be

197
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,800
in meditation can be a meditation becomes a dynamic

198
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:09,240
place of change everything is just coming into being Moment by moment we don't dwell anywhere

199
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,400
sometimes this isn't Buddhism is called non-dwelling awareness non-abiding

200
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,480
where we kind of float on the River of change and time be being the change

201
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:27,780
being the the changing flow of the present moment we become it

202
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:33,859
as opposed to think about it be something step apart from it

203
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:42,540
is this easy not necessarily but uh the um the ability to kind of be

204
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:47,960
in the flow of the dynamism of things coming into being

205
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:55,740
is built on a continuity of the gladness pentaton the teaching from last week

206
00:40:55,740 --> 00:41:01,859
so if we can't do this then we step back and we go back

207
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:08,820
to the beginning where practice is maybe we go all the way back to the place where we're fixated and suffering and

208
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:15,300
challenged and we hold that with kind non-reactive awareness

209
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:22,260
may be feeling glad that we have a practice to do so and then we with that gladness we can

210
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:29,400
engage in the practice of really trying to see more clearly being practicing more non-reactive awareness which maybe

211
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:35,400
brings the kind of warmth to it all that begins to bring some kind

212
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:42,240
of ease Tranquility maybe begins to thaw the iceberg of how we're Frozen in

213
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,839
some kind of concern or preoccupation and when the when the whole Iceberg has

214
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:55,619
melted then uh it's we're resting in this wonderful pond of water

215
00:41:55,619 --> 00:42:02,700
Lake of samadhi which from which we then can kind of be with the fluidity of the

216
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:07,800
water the changing nature of it meeting at the meeting meeting the

217
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:13,280
currents meeting the changes as they come to be as they flow

218
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:20,760
so this is one way of talking about the insight into impermanence

219
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:28,200
the Buddhist language he literally said insight into inconstancy how things are

220
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:35,400
in constant motion constant change and um and one of the purposes of this

221
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:42,720
deep Insight is to begin Letting Go begin resisting letting go to begin

222
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:50,520
Letting Go letting go of resistance letting go of clinging letting go of fixation now this is how things are

223
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:57,119
nothing is this is how the things are it's always this is part of a process of

224
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,460
change this is a part a part of a things coming into being

225
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:08,400
and when we see it that way then it may be easier

226
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:15,300
to be interested in given this how this is coming into being now

227
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:23,220
how do I participate in this for the greater good how do I step into this changing River

228
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:29,760
of phenomena and contribute to something really wholesome

229
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:36,960
valuable wonderful beneficial into the mix

230
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,300
our job is to let go

231
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:51,140
and contribute what is good let go of our clinging and flow along

232
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:58,940
letting the current be an expression of our goodness

233
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:06,900
so um this is the Insight insight pentad and

234
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:13,560
then as we start having this insight into change Shifting the orientation from things as they are to things as

235
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:18,720
they change as they come into being this has an impact there's a con there's

236
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:25,880
a con that's a condition for something to begin to thaw to change to move and that's a topic for tomorrow

237
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:31,740
the way that ins how we're affected by the deeper and deeper Insight that

238
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:39,740
comes from this practice so thank you very much and um

239
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:43,880
and I look forward to our time together tomorrow
