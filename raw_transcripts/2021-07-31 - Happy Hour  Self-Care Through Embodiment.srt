1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,200
so formally hello and welcome to this tradition rendition of happy

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,280
hour so for today's practice um

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,960
i'd like to bring in something that's thematic

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:25,439
and and also bring in some

5
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,119
buddhist practices into that so okay so what do i mean by that right so

6
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:38,879
so it's the it's the olympics as we all know and um

7
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,440
and uh i was quite touched by hearing learning that one of the

8
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,600
athletes simone biles who is a young [Music]

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,500
gymnast and if i heard correctly on the radio she's the most decorated

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:05,040
[Music] female gymnast

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:14,880
anyway so she decided to pull out and and not compete

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,920
for because of mental health and what i heard is that it's very

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,520
common for for gymnasts etc well not very common but you know the reason why they would

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,439
pull out of competition that the olympics at this at this stage usually is because of an injury

15
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,520
it's physical health it has never been mental health

16
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,200
um and her making that statement really that that courageous

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,520
statement of self-care um is so inspiring it's so inspiring

18
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,640
to really not just take care of our physical health but our mental health

19
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:04,399
um and of course we can imagine how much pressure an olympian like her would be under

20
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:11,840
and of course we all have pressures in our lives of different kinds so

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,360
so self-care self-care of course i mean we know this in many ways we already

22
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:25,360
know this as practitioners and yet it is wonderful to see it in the zeitgeist and i think olympics

23
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,879
being an international event that unifies all of humanity

24
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:38,000
to see an olympian at this level really take a step to take care of herself for mental

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,840
health is i just wanted to bring that in i wanted to bring that that theme in is worthy of our happy hour to

26
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,280
to give a nod to for all of us in this community for all

27
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:57,040
of us taking care of ourselves physically emotionally mentally

28
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,840
self-care self-care and not being ashamed of it there is no

29
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:12,480
shame in self-care there is no shame it's it's so important and it's actually an

30
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,920
act of courage it's really an act of strength and and you know we can see it perhaps for

31
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:24,560
simone biles you know and i see for her wow that's very courageous yay you go girl you know

32
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,799
pulling out for mental health wow what an act of strength right

33
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,959
i can see it for her you can see it for her i trust you i trust you can now see if you can see

34
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:43,040
it for yourself if it's possible for you to see it for yourself

35
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,760
you know if if there's a day you're just not it's so too stressed out it's just too

36
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,840
hard would you would you think of it oh no i'm going to push through i'm just going to push through and know

37
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,920
oh my mental health is not important enough i'm not sick i don't have an illness

38
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:09,200
do we not see it for ourselves do we appreciate it for others but not for ourselves

39
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:18,400
so that's one reflection i like to bring up for us too to sit with to sit with this happy hour

40
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:26,160
appreciation of self-care the courage the courage the courage of self-care

41
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,120
and the other theme i want to bring in is

42
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,840
one practice to offer ourselves self-care there are many ways to offer

43
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,240
self-care the practice of meta compassion presence

44
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:54,080
and the way to like i'd like to invite us to explore tonight is is one of um

45
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,639
holding presence holding presence in

46
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:07,840
a physical in the physical body so just as the buddha you know there is

47
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:14,080
the image of the buddha the the one of them the common images statues

48
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,000
or the mudras the the mudra this this hand movement of the buddha

49
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,880
touching the earth grounding himself ground pick himself

50
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:36,800
as if oops i think my computer just for

51
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,800
all right my computer just froze here we go so the mudra of of the buddha touching

52
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:53,360
the earth grounding it as earth may be my witness i am here i am

53
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,600
here i have the right to be here i am here so connecting with the earth the

54
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,280
sense of stability stability of the earth touching the

55
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,840
earth touching the earth with our bodies

56
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:18,319
and also feeling the solidity of the body the earth element

57
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,000
in the body throughout the body so that's another thing i like to bring in

58
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,120
because at times when the mind is going all over the place or

59
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:38,560
it's just very challenging this can be a support this can be a support this

60
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:46,720
is grounding oneself feeling sensations of the earth

61
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:53,680
grounded in the earth the earth element in the body throughout the body throughout the body

62
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:03,840
can be very grounding so i'll bring that in the invitations as we explore tonight

63
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:12,160
so so let us continue

64
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,160
up i hope my audio is still coming through

65
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,720
i feel coming through your image keeps getting frozen but as long as the audio is coming

66
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:31,919

68
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,599

landing in our bodies

70
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:13,840
landing in this moment

71
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:26,319
connecting with the felt sense of this body this body connected to the earth

72
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,160
by the earth touching the earth

73

rising up from the earth feeling our spine

74
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:55,839
this sense of integrity sitting upright

75
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,839
well rooted to the earth with our feet our legs

76
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:22,880

77
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,000
resting on the earth resting on the earth

78
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:37,839

earth on earth

80
00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:05,839
earth giving itself giving its weight to the earth

81
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:43,120
the whole body this body has earth element

82
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,839
parts of it solid

83
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,680
heavy resting on earth

84
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,839
feeling supported by the earth

85
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,320
as if we have an image of this body sitting this whole body

86
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:34,079
turning the gaze of our awareness internally all throughout the body

87
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:44,560
feet set bones abdomen chest

88
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:57,839
arms and hands neck and shoulders face

89
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:11,839
our own time feeling the settledness the solidity

90
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:25,839
it'd be such a sense of comfort coming home to the body

91
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:35,040
especially be stabilizing

92
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,639
calming soothing to the heart to the mind

93
00:12:50,079 --> 00:13:07,839
feeling this comforting solidity in our bones

94
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:21,839
the touch points

95
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:37,040
even places in the body where it feels empty vacuous

96
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,600
see if you can feel the sensations

97
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:52,560
solidity of the earth element and if it's hard feel the solidity of the areas

98
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,800
surrounding this part of the body

99
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:17,839
as if supporting saying it's okay it's okay you're supported

100
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,279
whatever tenderness there is the heart and the mind and the body can

101
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:32,080
be supported with the stability the solidity

elsewhere in the body wherever accessible the touch points

104
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:57,519
maybe the whole body is a whole block if you're looking at yourself

105
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:09,839

rising up

108
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:44,320
if you've never tried this it would be helpful especially if you're stepping out of

109
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:54,399
yourself for a moment and have an image of this entire body and stepping back

110
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,720
stepping back into solidity the whole body

111

ourselves physically emotionally mentally

124
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,799

to connect and care make space

126

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,880
thank you all

166
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,280
so we explored the theme to begin this

167
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:54,560
theme of self-care with not just physical care but mental

168
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:03,200
mental suffering mental health and then one way one way to actually

169
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:09,440
express that bring or bring stability sense of care holding

170
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:16,000
is through this practice of the solidity of the body

171
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:23,040
grounding the body the earth element and both from my teaching and practice i

172
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:28,320
found i found this to be so important have you noticed that sometimes if

173
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,680
there's a lot of mental distress mental um

174
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:40,480
unhappiness agitation you know the body feels as if it it contains smoke as if the

175
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,160
body is just you know there's no solidity in the body

176
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,599
as a human have experienced that and i've also experienced and witnessed that for

177
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:59,920
many practitioners especially if they're in very difficult mental states so bringing this this

178
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:07,040
embodiment sense of grounding in the body with the solidity earth earth on earth the buddha sitting

179
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,440
on earth touching the earth so that's one aspect that's so important

180
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,200
just the sense of meta care feeling the body the whole body the whole body

181
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:26,319
solidity a brightness support the calming soothing lovingness in that

182
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:33,520
the scent and something magical nurse in the sense of touch

183
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:40,560
in the sense of touch you know again as as little babies newborns

184
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,960
when they're cuddled they they calm down they there's the sense of

185
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,319
oh they when there's pressure in their joints when they feel the solidity right

186
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:58,319
when they're held tight oh they calm down they calm down they feel the sense of

187
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:03,680
love and care and for us it's similar so touching ourselves touching our heart

188
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,880
center with our hand holding ourselves or just mentally

189
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,000
mentally touching ourselves all sense of solidity throughout the body

190
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:22,000
is both can bring up a sense of stability as well as sense of care meta

191
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,800
it's there's so much here there's so much both science here as well as as

192
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,720
practice of of us experiencing on our own oh yeah i feel more stable more

193
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:39,760
supported ah earth on earth

194

210
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:41,839
and someone on the phone please

211
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:48,960
hi everyone this is melanie i usually join on video but i decided to call in by a phone today um i've been thinking a

212
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,000
lot about simone biles in life watching the olympic olympics and gymnastic really closely

213
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,760
and um for those of you who follow it more closely simone actually said that she withdrew because

214
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:07,119
she got what's in gymnastics is called the twisties which is like when you basically lose sense of where you are in the air

215
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:14,800
and it's like so incredibly dangerous for gymnasts because they can like land on their head like they don't know where they are um and so i thought

216
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,960
that was just so relevant to this practice like this idea that she withdrew because she had like lost sense of where

217
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:27,839
she was and she needed to like reconnect her mind with her body and and how much that connects to meditation

218
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:34,400
and just having that awareness of like oh my mind and my body are are too separated right now i need to

219
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:41,680
like you know withdraw and focus on myself and bring them back together so i i really admire her and i think it

220
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:49,520
is just like so related to this practice yes thank you so much melinda for adding

221
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:55,599
this detailed nuanced detail and oh my goodness i i got chills as you

222
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,720
were describing the the connection which i hadn't heard

223
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:07,680
of yes connecting knowing connecting to her body which is what we did tonight inspired by her

224
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:14,720
beautiful thank you so much for bringing this nuance and i'm i'm touched and so heartened

225
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,838
thank you for that comment trevor please

226
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:28,560
yeah hey um before i joined tonight i just got into a huge

227
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:33,920
blowout with um with my family you know like it rarely

228
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:41,599
happens in that manner my dad has stage four cancer and he's potentially one of the most

229
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:47,200
difficult people to deal with in terms of just uh

230
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:54,319
not in touch with himself at all and and just um not willing to just very stubborn very

231
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:59,359
old school stubborn and um

232
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:07,520
even before the blowout i had just been talking with a friend about how i have to have that sense of equanimity and do my

233
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:12,880
best to take care of myself and know what that means and what that

234
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:20,000
looks like to practice that and um and to uh to give

235
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,359
to his treatment and and and love for him what he needs

236
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:33,680
without any expectations and that's a very difficult thing to do with a very difficult person

237
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:42,880
and just feeling the the intense [Music] just real bodily discomfort and uh

238
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,160
almost pain that that comes with that kind of level of blow out so

239
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:53,760
um yeah just uh just thank you for having these every every night even

243

holding you with care compassion as you hold yourself with with the stability with the

245
