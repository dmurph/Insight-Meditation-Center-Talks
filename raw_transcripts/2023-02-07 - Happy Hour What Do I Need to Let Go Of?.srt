ah arriving in this moment

26
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:54,300
arriving arriving together the sense of collecting Gathering

27
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,519
sometimes we feel perhaps that we've been scattered with

28
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,900
the demands or thoughts our priorities

29
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:16,620
our hearts scattered now we collect we collect we collect ourselves We

30
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:24,019
Gather ourselves as we gather together we also gather ourselves

31
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:32,239
which is another way to consider the practice of concentration or somebody

32
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:38,220
samadi or samata practice Gathering we collect ourselves We Gather ourselves

33
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:44,040
lovingly come sweetie come become whole become

34
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,580

scattered bring him together ah

36
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,080
I'm bringing our attention

37
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:11,060
this breath to this body sense of Integrity wholeness

38
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:19,680
there might be demands on our attention and our emotions we say yes we know we

39
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,440
know and it's okay we're not going to abandon you we're

40
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,780
just going to nourish ourselves for a moment for a few moments with

41
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:38,400
Silence with the breath with presence so that we have more stability to

42
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,160
include it all so with that attitude of openness

43
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,880
spaciousness

44
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,840
coming to ourselves coming holy to ourselves

45
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:16,740
connecting with the breath sensations of the breath in the body not

46
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:24,560
the idea of it perceiving the breath in the abdomen

47
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:33,199
feeling the sensations quite amazing

48
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,539
feel like a lullaby these Sensations

49
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:36,000
and if thoughts arise not bad there's anything wrong with thinking but for now we say no thank you

50
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,560
please come back later hearing Primacy to what's important

51
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,080
right now what is important right now

52
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,978
In This Moment

53
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,500

54
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:05,099

just this breath

58
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:01,500
just this can we give Primacy

59
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:09,800
and we make this the most important priority right now just this

60
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,240
Justice really grocking

61
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:21,080
this is the most important Act

62
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:26,220
this dedication in this moment of her heart to this practice our attention

63
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:31,560
Gathering our attention is the most important thing can we really get it

64
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:38,339
can we really align with this of thinking about this or that or planning or

65
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:44,100
chest let go just this

66
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,139
just letting yourself be breathed

67
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,399
just be awake in this moment

68
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,220
it's passing moment

69
00:12:54,300 --> 00:13:00,540
can we nourish our hearts ourselves can we be kind to ourselves

70
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:10,040
by just attending to one thing the Simplicity of being not doing

71
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:14,040
Thomas Merton celebrated Trappist Monk

72
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:22,579
share his words let them wash over you while you're in a meditative state

73
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:42,380
the rush and pressure of Modern Life are a form

74
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:47,300
perhaps the most common form

75
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:55,199
of of its innate violence

76
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,639
the pervasive form of contemporary violence

77
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:10,199
to allow oneself to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns

78
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:16,500
to surrender too many demands

79
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,720
amid oneself to too many projects

80
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:29,300
we want to help everyone and everything is to succumb to violence

81
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,160
and we in this moment not succumb to this inner form of

82
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:53,279
what he calls violence pulled this way in that all the demands be just

83
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:59,000
getting a sense of what is the most important what is

84
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:04,339
and sitting sitting Landing

85
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:12,558
wholeheartedly in the most important thing

86
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:19,740
and a descend in Buddhism the most important thing is to know what is the most important

87
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:26,400
thing saying from Zen to rest

88
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:34,519
rest to rest and the most important thing right now not running this way or that

89
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:49,940
as a sense of Meta Care service to yourself and others

90
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,140
what is the most important thing in this moment just drop it into

91
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,900
your body to your heart not into your head

92
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:27,360
maybe nothing will come up it's okay sit and breathe with this question

93
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,919
let it gather you calm you settle you

94
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,700
can you imagine for a moment conjure up connect with what is the most

95
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:11,240
important priority in your life right now what value

96
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:17,580
what act what service and connect with that sit with that rest

97
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:24,620
with that so if you're sitting in a warm bath

98
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,460
at this aspiration support you and golf you no distraction

99
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:41,658
just one thing just one thing just this breathe with it

100
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:24,059
as an aspect of as an expression of meta to yourself

101
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:32,840
what do you need to release say no say no to so that you can

102
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:38,460
be aligned with what is the most important thing

103
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:44,580
in this moment in your life and not to think about it but drop it in

104
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:47,960
as a reflection

105
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,980
let yourself just breathe with this question but do I need to let go

106
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,820
say no to

107
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:15,320
don't think about it just be breathed

108
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,380
the answers will find you you don't have to go find them

109
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:42,799
and you need to let go of In This Moment it's thinking just let yourself be breathed

110
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,158
simple

111
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:41,580
and as we turn towards the end of this sitting let go of many self-judgment if it's

112
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:47,520
arising or has arisen not needed not needed

113
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:54,840
let go it's one thing you need to let go of right now any self-criticism you've done your best

114
00:31:54,840 --> 00:32:01,880

125
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:27,960
thanks everyone thanks for your practice thickness of your practice so

126
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:34,919
the aim I wanted to think in and I brought in for us to contemplate to consider is

127
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:40,320
is as I read the quote um by Thomas Merton which I'm sure Neil

128
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:47,340
will find later about the violence of our times and and send it to the mailing list later

129
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:53,039
um it's really about being distracted and pulled in this and that did and the

130
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:58,919
other and what do we need to let go out of care out of love out of mitta for

131
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:04,740
ourselves and others not to be pulled in so many ways and what do we need to let

132
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:09,780
go of in our lives and not and what about this moment and what is the most

133
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:17,240
important thing what is the most important can we just sit in that can we sit in our highest value our highest

134
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:24,118
intention and just let it sink and open our hearts we can just become beautiful

135
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:31,138
and and accomplished a Divine Compass yes this is what I intend to

136
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:36,300
to engage with I'm intended to be engaging with in this in this life so

137
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:43,440
that's the invitation that was the invitation as much as it showed up or didn't it's fine let go of any

138
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,800
self-judgment the audio is available for listening later as well

139
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:57,180
so now engaging in small groups can be quite inspiring what and the inquiries

140
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:02,700
what are you what I would do what should you let go of why should you let go of

141
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:08,460
what do you what what is appropriate for you to let go of uh in this moment what

142
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:16,560
is appropriate for you to let go of in your life and so what is appropriate and again your responses as you as you uh

143
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:23,040
come together and share and hold each other can be inspiring can be supportive

144
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,380
you're not the only one who needs to let go I need to let go of business I'm

145
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:34,500
saying yes to too many things um so all of us it's it's right it's a

146
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,140
good um reflection for all of us

147
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:48,060
and um so that's the invitation what is and and what what what is appropriate to let

148
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:55,440
go of right now and the question the answer might be I don't know I'm just sitting with that I don't know what's appropriate to let go of maybe I engage

149
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,619
too much with other I try to take care of others too much or whatever it might be just

150
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:07,079
exploring and then the the other inquiry question that you can reflect on

151
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:12,900
together might be what is the most important thing what is the most important thing do I know what that is

152
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:19,980
and maybe you do maybe you don't you don't have to share it if you don't want to just if you wanted to that could be

153
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:26,280
another exploration so two questions what to let go of and what is the most important thing again

154
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:33,599
you can choose to engage with one uh or both uh in in any way so

155
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,820
so I'm going to create the the groups as

156
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:44,220
always please take care of yourselves take care of each other and each person

157
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:50,280
can just share from their own experience um

158
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:55,500
and um and just sharing from your own Express not asking others questions not

one of you says we shared having anxiety about social interactions yeah

185
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:39,140
thanks for sharing that one says cultivating kindness letting go of worry and concern for the future

186
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:44,160
requires courage yes absolutely yeah

187
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:50,099
and bill says I thought this meditation was

188
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:56,280
very inspiring apparently Diana's waving her hand but I don't see you guys because I only see a small strip so it

189
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:03,480
will be Adelia and then Diane if you can find a way to raise your Zoom hand that way I can actually see you Adelia please

190
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:11,099
hello um as I practice more I am beginning to

191
00:49:11,099 --> 00:49:18,300
question or maybe even some of them are slipping away some of the motivations

192
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:25,980
in my life and what I'm pursuing um and at the moment it's disorienting

193
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:33,000
you know I'm not quite sure it's very uncertain and I'm not quite sure how to structure my life or what to

194
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:39,420
pursue anymore but so that question of what to let go resonates and it feels like some of it

195
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:47,280
will just go naturally yeah yeah thanks for sharing that and

196
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:53,520
and speaking really from a an honest truthful place of this is what it feels

197
00:49:53,520 --> 00:50:01,800
like when I'm letting go of what doesn't really resonate anymore there is um an unsettledness of what now what

198
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:07,920
what is um important what next what what and and

199
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,140
beautiful stay stay there because that place of unsettledness that place of the

200
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:20,460
don't know mind that place of okay I'm letting go of it doesn't quite serve me anymore but I'm not quite Landing

201
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:27,540
elsewhere yet it's perfectly fine it's the it's the Bardo it's like you know you've you've you know this image of

202
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:33,000
Runners when they've leapt right they've taken a leap they're not on land anymore

203
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,640
like they're in mid-air and mid-air actually if you open up like wait we

204
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:44,400
have where am I but but trust the momentum trust the momentum and and that

205
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:50,819
is a rich place to be one can see it as unsettling but one can

206
00:50:50,819 --> 00:50:58,559
actually see it as a place of possibility you've left safe land that didn't serve you anymore

207
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:04,800
so yes you're opening up the possibility celebrating that thank you for sharing

208
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:11,160

last reflection well I just want to thank you this may

210
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:25,200
be repetitive but I I love the Simplicity of this meditation and the uh

211
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:32,700
um the questions and especially not knowing I don't know and um

212
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:38,220
and it's okay to not know and and um not needing an answer the answers

213
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:43,260
will come this is something that's so pretty that I can really work with on a

214
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:48,420
daily basis so yeah um especially if you're feeling unsettled I

215
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:55,980
just recently like today something's left me and I've been thinking what's going on here where'd that go what what

216
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:04,020
happened to it so we can be right in the middle of all kinds of processes yeah out thank you beautiful thank you so

217
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:10,260
much Diana yeah thank you it's just working with all of that so I'll share a couple of things that have come to me in

218
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:16,940
chat to um one person has said reminding myself I'm only human and doing my best

219
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:23,700
self-compassion beautiful yay um one more person says my group reminded

220
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:29,460
me we must let go of the past and what's most important is to know

221
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:36,059
that everything is temporary this made me feel grateful to be sharing in conversation with my group since that

222
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:42,540
too is temporary and the last and uh let's see one more

223
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:47,819
I see all that when will the recording be available it

224
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:54,740

225
00:52:54,740 --> 00:53:02,760

226
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:08,220
um yeah I think that's it and how to let go

227
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:14,760
of The Cloud of Unknowing well you don't want to let go of The Cloud of Unknowing you want to embrace

228
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:21,119
The Cloud of Unknowing that's where it's really yeah you want to be in the cloud about knowing that's actually where it's

229
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:27,420
juicy that's where the certainties were like oh you just we we we're the know it

230
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:33,000
all but The Cloud of Unknowing that don't know why and actually maybe I'll do a session on the donut mind
