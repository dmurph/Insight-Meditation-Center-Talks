1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,279
so this has been a week

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,599
of emphasizing the role of imagination

3
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,679
in buddhist practice and it's not

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,480
something that i'm making up by my own

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:19,039
that

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,520
the buddha himself in one way or the

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,680
other in a variety of ways

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,439
used imagination and evoked the

9
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,320
imaginary powers of people

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,160
when they engaged in this practice

11
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,440
and as the practice deepens there

12
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,480
is born a

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,000
capacity for a particular capacity for

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,559
imagination which in english we could

15
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,280
call maybe

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,719
vision and

17
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,160
and to have a vision of a possibility

18
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,079
and it's a vision that can seem very

19
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,920
clear and tangible and

20
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,440
immediate and maybe it even is

21
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,600
in a certain kind of way it's not

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,559
something which

23
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,240
is it physically tangible or physically

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,000
seen but with the mind's eye and

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,400
buddhism awakening is opening them

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,280
the eye of the dharma the eye that can

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,400
see

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,240
and have a vision of the potential for

29
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,600
freedom

30
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,720
or can see freedom

31
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,439
can see the peace and the freedom of the

32
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,119
mind

33
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,320
that's there to some degree and then has

34
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,520
a vision

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,880
for it becoming complete vision of it

36
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,200
expanding a vision of it touching the

37
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,079
places

38
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,200
where we're not yet free and this idea

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,960
of becoming a visionary using the

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,240
imagination

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,119
to to know a possibility that um

42
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,560
it's not it's not a fantasy it's based

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,399
on something real

44
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,880
but it's imagining the fulfillment of

45
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,240
that

46
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,640
so for example if i hold my hand in a

47
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,119
tight fist

48
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,599
i could release one finger and hold the

49
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,520
other fingers tight

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,560
and then um but then oh i think you know

51
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,080
it's possible now

52
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,360
i have a vision i see the potential

53
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,120
of opening the whole hand up and

54
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,360
relaxing it

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,760
and so it's a kind of a kind of an

56
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,440
imagination a vision of

57
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,120
a potential and it said sometimes in

58
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,879
buddhism that with the

59
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,760
that awakening is an act of vision a

60
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,560
seeing

61
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,280
or it awakens vision it awakens the

62
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,720
imagination

63
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,440
of something that's possible that then

64
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,920
becomes

65
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,599
the direction we go or the or what we

66
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:50,319
kind of

67
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,480
wholeheartedly put our life energy into

68
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,080
like this is important this

69
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,920
is valuable to live this way

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,000
and it doesn't mean we have to leave the

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,840
our world behind the regular world

72
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,120
behind

73
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,239
but rather when the clear enough vision

74
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,480
of the potential or what awakening is as

75
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,800
freedom of clinging is

76
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,480
we realize that it can be the foundation

77
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,080
for how we live our life

78
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,959
or the all income inc all-encompassing

79
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:19,760
uh

80
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,120
container or or approach for

81
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,000
everything we do so it isn't so much

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,599
that we have to

83
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,360
leave our life uh and it's

84
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,920
but it's rather it's to vision that it's

85
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,440
possible to live our life

86
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,040
freely and to wholeheartedly

87
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,760
enter our life with that as a guiding

88
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,720
principle

89
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,080
and this is a radical thing

90
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,920
and so um so it's not a compromising our

91
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,360
life necessarily but it's

92
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,080
bringing what's best in life freedom and

93
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,239
peace and compassion

94
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,840
as the container as the context as a

95
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,720
foundation so a vision

96
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,840
that's possible and then a decision even

97
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,200
a commitment

98
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,000
a vow this is how i want to live my life

99
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,560
so uh so all these things i've been

100
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,560
talking about this week have to do with

101
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,920
imagination

102
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,239
and imagination can be both

103
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:24,160
harmful can be debilitating

104
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,360
and it could be forward leading opening

105
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,160
they can help us grow and develop and to

106
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,560
be able to see those two apart is very

107
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,759
important

108
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,360
a few things about the word that the

109
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,600
buddha used words he used that i'm

110
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,840
translating as imagination

111
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,479
one of them is manyati and

112
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,919
the uh and that

113
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,120
is usually uh used for

114
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,639
acts of imagination which are

115
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,840
not helpful in fact bekabodi the great

116
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,040
translator

117
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,400
sometimes translates this word as

118
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,199
misconceived there's no

119
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,680
negative prefix in the word but it's

120
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,360
used in such a kind of

121
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,840
negative way in the suttas that it's

122
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,280
often you know can be

123
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,520
to misimagine or bad in that poor

124
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,120
imagination

125
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,919
and so at jackal the buddha used the

126
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:18,960
word the word

127
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,560
for a jackal that imagines itself

128
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,919
to be a lion

129
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,039
and uh and so you know

130
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,400
it's a misconceived oneself as a lion

131
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,560
the um

132
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,400
um so one of the very interesting places

133
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,600
where this word

134
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,160
um one imagines which has negative

135
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:44,960
connotations

136
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,000
is manyati uh it has to do with uh

137
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,080
identification

138
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,560
and uh there's a plenty of places in the

139
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,320
sutures where buddha emphatically talks

140
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,280
about

141
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,360
um the pro the problems people have

142
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,400
when they imagine and they

143
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,960
imagine an identity for themselves that

144
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,000
they are something

145
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,360
in relationship to other things so

146
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,560
imagining that they

147
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,440
are the same as the universe so the same

148
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,160
as the world

149
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,560
imagining that they are in the world

150
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,720
imagine the world is in them

151
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,479
imagining that they are distinct from

152
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,479
the world

153
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,039
and he uses this word manyati imagine

154
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,639
and if you really understand that and

155
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,199
it's often translated as conceive

156
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,440
which has some idea doesn't quite

157
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,240
capture the idea of imagination

158
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,240
and so rather than talking about the

159
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,919
self and identity that who i

160
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,080
am i'm this i'm that as a belief

161
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,960
which gets into philosophy and all that

162
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,319
the buddha is using the word

163
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,160
imagine and so it's not a philosophical

164
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,960
issue

165
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,319
but it's an issue of what we're doing

166
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,080
with our imagination

167
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,919
what are we constructing what are we

168
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,240
fantasizing about

169
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,280
and many of the problems around self

170
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,639
are not about truly exactly

171
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,599
what we are as a self whatever that is

172
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,400
but rather

173
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,560
how we imagine ourselves to be and uh

174
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,000
and then we have a whole different

175
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,400
understanding of this kind of

176
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,599
not self teaching there's a deci

177
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,199
for example there's a very common phrase

178
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,479
important to me myself and mine that's

179
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,759
used in the sutures

180
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,840
it's a little bit of mistranslation the

181
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,800
order of it but

182
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,840
but basically the same

183
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,039
and um and uh imagining that um

184
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,160
something is mine imagining that i i

185
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,360
have an identity

186
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,400
imagining there is a essential self the

187
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,039
buddha uses the word imagine

188
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,120
it doesn't say one believes in me myself

189
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,639
and mine

190
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,639
but one is something that we're

191
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,720
construing we're constructing we're

192
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,160
imagining

193
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,199
happening and so

194
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,599
uh part of meditation practice then is

195
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,000
to quiet and calm

196
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,720
this excessive over-imagination false

197
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,919
imagination misconstruing we do

198
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,440
and it's not questioning or or or

199
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,440
challenging any kind of philosophical

200
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,560
view

201
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,599
of self me myself and mine in these

202
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,280
particular teachings

203
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,560
and so we don't have to get involved

204
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,319
philosophically is there is there not a

205
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,440
self

206
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,200
where we get involved in meditation

207
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,680
practice is to

208
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,800
clarify let go of quiet

209
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,719
the imaginings that are occurring

210
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,360
and and so

211
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,160
so that's kind of manyati this imagining

212
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,760
is usually negative

213
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,760
the word that's more positive for

214
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,120
imagination

215
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,959
is has the word anupasati in it

216
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,120
and that's one of the central words for

217
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,480
mindfulness practice

218
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,240
it means in mindfulness practice to

219
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,519
observe

220
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,720
to see but it has the the prefix sum in

221
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,440
front of it so

222
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,800
some anupasati and

223
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,360
the context in which it's used in the

224
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,640
buddhas

225
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,200
is to we can understand it to be

226
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,560
imagination

227
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,440
of maybe of the form of visualization

228
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,640
so uh so the the similes of the

229
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,160
hindrances i taught free of the

230
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,720
hindrances i talked about a few days ago

231
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,959
to the buddha says visualizing oneself

232
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,480
as um no longer sick

233
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,360
visualizing oneself is no longer in debt

234
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,200
visualizing himself were no longer

235
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,200
enslaved um and so that visualizing has

236
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,240
a kind of richer

237
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,839
feeling sometimes in imagination and

238
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,080
and it touches into something deeper it

239
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,839
touches into something

240
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,800
more emotional more embodied more

241
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,000
tangible maybe in the mind's eye

242
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,760
it kind of helps us to fill out

243
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,680
something

244
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,920
and and that is i think one of the

245
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,959
functions

246
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,839
of two functions of this imagination or

247
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,680
visualization the buddha talks about

248
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,640
uses in practice

249
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,399
one is to give us a visceral kind of

250
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,320
embodied maybe

251
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,200
feeling or sense sense of what he's

252
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,160
talking about

253
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,360
that's not just uh explanations it's

254
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,920
you know more like poetry or something

255
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,680
that's evocative

256
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,360
and something that opens up and it

257
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,959
touches into

258
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,959
more dimensions of our life than just

259
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,000
words

260
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,320
it touches touches into our emotional

261
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,360
being

262
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,040
our kinesthetic being some of the

263
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,480
imagery imagery

264
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,519
are in action and movement flowing water

265
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,000
and now the the person working the lathe

266
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,279
or needing the

267
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,880
the water into the into the powder

268
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,399
and also it's um touches into memory

269
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,959
and associations we have with these

270
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,360
things and

271
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,959
and our capacity for imagination our

272
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,240
capacity for thought and thinking and so

273
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,360
we have here this movement support

274
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,240
in imagination this movement of becoming

275
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,839
unified

276
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,920
which means gathering together all our

277
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,320
different functions as human being

278
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,839
so that we're focused and present here

279
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,160
for the practice of meditation we're not

280
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,000
fragmented we're not divided

281
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,600
and we're not leaving any part of

282
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,320
ourselves out rather gathering together

283
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,880
all of ourselves to center and be here

284
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,560
and that we'll see we'll continue now

285
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,320
with the steps of anapanasati

286
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,600
on monday going on with

287
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,800
steps seven and eight and this

288
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
continues this process of gathering

289
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,760
together and settling and unifying

290
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,920
and we're supporting also the process of

291
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,560
also once the imagination has functioned

292
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,760
in useful way

293
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,720
to help that to settle as well not to

294
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,000
hold on to that

295
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,519
but to go to deeper states of

296
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,360
unification and calm

297
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,720
that at some point imagination

298
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,000
you know is no longer supportive for

299
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,760
so we'll start going into more deeply

300
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,000
into the mind next week

301
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,200
and and then we will

302
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,200
go on from there and

303
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,040
so thank you very very much and

304
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,040
uh someone asked yesterday i saw on the

305
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,680
chat at the end that they wanted to

306
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,480
see the the you know the

307
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,120
written form of the similes for the

308
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,480
for janna's and um and i said i would do

309
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,360
it and i

310
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,920
i still will do at some point and also i

311
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:58,959
can also maybe

312
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,920
uh post uh my translation of this

313
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,399
16 steps that we're going through and

314
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:07,920
once i've posted it i'll let you know

315
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,959
where it is and

316
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,240
hopefully i'll have time to do it over

317
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,240
the weekend

318
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,880
so thank you all very much and look

319
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:21,360
forward to our next time together
