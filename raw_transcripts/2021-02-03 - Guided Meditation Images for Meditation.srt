1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,639
so welcome

2
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,320
and a warm hello to all of you and uh

3
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:33,120
sometimes when seeing all the locations where people are sending in their greetings on the chat

4
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,800
i have a kind of very kind of vague imagination of

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,520
having a globe in front of me and having lines drawn between all the places that are

6
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:53,520
named and take into account all the places that are not named and it would be quite a net quite a

7
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,320
a interconnected net of community of people with similar

8
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,560
interests sitting here to meditate and doing a practice which i believe brings

9
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,840
out the best in people and so it's a wonderful act of

10
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,240
imagination and and that is the topic for this week

11
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:25,759
the ways in which imagination can support meditation rather than detract from it

12
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:32,960
a certain kind of way if we don't use our imagination then we get used by it but

13
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,439
and but it's not just our own imagination we get used by but there's a lot of people who

14
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,280
are trying to hijack our imagination or plant images and ideas in our mind

15
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,880
advertisers politicians you know all people who are providing us

16
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,040
with imagination imaginary scenarios that sometimes are done very cleverly to really kind of penetrate

17
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,560
deep inside of us and then they remain and and we're used by them or influenced

18
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:11,280
by them and it's also possible to use our imagination creatively or

19
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,440
and use it for the purpose of meditation and it takes wisdom to do that takes

20
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:25,520
skill to do it in a way that's actually supports the mind to wake up to be present to become stable

21
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,680
and and then at different levels of stability of stillness different forms of imagination might

22
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,200
come into play so that if you hear different instructions for imagination

23
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,840
some of them might not work for you because either because you don't have a reference point for them or because

24
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,319
they belong to different degree of stability either than you have

25
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,000
maybe less or more something but the buddha certainly

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,280
was his teachings are filled with what could be called images of the imagination images of

27
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,800
similes ideas and a basic one for meditation

28
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,280
is um the idea of sitting with the sitting as stable as

29
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,280
the earth or sitting as firm as a pillar

30
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:31,440
that it's planted deep in the ground so it's not going to wobble at all or being as calm as a surface of a still

31
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,159
lake and there's it goes on and on these kinds of uh images that buddha uses

32
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,440
which are tapping into the imagination and i'll say this later but part of the

33
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,920
purpose of this tapping into the imagination is because the imagination itself is

34
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,120
tapped into so many different aspects of our inner life the to our emotional life

35
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:03,040
for physical life kinesthetic life to our motivational life to

36
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:09,840
to our thoughts and memories and things and so imagination somehow has a

37
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:17,199
capacity to contribute to the unification the integration that is samadhi as we're getting more

38
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,440
present and more collected in meditation the process of meditation is a process of collectedness

39
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,960
or unification or some people like to use language of becoming whole

40
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:34,080
and imagination can be in the service of that because of what it evokes within us

41
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,919
it's certainly not true for everyone and everyone if people have different ranges of

42
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,320
relationship with imagination but for this week we're looking at the

43
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,199
building on the buddha's use of imagination in order to cultivate stability

44
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,120
but also presence but also gladness to have gladness or a certain degree of

45
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:06,880
joy in meditation so to take an upright

46
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:15,039
meditation posture and to adjust your posture

47
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,680
so it begins to feel stable

48
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:28,479
one of the advantages of sitting cross-legged is the stability of the legs and the buttocks on the on your cushion a

49
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,600
broad wide foundation anything that supports you the weight of

50
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,960
your body can provide a foundation of stability

51
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,479
and to imagine this body that you're sitting in is here like

52
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,840
a mountain

53
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,440
stable strong

54
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:07,840
unfazed by the wind that flows by or the clouds that wash over

55
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:30,000
imagining that the mind is like a clear quiet lake calm wind not blowing

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,840
water still and the mind is broad and wide

57
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,360
like the wide broad lake

58
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,560
and imagining the moon the heart is like a full moon

59
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:59,198
fully exposed fully open fully here

60
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:17,840
the heart shines its light peacefully on all things

61
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:27,440
and then the buddha uses an image for tuning into the breathing that one

62
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:34,960
tunes into breathing like a woodworker does on a on a with a chisel

63
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:43,840
on a lathe carving a piece of wood or maybe we would say a potter

64
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:52,240
turning clay on a wheel and to make this contact

65
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:59,840
with something which is moving around in a circle the cycles of in-breath and out-breath

66
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,120
and this image of a someone working a lathe or working

67
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:14,879
clay on a wheel is partly an image of making contact and

68
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,319
keeping the contact there

69
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,319
so to take a gently with his contact with the body breathing

70
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:41,839
taking a few long slow deep breaths

71
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,360
and as you exhale maybe like a dam which has opened its doors so water

72
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:20,000
can flow out to relax your body

73
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:30,800
so there can be a flow of vitality flow of ease calmness from the places where you relax

74
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,839
to relaxing the shoulders

75
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:51,839
relaxing the arms and the elbows hands

76
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:05,839
relaxing the chest the belly

77
00:10:49,200 --> 00:11:01,839
and breathing easily maybe naturally

78
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,240
as if the piece of clay now has become smooth and round

79
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,959
bowl and the wheel and it just feels light and smooth and

80
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,959
easy to allow the turning of breathing in

81
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,839
and breathing out

82
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:51,760
your whole body is the bowl awareness is feeling

83
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:58,800
as you breathe breathing in and breathing out

84
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:11,839
that kind of intimacy with the body breathing

85
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:50,639
and as you're sitting here bring to mind

86
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:58,480
gently quietly whatever sense of goodness or

87
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,320
gladness that comes from the simplicity of being here

88
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:12,959
meditating where you're somehow what's absent

89
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,839
is the busyness of the day

90
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,199
what's absence is the challenges of the

91
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,480
day the crowds of people

92
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:45,839
driving in traffic

93
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,560
and if you can stay quietly focused on the breathing

94
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:08,000
and not giving in to thoughts of desire thoughts of ill will

95
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:17,120
thoughts of anxiety and regrets thoughts of doubt

96
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:31,279
this begins to feel like similar to being free of

97
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:37,279
debt or free of an illness

98
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,720
free of oppression

99
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,880
free of being lost in thought

100
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:59,600
and these ideas of this freedom from these things for the buddha is meant to be a source

101
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:09,440
of gladness to take a few moments to appreciate

102
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:17,920
what is not here right now that feels good to have put aside

103
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:25,440
and which gives you an intimacy and a peacefulness even if it's mildly so

104
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,600
with here and now and being present

105
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:38,720
feeling the goodness of this maybe being glad to have these moments

106
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:51,839
to be free of these things

107
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
so

108
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,720
perhaps making a small half smile

109
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,720
that maybe supports a gladness or a contentment

110
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:56,880
that's willing to be just here in whatever goodness whatever

111
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:03,840
pleasure or contentment that is available

112
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:14,840
as you turn the wheel of breathing in and breathing

113
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:23,200
out in a sense smoothing out the bowl of

114
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:31,840
your body the bowl of clay on the wheel

115
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:11,840
with the image of a mountain feeling whatever stability is here in

116
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:19,840
your body resting in that stability as if you're a

117
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,840
mountain

118
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:41,679
as if your mind is a broad peaceful lake

119
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,240
feel whatever ways the mind might be that way

120
00:26:48,240 --> 00:27:07,840
broad and still even if there are some waves on it

121
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:17,600
and then whatever way the heart feels like a full moon

122
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:24,640
exposed open floating in the air in the sky in space

123
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:35,840
feel that luminosity and freedom of the heart

124
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:05,919
and they're breathing like a gentle breeze

125
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:17,840
that blows here and there through the body through the mind through the heart

126
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:31,840
connecting you to stability and stillness

127
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:45,840
in freedom of the heart

128
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:56,320
and staying centered here in this mountain-like body

129
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,039
still mind an open heart

130
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,960
open the awareness up out into the world

131
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:15,919
as if the stability spreads out from the place you're sitting out across the

132
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,120
surface of the lands

133
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:27,919
as if a peaceful stillness spreads from your mind out across the

134
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:37,039
air and across the seas

135
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:42,559
and as if the freedom and luminosity of the full moon heart

136
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:52,398
shines all over the globe and you

137
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:58,960
for a few moments undisturbed by the suffering of the world

138
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:07,679
but in this undisturbed way perhaps you can tap into a heartfelt

139
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:19,840
wish of compassion care wish for the welfare of all beings

140
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,600
may all beings be happy

141
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,919
may all beings be free of suffering

142
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:46,320
may all beings be safe from all forms of harm

143
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,360
physical mental emotional

144
00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:01,840
may all beings be peaceful

145
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:08,559
sharing as we share our peacefulness with them

146
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,840
and may all beings be free

147
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:23,440
as we do not limit them box them in with our ideas and

148
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,840
desires expectations

149
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,679
may the benefit of this meditation together spread out into the world for the

150
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:43,840
welfare and benefit of all beings

151
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:53,360
and they do so through our deeds of body speech and mind

152
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:01,840
may today be a day for spreading for caring for the welfare

153
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:10,360
of others

154
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:15,230
[Music]

155
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,080
you
