00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:10,400
warm greetings and a warm welcome to

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,640
inside meditation center that you get

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,199
so for the meditation today i would like to evoke the quality of

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:28,160
trust and that

5
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,640
sometimes in buddhism we talk about trusting the dharma

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,800
going for refuge to the dharma but i think that

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:50,239
when things come down to really practicing the dharma what we

8
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:57,120
learn is that we're trusting our hearts in some ways the dharma and the

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,199
and our hearts are the same and our hearts um

10
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,119
understand much more than our minds do or much more than we do

11
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:16,799
and to trust something that is wiser or deeper

12
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:26,080
is more able to protect us and care for us and guide us and sometimes our conscious mind can do

13
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,320
and that is not a maybe easy thing to find or come to

14
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,159
but when we sit and do this practice when we do a practice

15
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,759
of the heart the practice that connects us deeply to that which is

16
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:49,840
within us it's more than conscious then we discover that there's a place of

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,680
trust something we can trust the dharma in us the heart in us

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,200
so to sit with trust so

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,399
to begin with a posture

20
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,160
that you can trust maybe not maybe there's no perfect

21
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:19,200
posture i think there is no perfect posture for any of us

22
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,720
but maybe there's a posture that can you can trust enough for these minutes of

23
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,560
meditation a posture that allows you to

24
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,840
relax and to let go

25
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,360
and to gently close your eyes

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,800
and to feel this body

27
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,640
in a sense we learn to trust the body too

28
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,599
no that's not the body that decays or becomes sick exactly but something

29
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,360
something deeper about here in this lived body

30
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,879
is a place that we relax

31
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,159
and relaxing the body into the

32
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:24,640
pull of gravity wherever you're sitting or touching

33
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,120
whatever surface is holding up your weight

34
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,840
your weight being the

35
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:43,280
the interface direction of your body and gravity

36
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:53,439
and to let yourself trust the support your body is given

37
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,200
by the surface that hold your body up

38
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,920
taking a few long slow deep breaths

39
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,280
relaxing trusting on the exhale

40
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,639
letting your breathing return to normal

41
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,000
and to progressively relax your body maybe think of it as a progressive

42
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,199
trusting each movement of relaxation means to trust enough to do so

43
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,240
on the exhale relaxing the belly

44
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,440
trusting enough to let the belly relax soften

45
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,080
on the exhale relaxing the chest and the heart

46
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,840
trusting enough to relax in the chest

47
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,440
relaxing the shoulders

48
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,240
relaxing the shoulders softening the shoulders there's a release of

49
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,560
some fear or mistrust and a movement towards trusting enough

50
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,720
to relax

51
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,918
enter relax the face

52
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:56,479
the face is more engaged in our lived life than most people realize

53
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:04,800
and to let there be trust in the face so the eyes can relax

54
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,319
cheeks and jaws

55
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,599
the forehead

56
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:37,120
and then relax relaxing the thinking mind

57
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,919
maybe softening a mistrust or fear that's in the mind

58
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,360
for these minutes trusting there's nothing you have to

59
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,638
fix or save or protect

60
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:08,400
these minutes now you're safe and

61
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:19,199
protected and so you can relax the mind

62
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,039
from its concerns trust

63
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,560
a trusting

64
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,519
and then becoming attuned to your body breathing

65
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:55,519
noticing that if in the breathing there is any anxiety or fear

66
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,959
it's okay if there is

67
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,760
let the rhythm of breathing massage whatever

68
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,440
fear anxiety there might be

69
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,640
noticing if the fear changes

70
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,079
throughout the cycle of breathing in and breathing out

71
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:41,080
becoming aware of that rhythm of change

72
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,680
letting the breathing relax

73
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,680
soften

74
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
softening relaxing as you exhale

75
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,120
and allowing as you inhale

76
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:41,040
and here now in this lived experience of breathing

77
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,640
being in a body for these minutes that you're here

78
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:57,440
trusting being alive trusting breathing

79
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,800
being mindful being present

80
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:56,080
for these minutes perhaps that trust can be

81
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:07,039
entrusting just being here present breathing

82
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,360
is enough

83
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,640
so as we come to the end of the sitting

84
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,880
as we become come to greater freedom in this practice

85
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:26,240
one way of expressing that freedom is that just to be alive is enough

86
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:34,440
sitting here meditating breathing being mindful

87
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:41,200
that there's nothing to attain nothing to be or nothing to prove ourselves

88
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,278
just being here breathing being alive

89
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:55,039
is enough or is glorious

90
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,440
to trust that this is enough for these few minutes

91
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,600
and if you appreciate

92
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:17,279
the well-being that comes with just being here breathing with trusting

93
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:22,240
this moment this experience

94
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:32,559
if you appreciate the well-being the ease the freedom the absence of stress that it produces

95
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:38,159
imagine what it'd be like for others to have the same

96
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:45,840
to others to have be free of the stress of needing to attain and to prove themselves

97
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:53,200
the stress of being afraid and anxious needing to protect themselves

98
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,159
how wonderful would be if others could have this sense of ease

99
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:07,278
well-being have the ability to trust just being alive is enough

100
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:17,760
may it be that as we do this practice and we taste the benefits of it

101
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:24,320
that we share those benefits with the world around us

102
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:31,360
may we dedicate the benefits of this practice for the welfare and happiness

103
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,480
of everyone wishing

104
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:42,799
happiness on others wishing safety

105
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:50,720
for others wishing peace and freedom for others

106
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,000
and wishing that we find we notice

107
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:05,760
the small things big things we can do today to contribute to that possibility

108
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,840
to the welfare and happiness of others

109
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:29,960
[Music]

110
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,720
thank you

111
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,720
um

112
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:52,240
so here we have the beginning of our third talk

113
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,120
on fear and

114
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:05,120
yesterday i talked about holding the fear carefully

115
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,279
so that the fear feels safe another way of maybe talking about that

116
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:17,519
is to have the ability to be present for fear and offer attention to fear

117
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:25,440
without reacting to it without being for it or against it without being

118
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,679
impacted and influenced by it acting being pushed around by the fear

119
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:37,919
to just learn to learn the ability to be present the capacity to be present

120
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,440
and be in a certain way comfortable certain way at peace

121
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:53,200
with being afraid and these two who you know come being comfortable or being at peace with fear is possible

122
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,960
and what that does it begins to change our relationships to fear

123
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,919
and gives us a chance to look at it more deeply

124
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,000
it also allows the chance for the fear to do its own process

125
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,440
the dharma in us the heart in us has has a way of healing has a way of

126
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:22,000
moving towards health if we can get out of the way enough while at the same time

127
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,360
being attentive being present and that's the wonderful ingredient of

128
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:34,320
this practice is to have the capacity to be present to be attentive to something

129
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:41,679
without interfering with it without fixing it changing it judging it

130
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:49,840
but making almost like the attention gives room for something to unfold to unwind to

131
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,720
evolve the way it needs to evolve so some of that happens with fear

132
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:03,840
but fear also is a great subject for study to look at in respect

133
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:08,878
it's helpful to think of fear as a message and the question is what is it a message

134
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,000
of and to ask that question what is this message

135
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,800
what is this fear trying to tell me what's it about is a very profound question that

136
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,679
that is supported by this capacity to be present because if we don't know how to be present kind of in a relaxed open kind

137
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:36,320
of accepting way then the chances are that when we're attending to fear we're bringing with us

138
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:43,358
our fear of fear our aversion of fear our stories about fear and rather than just seeing it in a very

139
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:50,079
much simpler more direct way and so um

140
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:56,079
what is the message of fear now sometimes fear is a very good message that something is

141
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,920
dangerous and when the fear has to do with something in the moment like we have a

142
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:08,480
really clear sense right now there's something not right here something is off

143
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,280
that maybe should really get us to stop and pause and take look at the situation

144
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:22,480
you know our minds our hearts know more than what we consciously know

145
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:28,240
our mental processing is quite complex involved

146
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:33,760
involves much more than what we see on the surface of the mind you know the conscious mind

147
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,960
and so we're taking in a lot of information from the environment that we don't really

148
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,599
conscious processly consciously and so if there is a fear about something is

149
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:51,920
off it might be something to pay attention to i've done that in situations in cities

150
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:59,520
in san francisco and um there was a clear you know suddenly this is this this situation is not safe

151
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,960
this person who is following me is not safe and i would then

152
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:10,800
change what i was doing i remember once i uh that this is not good

153
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:16,240
and um and i didn't know what it was but something about that told me this is not safe

154
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,280
and so i walked into a grocery store and uh

155
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,280
and and i think it was a really wise choice

156
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:35,040
so there's all kinds of things that come up and so this idea that sometimes fear is a good message that there's danger

157
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:43,200
sometimes fear has no immediate danger sometimes we call them fear that kind of fear anxiety

158
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,720
but there's fear about something that we're imagining it might be coming in the future

159
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,400
and there might be there also there might be some deep understanding that maybe there really is

160
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,160
something to be afraid of and where we're going what we're doing and um

161
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:08,000
and so to stop and feel the fear take it as a message and try to study it what's what's this about

162
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,720
can you in fact understand more about it if there's an opportunity to reflect on and think about it

163
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,400
and there's two very i think useful directions for

164
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:27,839
investigation around fear one is what are we threatened by

165
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:34,320
and then more profoundly maybe something that really meditators could ask in a deep way

166
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:40,320
what is threatened in this with this fear what inside of me what

167
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:48,640
what about me what what what what is being threatened by the danger so what is being uh what is the threat

168
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:54,960
um is what's really the thing that seems dangerous here

169
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:01,440
and is it in fact a mountain lion about to pounce or is it fear

170
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,200
that of rejection that if i go into that social situation

171
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:14,000
certainly i'll be rejected and that those people are not going to like

172
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,200
me for whatever reason and and that might be i mean it happens

173
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:26,240
sometimes but if we every social situation go in there's a fear of rejection

174
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,440
and um and that's that's the threat is that people will reject me and it's always

175
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:38,240
that's a concern then maybe what's interesting is to look at what is being threatened here

176
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:44,160
what is it that keeps what's the common denominator that i bring with me to all these different social situations

177
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:50,400
what is it that uh is in danger in me and um

178
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,320
and sometimes we can find very interesting things there the um

179
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,000
uh you know i i had a fear of rejection when i was young

180
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,359
and as i looked at it more and more deeply it what is being threatened here

181
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:13,520
uh i saw because i because i started being a meditator it wasn't so much that i saw what was

182
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:20,880
being threatened though i saw it to be a lot of my ideas my imaginations of what would happen and

183
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,560
what the consequences of that if i was rejected then something else would happen it'd be

184
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:32,560
cascade domino affected in my imagination of things but when i looked what is being what is

185
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,640
really being threatened here inside of me and in this present moment

186
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,320
and i found that there was nothing that there was nothing that uh there was

187
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:49,760
a place inside of of of well-being

188
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:57,839
that was untouchable by whether or not people rejected me or not and that made a huge difference it

189
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:05,520
started to shift something in me about this fear that i had i it no longer carried much

190
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:11,680
force on me or i didn't invest a lot of importance in it and it was still there but it was like i could just shrug it

191
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,920
somebody just shrug it off okay there it is again my old friend and um because i knew a kind of

192
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,160
confidence and a sense of well-being that i could protect or i could stay close to

193
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:30,240
and i knew that that doesn't have to be threatened by what other people do

194
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,760
in fact i learned that the real threat and this is the question this first

195
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:43,440
question what is what is where is the threat where is the danger is that one in some many situations the

196
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:50,400
real danger is not what happens in the world but my own mind and what i do about it

197
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,560
and this fear of rejection i could see that the real danger was uh

198
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:03,040
the fear itself the real danger was the contraction i had the resistance i had

199
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,480
the the that free sometimes freezing sometimes the

200
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,800
collapse that i had in myself the attachment that i had around something

201
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,240
and um and that was the real danger to come to that place to see that the

202
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:28,560
real danger was in my own mind not out there around the sphere of rejection that was powerful for me

203
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:33,599
and because then i could practice with myself i wouldn't have to try to find

204
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,599
everyone get everyone to like me or stop rejecting me i could practice with my own mind

205
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:46,560
and it came to a point well if they reject me it was okay if they don't reject me that's okay because i work

206
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,640
through my own reactivity around this whole issue and have found this place

207
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,079
inside of peace of well-being that

208
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:05,839
i didn't want to sully i didn't want to i felt that this is important to protect from myself

209
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:11,839
and so the whole buddhist practice that was then learning how to work with this mind and mind

210
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:17,440
letting go of the attachments letting go of what what i was holding on to there in my mind

211
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:24,640
letting go of the reactivity the that i had there so to ask the question what is being

212
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:30,079
what is the threat what is a threat really to understand that and there's many many

213
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:37,119
answers to that but to ask that question but don't don't settle for the first answer

214
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:43,040
um you can ask keep well yes yes i'm threatened by that people reject me but

215
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:49,440
what's really the threat what's the really the danger if they do that what is really the danger what's the

216
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,880
danger here what am i afraid of and maybe there's layers of answers to that

217
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,560
question um and sometimes you do i'll go through the layers and you'll find that the real

218
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:06,160
threat is in your own mind surprisingly sometimes you'll see the real threat is

219
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:12,800
out in the world and because you really got to see it well and understood it that that's where the danger is

220
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:18,079
maybe you're in better position to address that danger out there

221
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:25,040
but they keep asking also the question what is being threatened that's a profound question

222
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:31,599
and sometimes even when there's real threats out there in the world that need to be addressed and taken care of or be

223
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,640
protected from at the same time

224
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:44,079
there might be aspects of what's being threatened inside that is the domain of practice that might show you something

225
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:49,200
very profound about what you're doing extra what is not needed

226
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,640
in the heart or in the mind the very thing that we're holding on to our attachments

227
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:59,920
what we are trying to protect or how we're trying to prove ourselves or

228
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:06,319
how we're trying to get other people to see us or how we're trying to kind of protect our a certain kind of inner

229
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:11,440
story about ourselves that we have and we start seeing what that's being

230
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:18,160
threatened my desire for security my desire to be seen as a particular way

231
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,680
my desire to um to uh

232
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:29,599
you know all kinds of things so the um what is being threatened so

233
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,800
what is what is really the threat and spend time and what is being threatened

234
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:41,359
and to repeat what i said at the beginning that investigation is a lot easier

235
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:47,440
when we've learned how to hold the fear

236
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,440
carefully and mindfully helping the fear feel safe then we're in a better position to ask

237
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:59,520
these questions in a good way so um

238
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,440
you might try that today the next 24 hours is look at things that you're anxious

239
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:12,800
about look at things that you're afraid of and and take some quality time reflecting on

240
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:19,599
what is really the threat to it and maybe it should be plural what are the threats what is be what is the threats

241
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:25,680
where's the threats coming from uh what is really the what's really the danger for you

242
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:33,280
in this thing and then what is being threatened in you what what what is what is the

243
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:39,359
uh yeah what is being threatened what is the thing that you feel is afraid will happen to you

244
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:46,079
or to your life what is that become clear about that and maybe there too there's layers of understanding what is

245
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:51,200
being threatened and i'm confident that whatever you discover

246
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:57,280
in that that it will bring you greater wisdom to understand how to navigate

247
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:03,359
your fear and live with your fear so um

248
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:11,520
i hope you have just the right fear today just enough to be able to do this exploration

249
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:17,400
and then we'll continue tomorrow thank you
