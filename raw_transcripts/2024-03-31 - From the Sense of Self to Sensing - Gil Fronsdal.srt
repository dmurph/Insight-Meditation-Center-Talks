1
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:07,000
so good morning everyone and hope you can hear me out there in the hall okay

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,080
thank you so um last

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:20,560
week um I gave a talk on the sense of self and the stronger the sense of self

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,960
is I believe or I suggest that um the less we're in our

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,920
senses and that one of the switches that happen when we meditate is We Begin

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:41,039
becoming embodied more and more in our senses our physical senses the sense of

7
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:48,559
being in a body embodied in a body connected in the body and to the degree to which the

8
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:55,440
sense of self is related to thinking ideas stories memories and all that

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:01,600
kinds of stuff it's very easy for people to identify this self as connected to

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,520
thinking and we we have this famous expression comes from French of I think therefore I am the French philosopher

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,799
came up with and um and uh the um the Buddhist if they

12
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:24,640
buddist were going to use the same three words they probably say uh I am therefore I

13
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,799
think and um the um the uh you know the amness comes

14
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,240
first and thinking is just kind of like an appendage or addition on top of it

15
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,360
and that thinking world can be an support for us it augments the the

16
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:49,079
Fuller way of we being in the world but it doesn't take predominance and for some of us there

17
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:56,719
are times in our lives probably some of you where the um

18
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:03,039
thinking uh is takes the lead living in the thinking moving forward and the

19
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:10,640
momentum the pressure to think the forward directionality the addiction to thinking the magnetism of thinking and G

20
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,800
engaging in thoughts um becomes a little bit like having the cart in front of the

21
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,080
horse has a little bit like having um the thoughts are ahead and the body is

22
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:29,959
following along the body is the appendage appendage to thinking and there's so much thinking going on and

23
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:36,920
jumping around from one to the thought to the other to what our plans are we have to do figuring everything out and

24
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:43,560
um and I know that I'm quite capable of uh beginning to just uh have a feel like there's a lot to do and my mind is just

25
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,680
jumping around between them and the more I do that the less I'm in touch with my

26
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,519
body the less that I'm here and that things like sitting down to meditate is

27
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:02,400
uh begins to put the horse in front of the cart sitting down to meditate uh places

28
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,440
the C the the central sense of being alive here in this body being connected

29
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,159
here more than the sense of aliveness somehow inhabiting the world of thinking

30
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:20,959
the drive to think and one of the interesting questions to ask any of us

31
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,640
uh is where do you live and not your address but um you

32
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,200
know and and there's plenty of people who live in their thinking that's the world that they

33
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,319
inhabit and in Buddhist practice we're trying to live in our bodies more than

34
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:43,400
in our minds to be embodied here and so the experience of being in the

35
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:51,640
body belongs to the realm of Senses the sense the sense capacities we have and

36
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:58,159
the world of Sensations and what is uh really uh Rich

37
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:07,200
really valuable in the teaching of the Buddha is that he distinguishes between two different areas of

38
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:15,120
sensing so there's those Sensations that we experience that come from having uh

39
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,600
our senses s stimulated by the outer

40
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:26,560
world so if it's cold outside then this

41
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,440
our temperature nerves senses the cold cold and that has a whole effect on our

42
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:38,080
system and the whole physiology begins to change and shift the more cold we

43
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,639
feel as a way of taking care of ourselves and it's a rich Dynamic inner world that gets

44
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,680
activated if uh our senses pick up warmth it isn't just simply there's

45
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:57,000
warmth on our on our skin but that is tied to a whole dynamic system inside of

46
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,400
temperature regulation and your Poe and sweat and who knows all the things that

47
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:09,039
go on lots of things go on and um so this world of Senses is a

48
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,199
rich world of regulation of finding our way understanding our way in this

49
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:19,600
world so uh uh if uh we have pain pain

50
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:26,160
is an extremely valuable thing to have and um and so generally it gives us a

51
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,120
signal that something is off that we should respond to just as I say that I remember the time

52
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:38,280
when I was staying in a little Hut in Thailand and I think I was taking a nap

53
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,639
or maybe I was sleeping but I was sleeping and uh and I had a

54
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:49,600
dream and in the dream I was walking barefoot up a grassy null and when I

55
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,919
came to the top of the null I stepped down and there was a steak in the grass

56
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:04,759
and my toe went into that mistake and it hurt but it was a dream so it's

57
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,840
okay but it it really hurt but I knew I was dreaming it's just a dream but it

58
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,319
really hurt so I opened my eyes to look and

59
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:22,880
there was this big ant biting my my uh my

60
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,919
toe and you know I was getting a signal danger signal but in this dream state it the

61
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,400
the message was coming through these images that I initially

62
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,800
misinterpreted it's just a dream and um so you again there's this

63
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,919
Dynamic Rich system inside that gets activated by something like pain that

64
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,960
who knows all the things physiologically psychologically mentally uh that are

65
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,680
triggered by it but in that situation it was that Dynamic inner World of Pain

66
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:07,120
played itself out in a dream how did it get from the toe to the Dream It's a rich CH dnamic world it's not just pain

67
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,840
it's not just pleasure it's not just these simple things the sense the senses

68
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:19,280
we experience is are richly connected and what happens as we start

69
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,400
meditating uh I think in an ideal world it's not easy is that we've become more

70
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,520
whole where all our apparatus all our capacity to be

71
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:37,159
the signal of danger came in without the my ordinary conscious

72
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:42,599
mind which is busy probably thinking about things um too busy to notice but

73
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:48,200
something is noticing something is taking in the danger and it's being expressed someplace

74
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:55,880
within so the body is an antenna the body picks up things and it's part of that bigger apparatus of experiencing

75
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:04,000
that's so valuable and so the more we can be connected to body then more we feel sometimes oh something's off here

76
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,040
what's going on something is right here what's going on here or if I go this

77
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:17,000
direction it just feels like that feels like a rightness a goodness to it wholesome it's this is wholesome this

78
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,519
direction is UNH wholesome this direction this activity is nourishing this activity is not

79
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:31,200
nourishing and one of the great Joys that I've had from doing this practice is really getting a sense of this inner

80
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:38,320
nourishment that's possible that's and the the feeling and sense of nourishment of being nourished

81
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,760
by the activities I do and feeling what it's like to do something which is Den

82
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:49,240
nourishing that's the opposite and then in Buddhist practice uh generally the

83
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,760
guide for what we do is to choose what's nourishing what's wholesome what feel

84
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,600
feel has a certain not just feels right but it actually feels like it it uh it

85
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:07,079
um fills us with a sense of rightness and goodness and warmth and kind of

86
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:13,800
makes us kind of better people and avoid the stuff does the opposite so as we

87
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:19,200
tune in to the body we make this switch from having the cart in front of the

88
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:26,519
horse to the horse I don't know if it's behind uh the the the the horse in front or I like to

89
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:33,680
think of it is no cart involved um uh it's uh rather than us being

90
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,839
behind the horse pushing it um we're on the

91
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:47,279
horse or being in front of the horse pulling it I don't know what the analogy is but but but the the point being we

92
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:53,880
get to sit on the horse and the horse is our whole being the wholeness of it all and it's

93
00:10:53,880 --> 00:11:01,680
phenomenal that we have this apparatus the body that can support us has this intelligence in it has this has this uh

94
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:08,200
antenna that gives us so much information and so to drop into this

95
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:15,040
body and um I love this pyramid that we have on the they used to have it do we have it

96
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,839
anymore do we even have money anymore this pyramid with the eye on the

97
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:28,040
top of the pyramid um I sometimes I think of the human being as um a

98
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:35,639
pyramid where the the um the body is the big wide

99
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:42,920
Foundation then there's maybe the emotions in the middle and then there's thoughts on the top and if you tip the

100
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:49,560
the the uh the pyramid over on its head it's very unstable but if you have it all in the

101
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:55,240
right position then it's stable and so U and so the pride of

102
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,279
place because it's so insecure is we're given to thinking

103
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:05,800
it gets to be up there where that little eye is and um and maybe it has a good

104
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:11,000
overview sometimes but uh but it's just a small part of who we

105
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,079
are a huge part of what we are is the body not the hunk of flesh but this Rich

106
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:23,720
Dynamic world of the senses that come alive through the body the processing in the

107
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:30,000
body so that was all leading up to the Buddha distinguish distinguishes between

108
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,360
two kinds of sense experiences we can have in the

109
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,839
body and um and so the ordinary one is when the senses are stimulated by the

110
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:51,000
outside world so uh we hear a sound and that also can has this ripple

111
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:58,800
effect within us that can be quite Dynamic more than we often realize the the what we see through the

112
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:06,600
eyes we see certain things and that's maybe a little bit easier but sounds sometimes too can be very soothing very satisfying

113
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:14,519
very inspiring to hear music of certain kinds voices of certain types um some voices and music is

114
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,519
jarring and um we can see things same thing some sites are actually nourishing

115
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:28,160
and supportive it shift the Inner Light landscape dramatically and uh I love

116
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,360
water and so um uh I when I drive around the Bay Area it's rather unfortunate I

117
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,839
have to usually be the driver because going across the cemeter

118
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:46,199
bridge or just at a little place on 101 going to San Francisco just past just before you get to Candlestick Park or

119
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:51,800
whatever it is I just love to look out across the water and I can't do enough

120
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,880
of it if I'm driving but just it to look out on flat

121
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,399
quiet calm water is for me is so something settles deep in me I grew up

122
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:08,480
around water so maybe that's why so so so we can things come in

123
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:16,759
through the eyes tongue smell the body oddly enough you have to kind of Go

124
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:23,839
Hopefully go along with me in the psychology of Buddhism the mind is a sense organ as

125
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:30,399
well it's a six sense organ so our ability to have a thought and know we're thinking

126
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,120
is um is the the Mind sense that's seeing it knowing it

127
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,560
somehow oddly enough this is the odd part even more

128
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:47,639
odd uh those thing those thoughts are sometimes considered to be external

129
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:53,600
stimuli on that sense door but that seems strange because most of us are our thinking I mean what can

130
00:14:53,600 --> 00:15:00,240
be more personal and now you're saying it's outside one more thing's outside that's coming

131
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,079
and um and so but it makes more sense if you begin understanding that the Buddha

132
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:12,160
had a whole other area of sensing that was not the senses being

133
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,800
stimulated by something outside and he he he made this this

134
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:23,839
distinction he made is between uh sensations of the flesh the flesh are

135
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:30,880
somehow stimulated and Sensations not of the flesh you usually the translators

136
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:38,360
don't know don't want to do translated that way into English so one way they translated is uh

137
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,759
uh worldly Sensations worldly feelings and non-world feelings so that's just to

138
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:55,880
me is confusing non worldly and um the um and uh so uh the

139
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:03,040
um but what's the it's the non the sensation is not of the flesh the

140
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:10,360
things that uh arise in the sense field but not because some particular thing

141
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:16,560
stimulated the senses so for

142
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:23,360
example um when

143
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,199
um um I've been around little children and and uh like I used to go to my kids

144
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:34,920
nursery school and there was lots of stimulation

145
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:41,920
there but something deep inside of me kind of just got really

146
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,600
sweet really kind of feel oh this is kind of sweet quiet

147
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,199
warm kind of loving especially all nurser kids were taking a

148
00:16:53,199 --> 00:17:00,440
nap I mean I mean that that is a that's like one of the Great sites go

149
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,079
the to sit there with all these kids so peaceful and quiet napping

150
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,319
oh who would want to wake them my son

151
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:18,959
actually I think both kids but my young older son he he got he

152
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,199
got expelled from school the first chance I mean he

153
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,520
started he started early with this because he went to pre nursery school

154
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:36,360
and he would wake up the other kids during the nap and the that and the teacher just

155
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:43,679
didn't have any then wouldn't have it so that's his that was his beginning of his school

156
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:51,559
career so we found a better place for but um but the sweetness this you know

157
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:57,720
that's that would be considered not of the flesh even though we feel it in the flesh we feel it in the body but it's

158
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:03,280
not a particular thing is being stimulated some some and maybe the way I

159
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,280
felt that way was tied was related to all kinds of things it part of the rich part of the inner landscape that was

160
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,559
coming alive I felt very nourished and supported by that sitting in

161
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:22,640
meditation the uh which is the Buddhism the classic reference point for this not of the flesh sitting in meditation

162
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,039
minding your own business and having nothing good coming from the outside but

163
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:34,200
starting to feel settled and calm and warm and connected and and at ease

164
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,720
feeling safe feeling somehow involved in a nice way with the

165
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:48,360
meditation and then there starts being this this suffusion of feeling of calm feeling of

166
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:56,120
pleasure feeling of goodness feeling of ah I'm home that you can't really pinpoint to a

167
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:03,640
particular thing having been stimulated it's not like you know someone went in there and tickled you in a particular

168
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:10,480
place in your heart or something but it's it's it's something that's much more suffused diffuse through the

169
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:17,039
body and you can't you know you can have maybe have tension in your shoulder and that's a very particular spot that you

170
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,159
can bring your feel maybe to feel that tightness or the hardness or the pain or

171
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:28,159
the belly when I'm afraid I can feel the tightness in my belly very clear space

172
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:34,039
but there's not of the flesh thing is doesn't have that specificity it's something a little bit

173
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:41,919
broader and wider so the mind the thinking mind that likes to have things likes to want

174
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:48,080
something wants to Define Itself by something and by and hold on to it

175
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:55,039
there's not actually something to hold on to there because it's so diffuse but it's some of the most

176
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:00,880
valuable feelings we can have as a human being these feel is not of the flesh

177
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:06,159
that's where love love that is wholesome and

178
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,799
nourishing comes out that way through us the Love sometimes what's confused

179
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:18,640
with love is intense desire there's a lot of things that get

180
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:25,320
confused for this wholesome not of the flesh Love sometimes uh uh some people

181
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,520
what they think of as love is the tremendous Delight they have that

182
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:38,600
someone else loves them they don't love they don't actually love the other person they just really thrive on being

183
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:45,400
loved and so they say I love you but it's really because how good they make me feel like you know I'm important here

184
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:51,240
I don't know if that's the same kind of deep satisfying way of feeling something that we have in

185
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:57,720
Buddhism that's partly based on on attachment uh or sometimes love is

186
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:03,720
confused with secur which is such an important thing to have for our very sense of being alive and

187
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:10,840
well-being and sometimes the person that provides us with security is that which we kind of think we love but it maybe

188
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:17,600
it's a kind of love but there's a different kind of love that's deep that's effusive that arises with this

189
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,440
kind of warmth or or or Delight or deep

190
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:29,279
sense of appreciation and that's almost like there's no desire in it it might

191
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:34,360
give birth to certain kinds of motivations Inspirations aspirations

192
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:41,279
Expressions but it's not caught in any attachment any clinging any need to have something

193
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:49,159
happen so this not of the flesh it's Sensations but it's a very different uh

194
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:54,480
species of Sensations than the the species that come from a particular

195
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:00,440
sense door being stimulated including being stimulated by by particular

196
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:06,720
thought I've been minding my own business in meditation feeling quite content and happy

197
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:15,679
maybe and then somehow my mind brings up a thought of someone who 15 years ago uh

198
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:22,080
offended me that's all it

199
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:28,640
takes you know and suddenly you know I'm like captured by that particular thought

200
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,159
and stimulated by it and you know my calm just dissipated now I'm tense that

201
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:39,320
didn't like 0 to 60 in half a second it's quite something what's possible in

202
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:46,919
there and uh but then it's very particular things have gotten tight things have gotten you know kind of

203
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:52,840
agitated by the stimulation from those thoughts but what happens when the

204
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:59,679
thoughts get quiet and peaceful and the and our thoughts are not stimulating

205
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:05,279
I've also been stimulated by thoughts of uh pleasure I w't tell you the

206
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:13,720
details but uh you know and it feel feel kind of delightful and pleasure suffusing my body but it hasn't been

207
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,919
nourishing to confuse pleasure with nourishment is one of the things that we

208
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:25,320
can distinguish or the ability to distinguish pleasure from what's from

209
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:31,159
nourishing pleasure or Den nourishing pleasure from nourishing pleasure is one of the things that comes with this

210
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:36,240
heightened sensitivity to our body and what's going on here and some Pleasures

211
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:44,840
are Pleasant in the moment but are harmful for us in the long term some uh some things that are uh

212
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:50,400
actually feel unpleasant in the moment can lead to a sense of profound feeling

213
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,320
of well-being in this non this not of the flesh world that's part of who we

214
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:02,440
are and again but you know taking care of young children um I've had to do some pretty

215
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,720
unpleasant things conventionally and my favorite one to tell you hopefully it's

216
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:14,679
okay maybe I should warn you what's coming stay on your seat no but it was

217
00:24:14,679 --> 00:24:20,799
uh was this amazing thing that when my my baby was you know pretty

218
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:27,440
young and um was sleeping next to us in bed next to us and got sick and suddenly

219
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,640
we had to deal with this sick baby and and uh it was clear that uh he was going

220
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:40,039
to throw up I didn't know people could do this it was very unpleasant on one hand but it was also at the same time so

221
00:24:40,039 --> 00:24:47,640
it was unpleasant conventionally but I was filled with a feeling of compassion love generosity

222
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:54,000
goodness I took my hands cup them together to receive the

223
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,120
bomet can you believe it it never once had ever occurred to me

224
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:05,840
that that was a possibility and that I would have these good amazingly like of course I'm going

225
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:11,279
to do this for my child wow like what is you know wow you know so it was

226
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:17,520
unpleasant in some ways but boy the the sense of it was really Pleasant in this

227
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,840
inner landscape that has come alive for me through this

228
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:31,120
practice so so uh as we go through our life we have we understand it we're

229
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,520
Guided by a very different sensibility when we're in touch with

230
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:42,440
this world not of the senses if it's all about the senses it's

231
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:48,159
all about the ideas all about the thoughts we really limit ourselves and

232
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:55,360
uh and we're not you know uh not availing ourselves of the full richness of what it's like to be a human

233
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,600
being so this switch from being in thoughts to being

234
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,880
embodied is huge and um and I would I propose that

235
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,559
you know this kind of simple idea that's frequent now I think that human beings

236
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:22,320
evolved Plains of Africa a long time ago to

237
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:30,320
um use all their senses all their senses uh are

238
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,190
[Music]

239
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:35,440
negotiation I'll do X and you do y for me um it's the it just it's more of a of

240
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:42,320
a well it's a it's a Wellspring it's a fountain that emerges from below it's a

241
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:49,600
generative world that flows upwards and outwards as opposed to an impoverished

242
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:55,200
world where we're taking in taking in and trying to fill ourselves and fill

243
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,559
ourselves and um and it's really easy when the Carters in front of the horse

244
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:07,600
when we are in our thoughts to to this this complicated inner world that we

245
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:14,080
live in and complicated this Rich Dynamic world that's kind of we don't we

246
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,279
don't under the surface of what we see that if we're always in our thoughts

247
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:26,559
thinking and Desiring and wanting and Afraid and anxious and planning there's a tremendous feeling of

248
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:35,080
emptiness or lack that we feel because we're not paying attention to a big part of who we are and something feels that

249
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:41,640
lack and one of the responses to that is then think more want more look outside

250
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:47,799
search outside more and it's sometimes it's a perpetuating self-perpetuating

251
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:54,200
movement of being more and more disconnected and therefore feeling more lack and then trying to fill it outside

252
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:00,519
and and it goes on and on and some people don't know any other way because they've never been trained never looked

253
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:10,480
to never told about this deep Wellspring that's available inside and so to find this

254
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:16,120
generative Fountain of goodness that's within

255
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:25,000
us is one of the reasons we sit to meditate and why we learn the art of

256
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,919
doing a switch from being concerned with thoughts you still might think isn't

257
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,960
that thinking is a problem if there's a problem it's being addicted to thinking

258
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,640
the problem is thinking the solution is in the thinking chasing the thoughts

259
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:50,399
participating in thoughts living in the thoughts we think it what's really great

260
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:56,600
is that if we can make that switch

261
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:02,840
here into the body and which puts us in the present

262
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:09,360
moment because this Rich world of the body that were or the heart if you

263
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:15,240
prefer um it's always here this can't be anywhere

264
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,320
else to find it to a switch and get grounded and centered

265
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,279
here you'll still think and you'll think a lot

266
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:33,559
better but it puts the thoughts in its right place on the top of the

267
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:40,720
pyramid and your thinking will feel respected because you keep it up there on the very top so it's not going to be

268
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,880
insecure it's actually and it's feels it's more capable to participate in the

269
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:55,960
whole participate in the way this very Dynamic and Rich and fascinating inner

270
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:01,760
World operates that we can't even see usually it's so

271
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:08,919
complicated but to feel like we're part of this Rich generative

272
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:15,240
Dynamic world of of the senses of the F of sensations of the

273
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,880
Flesh and if not of the flesh to feel the interplay and the connectivity and

274
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,039
the wholeness gives birth to a whole different way of being in the world that

275
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:34,519
um that for some people will say there's much more going

276
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:40,279
much more interesting stuff going on here than me there's something inside of me which

277
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:47,600
is not me which is really valuable really significant that's a source

278
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,600
of what animates our life in a wonderful way and in Buddhism that's often

279
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,799
associated with Liberation and freedom to be liberated from self

280
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:04,600
to be liberated from desires to be liberated from hatred and fear is a way

281
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:10,519
of stepping back from The Limited world of preoccupation in opening and allowing

282
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:18,559
for this richer World generative world to move through us and uh I'll end with this wonderful

283
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:26,120
idea at least for me that um that rich inner generative

284
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:31,360
World it doesn't make any sense to appropriate

285
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:39,240
it as yourself it doesn't make any sense to claim it as self it doesn't make any

286
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:45,080
sense to use it for your selfish

287
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:51,519
purposes it that it it doesn't belong to that world of self- preoccupation

288
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:58,679
self-definition it's put it takes you beyond the sense of self to a sense of

289
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:06,799
being alive to a sense of compassion care love joy peace

290
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:13,919
warmth friendliness all kinds of beautiful things that we're capable

291
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,679
of so from sense of self to the

292
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,720
senses that's the path so thank

293

296
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:50,440
to but it's nice just to get a sense of community so my name is Bonnie I don't

297
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,240
have a question but I want to share what happened yesterday during um The Retreat

298
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,679
here uh I didn't come in the morning because um I need to swim uh so I had a

299
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:09,679
wonderful swim and I was looking forward to the afternoon and as you know I haven't been back here in a long time

300
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:16,480
and within 10 minutes I know I was doing some thinking about a relationship where there's a lot

301
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:23,480
of ambiguity uh I started getting this intense crushing heart pain and I

302
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:30,358
thought I was having a heart attack it then moved into my jaw and and my thinking then went to oh

303
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:36,839
my God what if I die right here and I just feeling shame and I don't want to

304
00:34:36,839 --> 00:34:43,760
disrupt the s or should I leave the room should I go call you know what do I do with this and I decided to just be

305
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:51,878
really still and to lean into the pain and I just trusted the process I

306
00:34:51,879 --> 00:34:58,560
didn't know what was going to happen uh and I sto stopped letting go of the um

307
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,200
the concern about the outcome and I've had this happen before so it wasn't like

308
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:09,480
the only unique experience but I think this was really a metaphor as I sit here

309
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:15,640
listening to you about where I am in my life right now um I don't want to go

310
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,920
into all the all of that but um thank you for this because it it definitely

311
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:27,440
helped but if I could share a contrasting situation where when I was back in Cambodia I went

312
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:35,200
back and January and I was uh to see the kids and I was sick 20 out of 23 days

313
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,680
and I could not have been happier it was the happiest time I've had in four years

314
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:46,079
you know so I was just coughing and wrenching you know every minute of those

315
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:52,599
23 days and the joy that I felt as you were talking about watching those kids

316
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:58,319
nap the joy I felt just in their presence watching them interact watching

317
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:04,599
them interact with me and you know so much happens in The Experience yeah

318
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:11,319
great thank you very much so first of all is song can you

319
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:16,520
hear me okay so first of all I'm Kathy C you might want to go see a doctor about

320
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:24,240
your chest pain because women do present differently with but anyway um now after

321
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:31,119
your talk thank you for your talk but um I'm going to sit here um and say don't

322
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,440
think don't think don't think because you know that um that's my

323
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:42,000
inclination is to stop trying to try not to

324
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,400
think so so there there there there might be there might be another

325
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:55,520
option it it might be more interesting to begin with to become friends with your

326
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:04,880
thoughts okay and how do you do that respect them listen to them allow

327
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:12,319
them to be there but uh but don't be in them the metaphor which I used yesterday

328
00:37:12,319 --> 00:37:19,160
is is uh you know if you have a friend who's distressed and in trouble or something and and they ask you can you

329
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:25,359
can we meet in the park and go for a walk and then you accompany them listening to what they what they have to

330
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:31,400
say but if you get as as dressed as they are then uh you're probably not going to

331
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:37,359
be supportive you have to accompany them with a respectful listening caring way

332
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:42,920
uh maybe but calm it maybe equanimous that then they they really know you're hearing it and it's meaningful for you

333
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:48,960
that they're hearing you that that they know you're hearing them without being distressed and you don't pull out your

334
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,040
phone to look you know you know to check your emails while they're doing that

335
00:37:54,040 --> 00:38:00,599
you're really there for them so the say to be friends with your thoughts is to do it maybe the same to your thinking uh

336
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:08,200
don't believe them don't be involved in them don't participate in them but um accompany

337
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:14,000
them and as you accompany them see if you can feel what more is going on under

338
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:20,800
the surface thoughts are really just kind of like a surface phenomena they're not usually they're not as important as

339
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:27,760
we think they are and if you're able to listen to your friend in this case you in a deeper way

340
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:34,960
but listen with calm with equinity don't look at your uh phone which means don't start thinking about something else just

341
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:41,359
really be there you might start noticing that uh your thoughts maybe are arising

342
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:48,000
out of some emotional Source it might be you're afraid or angry or anticipating

343
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,400
or um delighted or you you want or there's a desire or there's an aversion

344
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,119
you start seeing there thoughts are again tip of an iceberg tip of a

345
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:06,960
pyramid and so what is it that's if you if you're really a good listener good friend you start listening and feeling

346
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,440
what's deeper because that's what your friend wants they want to be met in that deeper

347
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:15,440
place

348
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:24,079
thank well hopefully my response was good enough for

349
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,520
everyone um my name is Sylvie

350
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:37,119
when uh when you were talking um that was very powerful and um I wanted to

351
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:43,880
maybe paraphrase in a different way to make sure that I understood because something that came for me was pretty

352
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:49,440
strong um so the feelings or the senses

353
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,920
that are uh of the stimulated by the outside right and then they are um

354
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:04,560
feeling or Sensations or phenomenas that are coming from the inside and is it

355
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:12,000
that when we remove kind of the sense of self and we and you know the self is

356
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,680
stimulated by what it it contact with in the external world and we deep go down

357
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:24,200
like what you are talking about I had a sense that

358
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:30,400
um then we reach kind of the elemental Bing

359
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:37,800
blocks of our beings in a way and um the re the reason why you were talking about

360
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:45,359
like compassion and love is to me what comes to is when we come down to that

361
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:53,480
Elemental sensient being kind of operating system then we are in

362
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:58,680
interconnected with both the planet and other beings and so but that is why this

363
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:05,599
love or compassion is coming there is no more I'm Sylvie yeah I'm I'm really part

364
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,680
of the Ecology of the universe very nice

365
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:17,200
I like this very much so but I like to respond a little bit to you um uh I

366
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:23,000
agree with you but I want to be a little bit few care careful with a couple of things one is we don't want to make the

367
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:29,960
sense of self too much of a problem because it's vague what we're talking about we say sense of self more Central

368
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:37,240
to the issue is attachment you know clinging to something um and uh so sense of self

369
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:42,800
often comes with attachment doesn't I mean doesn't have to and so if it's no

370
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:50,800
attachment maybe it's okay it's it's safe enough but it's the attachment and the reason why the attachment Narrows

371
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:58,560
the attention it uh it uh keeps us out of touch with a wider field of Who We Are

372
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,680
and it's through attachment then that uh we're not in touch with all the

373
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:09,839
different ways Rich ways in which a senses take in other people where we

374
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:16,520
have mirror neurons we have all these different ways in which we are attuned in a very deep way to other people that

375
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:23,720
we feel really connected in a very rich way that uh is that attachment is the

376
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:31,559
barrier for so that so that that's the little it's okay with you it's a little bit of a yeah I mean in a way you're

377
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:38,480
saying that the attachment is what comes on top of our Elemental Humanity it

378
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:45,640
covers it covers it right so we're not so we can't be in touch with it yes and so when when we are at that attached

379
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:51,920
level we cannot really be fully uh connected with the universe and other

380
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:59,240
people yes very nice sh thank you so

381
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:06,880
so okay I think that um so in a few minutes there's it'll

382
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:12,960
take a while to get the lunch ready and um everyone's welcome to the polu and

383
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:21,319
whether you're brought anything or not the most important thing to bring is yourself and uh and that uh because it's

384
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:26,800
a potluck it's a little bit social if you would be so willing to take a few minutes here to say hello to the people

385
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:33,400
around you and introduce yourself maybe to at least two people so no one's left alone in the middle of just look around

386
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:39,400
so everyone's get and if you want to share some ideas that came out of this talk for you that's important that would

387
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:45,000
be nice but um it's just nice to have make the connection here easily at begin

388
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,680
so thank you
