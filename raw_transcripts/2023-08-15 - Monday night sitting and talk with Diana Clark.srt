1
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:07,339
foreign welcome welcome

2
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,940
so as you probably know we'll sit for 45 minutes and then I'll give a talk

3
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,620
so we'll see you in 45 minutes

4
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:38,540
foreign welcome welcome

5
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:48,380
maybe I'll ask how is the temperature for you guys is it is it okay is it a little bit chilly is a little bit warm

6
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:54,300
it's okay okay just because uh I'm in a place where

7
00:55:54,300 --> 00:56:00,300
these are blowing on me so I'm fine but I just want to check and see how you guys are

8
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:06,680
okay so welcome welcome

9
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:14,640
nice to see you all so today I'd like to give a talk about

10
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:19,800
this story that we find in the suit does that uh I don't know I kind of like it

11
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:26,819
it's uh a little bit silly maybe maybe silly is not the right word that

12
00:56:26,819 --> 00:56:35,480
um it has these exaggerated portions of it which I think are kind of fun maybe that's the right word a little bit fun

13
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:42,300
and we might even ask like what is the purpose of having some of these stories that are fun

14
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:48,359
and I would say actually so maybe I'll clarify so we have this suit does he's

15
00:56:48,359 --> 00:56:54,900
kind of like the scriptures we might say and then like maybe a thousand years later they wrote what are called the

16
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,940
commentaries and the commentaries are is where all this very colorful kind of

17
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:05,339
what we might say like fun stuff so it's not in the earliest strata of literature

18
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:12,660
it's not from the time of the Buddha but sometime later as they were filling in the backstory like well why

19
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:21,119
did that happen and they sometimes the backstory is some fantastical thing as as is the case here

20
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:28,200
and so I'm sharing this just because uh I don't know it kind of makes me smile a little bit that this story but there's

21
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:33,900
also some really good teachings in here so it's not just entertainment or

22
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:39,359
entertainment's sake but it can be entertainment too but also I like that

23
00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:46,980
this idea that okay that Dharma doesn't have to be so dry and boring

24
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:54,420
can be dry and boring if that's your thing there's plenty of dry and boring things in there but uh and to be sure a

25
00:57:54,420 --> 00:58:00,059
lot of it you know there's these lists and I actually love the lists but I want

26
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:06,660
to kind of like highlight that there's more than just lists and these uh Brutus teachings for Noble Truths they fold

27
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:12,059
path seven factors Awakening five faculties ten parties like you know all these

28
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:19,339
okay so this is a story of the Buddha talking with an ogre

29
00:58:19,339 --> 00:58:24,599
this is how we translate this word yucca as an ogre

30
00:58:24,599 --> 00:58:31,920
so and so uh these ogres yuccas they show

31
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:38,819
up in the poly Canon you know just a few times and they have different roles when

32
00:58:38,819 --> 00:58:44,400
they show up and some of them are depicted as really devout followers of

33
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,500
the Buddha and some are depicted as demons that

34
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:55,200
like to eat humans and they're not necessarily malicious but they do eat

35
00:58:55,200 --> 00:59:01,319
humans so so there's something about that I guess but uh

36
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:07,380
but we might see that in the case of this story it's we I might understand as

37
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:12,839
a rhetorical device or a literary device and that's this ogre

38
00:59:12,839 --> 00:59:18,420
asks questions and it's the answering of the questions where we get some of the teachings but

39
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:24,799
we might learn something about the questions that get asked and in the same way we see

40
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:32,040
lots of uh humans as well as if there's going to be any non-humans that show up

41
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:38,339
um and any sutas they will often are asking questions too so this is the way

42
00:59:38,339 --> 00:59:44,220
that I am kind of holding them as just this rhetorical device is a way to provide opportunities for that Buddha to

43
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:50,000
talk about something so

44
00:59:53,700 --> 01:00:00,059
okay so this is from the this is that starts with the I'll start with the back story that comes from the commentary

45
01:00:00,059 --> 01:00:08,040
right so this is uh like I said like a thousand years after the time of the Buddha so the Buddha goes to allavecca this is

46
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:13,579
the ogre's name olavecca I kind of just like to say it

47
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:22,920
yeah guys ogre so and I love olavika lives in alavi so it

48
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:30,299
does kind of have this like fairy tale kind of feeling right even just the names of these uh people so the Buddha

49
01:00:30,299 --> 01:00:35,819
goes to visit goes to olivi to see alavaka the yaka

50
01:00:35,819 --> 01:00:42,599
and alavaka is not there apparently he said a meeting of ogres

51
01:00:42,599 --> 01:00:48,359
that is happening in the Himalayas kind of curious I don't know what the

52
01:00:48,359 --> 01:00:54,119
meetings are about but uh so but the Buddha he shows up anyway he

53
01:00:54,119 --> 01:01:01,260
goes to alavica's place and he knocks on the door and there's I

54
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:08,640
guess all of AKA lives in a big really big place we might maybe a mansion or something we might imagine and the door

55
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:15,619
keeper opens the door and says the blessed one has come at an improper time

56
01:01:15,619 --> 01:01:21,000
so it's interesting that the doorkeeper recognizes oh this is the Buddha

57
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:27,299
and just says you know this is not a good time and the Buddha responds yes but if it

58
01:01:27,299 --> 01:01:32,400
would not be burdensome for you I would like to spend one night here

59
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:37,980
and this was the case that the monastic sites and the Buddha's followers or they

60
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:44,700
would often be traveling and would just stay at people's places and you know

61
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:50,160
they would for alms they would have food that people would give them in places where they would stay so this is not an

62
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:57,359
unusual thing to happen so the doorkeeper says well it will not

63
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:05,040
be burdensome for me but the Yucca that's ogre is rough and harsh

64
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:11,400
and he doesn't even pay homage to his mother and father so saying he's not going to pay homage

65
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:18,660
to you because he doesn't even pay on his homage to his parents it doesn't respect his parents but the Buddha isn't

66
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:24,420
phased and he says to the door keeper I know his rough character

67
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:33,440
but that won't be an obstacle for me so if it would not be a burdensome for you I would like to spend one night here

68
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:39,059
the door keeper responds it would not be burdensome for me but the Yucca is like

69
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:45,839
a hot frying pan he does not have regard for his mother or father or for recluses and brahmins

70
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:52,319
or for the Dharma and when others come here he drives them insane or splits their hearts or grabs them by the feet

71
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:59,520
and hurls them across the Ganges River and then Buddha is completely undeterred

72
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:05,040
and says I know but if it won't be burnsome for you I

73
01:03:05,040 --> 01:03:11,160
would like to spend one night here the door keeper says it will not be

74
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:17,700
burnsome for me but if I allow you to stay here without informing him

75
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:25,680
he may kill me so let me inform him so the doorkeeper left and to talk with

76
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:30,900
all of AKO so I you know I don't know how ogres travel I don't know if a door keeper with or I don't know how this

77
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:37,440
works but somehow he goes to wherever olafika is to say the Buddha is at your place

78
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:44,400
so while this is happening the Buddha enters olivica's house or

79
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:51,240
Mansion or whatever his Abode is and he sits down and gives a talk gives

80
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:57,900
a Derma talk to the people that are there so apparently they're maybe housekeeping you know servant I don't

81
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:03,900
know who's there exactly gives a Dharma talk to them and then um

82
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:10,559
then when the doorkeeper meets where alifakka says he rushed back to his home

83
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:16,740
in a fury and demanded that the blessed one leave so that's all this colorful black

84
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:23,579
backstory now we're getting to what actually happened what actually happened what's in the suit does so it's you know

85
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:28,980
in the earlier strata this is in the suit and it starts thus

86
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:35,220
have I heard for those of you who are um new to this very often suit does

87
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:40,680
discourses start with us thus have I heard this is

88
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:48,839
um kind of bringing to mind the idea that this was the Buddha speaking and somebody remembered what he was supposed

89
01:04:48,839 --> 01:04:56,460
to have I heard on one occasion the blessed one was dwelling at alavi the haunt of the Yucca

90
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:02,040
olavika then the yaka alafika approached the blessed one and said to him

91
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:09,318
get out all right but by someone said and he went out

92
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:15,780
come in all right I'm a bus at one side and went in

93
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:24,540
on the second time a yucca olavika said get out all right so the Buddha walks out get in

94
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:33,540
all right so the Buddha comes in a third time get out okay he works out

95
01:05:33,540 --> 01:05:40,380
get in so the Buddha goes back in so the kind of the backstory to this

96
01:05:40,380 --> 01:05:47,040
like why all Africa is doing this and why the Buddha is allowing himself to do why he's doing this is because olivica

97
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:54,480
wants to make the Buddha angry because he uh has learned that he the

98
01:05:54,480 --> 01:06:02,760
Buddha is like abides in loving kindness and when he as long as he has loving kindness he's immune to those weapons

99
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:09,599
that olivica might have so he wants to get him angry so they will no longer have loving kindness

100
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:17,579
and the Buddha has this idea why he is following olavika's demands is because

101
01:06:17,579 --> 01:06:23,520
he knew that it was not possible to train a stubborn person with

102
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:29,940
stubbornness true right we kind of even know this in

103
01:06:29,940 --> 01:06:35,819
our own lives can't train a stubborn person with stubbornness in fact there's a few

104
01:06:35,819 --> 01:06:43,980
teachings about this that the Buddha gives that you can't teach somebody about ethical Behavior to

105
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:49,619
an unethical person and there's a thing and you can't teach

106
01:06:49,619 --> 01:06:55,680
Faith or confidence to somebody who doesn't have faith or confidence

107
01:06:55,680 --> 01:07:02,160
so this is kind of really interesting it makes for me when I heard this early thought about this public discourse then

108
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:10,079
I also thought well then how does this work how can you teach her how can people learn if they're stubborn or how

109
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:17,280
can they learn if they don't have confidence or don't have ethical Behavior

110
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:24,420
turns out that the answer is in the timing like if somebody is unethical but then

111
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:31,740
you want to support them behave in an ethical way you only talk about ethical stuff when

112
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:37,859
they are already being ethical because people aren't unethical 100 of the time

113
01:07:37,859 --> 01:07:45,059
and this makes sense to me kind of like the burden is on the the one who wants to help or the teacher is to be

114
01:07:45,059 --> 01:07:50,579
sensitive to what's happening to the other person and if you're sincere and really want to

115
01:07:50,579 --> 01:07:56,339
help and support somebody then you need to be attuned to where they are and to

116
01:07:56,339 --> 01:08:04,799
recognize when is the right time to say something when is the right time to share some wisdom you might have or some

117
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:11,940
ideas that you might have it's not always the right time and we know this and they go if I'm stubborn

118
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:17,580
right I'm not am I particularly stubborn no I'm not a particularly stubborn person

119
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:24,420
but I know that if somebody's like really pushing me you know then I just there is a part of me that just

120
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:30,838
doesn't like to be pushed around and so you know I tend to be like wait what's Happening Here

121
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:37,258
so we all have this experience okay so three times Olivia tells the

122
01:08:37,259 --> 01:08:45,000
Buddha get out come in get out come in and then the um fourth time

123
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:52,679
Olivia says get out and the Buddha says I won't go out

124
01:08:52,679 --> 01:08:57,960
do whatever you have to do so the Buddha's gonna say I don't care what you're doing I'm not going out

125
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:03,179
anymore and then Olivia asks the Buddha some

126
01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:09,000
questions he says I'll ask you a question and if you don't answer me I'll

127
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:16,980
drive you insane or I'll split your heart or I'll grab you by the feet and hurl you across the Ganges River

128
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:23,520
none of those sound really good right drive you insane split your heart or get thrown across the river

129
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:30,778
and the Buddha replies this is Diana's country like I don't see anyone in this world who

130
01:09:30,779 --> 01:09:39,238
could drive me insane split my heart or grab me by the feet and hurl my across the Ganges but ask whatever you want

131
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:45,660
so you know the Buddha he's not threatened of course he's not threatened but I've left this I've been um thinking

132
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:52,560
about this recently on a number of different settings different teachings I've been giving in some different places this

133
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:59,660
idea what would we do if the Buddha said ask whatever you want

134
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:09,540
you know like what would you ask what are some of their questions that we feel like that if we knew the answer

135
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:16,280
would really make a difference and what are some of the questions that we consider that the Buddha could ask

136
01:10:17,820 --> 01:10:21,260
ask whatever you want

137
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:31,760
so Allah here's olafika's question turns out to be four questions

138
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:40,380
Oliver Oliver asks what is a person's best treasure

139
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:46,820
what practiced well brings happiness

140
01:10:48,179 --> 01:10:53,179
what is the sweetest of tastes

141
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:59,420
living in what way is one's life called the best

142
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:07,920
so this first one what is a person's best treasure so treasure we might think of what you

143
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:13,920
know something that we value something that is uh

144
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:20,940
maybe like a resource and something about Treasures but like maybe even hidden

145
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:27,900
or maybe something that's you know not obvious or could also be something obvious like wealth or possessions or

146
01:11:27,900 --> 01:11:35,480
something like this but Allah is asking what is a person's best treasure

147
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:43,560
this is an interesting question because I think Society right now wants us to tell tells us all these things what is

148
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:49,080
the best treasure if you behave this way look this way your bank account is this way you live

149
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:55,260
in this person drive or live in this location drive this car or whatever it is right we're we're being sent this

150
01:11:55,260 --> 01:12:01,320
message all this time about what is makes a person valuable or or the most

151
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:08,940
valuable thing that they have or something what is a person's best treasure

152
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:15,000
and for me I kind of think this is and really humanizes this ogre right he's

153
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:21,080
concerned about wealth and security just like humans

154
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:30,420
so then the second question what well practiced brings happiness

155
01:12:30,420 --> 01:12:37,140
so I appreciate that Allah he's asking well practiced brings

156
01:12:37,140 --> 01:12:43,800
happiness what well practiced brings happiness so he's recognizing that it's not

157
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:49,620
something that can you can just get by snapping your fingers it's something that requires practice

158
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:55,320
so ellavika recognizes that happiness isn't something that just magically gets

159
01:12:55,320 --> 01:13:00,540
bestowed upon a person but what what can we do what can we practice

160
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:06,739
what can we cultivate and develop that's going to bring happiness

161
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:14,940
that they and maybe we can also say ogres just want to be happy

162
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:20,340
just like humans right so this way but this idea that happiness doesn't

163
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:27,540
necessarily come from things that are easily acquired but maybe it takes some effort

164
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:34,020
for things for some happiness that's maybe more enduring or deeper or

165
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:38,600
more than just fleeting or superficial

166
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:48,079
the third question asks is what is the sweetest of tastes

167
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:56,100
maybe referring to a little bit of experiencing pleasure taste we might understand here like

168
01:13:56,100 --> 01:14:04,739
taste to mean experience and this word right now it's just uh rasa is can be

169
01:14:04,739 --> 01:14:10,440
understood sometimes as experiences so he's asking what's the most Pleasant

170
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:15,719
thing what is the sweetest of Tates what's the

171
01:14:15,719 --> 01:14:22,199
what's the most Pleasant and then the last question is living in

172
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:28,020
what way is one's life called the best

173
01:14:28,020 --> 01:14:33,960
so how to live the best life you might you know we ask ourselves this

174
01:14:33,960 --> 01:14:39,000
question too we don't want to have a life filled with regret and remorse we don't want to get

175
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:46,440
to the end of our life and feel like oh I wasn't a good life somehow I didn't

176
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:51,540
reach my potential or didn't do what I thought was important or something like

177
01:14:51,540 --> 01:14:58,020
this so for me I appreciate this that this

178
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:05,280
ogre he's just like us he's concerned with wealth of security happiness pleasure and living a good life

179
01:15:05,280 --> 01:15:11,340
these are things I would say humans care about too chances are all of us in this room

180
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:18,719
care about these things also the Buddha answers all of the guest

181
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:24,060
questions in a very straightforward way

182
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:29,520
clearly and unambiguously and I appreciate this very much you might

183
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:35,820
maybe I should have said this this is all in verse right so um you know the English maybe does is a

184
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:43,140
little bit clunky this that's why the English feels a little bit clunky is because it's written in verse and then when it gets translated it's clunky it's

185
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:50,580
clunky and poly also but so the Buddha gives four answers to four

186
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:56,820
questions so one answer for each question faith

187
01:15:56,820 --> 01:16:02,460
is a person's best treasure Faith Sada we could translate this as

188
01:16:02,460 --> 01:16:10,560
conviction or confidence it doesn't have to be believing in the unbelievable or

189
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:19,199
something like this I'll unpack this a little bit but faith faith is a person's best treasure

190
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:25,040
the Dharma practiced well brings happiness

191
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:30,780
truth is the sweetest of taste

192
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:36,440
and living with wisdom one's life is called the best

193
01:16:37,739 --> 01:16:44,219
so we might ask ourselves you know okay well what does this mean exactly

194
01:16:44,219 --> 01:16:49,500
faith in what and what is the storm and what does it mean to practice the Dharma

195
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:56,280
and when he's talking about truth does this mean like speaking truth or finding the truth or what does that really mean

196
01:16:56,280 --> 01:17:04,100
and if wisdom is important like how does one gain wisdom and what is wisdom and how would we recognize it

197
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:11,420
so Olivia asked and the door and the Buddha said

198
01:17:11,420 --> 01:17:16,340
faith is a person's best treasure

199
01:17:17,159 --> 01:17:23,280
we need a certain amount of confidence or conviction

200
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:29,820
to even start any practice we have to have this belief that's not

201
01:17:29,820 --> 01:17:36,239
completely we don't have all the data in that this is going to be a worthwhile

202
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:42,659
use of our energy worthwhile of our time worthwhile of our resources

203
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:48,480
that requires a little bit of Faith or confidence or conviction

204
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:54,900
without that we will never start a practice right of course not so it's part of he's saying it's the

205
01:17:54,900 --> 01:18:02,159
best treasure maybe because it's something that's kind of hidden like a treasure but it's also if you have the

206
01:18:02,159 --> 01:18:07,739
confidence you can start all kinds of things

207
01:18:07,739 --> 01:18:13,739
not only does Dharma practice or Buddhist practice or a spiritual practice but so many things in life

208
01:18:13,739 --> 01:18:18,840
right just often require just a little bit of confidence to begin

209
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:25,080
and then when we put it down or we it slips then we just need a little bit of

210
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:30,300
confidence just to pick it back up again without the confidence we might fall

211
01:18:30,300 --> 01:18:36,239
into like oh I can never do it this is too hard for me everybody else can do it

212
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:42,900
what's wrong with me or something like that and we could just slip into inaction

213
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:47,780
so this confidence is the best treasure

214
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:54,060
and that's we also could say that in the same way that treasure could

215
01:18:54,060 --> 01:19:00,540
be like a type of wealth and there's a way in which the type of wealth can reduce

216
01:19:00,540 --> 01:19:06,960
the suffering that's associated with poverty or hunger or not having a place

217
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:13,679
to live so there's a way that treasure can reduce suffering

218
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:20,940
it's not the only way that reduces suffering but there's a way in which also faith

219
01:19:20,940 --> 01:19:26,820
can reduce suffering because it tests this it supports practice

220
01:19:26,820 --> 01:19:32,760
and some of you will know that it's one of the five faculties I'm not going to go into this list of the five faculties

221
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:38,040
but it's one of five things that really support practice is having this

222
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:44,040
confidence or conviction so faith is a person's best treasure

223
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:49,080
I'm using this word faith feel free to use confidence conviction whatever you

224
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:55,980
want you don't have to use the word faith the Dorma practiced well brings

225
01:19:55,980 --> 01:20:01,260
happiness so what does that mean the Dharma

226
01:20:01,260 --> 01:20:07,739
there's a few things maybe some of you know rich is the teachings of the Buddha

227
01:20:07,739 --> 01:20:14,100
practiced well so we learn things from the teachings and then more than just

228
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:19,920
having an intellectual understanding more than just memorizing all the lists

229
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:25,320
is there a way that we can put it to practice in our own life

230
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:31,199
is there a way that we can you know embody it

231
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:36,239
instead of just I remember I've heard Gill say a few

232
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:41,360
times he he had this expression I don't know if he still says it he used to say

233
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:49,260
nightstand Buddhists he's talked about all these people that had all these books on the Buddhism and the Dharma on

234
01:20:49,260 --> 01:20:55,440
their nightstand and they would read them and that was sufficient for them and he said that

235
01:20:55,440 --> 01:21:01,860
will take you to a certain distance but really you need to practice put into your life

236
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:11,119
what the teachings are including meditation practice ethical Behavior wisdom these types of things

237
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:18,600
so the drama is the teachings of the Buddha we also could kind of like summarize the Dharma as a path of

238
01:21:18,600 --> 01:21:25,500
practice and many of you will know that Silas manipania is kind of we could summarize

239
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:31,580
this path of practice see the ethical Behavior

240
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:37,080
mental development meditation panya wisdom

241
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:43,860
is seeing things clearly and how things really are

242
01:21:43,860 --> 01:21:51,120
as best we can as opposed to allowing our ideas about things to

243
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:57,380
obscure what's really happening say that's part of wisdom

244
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:04,500
and so the the Derma practiced well brings happiness

245
01:22:04,500 --> 01:22:12,120
because there's a way it's not only that I mean ethical Behavior brings happiness it's the complete absence of remorse

246
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:18,300
I have regret this Bliss of blamelessness there's a certain amount of Happiness to

247
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:25,140
know that uh like if you uh see the policeman walking up to your door like oh you just know

248
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:30,179
that either they need something and you don't have to feel bad or something oh

249
01:22:30,179 --> 01:22:35,400
my gosh why did I hear you're just like oh maybe they there's I can help with the neighbor maybe there's a problem

250
01:22:35,400 --> 01:22:38,960
with the neighbors or something like this

251
01:22:40,739 --> 01:22:46,679
and so but also Awakening this complete Liberation is

252
01:22:46,679 --> 01:22:51,900
described as the highest happiness to the Dharma practice well brings

253
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:57,659
happiness it brings more and more freedom and peace and ease into our

254
01:22:57,659 --> 01:23:03,600
lives and I gave the past month or so a number

255
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:10,679
of talks about what is the Dharma I'm not going to go through all of it now but there's a way in which just aligning

256
01:23:10,679 --> 01:23:18,300
with or tuning into what's happening it's kind of the Dharma as well

257
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:24,360
as being having some clarity about what's actually happening what's

258
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:31,080
there and then the last one oh sorry one two

259
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:36,659
three the third one truth is the sweetest of peace

260
01:23:36,659 --> 01:23:44,760
so what is like what is the most delicious you know what is like the most delectable what is the most

261
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:51,679
something that's maybe an Ambiguously delicious

262
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:58,440
and we might say that truthful speech that when it's done when it's kind and

263
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:05,460
given at the right time and it's done in a way that's beneficial kind of whether we are speaking it or

264
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:10,560
whether we hear it there's a way that it nourishes the mind and the way that food

265
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:18,239
might something that you're tasting might truthful speeches allows the mind to

266
01:24:18,239 --> 01:24:25,320
kind of like calm to be calm right whenever we're thinking about uh telling a little white

267
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:32,219
lie or if we're planning to tell a little white lie have you ever noticed how much planning goes into that we have

268
01:24:32,219 --> 01:24:38,520
to like rehearse it over and over and over again if we're going to tell a white lie or if somebody tells us

269
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:44,940
something and we're not quite sure is that true or not then we just kind of have this little agitation in mind did

270
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:50,940
they really mean that or there's something when we speak the truth

271
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:56,880
and we know others that are speaking the truth there's something that's really

272
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:02,820
calming about that it's really not agitating it at all as opposed to you

273
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:10,199
know agitating it's agitating when even with Little White Lies this is something to

274
01:25:10,199 --> 01:25:15,840
I don't know just for us to practice with is noticing when is our speech

275
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:22,699
agitating trying to Maybe

276
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:30,300
say things that are stretching the truth or or maybe going around the truth or

277
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:35,940
something like this but again it's not truth just for truth's sake because the truth can be

278
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:44,580
hurtful also yes you actually do look fat in that dress right so instead we want to use it in a

279
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:51,360
way that uh you know I love you no matter what you're wearing you know that's kind of

280
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:58,440
the things that we say instead of yeah actually that's not so great or we would say you know blue really looks

281
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:05,219
really good on you I like blue and so rather than the red dress they're wearing or you know I'm just making this

282
01:26:05,219 --> 01:26:10,800
up but this to say truth is really important but truthful speech doesn't

283
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:16,860
give us license to be rude or inappropriate and it's a

284
01:26:16,860 --> 01:26:24,560
skill it's definitely a skill to learn how to say things that are supportive and beneficial

285
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:31,380
but also the sweetest truth is the sweetest of teeth

286
01:26:31,380 --> 01:26:39,060
because the taste of Freedom peace ease is sweet also

287
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:47,219
no matter what degree of Liberation this putting down of the burdens that we have

288
01:26:47,219 --> 01:26:54,480
experienced there's something that's you know has this flavor as sweet as something that

289
01:26:54,480 --> 01:27:00,260
feels uh you know our our bodies Our biology are

290
01:27:00,260 --> 01:27:07,320
through Evolution right we like things that are sweet and want more and it's the same experience and

291
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:13,519
touching into some of this peace and well-being that's possible with practice

292
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:20,280
so then the last one the Buddha says is living with wisdom one's life is called

293
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:27,440
the best then maybe I'll just say after this

294
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:32,940
alavica's next question is how does one gain wisdom

295
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:39,360
because he wants to live his best life and he asks a few other questions too

296
01:27:39,360 --> 01:27:45,179
but for our purposes here I'll just stick to these ones and the Buddha response

297
01:27:45,179 --> 01:27:52,199
like how does one gain wisdom and maybe I'll just say a few words like

298
01:27:52,199 --> 01:28:01,320
how might we understand what wisdom is one one part of wisdom is uh having behavior just how we show

299
01:28:01,320 --> 01:28:06,960
up in the world there's some real wisdom to that how we treat ourselves how we treat others

300
01:28:06,960 --> 01:28:12,719
how behaving ethically taking care of our minds and our bodies taken care of

301
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:19,679
others taking care of our communities part of wisdom

302
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:25,820
as well as you know seeing the characteristics of

303
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:31,739
everything it's the impermanent

304
01:28:31,739 --> 01:28:37,080
it's unsatisfactory and doesn't have a inherent essence

305
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:43,860
part of wisdom is seeing this and understanding this so all of AKA asks well how does one

306
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:51,719
gain wisdom so and then but it responds

307
01:28:51,719 --> 01:28:59,400
by placing faith in the Dharma of the awakened ones if I'm a desire to learn

308
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:05,340
one gains wisdom if one is diligent and astute

309
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:11,460
so we can see that he's kind of referring back to what he was saying earlier when gains wisdom by placing

310
01:29:11,460 --> 01:29:16,980
faith in the teachings of the awakened ones so you know having enough

311
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:22,440
confidence that you're willing to think about it or consider it and maybe put it

312
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:29,159
into practice and from a desire to learn there can be a way right in which

313
01:29:29,159 --> 01:29:34,260
there's a certain arrogance like I know this I don't you know I don't need to learn that

314
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:40,139
but having a desire to learn is this curiosity this openness like oh yeah is

315
01:29:40,139 --> 01:29:45,920
there something for me to learn here

316
01:29:46,199 --> 01:29:52,320
what is it that I don't quite See Clearly or I don't understand that my life keeps on turning out a way that I

317
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:59,100
don't quite want it to is there something that I have I don't

318
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:05,820
understand from a desire to learn one gains wisdom

319
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:12,360
if one is diligent and astute so it is a practice where we do have to

320
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:17,880
practice I wish right I think all of us wish that

321
01:30:17,880 --> 01:30:23,280
it were easy and fast and turn our life around or even have our life continue to

322
01:30:23,280 --> 01:30:29,960
go the way that we wanted to go or whatever it is but it is a practice

323
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:37,820
so one last thing that I'd like to say here actually is that

324
01:30:38,159 --> 01:30:43,860
it's not a um an accident that order that these

325
01:30:43,860 --> 01:30:49,320
questions are in so it's part of the way that these

326
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:56,120
things get I don't know preserved or written a composed

327
01:30:56,159 --> 01:31:03,500
that these four qualities are not only answers to avoca's questions these qualities of

328
01:31:03,780 --> 01:31:09,719
faith I have to I am reading two things at

329
01:31:09,719 --> 01:31:14,760
once Faith the Dharma well practiced truth is the sweetest of taste and

330
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:21,800
wisdom they're part of a sequence

331
01:31:22,380 --> 01:31:27,540
the sequence of practice that it begins with

332
01:31:27,540 --> 01:31:32,880
having enough confidence to begin than practicing the Dharma

333
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:39,719
having a commitment to the truth then this way we might understand the truth as in sometimes we might think of like

334
01:31:39,719 --> 01:31:44,760
mindfulness as the truth okay what's really happening here even if it's

335
01:31:44,760 --> 01:31:51,060
uncomfortable to see even if it's actually an uncomfortable experience but like if the understanding that we gain

336
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:57,120
about ourselves can be uncomfortable to learn things about ourselves it can be

337
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:03,179
hard and then live with wisdom so faith

338
01:32:03,179 --> 01:32:08,580
practicing the Dharma having a commitment to truth and living with wisdom

339
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:16,020
kind of goes in that direction it's not perfectly linear we'll have a little bit of four altogether but that is kind of

340
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:21,800
like the path of practice maybe in a nutshell that the Buddha is teaching to olivica

341
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:26,960
the Yucca olivica of Olivia

342
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:35,340
[Laughter] Faith practicing the Dharma having a

343
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:39,440
commitment to truth and living with wisdom

344
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:46,020
so I'll end there and I'll open it up to see are there some comments or questions

345
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:51,900
about this and as I was talking I was thinking like oh yes and you know what I

346
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:57,420
don't think I have it in this version of the notes the question is well what happened to olivica after he heard all

347
01:32:57,420 --> 01:33:04,679
that right right that's like such an obvious question and I don't have the quote here but

348
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:11,460
um How It Ends is that elephant decides he becomes a follower of the Buddha and

349
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:18,139
then he decides he's going to go teach all the other ogres Bachelor Dharma

350
01:33:18,139 --> 01:33:26,480
so there we go so I don't know if he becomes awakened or what I don't know but maybe

351
01:33:27,420 --> 01:33:33,179
it changes diet [Laughter] was he eating humans I don't know if he

352
01:33:33,179 --> 01:33:40,020
was actually eating humans right because he was throwing them across the river or making them insane or splitting their

353
01:33:40,020 --> 01:33:46,139
heart or something like this right so yeah there's another suit to where an ogre does eat humans but I don't think

354
01:33:46,139 --> 01:33:52,739
this one does I know it's kind of it's kind of right so you guys are laughing and smiling

355
01:33:52,739 --> 01:33:58,920
this is partly why I like this because it has a little bit of Whimsy to it but I'd like to open it up if there's

356
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:02,840
any questions or comments

357
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:16,560
hi uh thank you um so at first I when I heard this I thought oh this sound these are Universal principles but they also

358
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:22,320
sound very like Western I see I feel like everybody is chasing some kind of happiness or wisdom and truth and

359
01:34:22,320 --> 01:34:27,360
whatnot but that was kind of I was like oh it's still relevant today so I don't

360
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:32,400
know if it's progress or sort of us sitting idle but it was nice to hear

361
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:38,639
yeah yeah that's the part of the reason why I like it too is right because oh yeah I can relate to this we all want

362
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:44,159
these things and even though it's couched in this kind of funny story and from thousands of years ago yeah yeah I

363
01:34:44,159 --> 01:34:49,380
feel like myself 10 or 20 years ago I could still relate to it then and now and yeah

364
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:52,520
great thank you

365
01:34:58,679 --> 01:35:05,820
yeah just a comment I was super surprised that the Buddha said faith I thought he would say love or

366
01:35:05,820 --> 01:35:12,480
Compassion or something like that for humans greatest treasure so that was just like a surprise for me

367
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:19,440
thank you maybe I will say that this word faith said shows up in all kinds of lists

368
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:25,020
that's the list that you haven't really heard Derma teachers talk about there's just there's many of them and here's an

369
01:35:25,020 --> 01:35:30,840
interesting thing about faith that uh as I said it shows up in lots of lists and

370
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:38,639
just like it does in this list it's always the first and almost always wisdom is the last and

371
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:44,100
there's all kinds of different things in between so it's this movement of Faith

372
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:50,040
towards wisdom which leads to Freedom so just this idea of a path maybe is kind

373
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:57,179
of what's so maybe it's like the kernel that starts everything before the love and the Compassion maybe kind of Rise it

374
01:35:57,179 --> 01:36:02,400
has to start with just thinking that that it's possible maybe just start

375
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:08,040
thinking that it's possible to have love and come person and wisdom

376
01:36:08,040 --> 01:36:10,699
thank you

377
01:36:16,139 --> 01:36:21,560
anybody else have a question or

378
01:36:24,060 --> 01:36:29,520
okay so yeah yeah I think Lydia also has maybe Lydia

379
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:34,639
and then bill thank you

380
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:38,719
I'll make it fast bill

381
01:36:43,139 --> 01:36:48,300
thank you Diana so when you were talking about all this

382
01:36:48,300 --> 01:36:54,420
four questions by Race by yaka

383
01:36:54,420 --> 01:36:59,639
um I don't know how to link the first one but to me

384
01:36:59,639 --> 01:37:06,619
practice Dharma is to know the truth

385
01:37:06,920 --> 01:37:16,560
and to gain the wisdom is to know the truth also and it's

386
01:37:16,560 --> 01:37:22,320
practicing Dharma filled all the three because

387
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:28,080
to me the wisdom of the Buddhism seems like the three characteristics you were

388
01:37:28,080 --> 01:37:36,178
talking about and they're so tightly linked

389
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:44,040
um but but I'm not sure about the face like you said seems after

390
01:37:44,040 --> 01:37:51,860
to be the seed and then you know one step at a time

391
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:57,719
and maybe he talked about faith because he was talking to an ogre maybe he started there

392
01:37:57,719 --> 01:38:03,780
right okay we have to start you know with a simple what's you know the first step you might think about that

393
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:10,560
but I appreciate truth Dharma wisdom rights they kind of yeah they're all linked

394
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:17,100
and so I'm not quite understand what the ogre mean oh

395
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:23,540
um a troll like somebody that lives under uh an ogre is like a monster

396
01:38:23,540 --> 01:38:32,239
a uh I don't know does anybody have a what's a good word for ocher shrekler now I understand

397
01:38:32,239 --> 01:38:37,280
thank you Shrek thank you I wouldn't have thought of that

398
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:44,100
orc orc laughs

399
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:54,060
um well I didn't start with faith started with sort of desperation like

400
01:38:54,060 --> 01:38:59,520
gotta be some way to be happy I haven't tried this yet whoever got to

401
01:38:59,520 --> 01:39:05,580
lose right but uh maybe it's just this time there had to

402
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:12,300
be a tiny little bit of faith in order for you to come back the second time well it just worked

403
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:18,060
okay so then but then so your faith wasn't completely because you had no

404
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:24,360
data right you had this I'm like oh yeah it worked I'm gonna keep on coming back but still the the faith to think like

405
01:39:24,360 --> 01:39:30,600
okay it can continue to work well yeah it was just sort of like

406
01:39:30,600 --> 01:39:35,820
evidence though like yeah there we go that's the word I'm looking for evidence you had evidence yeah uh-huh and that's

407
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:43,199
exactly what's we're being asked to do we're not asked to just believe blind yeah yeah

408
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:51,360
although um and however hazy and unformed and

409
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:57,540
ill-defined a manner I did always

410
01:39:57,540 --> 01:40:03,179
I have this idea that it was somehow important for us

411
01:40:03,179 --> 01:40:10,340
for each person to try to become a better person

412
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:17,520
and go as far with that as you could and that it was also somehow important

413
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:24,060
for all people to try to form a better Society yeah

414
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:31,139
um and where that came from don't know still don't know maybe there's a little

415
01:40:31,139 --> 01:40:37,500
bit of a faith element in that uh and kind of a innate

416
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:43,920
feeling that this is important does that sound like Faith or does it

417
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:49,500
sound like something else sounds like maybe it's that you have

418
01:40:49,500 --> 01:40:55,800
faith in the human capacity or to do that and that it wasn't that it's

419
01:40:55,800 --> 01:41:02,760
important that it's important somehow whether this importance is something we're making up for us out there

420
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:07,920
somewhere don't know but but that if there's such thing as a

421
01:41:07,920 --> 01:41:13,860
purpose in life some reason for us to be here that's it

422
01:41:13,860 --> 01:41:20,599
does that sound like something different yeah it sounds a little a little bit different

423
01:41:22,739 --> 01:41:28,380
I think what's being pointed here it's like this idea of like okay I have this

424
01:41:28,380 --> 01:41:34,500
little this makes sense to me and I have some a little bit of evidence that this is going to work and therefore I'm going

425
01:41:34,500 --> 01:41:40,380
to continue that's kind of what that's being pointed to here um I have two more questions but they're

426
01:41:40,380 --> 01:41:45,980
really brief one is which suit is this and secondly where do you find these uh

427
01:41:45,980 --> 01:41:52,219
commentaries I have never seen them anywhere yeah so this is

428
01:41:52,219 --> 01:41:56,219
110 apata

429
01:41:57,619 --> 01:42:04,020
110 and the commentary to this is the only commentary that I know of that is

430
01:42:04,020 --> 01:42:10,260
translated into English so that's why you haven't seen them it's because they're just not there they just don't

431
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:16,139
they're not oh they're still not translated that's right oh where do you find them

432
01:42:16,139 --> 01:42:22,860
well this one this commentary is translated this is the only one have you seen like biker body he has this the

433
01:42:22,860 --> 01:42:27,900
student about is like literally like four inches thick and the actual suit

434
01:42:27,900 --> 01:42:33,300
does like you know quarter inch and the commentary is thrown oh yes yes yes yes

435
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:40,739
