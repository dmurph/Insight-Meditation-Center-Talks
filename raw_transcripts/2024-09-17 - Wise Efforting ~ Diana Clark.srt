1
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:09,280
welcome welcome you know what can we turn the volume just a tiny bit

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:16,000
higher just because I I don't want to I'm I'm getting a little lazy with these

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,960
microphones I don't want to project my voice I think this is good thank you thank you

4
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:31,239
Jim so good evening I was uh thinking about uh this

5
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,600
Bell when the bell rings there was a time when I first started uh a

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:44,000
meditation practice and then I would come to like group sits like this and I would be like holding on for dear life

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,920
just waiting for the boring and the bell would ring and like oh thank goodness know this kind of this

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:56,000
feeling I didn't even notice really how much I was like couldn't wait for that Bell to

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,120
ring maybe I was in like some physical discomfort or or uh maybe just some

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,320
mental discomfort or there would be times when

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,840
I would uh realize uh that you know again I'd be in a setting where other

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,960
people are meditating and there would be a just I don't know what would happen

13
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:25,439
but something I like oh I can't meditate and then I just said okay well I guess I'm just going to sit here and I would

14
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,880
just like just totally stop uh meditating pretend to meditate I was

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,600
trying not to wiggle too much but you can't help it when you're not meditating you're just shifting your weight around

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,159
and I remember um reporting this to a teacher that I would just like give up and then just

17
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,000
wait for the Bell to ring and this teacher told me you know you're not what

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,280
you're actually doing there is cultivating a verion just this you know waiting

19
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:04,079
wanting something to happen that's not there so there's this way in which we can

20
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:10,319
practice you know with this effort or you know really striving hard or really

21
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,040
just being kind of laxidasical maybe about it or there's way in which we're

22
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:23,360
kind of present not completely present but not completely lost in thought

23
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,440
either so I'd like to talk a little bit about this uh tonight this uh idea about

24
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,360
about balanced efforting like the right amount we might say wise

25
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:44,519
efforting and this is certainly part of the art of practice is to know like how much like

26
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:53,040
efforting to be doing even like the whole notion of efforting what does it mean to apply effort to a mindfulness

27
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:00,599
practice to a meditation practice and it's not uncommon for

28
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:05,879
to uh be a little bit over efforting this sense that we're straining or

29
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,959
striving and maybe we don't notice it so much in like a 30 minute sit like uh we

30
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:18,599
did tonight but when you're on a Meditation Retreat and you're doing sit after sit after sit you just start to

31
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,239
run out of energy like what happened get exhausted and you're but

32
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,400
all you're doing is just sitting and so you start to notice oh

33
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:34,439
yeah there's this draining there's this quiet

34
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:40,080
striving this pushing and of course we bring this to

35
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,280
our meditation practice because chances are we've been doing this type of uh way

36
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,159
of achieving attaining in other areas of our life and our professional life and

37
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:58,159
our academic life with our Hobbies with the almost most Endeavors that we do

38
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,439
there's a certain amount of like pushing that we do to get through to

39
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:09,200
make it to the end of it or to achieve

40
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,840
something and you know in some ways there is a little bit of having to apply

41
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,160
some effort but it's really kind of we might say it's kind of like riding a

42
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:28,240
bicycle where you know in the beginning you have to Pedal you have to apply some effort but then you can

43
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,360
coast and there can be a way in which ere efforting then we get out of breath

44
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:40,120
and we can't go so far on the bicycle but if we are pedling in such a way that

45
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:47,199
it's sustainable then actually then we can uh ride our bikes further and in all maybe

46
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:54,520
different types of uh terrain through the city and out of the city and into the country and to the next town and

47
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,800
these types of things because meditation practice I

48
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,560
mean we're here and we're doing a formal 30 minutes and with a beginning and an

49
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,960
end and there's certainly some real benefits to that but there's also you

50
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:19,400
know mindfulness practice that we're doing in our daily life that is just being embodied for our life being

51
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:27,199
present for our life bringing a certain amount of awareness a certain amount of attention a certain amount of

52
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:34,160
mindfulness so there's the amount of effort to do during a formal meditation period as well as this type of effort to

53
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,199
do when we're um expanding the mindfulness to be in our daily

54
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:48,639
life and they're related of course they are maybe I'll just say in a daily life

55
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:56,120
there's uh it's less common that there's uh a lot of serious

56
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:03,360
straining in our meditation practice when I mean by daily life is like just bringing some mindfulness to some of our

57
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:11,960
activities in particular some people find it easiest to do this on activities that have a that are we do a lot or that

58
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:18,240
have a certain repetitious n nature to them obvious examples are doing the

59
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,680
dishes brushing one's teeth or folding clothes there's something where that has

60
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,680
this certain uh uh Rhythm to it so chances with those type of

61
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:37,800
activities we have just this light sense of being

62
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:45,199
embodied and then part of the question is and that maybe I should back up and say and that light sense of being

63
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,080
embodied it's a tremendous way to really like bring some fullness to our lives

64
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,560
instead of to just be mindlessly just going through our lives as if it didn't

65
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,680
matter what we did we what matters more is what uh we're cooking up in our

66
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:14,879
minds but there's this way in which this um this more uh gentle type of

67
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:23,039
mindfulness that we bring to daily life is appropriate for being the more formal

68
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:30,120
City uh in a sitting meditation

69
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,680
because there is this way in which uh straining we don't we might not even

70
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,319
recognize it but what's fueling the straining is this subtle sense

71
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:51,520
of whatever's Happening Here is not okay I have to go find something else I have

72
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:58,360
to go make something else happen so either we don't want to be

73
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:04,120
experiencing something so there's this very subtle way like we're kind of like

74
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:10,639
dismissing whatever experiences we're having thinking that the next moment's going to be better so there's this kind

75
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:17,479
of like this straining this leaning into a certain amount of uh greetin for the

76
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:24,000
next moment because we don't like what's happening

77
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,479
here and there's this way this I'll use this language kind of like greetin for the next moment

78
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:36,518
is really also tied up with this strong sense of me like I like things this way

79
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:42,760
I don't like things that way I like it when it's quiet my body is

80
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,519
uh perfectly comfortable and meditation period is not too

81
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:56,560
long of course but you know how often does that happen and you know this meditation

82
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,959
practice is so much about being able to show up for our life life no matter what

83
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:07,680
is happening no matter what is

84
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:19,360
happening so even if we might have the sense like I don't want this or we might have the sense that I do want that and

85
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,320
that's another way in which we are can be this straining there's a sense of

86
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,959
effort and this often we wouldn't even notice that we're having this sense of effort unless maybe we compared it to

87
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:42,279
practice in daily life or we pra or we compared it to an experience we have

88
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:48,519
when we've been on a Meditation Retreat maybe some longer meditation and we have

89
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:54,360
this feeling like oh yeah okay we've been riding the bicycle and now there's a certain amount of coasting there's a

90
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,800
certain amount of momentum that arises and this is a natural thing that

91
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:05,959
happens this uh momentum you know just a few moments of mindfulness they start to

92
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:15,680
support one another and then there doesn't have to be any effort so much anymore it's just mindfulness is

93
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:25,079
arising so how can we apply the right amount of effort that the practice is

94
00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:30,760
nourishing and supportive and sustainable

95
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:36,639
and not something that turns into a grim Duty I'm supposed to do this because

96
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:42,800
it's good for me like you know eating our V taking our

97
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,839
vitamins eating whatever vegetables we don't like but we think are good for us

98
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,720
or some doing some exercise that we think that we should do that we don't really want we don't want meditation to

99
00:10:53,720 --> 00:11:00,160
turn into something like that but then you know the risk is that okay well then we're just and to chase

100
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:05,959
whatever it is that uh makes meditation

101
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,800
pleasurable so I would say that meditation is about practicing in a way

102
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:20,480
or maybe persevering in a way that has in a relaxed

103
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:27,079
Manner and this relaxed manner is a lot about being

104
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:35,040
receptive to what's arising as to as as opposed to going out and you

105
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:42,160
know connecting with something and really working to stay with that object there are times in which that

106
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,600
style of practice is appropriate and there's times when also when this style of practice of just

107
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:56,079
being more receptive like there's a sense of receiving the objects of meditation

108
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,959
receiving the experience of the breath receiving the

109
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:07,560
sounds and this way of receiving is a way in which there isn't

110
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:15,920
so much a sense of preferences isn't so much a sense of I want this I don't want that but it's a

111
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,639
more of a sense of allowing and accepting and like just noticing what is

112
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:29,040
the next thing that's being noticed

113
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,600
this has a very different flavor to practice in this

114
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:43,320
way this idea of being receptive one way one way in which it's

115
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:52,279
a different is that really highlights actually how little effort is

116
00:12:52,839 --> 00:13:01,120
required if I were to ask you right now to just feel the sensations in your right hand

117
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,440
what does it feel like to have a right

118
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:14,880
hand that doesn't take so much effort you just kind of like inclined the mind

119
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:22,760
there it was just a slight amount of effort and so this kind of more this

120
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:30,000
receptive style allows this more just a uh a light amount of effort efor that

121
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,399
then we can be uh more continuous or

122
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:42,120
have this uh um more consistent and perseverance with this with this light

123
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:49,079
amount of effort that allows this momentum to

124
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,000
build because if we are trying to have a particular

125
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,480
experience for trying to avoid something there's a way in which we will over

126
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:09,240
effort there's a way in which we will strain or strive to get rid of that

127
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:17,560
discomfort in the knee or just get rid of the sound of the neighbor's dog

128
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:23,880
barking have you ever tried to do that there's a way in which we often are

129
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:30,440
like oh I could meditate if only that thing that sound weren't happening

130
00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:36,079
there's a way in which and then we try to strain even harder to uh you know be

131
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:41,279
with okay just be with this and not noticing that actually what we could do

132
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:48,480
is just be with annoyance feels like this and just be with that experience

133
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:56,279
kind of like receive or be tuned into in a subtle way frustration feels like

134
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:02,120
this irritation feels like this and just turned it into that's what's

135
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:07,360
being known next and that way we don't have to fight

136
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:14,560
with what's happening and we don't have to like over effort we don't have to strain and

137
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:22,839
strive I I've have told this story quite a few times but there was a time when I was on a long

138
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,959
retreat and I just somehow got it in my mind that I had to work harder work

139
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:35,079
harder work harder it didn't matter what I was doing like it was not enough for this sense of just being insufficient

140
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:42,279
whatever I was doing I got a little crazy I just got a little I'll just say this that I just

141
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:47,959
got so tense and irritated I ended up hating everybody and everything it was

142
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:53,199
just CU like oh I'm trying to meditate and the teachers uh you know after weeks

143
00:15:53,199 --> 00:16:00,560
they watching me do this they're like okay D just stop just go out for a hike you need to be out walking in nature for

144
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,240
like hours like oh okay okay I just hadn't

145
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:13,240
realized how like I was just straining and striving and you know I was I don't know I just felt like that's what I was

146
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:18,839
supposed to do on a long Meditation Retreat but it's it's not like that

147
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,160
instead it's more like no no you just have this build this momentum and then

148
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,519
on especially on Retreats it's not only while you're sitting but it's while you're getting up from the sit and then

149
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,399
walking and then eating and you know everything is like

150
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:42,880
that so it can be helpful to just have in

151
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:51,519
mind the sense that with practice to see if the Mind itself is

152
00:16:51,519 --> 00:17:00,680
relaxed there's this way in which we kind of notice what does it feel like when the mind is relaxed

153
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:08,240
there this sense of spaciousness and this sense of ease there's also but

154
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:13,798
implicit in that and this is also really subtle is the sense of like trusting

155
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,880
that the next object of mindfulness is going to

156
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:26,280
arise we don't have to go get it we can just be receptive and it's going to

157
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:31,640
arise the next sound the next bodily

158
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:38,440
sensation if we're practicing in this way that's open awareness maybe I should have said that earlier this is a

159
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:43,640
different with this receptive uh way of practicing we're not

160
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:50,880
choosing the different objects we're just allowing the objects to arise you can also do this flavor if

161
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,400
your flavor of kind of receptive awareness if the breath there's a way you can incline the Mind towards the

162
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:02,640
breath but also a way in which which you're receiving it instead of going out

163
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:12,360
there and jumping on it or grabbing it so if you notice that the mind is not

164
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:19,960
relaxed what are some of the things that you can do or if the or if there's if you notice there's some

165
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:30,760
efforting one thing is maybe just uh take a breath like a larger breath like

166
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,559
you know and just kind of like this big exhale and get embodied back into the

167
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:43,000
feel the bodily experience and then just rest attention

168
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,600
on what's happening in the body this moment because often the straining is

169
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,200
not in this moment it's about I have to get somewhere or I have to avoid

170
00:18:54,200 --> 00:19:01,799
something so that's one things to do maybe this can to re uh mind oneself

171
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:09,559
that no we just have to take this practice one moment at a

172
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:14,760
time just have to meet the next moment that doesn't take very much

173
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,960
effort just the next moment for me on those long Retreats

174
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:26,799
this is something I do not recommend that I was there for uh number of months

175
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:32,919
and then right you know we just meditate all day so it's hundreds of meditation periods right and I was counting down

176
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:41,480
like oh 624 more to go and I was just making myself

177
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:46,760
crazy it says that we just have to just meet the next moment that's all that's

178
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,799
all that's been us just the next moment and there's a way in which that doesn't

179
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:57,360
feel burdensome and it doesn't feel oppressive just like oh just the next

180
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:04,919
moment and then it can be helpful to there's a

181
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:10,440
way in which um with a meditation practice there can

182
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:17,480
be a way that um the attitude that we have that we're bringing towards the

183
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,880
meditation practice can have a big

184
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:29,360
impact and so it can be helpful to have a sense of like well why not okay

185
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,440
just just I I'll okay I'll just be present for this like why

186
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:41,080
not because sometimes often what happens is we might have this little rebellious or maybe I should speak for myself

187
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:48,360
sometimes I have this rebellious like attitude like I don't want to simply because somebody told me to or because

188
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,679
it's what I'm supposed to do or something I often have this little bit of a

189
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,440
resistance but what would it be like to just like well why not I I'll just give

190
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:06,039
it a go I'm just going to be present for the next moment why not just the next

191
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:11,360
moment so these ways are these these attitudes and which can be a big support

192
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,960
and the way that we are I don't know being able to sustain a meditation

193
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:24,880
practice not only during the meditation period but at home when we bring this at

194
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:33,159
home cuz there's a way in which um we might have this sense that uh to

195
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:38,679
practice maybe in English it's often we have this sense of practice is to exert

196
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:46,159
oneself so even we use this language right you know I have a meditation practice or something like that but

197
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:53,760
really the having this steadiness with the attention is really

198
00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:01,279
can be really beneficial because we start to see what our our minds do we start to understand

199
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:09,120
some of the attitudes of the mind or we start to recognize some of the habits and patterns of the mind if we can bring

200
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:16,320
mindfulness to more and more parts of our life or just even uh more consistently

201
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,720
during the meditation period there's a if there's a certain amount of mindfulness then we're less likely to be

202
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,120
completely lost in thought and you know out in wherever it is that uh the Mind

203
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,480
goes likes to go so to help support like practicing

204
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,880
with a balanced amount of effort I've been talking about not too much striving maybe I'll just say also the

205
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:48,159
opposite of too much striving can be this uh like a laxidasical kind of sense

206
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:54,640
of like yeah yeah okay mindful I'll get to it later but right now I having this juicy thought or I have to solve this

207
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:02,559
problem or I have to remember the grocery list or I'm going to to uh indulge in this fantasy or something

208
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,919
it's not uncommon also to have this idea like yeah a little bit later I know I'm supposed to be mindful but yeah I'll do

209
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:15,600
it later and I hadn't really noticed how also early in my meditation practice I

210
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:23,200
would do this until um I Heard a talk by Joseph Goldstein he's one of the elders in this

211
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:29,320
tradition and he has this expression uh more or less mindful

212
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:35,720
like kind of mindful like yeah more or less a little bit you know lost in thought and a

213
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,880
little bit present and he was pointing to why not just be completely

214
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,760
present it's there's a way in which it can be really supportive for our life

215
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,520
and for our practice so what can support this

216
00:23:53,520 --> 00:24:01,279
balanced effort is one way is to just learn what what are our patterns what

217
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:06,520
are our patterns that we bring to tasks in

218
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:14,000
general often they're like these patterns or some of the attitudes that we bring aren't necessarily obvious but

219
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:21,400
they're having an impact on us because there might be a way in which

220
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:27,000
um you could even just uh inquire when you realize that I was going to be talking about

221
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,799
efforting was was there a subtle sense that you said like oh great I I know

222
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:38,200
that I need to effort more I I want to hear how how much I need to effort more

223
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,880
or maybe you have this idea like oh really effort I feel overwhelmed already

224
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:51,039
with all the stuff I have to do I have to apply effort to practice or maybe you had a response

225
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:58,919
somebody like what is she talking about I don't even really know this whole idea of effort I just sit down and meditate

226
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:04,679
so maybe those three are three different extremes but just notice like what kind

227
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:11,679
of an attitude you have towards effort I know I I told you about how

228
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:17,720
like I was over efforting and I see how uh this shows up in other areas of my

229
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,640
life just recently I was uh doing a hike with a friend and it was it was a long

230
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:30,120
hike for me it was a long hike and uh you know the last bit I was

231
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:35,600
tired and so I was like walking faster I got to get finish this thing I got to

232
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:42,520
you know push to get this thing through finished to get there my friend was like why are you walking so fast I just want

233
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:48,039
to be done so there's this kind of like my way of pushing but some other people you

234
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:54,600
know might have a different way that's when there's a sense of uh I need to do

235
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:00,200
something so one way to have balance Balan effort with your meditation

236
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:07,000
practice is just to be aware of what are your patterns what are ways that you often

237
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,279
are showing up when there's something to be

238
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:17,320
done and just knowing about it can maybe

239
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:22,480
help sensitize you to noticing when you find yourself doing something like that

240
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:29,320
in your meditation practice you don't have to change it you don't have to make it different but there's a way in which

241
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:36,200
just knowing what some of our patterns are is uh can be really helpful just as

242
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:43,320
I said kind of sensitize it and maybe I'll say that if you notice

243
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,880
that there's a like a lot of like striving or wanting

244
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,760
to uh attain things it might be that there's some fear underneath that's

245
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:02,480
fueling that might be might not be too but it might be a little bit of fear of

246
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:08,960
uh backsliding or fear of feeling regret if I don't really put all this effort in

247
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,880
or a fear of missing out or or a fear of

248
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,399
becoming a slug and people taking advantage of me or something like this

249
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:28,200
so maybe there's some fear that's underneath the striving pattern or maybe there's doubt that's

250
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,360
underneath uh maybe this more I'll use this word laxidasical

251
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:41,120
uh pattern maybe there's doubt about is this really what I should be doing is

252
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:48,600
this valuable is this just a sense of hesitation is maybe I can't even really

253
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:54,360
do this maybe this is not what's best for me or something like

254
00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:01,240
that and these are just things to consider to be be curious about you don't have to find the answer to this

255
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:06,399
but again sometimes recognizing that what's underneath fueling some of our

256
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:14,240
patterns can help uh take some of the authority out of uh these

257
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,720
patterns so something else that can support having a balanced effort is to

258
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:28,799
remind ourselves of why are you doing this in the first place maybe I should reword that

259
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:34,080
just what maybe to tune into what are your

260
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:40,398
aspirations like what is it that's motivating you or inspiring

261
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:46,519
you cuz sometimes it can be like we're just wanting to feel better and we're

262
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:52,519
doing anything we can so we're trying to avoid what's uncomfortable and Chase what's

263
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:59,240
Pleasant I mean that works when it works until it doesn't but most of the time it doesn't

264
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:05,080
and this practice is about just learning to have some steadiness no matter what's

265
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:11,399
arising so maybe to have some balanced effort is to tune into again our

266
00:29:11,399 --> 00:29:17,240
aspirations of why we're practicing this wish for greater Freedom this wish for

267
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:23,039
greater ease or peace or whatever it might be for

268
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:33,000
you something else that can help with having a balanced sense of effort is to

269
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,919
check in with the way that our sense of our self is tied in with how much

270
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:48,440
efforting we do again and this is tied in with our patterns but we could just uh drop in a

271
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:55,120
question we could ask ourselves who would I be if I weren't

272
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,360
making this amount of effort who would I be if I weren't making this

273
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:09,159
amount of effort I know this is an odd question but it's something that you just drop

274
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:14,919
in and then maybe just listen to see if there's any answers so we don't have to

275
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:22,519
find the answers we don't have to look for the answers we're just dropping in a question and it's a way of kind of just

276
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:28,159
bringing some curiosity to the experience

277
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:34,559
because there's often a way that our sense of self is really tied up with

278
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:41,840
well I'm the one who gets things done or I'm the one who often leaves things

279
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:49,039
undone or I'm the one that procrastinates a lot or there's a way in which we might have part of our identity

280
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:55,240
is could be related to effort and part of the what this

281
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:00,960
practice points to is to have a flexible idea identity not to identify just only

282
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,240
one way maybe it's a appropriate to have a lot of effort or in certain situations

283
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:12,679
but not in other situations and can we have this

284
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:20,919
flexibility so whatever you recognize about yourself about your patterns or

285
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:28,120
this idea of who you would be if you weren't making that amount of effort the

286
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:33,679
point is to just meet it with kindness just to meet it with

287
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:42,159
uh compassion and awareness like oh okay this practice is so much about just

288
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:50,519
understanding ourselves better and understanding how some of the ways in which we constrict our possibilities and

289
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:55,559
some of the ways in which we blame ourselves or beat ourselves up

290
00:31:55,559 --> 00:32:00,799
and that's not the way that's going to support having a practice and having a

291
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:07,080
life that is nourishing and supportive so with this inquiries

292
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:13,600
there's no need to be harsh on ourselves we're just maybe being

293
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:19,399
Anthropologist in some kind of way and just learning

294
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:24,440
about ourselves and how we're showing up in the

295
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:32,399
world so wise efforting often it can be this sense of like

296
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:37,559
receiving objects and that can be just with open awareness with whatever object it

297
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:43,320
is sound bodily sensation breath thought

298
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:49,399
emotion or it could there can be a sense if we're doing like a combination of directed and received like I'm going to

299
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:56,760
do mindfulness of the sensations of breathing but there's a way in which we're receiving them instead of going

300
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:02,080
out and getting them this is a subtle movement but it allows

301
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:11,240
some more sustainability with a meditation practice so that when the bell rings there's just like oh Bell

302
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:17,000
just noticing the sounds and then realize oh yeah that's the end and

303
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,159
opening your eyes instead of holding on like when is this going to be

304
00:33:23,159 --> 00:33:32,000
over so I'll end there and open it up to see if there are some questions or

305
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,480
comments right back

306
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:54,480
here my question is for me personally I find I'm I'm most at peace

307
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:02,240
when I'm not making any effort and just kind of like resting chilling out relaxing so not

308
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,679
eorting maybe in a good one eorting a bad way but just not efforting at all and just kind of like being there I find

309
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:16,158
that at least for me personally everybody's different but that's when I feel the most Mindful and can you describe like what

310
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:23,440
is the experience of mindfulness for you then resting resting just completely chilling out not trying to be anything

311
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:31,440
or anyone and and and I find in those moments when I'm not efforting at all all and I can't I don't do it that often

312
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:38,520
to be honest but every once in a while like if I'm at the beach or there's a sunset or maybe I'm with a friend who I

313
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:45,280
really care about and there's like a moment where I find like I'm just not eorting at all I'm just resting in that

314
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:51,200
moment and and I find that's when I feel like I'm the most awake so just being

315
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,599
present for what's happening yeah just just letting letting go of everything and just kind of just being there you

316
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:03,839
know nice nice so maybe that's pointing to kind of like just the receptive just like just being with whatever there is

317
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:12,040
right there because sometimes I tend to overthink the spiritual path like think that I can think my way into more peace

318
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:19,280
and I think it I feel the best one I'm just keeping it the most simple yeah the simpler so great I appreciate that

319
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:26,480
simple simple is good yeah yeah thank you thank you anybody else have a comment or

320
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:34,599
question okay hi I'm Jay um and I know I think

321
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:39,760
this all goes back to a time when there was no writing right it was an oral tradition there was no writing at all

322
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:46,960
that's right so my question is this which is and I've been sort of I know once experimenting with it with

323
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,319
this when I'm meditating I can track my thoughts on paper right we tend to not

324
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:59,319
do it in this tradition so I'm just curious if this any value or have people tried it meaning as I'm meditating let's

325
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:04,760
say distracting thought comes and then I write it down then I go back to the breath wait wait maybe I get distracted

326
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:11,880
I forget about then I come back new you know and I can so I was wondering if there's any value in that or is it like

327
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:18,440
there's some inherent value in not doing it which is why people don't do it I see yeah well I I don't I haven't done this

328
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:25,240
practice so I don't know can you tell me what happens after so you have a thought then you write it down and what happens

329
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:32,040
after you write it down so then when I finish I going and look and it looks like like a crazy like there's no for me

330
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:39,280
uh when I look it's there's no pattern or there's no I think the craziness the craziness of it jumps out like my God

331
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,760
what is this all over the map you know and I've done it just like three or four times it's just to see what that feels

332
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,920
like like I was concerned that it would you know I like it would disturb my set

333
00:36:51,920 --> 00:37:00,280
right it's not a solid 30- minute set because I'm going in and out but just wanted to see what the effect was um and

334
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:06,359
whether over time if I did it it might actually help me be more mindful you know I don't know what the long-term

335
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:12,560
effect is if I keep trying it and have people done it you know because I rarely hear anybody doing it I it's just like

336
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:19,000
you know it doesn't matter the reason is because sometimes a whole sit can go and I'm barely there if I don't do this I

337
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:26,920
feel like I've lost 30 minutes you know and I'm gone like or I maybe I'll come back like three times you know for the whole set yeah I I can see that part of

338
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:35,599
the value we start to see you use the word craziness the craziness of our thoughts yeah it's helpful to see that

339
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,640
for them to lose some of their Authority because often you know thoughts we feel like oh they're so important we have to

340
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,680
pay attention to them and they're we're going to solve something but when we really start to look at the content we

341
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:53,160
start to see oh there's a tremendous amount of repetition and there's this tremendous amount of you know going all

342
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:58,880
these different places and maybe uh you're writing it down helped to see that

343
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:06,000
um and so in this tradition we don't write them down um

344
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,880
but I could see where it would be helpful to just recognize maybe like the

345
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:18,200
the I like this word craziness right because when we really

346
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:24,920
start to pay attention we start to see that so and then then uh then maybe the

347
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:30,200
Allure of being lost in thoughts start starts to go away starts to diminish and

348
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:36,880
then we could just say oh I might as well just be here with this moment thank you to I I don't have a

349
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,960
good reason why we don't yeah and the reason I mentioned the original context

350
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:49,440
was I was wondering if writing was available at the time maybe Buddha would have said write it down or something I

351
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,240
see so I don't know I'm just speculating you know yeah so uh writing existed but

352
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:01,200
it wasn't uh it was used just by a few people for accounting purposes for like

353
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:07,200
merchants or you know for taxes or something like this and it was really considered certainly not anything that

354
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,440
people used to share information or certainly not in a religious uh context

355
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,280
or something like that that didn't happen until hundreds of years later

356
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:33,240
hi so I think uh in the talk at some point you mentioned uh this idea of

357
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:40,640
there's a time for uh meditations where you focus on you can focus on an object

358
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:48,800
and then there's time kind of just supposing that there's meditations where you just try and accept what is um I

359
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:55,119
feel like my practice has been halfhazard sometimes I am uh accepting and then other times I'm

360
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:01,240
trying to focus um um curious um what's maybe a

361
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:07,760
good way to think about like you know when is it a time for you know the the more focused

362
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,240
meditation versus the accepting or maybe other kinds but yeah great thank you

363
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:19,280
that's a good question um I would say that it differs

364
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,200
for different people for some people they uh to be more relaxed and receptive

365
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:32,040
just works best for them and that's their entire practice that they don't have this more uh focused you choose an

366
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:38,640
object and stay in the object they more they they might say that the object is

367
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,560
um awareness itself so they might say like the object is I'm using this

368
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,920
awareness and then they're noticing like oh here's a sound like here's a sensation here's a another sound or

369
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:57,520
something like this so they're just being aware of awareness we could say

370
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:04,599
and some other people would say no we I'm just going to like choose like the breath for example I'm just going to stay on the breath breath breath breath

371
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:10,440
so this one aware of awareness is more receptive and the more objectoriented

372
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:16,200
one is a little bit more directed and so um often people will do a little bit

373
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:22,720
more directed to help the Mind settle because that takes a little bit more effort so if there's if you're feeling

374
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:29,920
like oh my gosh this mind is everywhere and I can't settle down they might like stay with the breath for for certain

375
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:37,680
duration until certain settl ARS arise and then um open up and just like

376
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,760
receive some people will do the opposite they want to just uh like okay the

377
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:49,800
mind's all over the place I'm not even going to try to direct it I'm just going to notice what's happening and they'll

378
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:56,560
have a little bit more uh receptive and then there starts to be a little bit of settling and then they want to get

379
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:03,760
concentrated so then they'll choose a particular object and just stay with that so my answer I guess is like

380
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:11,400
different people have different uh propensities I would say some people it's easier to be with um with just like

381
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:18,319
awareness and having bunch of different objects as opposed to just one different object and I'll say it also depends on

382
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:25,119
you know if you're objectives if you want to get concentrated yeah you know having said

383
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:31,240
that you can get concentrated both both ways

384
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:37,319
um thank you yeah maybe I'll also say I think of it that way so I'm sorry what

385
00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:44,280
was that I didn't think of it that way you didn't think you had a different question that I'm not even answering no no you are I didn't think of it that you

386
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:50,160
could um I thought you kind of pick one type or one style throughout the meditation

387
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,599
and I didn't realize that even like awareness itself could be the object yeah

388
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:05,520
but great great thank you anybody else have a comment or

389
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:22,559
question okay so thank you all and I wish you a lovely rest of the evening

390
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:25,760
thank you
