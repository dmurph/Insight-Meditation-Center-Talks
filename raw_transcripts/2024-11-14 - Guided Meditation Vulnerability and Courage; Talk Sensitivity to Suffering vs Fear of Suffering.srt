1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,519
okay welcome uh welcome friends so

2
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:20,760
um yeah nice to uh nice to be with you and uh let's uh let's practice

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,960
together e

4
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:06,479
so get uh get

5
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:13,520
cozy but not too

6
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:37,040
cozy so relax relaxed but a kind of energetic openness

7
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,439
to Body

8
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,000
Mind we've asked the question a million times what is it

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,520
like to be human but with a kind of

10
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:19,159
fresh interest curiosity we ask again

11
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,159
sincerity is the willingness to be

12
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:50,800
surprised by experience by the moment by life

13
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,319
we can never really

14
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:29,359
anticipate when Insight will arise

15
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,000
so we just stay evenly suspended over this

16
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,959
moment breathing

17
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,879
relaxing waking

18
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
up

19
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
e

20
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
e

21
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
e

22
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,639
e e

23
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:57,759
we emphasize uh tenderness and

24
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,120
vulnerability the intimacy with

25
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,879
experience but what's sometimes gets lost in that is

26
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:16,360
the vulnerability is what

27
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,720
confers

28
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,960
power strength

29
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,800
courage braced against

30
00:07:51,800 --> 00:08:01,080
pain uncertainty that yields a kind of um brittle fake power

31
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,560
but really becoming porest to the

32
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,479
moment letting imperfections flow

33
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:25,520
through this softens our

34
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,440
heart but deepens or

35
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,240
power soothes our fear

36
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,920
all right

37
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
e e

38
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:34,880
our heart undefended Body Mind undefended against samsara

39
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:42,399
undefended against the the intensity of The Human Condition

40
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:50,920
but undefended doesn't uh lose its

41
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,240
Center doesn't misplace its strength

42
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,000
what doesn't and breaks the song lyric

43
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,560
goes so yeah flexible

44
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:49,760
fluid that's what uh permits

45
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,639
strength strength of our Clarity of our love

46
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:29,639
just see if you can uh attune attune to a kind of felt sense

47
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:34,920
of your

48
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
power

49
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

50
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

51
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

52
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

53
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

54
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,880
for for

55
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:41,559
we cultivate a a certain kind of courage in meeting uh This

56
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:50,280
Moment knowing that the Winds of feeling will blow but they won't blow anything

57
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,280
over

58
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:13,039
the energetic openness conveyed in our posture openness of our

59
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,200
chest come with May

60
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,159
I make my heart available to the moment

61
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:12,720
Aristotle said between recklessness and cowardice lies

62
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:27,720
courage so find that meeting this

63
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
moment

64
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

65
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

66
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

67
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

68
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

69
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

70
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,480
e e

71
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:02,120
when you ink at nothing the LC goes got nothing to

72
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:10,480
lose dharmically meditatively maybe we say

73
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,440
when you claim no

74
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:25,559
territory nothing to defend you surrender this somethingness

75
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:30,240
of your being up to awareness

76
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,679
there no uh no more

77
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,440
defensiveness but a lot of

78
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
confidence

79
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

80
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

81
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

82
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

83
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

84
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
e e

85
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,080
for e

86
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,039
okay

87
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:14,679
so I'm not uh not a temperamentally patient person that's not my par of me

88
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:23,600
you know and when I'm doing something uh I don't like like the

89
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:32,000
dishes it's not a dignified scene tignan would not be impressed how I wash

90
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:40,200
dishes um someone said to me uh you wash dishes like Poseidon in a bad

91
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:46,799
mood that's the god of sea and

92
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,799
storms but in other

93
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:58,200
ways I'm patient for example

94
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,679
I'm [Music] very patient with

95
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:09,360
pain very patient with my

96
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:16,639
grief I don't ask it to crystallize into meaning before it's

97
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,919
ready and sometimes we're in too much of a rush and we

98
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:28,840
prematurely impose some order on [Music] pain and

99
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:36,120
that does healing a kind of disservice and so I'm comfortable not

100
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:42,720
knowing what grief means not knowing what it entails not knowing what it asks

101
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:50,518
of me not knowing how it will change

102
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:56,679
me leard um Cohen uh I managed to get

103
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:03,760
Annie def Franco and Bob Dylan in the uh guided here's

104
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:09,679
Leonard um I Heard the soul unfolds in the chambers of this longing as the

105
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,480
bitter liquor sweetens in the Amber

106
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:22,840
cup so all this is to say I'm still finding my ground

107
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:31,960
after November 5th and in no rush to find Hope although

108
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:39,480
I know I will and I'm in no rush to find equinity although I know I

109
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:46,000
will and I'm in no rush to make everything feel better than it does

110
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:54,200
although I know it will and all ad Dharma teacher can do is

111
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:59,519
really teach their own heart and and hope that it's useful for

112
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:06,399
at least a few others and teaching is always strid with

113
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:14,480
the teachers pain and wisdom with their particularity and I I don't want to hide

114
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:22,480
that nor do I assume that it's right for you and I'm grateful that um there are

115
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:28,360
many Dharma voices and many Dharma doors and um

116
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:36,639
I offer what I can and so the Buddha said um the Dharma

117
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:45,720
is is uh it's found as a kind of middle path and just that is is just is so

118
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,320
genius a middle path and classically that's

119
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:57,398
between um self-indulgence and self-mortification

120
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:06,760
uh between you know obsession with sense senses and um and a kind of

121
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:16,158
useless punishment of of ourselves and um for me in this moment

122
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:25,079
uh the middle path is something like between melodrama on the one hand and

123
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:30,520
insensitivity to suffering on the

124
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:36,240
other and I've no doubt Fallen prey to

125
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,960
melodrama at times the ways that some concern in my

126
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:49,079
mind collects so much attention and I just lose contact with the vastness of

127
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:59,640
space of time I lose contact with the austerity of the Dharma

128
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,839
and maybe sometimes I'll I'll look back on notes that I had for some old talk

129
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:11,040
years ago and I can sort of see in those notes

130
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:18,400
like oh okay a little a little swept up a little

131
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:26,599
precious maybe the vastness somehow got lost and maybe I think like

132
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:34,640
well you know Matthew you were in some awkward intermediate phase you were

133
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:45,520
whatever the grief hadn't yet given birth to wisdom and love fully you know and um

134
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:53,800
and so we're invited to become uh disenchanted with samsara

135
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:59,440
disenchanted and that is so much more radical than we tend to

136
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,480
realize the space that opens

137
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:11,160
is amazing but middle

138
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:19,520
path The Other Extreme is a kind of denial or numbness or insensitivity to

139
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:26,000
suffering some kind of like muffled muffled

140
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,640
compassion and I got into this path because I cared deeply about suffering

141
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:38,280
you know cuz I felt it before I knew it had a name

142
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,880
right and uh and why should greed hate and delusion only matter when it's

143
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:50,760
inside me of course the ascendancy of unadulterated greed hate

144
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,599
delusion outside is

145
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,839
harrowing and yeah I agree the Buddha Focus primarily on freeing oneself from

146
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:07,160
suffering rather than the Dharma as a kind of medicine

147
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:14,280
for society as a utopian Vision the Buddha never claimed that the Dharma

148
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:23,720
scals it's not really a treatment for samsara although it has um tremendous

149
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:30,800
diagnostic power but as far as treatment I I don't

150
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:40,480
know in giving up on a kind of utopian dreams this

151
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:47,560
disenchantment actually has made the suffering more poignant rather than

152
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:58,599
less and a lot of the care and the movement in my heart feels um

153
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:07,359
feels you know clean pure but even Pure Heart can be

154
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:16,000
heavy and some of my care is more like the entangled species of care the pain

155
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,480
of the world somehow resonating with my own clinging with my

156
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:31,240
own fear and that it's not where our deepest love

157
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:36,280
comes from and so something that's become

158
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:41,960
clear to me in the last week maybe overdue you know it's kind of

159
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:49,319
embarrassing to Tim stamp our insights you know but yeah here I

160
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:57,440
am and something that's become clear is um is there's a difference between sense

161
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:03,800
sensitivity to suffering versus fear of

162
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:11,160
suffering and on the one hand I worry very little but in the end I am a fear type

163
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:17,000
meaning that um risk is dramatically more

164
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,079
Salient than reward for me from taking care

165
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,920
of a child or something I'm very conscious of the ways they might get hurt

166
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,920
if I'm directing a project I'm very conscious of the ways things can go

167
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:40,839
wrong um I'm awake to suffering to anich to the way the world trembles in all

168
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:47,440
directions that's part of why I can be useful as a teacher but I'm realizing

169
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:53,880
now that um I'm more afraid of

170
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:01,240
suffering than I recognized more afraid of suffering

171
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:07,400
and to be afraid of suffering is not exactly the same thing

172
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:14,240
as actually comprehending it comprehend duka the Buddha

173
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:23,240
said I don't um consider myself uh you know a

174
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:30,440
courageous person so I've not taught about

175
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:41,040
courage but that's what's been coming up for me and compassion involves courage

176
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:47,960
involves certain kind of maybe it's too dramatic to say

177
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:55,200
fearlessness but um but involves the recognition I was pointing to during the

178
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:04,079
sit that that all all this talk about and I talked a lot about helplessness

179
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,119
about refining a relationship to helplessness about porousness about

180
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:15,160
sensitivity about vulnerability about uh

181
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:24,760
um you know shuddering in the face of harm all of these things right but but we we cannot

182
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:29,960
lose you know sight of of um the ways in

183
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:35,280
which all of that actually directs us towards a certain kind of

184
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,680
strength courage maybe ainus described

185
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:47,640
um I read U described courage as um a

186
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:55,000
condition of each and every virtue courage is a condition of each

187
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,800
and every virtue and was reflecting on the you know the parames the

188
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:07,079
Perfections courage is woven through a lot of that

189
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:16,359
in Dan you know generosity and renunciation and truthfulness in Adana

190
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:21,000
you know the resolution

191
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:29,119
perseverance UPA you know there's courage courage

192
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:38,760
and um and so maybe it's time to find some

193
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:46,760
of that very fluid Supple strength we call

194
00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:54,040
courage and nothing needs to happen now it's just you know in me it's a kind of

195
00:42:54,040 --> 00:43:01,000
gathering of the energy a pooling of a certain kind of

196
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,079
um strength confidence

197
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:13,240
love and I I say all this because um for

198
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:19,880
me I realized like some part of me was just

199
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:28,000
um tired of being afraid and maybe tired of the ways that

200
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:37,000
that fear encumbered my love and so the question what what does

201
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:44,440
love look like what does your love look like when it's less

202
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,960
afraid may be worth

203
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:58,680
asking so offer this for your consideration and uh

204
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:05,440
