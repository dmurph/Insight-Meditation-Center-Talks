1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,680
hello everyone and welcome and I suppose the background hasn't

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:16,118
changed so much from yesterday it's um but uh I'm actually now back at IMC

3
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:21,800
yesterday I was at IRC our Retreat Center in Santa Cruz and so here I have

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:29,320
welcome you to welcome you to Redwood City and um delighted to be here with

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:36,320
you and to be able to share this time and

6
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:43,160
um so the topic for this beginning of the year is

7
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:49,239
samadi and when it's con when it's translated as

8
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:54,760
concentration uh sometimes um uh we limit ourselves

9
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:01,440
dramatically by F focusing on focusing we limit ourselves to a

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,960
particular channel of attention that sometimes is a kind of a one-pointed

11
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:13,520
laser focus or an attempt to do this and

12
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:20,000
um and uh samadi is a practice that uh

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,240
awakens or utilizes all our attentional

14
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,479
faculties so it's something that is holistic or in

15
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,399
inclusive of um the the wide range of ways which we we can be present here and

16
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:42,560
now in fact in some ways there's a way in which there's a gathering of all our

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:53,079
capacities for attention into one way and then uh with that we are as the

18
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:59,360
the uh the objects of attention the what we're aware of become simpler and

19
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,680
simpler because uh we're not preoccupied or not

20
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:09,879
the mind is not chasing different things or fragmented and going off into different

21
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:16,680
directions the mind the heart gets more settled more at ease and peaceful in

22
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,000
itself and so there is no

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,239
um um uh there's very little uh

24
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:34,480
multitracking going on uh but without the without narrowing the

25
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:41,360
expense of the open awareness and all the different faculties of attention so this is one of the reasons it's called

26
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:48,280
Uh Gathering Together unification process and that's my favorite way of thinking of samade or translating it as

27
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,519
a unification so it is using our attentional

28
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,840
faculties and so mindfulness is very important because that is one of that

29
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,599
that is also using our attentional faculties and the um and one of the

30
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:16,239
things that mindfulness can teach us is uh is to have a very light

31
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,760
touch with with awareness uh that to allow the awareness

32
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,760
to be unburdened or uninfluenced by stress by

33
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:36,400
pressure by weight by force uh where awareness has the is

34
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,280
lighter maybe I was going to say lighter than air but maybe then it floats away maybe this you know the same weight as

35
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,640
air that awareness uh has the same

36
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,760
clarity as a really clean window or maybe better a Clarity of an

37
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,439
open window where there's no glass even in the way or it has

38
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:07,120
um uh it uh where awareness has no shape in a certain kind of way sometimes

39
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:14,319
it feels like awareness has no location or Center but whatever it is there's a

40
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:22,800
lightness to it or a softness to it or a um non assertiveness to it or non-

41
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,199
hesitation to it sometimes it's uh people will describe it as being

42
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:34,680
accepting re but even those are too much of a doing

43
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,840
though they get get the we get the hang of it from that and

44
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,960
um and uh so to learn that kind of attention and to learn to do it so the

45
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,919
mind doesn't Drift Away uh and that's the the art and that's one of the ways that

46
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,039
concentration helps is to help the mind not Drift Away into other things and

47
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:05,759
other plac is so yesterday I emphasized the importance of

48
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,199
Discovery and uh getting to know yourself better knowing what your mind

49
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:19,600
is like your body is like what your heart your feelings are like and i' like to continue that process of discovery

50
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,080
but today uh with an emphasis on

51
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,400
uh uh an emphasis on um

52
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,720
uh experimenting with how you're aware of

53
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:44,919
whatever you discover is happening now so it's not this is not a practice today still of making any kind of change

54
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:52,639
trying to get yourself concentrated to get yourself maybe even undistracted it's not trying to make anything happen

55
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:59,400
anything go away or fix anything but it's a simple process of discovery of

56
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,960
what your what's happening what what are the elements what who are you what's going on for

57
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:11,280
you um because that those all the different parts of who you are is what

58
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,560
is needed to gather the mind in this

59
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,680
unification and and and then how you do this with the mind the awareness with

60
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:31,319
which you do it that's also key so see if your awareness of whatever is happening can have no Force no weight no

61
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:39,080
tension in it it just very light almost like you're awareness is like an open

62
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:45,240
Palm that's going to that holds uh where where there lands a butterfly or lands

63
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:54,520
even more lighter than that might be a an a dandelion um uh you know those uh

64
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:01,280
flowers that they're floating through the air with the seeds and you just land there and just just there it is that

65
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,800
kind of weight so to assume a meditation

66
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,680
posture and to gently close your

67
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:24,000
eyes and without doing anything else to prepare yourself for

68
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,879
meditation discover how you are right now

69
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:37,479
almost like you're stepping back to be the

70
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:43,759
Observer almost as if you're observing something that you don't

71
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:48,840
identify yourself with but you

72
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:59,000
are kindly attentive how's your body

73
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:10,080
the kind attention that allows your body to be as it is even if it's some

74
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:18,280
challenge but for a few moments just discover the

75
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:24,720
body and see what kind of simple

76
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,759
awareness a way of feeling sensing

77
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,000
a simple knowing of how the body

78
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,880
is where these forms of attention have no force in

79
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:51,800
them no expectation no reaction no judgment

80
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:15,399
and then notice also in your body how you're feeling what's your mood

81
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:22,560
or emotional state to

82
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:30,800
discover maybe it's a bit of a kaleidoscope of Shifting feelings

83
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:41,399
and see if how you know it can be light and open

84
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:45,399
receptive allowing

85
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:14,120
maybe it helps to back off from not to disconnect

86
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:20,079
or not be aware of but to back off from your

87
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:27,040
emotions so you're not riding them too closely allowing them to be

88
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,839
there discovering them like a

89
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:56,519
naturalist and then how are you in your mind your thinking mind

90
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,000
without opposition or contention with

91
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,240
anything can you experiment with the lightest Touch of

92
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:22,000
awareness that is present without any pressure or Force

93
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:02,120
and now with the lightest of

94
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:09,320
Touches for your awareness your feeling sensing

95
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,480
knowing to be aware of

96
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:34,560
breathing if awareness is light enough to float on the

97
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:40,079
ocean maybe the image of awareness floating on

98
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:49,399
the waves of breathing in and breathing out gentle waves moving through the

99
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:55,240
ocean with awareness riding on them

100
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,040
a light

101
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,360
awareness and so the awareness doesn't float away across the

102
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:25,880
ocean imagine there's a gentle

103
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,519
soft rope where awareness is anchored to the

104
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:35,240
bottom of the

105
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:46,639
ocean staying in more or less one place as it goes up and

106
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:57,399
down floating on the surface of breathing in and breathing

107
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:05,160
out rooted with an anchor deep in your

108
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,079
body for

109
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
for

110
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

111
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

112
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

113
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

114
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

115
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

116
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,720
for for

117
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:15,240
if you're aware right now how is it to be

118
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:25,360
aware what are the characteristics of being

119
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,480
attentive just to what's happening in the

120
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:43,960
present and is there some way to relax any unnecessary

121
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,600
tension associated with being aware or judging what it's like to be aware or

122
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,919
not aware

123
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:11,960
letting awareness be like an open door that welcomes in the

124
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:19,919
breathing the body is experience a breathing appears

125
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,399
freely in a light

126
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,400
open awareness

127
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,360
that's

128
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:47,200
anchored deep under the surface of the waves of breathing in and breathing

129
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
out

130
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

131
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

132
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

133
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,440
for for

134
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
for for

135
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:22,760
and as we come to the end of this

136
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:30,159
sitting to take a few more breaths to rise on the

137
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:36,039
breathing floats up and down with inhale and

138
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:50,480
exhale and as you exhale to relax your

139
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,480
body soften

140
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:17,360
as you exhale Relax The Thinking mind soften any tension or

141
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,320
pressure associated with thinking

142
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:39,760
and if there is any pressure or tension contraction associated with how

143
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:46,720
you're feeling see if you can soften

144
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,960
relax that tension

145
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:14,880
and then as if body mind and

open and

150
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:05,039

00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:08,039
free and may those four

168
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:18,158
wishes flow out of the goodness of your heart out into the world

169
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:31,009
[Music]

170
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,120
thank you

171
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:42,080
so welcome to this second talk on

172
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,559
samadi this uh probably be a longer

173
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:53,320
series and it's such an important topic in Buddhism in Buddhist practice samade

174
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:59,159
or concentration and uh it's part of the

175
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:04,399
key Foundation stones cornerstones for Buddhist

176
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:12,039
practice mindfulness is another one ethics being ethical is a third one and

177
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:17,120
kindness and generosity or maybe the

178
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:23,519
fourth and but it's it's tremendously valuable and it can lead to a lot of

179
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:31,039
stress and a lot of confusion uh I certainly have tried to develop concentration and meditation and

180
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:36,480
ended up with u a headache because of the way in which I was trying to develop

181
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:44,320
somebody it was it was too willful it was too um forceful it was with a lot of

182
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:51,519
tension and with a lot of expectation and a lot of uh um degree of conceit you

183
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:57,399
know I'm the one who's going to get concentrated so it's I think of samadi

184
00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:04,559
as an art and uh sometimes as an art uh that we develop or craft that we develop

185
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:11,040
over time sometimes I think of it as Grace uh that uh when samade arises it's

186
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,839
like a gift that's been given and I don't necessarily feel responsible for developing

187
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:24,000
somebody but um I have to put the conditions into place so one of the ways of

188
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,599
understanding the unification of all of Who We Are a as part of samade practice

189
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:39,280
um and why it's so important to discover all the different aspects of who who we are um to do so without any judgments

190
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:46,440
without any uh criticisms without any reactivity to it but just to discover is

191
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:54,398
to think of ourselves all the parts of who we are as the new members of a soccer team or

192
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:01,920
new members of a of a dance team and um not everyone is uh completely

193
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:09,160
skilled in dancing or playing soccer and the team doesn't know each other and so

194
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,760
at first as they practice it's awkward and difficult and uh even the coach

195
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:21,880
doesn't understand the different skills and abilities and uh how to uh how to uh

196
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:28,640
give people different parts or and how those different uh players of the team

197
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,440
can uh work together and so of course that's the way it is in the beginning of

198
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:42,920
course it's awkward of course it's um it takes time for uh to discover the

199
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:49,440
skills the abilities the the how to be inclusive and how to put all the

200
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,680
different pieces together so in the beginning the coach is involved is

201
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:01,040
discovering uh the players and then as we discover them we learn how to begin

202
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:06,680
bringing them together to work together to support each other to have the same

203
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:14,079
purpose and uh to be a uh a team that is Unified so the desperate parts of

204
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:21,599
ourselves we want to First discover what they are understand what they are and then uh we want to start understanding

205
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:28,319
how to bring them together and so that the unification doesn't have any stress in it it doesn't

206
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:33,839
have any uh UNH wholesome qualities to it that it actually feels like a

207
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:40,160
welcoming com together a delightful coming together and uh kind of um uh

208
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:47,480
coming into a kind of fullness or a holistic Vitality or

209
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:55,119
liveness so we begin with the discovery process and we discover a lot of things we discover how distracted we are how

210
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,880
little concentration we have we discover that we have expectations of wanting it

211
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,040
to be different we have judgments about what's happening and this if only this

212
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:12,200
wasn't happening then I could get concentrated and so there's you know pushing away certain things or judging

213
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:19,119
certain things um we might be we might have a lot of conceit involved that

214
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:24,640
maybe you've been very successful in doing various uh things in your life and

215
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,000
you think that the meditation should be the same you just apply yourself you learn what the steps meditation by the

216
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,040
numbers and you can just do it and and um and that conceit sometimes of being

217
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:42,720
the doer the successful person uh gets in the way and the important thing here is just

218
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,920
discover the whole thing without judging it getting ready

219
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,480
uh for the Real Performance the real game later but for now just kind of

220
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:02,040
getting used to each other and seeing what's there and one of the things to discover is the different ways in which

221
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:09,000
uh awareness operates because samadi is a unification of not only of all of who

222
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,040
we are but all the different ways in which we can be aware

223
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,720
attentive and um and so there's three in particular that are useful for Saadi and

224
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:26,720
for mindfulness as well there is um our ability to know what is happening so

225
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:31,839
that's a cognitive uh function of the Mind recognizing and

226
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:37,960
it's a very it's not judging or having commentary not that kind of knowing but

227
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:45,119
the simplest possible knowing there's a sound uh we don't uh hear a big bang

228
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,800
like I just did and um begin thinking of oh was that an accident was that someone

229
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,400
at hammering what was someone doing banging this early in the morning and so

230
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:02,680
my mind Braes off off it's just like oh sound bang that

231
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:08,079
simple and um so the simple Act of knowing knowing the INB breath knowing

232
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:13,800
the out breath knowing oh there's thinking happening and keeping it very very

233
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,079
simple and so that's one way the cognitive functioning of uh recognition

234
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:26,680
of knowing the second kind of awareness is uh somatic it's how we can feel and

235
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:33,480
sense things through our body uh so you might know there's an inhale but you can

236
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:40,839
feel the expansion of the chest you can feel the movement of the chest you can feel the smoothness or the choppiness of

237
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:47,040
the way the the inhal moves out um and but that can be felt from the

238
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:54,319
inside out it's the I like to say as many of you know um to uh to notice how

239
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:59,640
the body experiences breathing how the body experiences itself so how does the

240
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:07,560
body experience the breathing so this experiential aspect of it which is somatic and uh

241
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:13,359
sensory is another piece another way in which we're aware a Third Way emphasized

242
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:18,839
by the Buddha that uh in his teaching at least usually waits until people are

243
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:27,040
pretty settled in meditation and that is to observe and this is uh to Simply uh see

244
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:33,040
why watch observe what's happening not NE without necessarily having to know

245
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,400
what it is without interfering with it because when you see something you don't

246
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:45,359
interfere with what you see that comes a different way and um and we're not

247
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:50,720
necessarily directly feeling it there's feeling and sensing experiencing can be

248
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,960
have a wonderful intimacy um and but observing can have a

249
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:02,800
much more peaceful much more equanimous it's not aloof uh can be very

250
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,160
important but uh there's a quiting of all kinds of activities including the

251
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:14,680
activity of sensing and feeling so there's knowing feeling and

252
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:21,680
um and watching and observing there's also hearing and tasting and smelling

253
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:27,640
there's proor perception there's all these different ways in which we um can

254
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:35,960
experience the inner life through the different nerve endings that we have and um and it's useful to recognize

255
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,720
what is our strength as part of the team the soccer team the dance troop uh what

256
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:47,400
is our strength are we we the person who's more easier with with the sematic

257
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:53,319
experiencing are we the one who's more has greater ease with um recognition and

258
00:41:53,319 --> 00:42:00,480
knowing and that's how we anchor ourselves in the present or we more like we we kind of settle back and observe

259
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:09,520
and and that's our strength and um and so um uh and then

260
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:17,079
there's the ways in which attention can be very open taking in everything and as it arises and occurs and sometimes

261
00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:24,720
attention is very um uh centered somewhere so that it's not it's not so

262
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:31,520
large maybe chaotic and confusing that so much is going on at once we're just kind of narrowing the attention to one

263
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:37,880
little place um so like if you're in a crowded restaurant sometimes it's really

264
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:44,599
nice to open the awareness the hearing and just take in all the amazing sounds of people eating and clanking their

265
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:49,880
spoon against their plates um and they just can that can be very relaxing and

266
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:55,640
spacious or it can be confusing and it can be agitating just like too much

267
00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:02,200
input and and for some people they prefer to just kind of just be with their own plate their own food and let

268
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:08,319
their attention be centered there and it can be very relaxing and quieting to just be have this intimacy with your own

269
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:14,000
food and everything else Falls away so how is it for you what kind of

270
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:22,040
awareness is useful for you um uh is it important part of this discovery process

271
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:28,359
that uh of bringing together um the team s

272
00:43:28,359 --> 00:43:36,359
the um the the dance troop the samade dance troop and so um uh this principle

273
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:45,520
of Discovery and knowing yourself uh is is invaluable for the preparation for you

274
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:53,119
know uh moving into samade itself and um so I've said a lot

275
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:59,680
today but you might want to as you go through um the day today uh

276
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:07,040
notice discover how you're aware and uh some people are very aware

277
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:15,000
through the the lens of their thinking their bias their preconceived

278
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:20,400
ideas and that's not quite the kind of attention the Buddha focused on but it's

279
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,599
important to see that that you're doing that and then as you know anything at

280
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:33,720
all about yourself the experiment the core experiment of today is can you know it lightly can you

281
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:40,559
know it without judgment can you know without tension and pressure and

282
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:45,880
um and uh how light how soft

283
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:51,520
how uh uncontracted how

284
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:57,839
untight can you simply know simply feel simply observe

285
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:05,599
what's happening with you so um in this slow way that we're going

286
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:10,960
to go into samade this is the second step of how to we're going to move into

287
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:19,839
it and um so thank you very much and I look forward to continuing tomorrow
