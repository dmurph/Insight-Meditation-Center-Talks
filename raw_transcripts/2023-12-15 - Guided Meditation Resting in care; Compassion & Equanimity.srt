um yeah that's uh that's it

10
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,800
so just uh on a dime just

11
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,319
begin with love some species of

12
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:57,560
Love gratitude or

13
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,760
compassion love and kindness

14
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,159
Joy

15
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,920
equinity or uh maybe it's that special species of

16
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,480
love that uh we call

17
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
grief

18
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:43,080
but find something that gives you some access to your heart just uh rest in that for a minute

19
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,319
or two as we begin

20
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
here

21
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:34,039
just like um irritation or hatred

22
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:40,000
or impatience

23
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,240
depressive mood just like all of that can flavor

24
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:52,159
everything so to can

25
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
love

26
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:15,560
in the light of uh of love and care and poignancy this

27
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,879
uh just this breath kind of a big

28
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:25,960
deal Kind of

29
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Wonderful

30
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:48,680
the energy of uh care gratitude aliveness just sort of

31
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,920
suffuses the

32
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
body

33
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:31,880
need not be dramatic need not be the rapturous Delight geysers of uh

34
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,480
love may be very

35
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:48,279
subtle but uh body and mind tilted in the direction of

36
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:51,279
care

37
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
tenderness

38
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:44,560
gratitude for um finding a a path that

39
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:53,560
uh promises or a hypothesizes that

40
00:13:53,560 --> 00:14:02,120
uh that any given moment is practice any life is

41
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:14,320
practice the possibility of uh love and freedom is

42
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,759
never we

43
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
closed

44
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,399
and we may not be able to think our way into Freedom we may not be able to

45
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:54,880
muscle our way into it to effort our way into

46
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,680
it and yet it uh be

47
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
us

48
00:16:17,079 --> 00:16:21,360
the more stable our mind

49
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:32,240
gets the more unambivalent our love

50
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
gets

51
00:21:53,520 --> 00:22:00,039
and when uh that which is not love arises

52
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:07,399
is don't have to

53
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,559
uh artificially force your way

54
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:19,679
into ease or forgiveness or Joy or whatever just

55
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:25,880
uh when the love is kind of sufficiently humming along

56
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,960
stabilized strong container

57
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:39,440
sort of drop the hate into that uh

58
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,240
love and uh the hate Burns

59
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
off

60
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:21,080
doesn't mean we can't say no or we can't say no to

61
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:29,880
something but the hate Burns off

62
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,960
may we be free from

63
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
suffering

64
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:58,320
so uh so thank you it's good to uh good to practice with you and uh

65
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,880
yeah thank you to uh yeah to everyone for you all for

66
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:12,440
sitting and uh practicing and uh yeah Kevin Julie

67
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:18,279
editing I maybe maybe others too Nancy scheduled

68
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:25,799
me uh the website Fe all the managing directors the board of directors the the

69
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:33,679
volunteer coordinate oh my good it keeps going right yeah it's beautiful thank

70
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,720
you so

71
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:50,399
um if uh if one um were were tasked with creating a uh a a

72
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:59,240
religion writing writing the holy books right be a very tall order

73
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:07,519
um you would have to write uh with uh with two considerations in mind how will

74
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:16,519
you be read but also how you will be misread you'd have to guard against um

75
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:21,600
misreadings that would legitimize bad

76
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:31,039
stuff and part of the the the Buddha's genius to my

77
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:37,240
mind is that his set of teachings provide very few

78
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:43,639
footholds for fundamentalism very few footholds

79
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:51,720
for the derangement of overconfidence it's an incredibly

80
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:58,320
nuanced path where in a way usually torical

81
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,600
force is not privileged over

82
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:11,720
nuance and so one factor balances other factors and we can't kind of fetishize

83
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:17,039
any one aspect of the path that's what I've been highlighting

84
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:22,639
this week just with pairings of teachings that maybe are not even

85
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:28,840
traditionally paired but on my own path of practice have been important

86
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:36,399
counterbalancing forces and so with the uh the last

87
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:44,880
um pairing I'm I'm highlighting uh that uh been circumambulating

88
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:51,159
often these uh past couple years of compassion

89
00:32:52,679 --> 00:33:00,600
equinity so we talk about uh freedom and happiness and these things but a huge

90
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:06,440
part of our practice is actually um

91
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:14,120
experiencing Dua experiencing suffering with Incredible

92
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:22,080
vividness and part of why we don't squirm is we're developing okayness with imperfection

93
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:30,240
but part of why we don't squirm is so that we might perceive suffering

94
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,600
vividly and in in a sit for a you know

95
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,039
this morning in a retreat in a sense it's just for pretend

96
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,120
right if we're on Retreat and there's a lot of suffering

97
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:51,840
or something we could shift postures we could skip the sit we could

98
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:58,159
leave the retreat but we don't we don't

99
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:04,320
and we say and this begins to actually etch into our brain just how hard it is

100
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:13,280
to be human just how intense it is just how intense even a very blessed life

101
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,720
is and we see the movements of our mind the

102
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,240
ways that uh it desperately seeks somewhere

103
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:30,358
someone to pin the blame on when suffering is intense maybe it's blame on

104
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:35,760
someone else maybe it's blame on the self but it seeks to like hang the

105
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,599
intensity of that affect somewhere but we

106
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:47,480
don't all the blaming really just kind of blunts the

107
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,638
insight about the intensity of The Human Condition insight into

108
00:34:53,639 --> 00:35:04,200
Dua which is um a huge huge huge part of the path and has huge liberatory

109
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:11,839
potential and so what happens uh to our heart when we open in that

110
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:17,760
way vividly to suffering

111
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:28,800
undefended well first we we sense how How Deeply we long to be happy

112
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:36,880
the kind of innocence of that wish and we sense How Deeply that's

113
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:44,680
shared by others no matter how different their nervous system is from our own it

114
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:50,280
can't be that different it can't be that

115
00:35:50,920 --> 00:36:00,640
different and so we uh dedicate some portion of our our energy to alleviating

116
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:06,560
suffering how much is enough don't know doesn't matter that

117
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,839
much we start we

118
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:17,400
start uh marks said uh from each according to their ability to each

119
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:24,280
according to their need and we don't need a kind of

120
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,279
Authority or government to make us honor that it's

121
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:38,680
seea so we look uh to see where we can spend our love

122
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:46,200
well I'm sort of like a value conscious person you know I am sort of not not

123
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:52,240
stingy but value conscious you know and it's like and so I look like okay where

124
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,560
can we get a lot of bang for the love Buck basically

125
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,920
you know where can we spend our love

126
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:09,359
well compassion compassion entails a willingness to uh to

127
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:15,800
grieve one element of compassion is is grief that's maybe the first movement of

128
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:22,000
the heart but that's not the last word the last word of

129
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,720
compassion is love uh you recard say like uh in giving

130
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:38,040
compassion instruction says something like imagine the the suffering of the other basically an incredible vividness

131
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:44,000
until it's unbearable and then there's this

132
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,920
inflection point when it becomes unbearable to open to that depth of

133
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:58,599
suffering you pour all of your love into them

134
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:07,480
and sometimes it feels like if I open to compassion it's going to end in

135
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:12,800
suffering it's going to end in suffering rather than

136
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:20,920
love but uh maybe maybe compassion only ends in suffering when it's not

137
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:27,240
counterbalanced by equinity and so we grow

138
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:35,920
we grow in our strength uh so that we can love more deeply our love becomes

139
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:44,560
stronger but um even when our heart is very strong

140
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:52,160
vast love is at some point becomes

141
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,040
fatiguing the Michelle uh Michelle McDonald talks about

142
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:03,480
um flowers a lot you know nature generally and flowers a lot and she's

143
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:11,520
like yeah flowers open but they don't expect to stay open you know sometimes I

144
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:17,760
found myself prying open Orchid I know that's so bad that's

145
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,480
so not

146
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,520
Buddhist flowers open and then something has to

147
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:38,640
happen they have to close right but what's the closing of the flower of the heart it's not apathy it's not

148
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:45,119
hatred it's maybe something like equinity

149
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:52,680
equinity equinity is uh is about

150
00:39:52,680 --> 00:40:01,400
uh refining refining our relation relationship to

151
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,680
helplessness refining a relationship to

152
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:14,680
helplessness the the kind of uh helplessness is sort

153
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:21,319
of in a way kind of foundational experience Primal

154
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:28,839
experience it's the experience that um that made us

155
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:34,760
uh howl as children and it's the experience that

156
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:44,200
still generates tears as adults now and it is that which our entire body

157
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:53,440
is oriented against H it is um the experience that

158
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,240
is almost unbelievable to the willfulness of the

159
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:07,640
ego you know nothing to be done no moves to make the ego all out of

160
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:14,440
moves so do you mean ungovernable for

161
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:22,440
real yeah and so aging

162
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:28,240
sickness mortality kind of um

163
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,640
uh narcissistic wound the kind of limits of the ego's

164
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:44,400
willfulness are highlighted and so part of um purifying

165
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:52,280
our love is deeply understanding helplessness which may be in the end just a synonym for

166
00:41:52,880 --> 00:42:04,079
Dua and so we ask the question uh can we keep our heart open open

167
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:10,640
relaxed Exquisite on the other side of our

168
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,960
power can we keep our heart open on the other side of our

169
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,240
power equinity is um is love in the face

170
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:33,680
of the the endless ungovernable nature of of uh samsara the suffring of this

171
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:41,480
realm and uh but it's not a closing equinity is is

172
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:48,160
a it's a very quiet kind of love it's like the arousal system Joy or something

173
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:56,480
very high state of arousal equinity the arousal is the the the system is kind of

174
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:06,359
like turned down towards zero but the heart is still wide

175
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:14,000
open and one of the functions of this quiet

176
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,040
love is that it refines out maybe the

177
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:25,160
impurities in our compassion the grandiosity or the

178
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:31,119
compulsivity or this kind of simple intolerance of

179
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:37,720
suffering that masquerades as compassion but is not

180
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:45,359
it that's something that I know well you know in the face of loved one suffering

181
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:51,559
it's a kind of intolerance and an agitated effort

182
00:43:51,559 --> 00:43:59,720
to dispel it right but compassion is a kind of um it may be

183
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:09,400
urgent but it's patient it is equinity that lets us rest

184
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:19,119
when there's no action to take it it lets us rest when only rest is

185
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:25,000
helpful it lets us rest when only rest is

186
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,960
helpful and then compassion is born again then

187
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:39,599
there's something to do and we do something these cycles of love and rest

188
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:42,960
love and

189
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:57,960
rest the rest purifying our love the love justifying the rest

190
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,240
and we keep

191
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,359
going

192
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:27,640
okay
