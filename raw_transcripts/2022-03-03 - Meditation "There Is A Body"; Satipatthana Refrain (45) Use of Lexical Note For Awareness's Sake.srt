00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:07,040
greetings greetings friends greetings sangha

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,519
whatever time zone you are in good morning good afternoon good evening

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,640
lovely to be with you in practice together at this moment in time

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,560
so for today this week we've been exploring the

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,279
refrain of the sati patana sutta going through each statement

6
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,360
step by step together and exploring it and um

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:45,600
i'll say more again about the context uh during the uh brief darmet afterwards

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,680
and i'll put up the uh diagram again just just to give a refresher

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,239
and for the guided meditation i'd like to just mention very briefly

10
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:06,560
what the statement the sentence is um that we're working on with today so

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,439
so the statement this the next part of the refrain we're working with today

12
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:20,080
is um mindfulness that there is a body is

13
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:28,720
established in one to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and continuous

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,079
mindfulness i'm going to read this again because this is going to serve as the

15
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,680
inspiration actually maybe it will help to read the whole refrain just for context so

16
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,880
the whole refrain in this way in regard to the body

17
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,640
one abides contemplating the body both internally

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,000
or one abides contemplating the body externally or one abides contemplating

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,119
the body both internally and externally we did this

20
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:10,399
a couple of days ago the next sentence or one abides contemplating the nature of arising in

21
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:17,440
the body or one abides contemplating the nature of passing away in the body

22
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:24,160
or one abides contemplating the nature of both arising and passing away in the

23
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:31,760
body we explored impermanence yesterday now here is the next sentence

24
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,599
or mindfulness that there is a body

25
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,040
is established in one to the extent necessary

26
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:50,040
for bare knowledge and continuous mindfulness

27
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,280
read it one more time or mindfulness that there is a body

28
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,519
is established in one to the extent necessary for bare knowledge

29
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,040
and continuous mindfulness so there are many keywords here which i will expand

30
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,800
on later in the dharmat and during the guided meditation i'll

31
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:21,440
invite i'll invite you i'll give invitations based on these particular keywords here

32
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,959
that there is a body extent necessary for bare knowledge

33
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:34,159
continuous mindfulness these are of course beautiful poetic but they're not just poetry these are direct

34
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:41,040
instructions that the buddha is offering so until i'll just read the last sentence

35
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,480
which we'll bring in tomorrow and put it all together

36
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,040
the last couple of sentences one abides independent not clinging to

37
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:02,000
anything in the world that is how in regard to the body one abides contemplating the body so

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,120
so without further ado let's let's practice together

39
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:15,760
formally ah arriving arriving in our seat

40
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,199
arriving in this body

41
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,080
here here

42
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,080
as always let's start

43
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,400
by relinquishing by releasing thoughts preoccupations

44
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,800
what is not needed releasing preoccupations

45
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,400
relaxing into the body relaxing into the body

46
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,400
and taking refuge in this moment in time

47
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:28,560
in our hearts intention in our goodness coming together to practice together

48
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,759
taking refuge

49
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,600
and the goodness within possibility for awakening

50
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,120
the teachings and the sangha buddha dharma sangha

51
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:52,960
ah let there be brightness let there be brightness

52
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:59,919
this sense of alignment maybe sitting up a little straighter if you're sitting

53
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,360
not tightening still relaxed

54
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,120
but a sense of alignment verticality

55
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,919
in our heart body and mind

56
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,880
noticing there is a body there is a body

57
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,080
aware there is a body

58
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:55,280
awareness can there be awareness with this phrase with dropping in

59
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,919
there is a body

60
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:10,160
not so much here is my body or what is this body oh

61
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,199
there's a body there's a body here

62
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,039
there's breathing happening here sensations

63
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,520
there is a body

64
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:13,279
notice how the use of this mental labeling very light

65
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,560
there is a body

66
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,549
can bring recognition [Music]

67
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,640
sanya recognition [Music]

68
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,560
what is here present

69
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,600
and support sati mindfulness

70
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,800
and clear comprehension of what is here

71
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:01,240
simply there is a body

72
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,279
established in awareness

73
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:36,760
here not entangled

74
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,839
but spacious

75
00:10:53,120 --> 00:11:00,680
knowing clearly knowing clearly knowing there is a body

76
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,480
not to analyze not to be entangled

77
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,560
just simply this awareness

78
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,440
knowing there is a body

79
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:35,000
this reflection for the purpose

80
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,279

there is a body there is a body

85
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:26,120
a mental note

86
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,560
a linguistic note

87
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:28,159
if you notice there's entanglement in the mind

88
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:38,880
the linguistic noting technique there is a body there is a body

89
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,880

continuous mindfulness there is a body

97
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:31,559
there is a body so simple and yet profound

98
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:32,640
and for the last moments of this practice period together

99
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:42,559
whether there were many moments of fair knowing clear comprehension

100
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:49,278
continued mindfulness or just one it's okay

101
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,880
letting go relinquishing releasing any judgment

102
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:02,480
you showed up you did your best by just showing up and planting seeds

103
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,600
we're cultivating goodness individually and collectively

104
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:13,039
in the world for the benefit of ourselves

105
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:20,240

128
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,440
i'm so touched thank you yeah so

129
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,440
[Music] so today we continue

130
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:20,080
our fourth day of exploring the refrain of the satipatana

131
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:28,399
so just to remind us [Music] of the context

132
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:35,120
i will share this screen [Music] just a bit of review

133
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,679
so the sati patana sutta the four foundations of mindfulness

134
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:48,120
sutta which you've been practicing studying with gil

135
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,519
systematically over the past many weeks and continuing

136
00:32:53,519 --> 00:33:00,559
to practice for the next few weeks so the suta has four sections so looking at

137
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:06,080
this and this is drawn from the book sati patana the direct path to

138
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:12,159
realization by pico analia a wonderful book wonderful book it's actually it's

139
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:19,360
it's his thesis is his phd thesis that he did on on this um

140
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:25,679
so looking starting from the bottom structure is there's four parts there's

141
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:32,559
the body you see on the left side there's the body there's six part six teachings to it

142
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:39,039
feelings which you practice with guilt last week feeling tones or vedana

143
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:44,159
there's mind mind states often translated as and then there is the

144
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,519
dhamma so these are the four foundations for establishments four ways to

145
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:57,200
establish awareness through these these ways through these establishments

146
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,240
foundations and each teaching each of these

147
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,158
teachings and i trust you can see my cursing each of these many many teachings in

148
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:15,599
these sections go into detailed descriptions as to how to do

149
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:20,638
the description how to do the the contemplation you know

150
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,839
postures lists the postures or say corpse and decay

151
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:32,960
as a cemetery contemplation stages of decay the many stages to go through etc

152
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,079
and at the beginning there is a definition which i shared at the very

153
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:46,158
first day i'll touch into it today again and the refrain repeats after every section so the

154
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:54,158
refrain sati patana sutta the buddha offers the refrain 13 times

155
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,359
as if to say hello are you listening i'm going to repeat the refrain

156
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:05,200
13 times and as i said earlier

157
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,960
i thought oh refrain you know sometimes the sutas are very repetitive like okay okay i want to get to the main teaching

158
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,400
whereas actually the refrain is so important as we have been exploring

159
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,440
today this this whole week together okay

160
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:28,079
so so today we want to focus on the third

161
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:36,480
statement as i read it earlier um so just to bring bring us up to date we the

162
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,079
first statement has to do with internal external not just internally as we

163
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:48,160
associate mindfulness to be just internally just internal long-term no internally

164
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:55,040
one abides contemplating the body internally one abides contemplating the body externally and one abides

165
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,320
contemplating internally and externally we discussed that we practiced with that

166
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,000
and the sense of [Music] impersonality of oh internal external

167
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,400
can can can pop out yesterday we worked with the second statement

168
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:19,040
arising passing or rising and passing and the significance of of contemplating

169
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,839
impermanence which is a doorway which is necessary for awakening

170
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:30,640
um one cannot awaken without a deep appreciation

171
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:38,560
contemplation of arising and passing really rocking getting impermanence in

172
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:44,800
every way not in just one way not in just one phenomena but in every way all

173
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,880
phenomena internal external the perceiver and the perceived

174
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,240
all aspects of experience the long list of satipatana teachings that's why the

175
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,839
buddha keeps repeating after everything after everything right

176
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:07,280
it contemplating say impermanence after breathing after

177
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:12,400
postures after activities anatomical parts like it's all impermanent it all

178
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:18,880
arises and passes away everything feeling tones mind states

179
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,400
hindrances ac everything it's it's pretty radical teaching you know it's

180
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,760
applied to all of these and today

181
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:36,000
we turn to this third sentence which relates to the previous two sentences so

182
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,280
kind of building up the third sentence or mindfulness that

183
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,760
there is a body is established in one to the extent necessary for bare

184
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:54,880
knowledge and continuous mindfulness okay there are a lot of key words here okay let's let's decode the significance

185
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,480
of this so and and in the guided meditation i

186
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:08,320
brought in there is a body there is a body we dropped it in and by the way just to say uh let me share this screen

187
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:14,000
one more time uh the the refrain of course after this the

188
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,680
fee after the like this refrain after feeling tones it says the contemplation

189
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:26,240
is that there is a feeling tone not that there is a body or after the mind would be

190
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:31,359
uh contemplated that there are mind states so

191
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:38,800
so that there is a body repeats in the body section and then the refrain for

192
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,000
feelings mind dhammas to substitute the word feelings mind damas for the word

193
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,280
body in the refrain just to be clear these ones don't say there is a body

194
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:54,400
they say contemplating that there is dominance just to be clear when you read it of

195
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,720
course you'll see as you've seen so

196
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,760
so what's the significance of this practice that there is

197
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,599
a x there is a body there is dhammas there's

198
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:19,520
feeling tones but i'm just going to continue with the body here just to have a specific instantiation but just

199
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,720
again you can apply it to all these other foundations

200
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:34,560
so so first um mindfulness that there is a body so this

201
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:43,440
is a uh what's called a mental label or a mental note or or

202
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,640
rather a linguistic note this is the way that the suttas and this is common

203
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:56,480
actually many places in the suttas for example in the anapanasati suta that

204
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:04,160
one knows i'm breathing i breathe in long one knows i breathe in short like one knows

205
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:10,079
like oh yeah this is a linguistic like it's a linguistic device

206
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:15,680
and this is often in the tradition in the practice it's called mental noting but mental

207
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:21,760
kind of i i like linguistic or lexical noting because mental somehow i feel

208
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:27,680
like we have to note it in our head but but lexical i think is a better choice of

209
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,960
the word or linguistic note so i'm going to use linguistic note

210
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,240
so it's a linguistic note as we practice with together oh there is a body there

211
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:47,760
is a body you drop it in drop it and you bring it up and the idea here is that um

212
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:54,079
it's [Music] it's a skillful employment it's a

213
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:00,720
skillful use of verbal knowledge so the practice doesn't mean that you have to

214
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:09,599
relinquish all verbal knowledge uh but actually concepts can be helpful

215
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:15,200
for the sake of knowledge and continued mindfulness as it says in the rest of

216
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:21,119
the sentence and in fact i think what i'll do is that i will put this line

217
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:28,079
in chat so that you can actually see this and follow this this line of the citra that we're talking about here we

218
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:35,280
go so so there is a skillful use of of

219
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,319
linguistic noting for the purpose

220
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:47,359
of bare knowledge and continuous mindfulness this labeling this label actually can

221
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:53,599
strengthen recognition can strengthen as you might have experienced yourself today in our

222
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:59,520
practice can strengthen recognition and clear comprehension it kind of brings it

223
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:06,800
back together if the mind is distracted and and lots is arising oh there is a body there

224
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:12,720
is a body and again it's not that this it's my body this oh it's there is

225
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:20,240
a body there's a sense of objectivity there's a sense of objectivity there is a body there's a sense of spaciousness

226
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,359
that can arise ah there is a body and yet

227
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:31,040
the this is not an end to itself this this lexical note we don't keep

228
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:37,040
repeating it as a mantra we don't we don't attach to it it's only again as

229
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:43,520
this beautiful line in the sutta says to the extent necessary

230
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:49,520
so important to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and continued mindfulness

231
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:54,880
like ah yes here and you might have noticed it i

232
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:01,760
hope you did for at least for a little bit like yeah there is ease like oh yeah there's kind of it's easier there's a

233
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,920
body i can there's an awareness of it and there's more continuous

234
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,200
mindfulness awareness clear knowing when this lexical

235
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,680
labeling is used another significance of this and i'll

236
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:24,880
wrap up quickly is that

237
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:31,520
yes labeling is not a means to an end uh it will be let go of when it does

238
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:38,240
establish awareness um so and it also connects this clear

239
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:45,040
knowing here in this sentence where knowledge and continuous mind it connects to what we discussed about the

240
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:52,160
definition on monday with sam paganya with clear comprehension so this mental

241
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:58,800
note can bring more clear comprehension which i really hope you you experienced

242
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:04,480
and lastly to say this idea of this use of concept here

243
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:09,760
this concept using this mental this this keep saying mental

244
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:16,400
lexical note we are using concepts in a helpful way and another thing to say

245
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:22,400
the object of this practice is not to get rid of concepts to have an empty

246
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:28,079
mind this is a misperception sometimes people think oh yeah the point is to

247
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:35,599
empty my mind no here the buddha is actually instructing us to bring in to use

248
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:42,000
concepts skillfully in order to establish what in order to establish

249
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:50,319
bare knowledge and continuous mindfulness so this is a very important point here

250
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:56,720
with that i'd like to end by thanking you and inviting you if today

251

um as you go about your daily life take this practice with you

252
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:07,599
there is a body when you are distracted stressed perhaps ah there is a body and

253
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,880
again it's not my body it's like oh there's a body there's a sense of spaciousness

254
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:21,040
uh healthy lack of attachment like oh there's a body wow how amazing there's a body that's

255
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:28,800
one thing that was coming up for me this morning sense of joy actually can arise oh there is a body wow

256
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,560
and continuous mindfulness the mind can really engage and relish the light

257
