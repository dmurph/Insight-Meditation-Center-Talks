1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,259
so good morning welcome welcome and wherever you are on this planet

2
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:15,679
maybe it's not morning but uh sending warm wishes your direction

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,340
so today I will continue on this theme of these letters from Mara

4
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,560
these uh you know completely made up letters but

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,079
I appreciate them they have some Whimsy in them as well as you know some truth maybe a little bit of uncomfortable

6
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,140
truth into them but as you know that will begin with a

7
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:47,180
guided meditation so

8
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:55,039
we establishing yourself in a posture that feels comfortable

9
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:03,379
for some of you that will be sitting whether it's on a cushion or in a chair

10
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:06,379
from the couch

11
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:15,979
and establishing yourself in a posture that feels comfortable and feels grounded

12
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:28,040
and if you are sitting feeling that uprightness of the posture

13
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:37,259
without stiffness but an uprightness so ease

14
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:43,979
and trying to think of a synonym for uprightness but if you have one you

15
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,320
could insert it into your mind

16
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:04,619
and then letting the awareness sense into the body the bodily experience

17
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,820
right now

18
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,859
letting the awareness inhabit the body

19
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,459
and what would it be like to let this awareness fill and

20
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:47,120
encompass the whole body

21
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,120
the quality of spaciousness

22
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,620
spaciousness and ease

23
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,400
right tuning into being sensitive to

24
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,200
the experience of the body

25
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,980
however the body is right now

26
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,400
might be restless might be tired

27
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,080
might be a little bit achy maybe a lot achy

28
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,760
maybe even some numbness not quite sure how the body is

29
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:09,319
however it is can we notice

30
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,540
letting the sense of the body reveal itself to you

31
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:41,699
we don't have to go out and capture it it's allowing it to be seen noticed

32
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,540
felt

33
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,560
because

34
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:21,120
and then however the mind is right now the emotions the thoughts the images

35
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,720
whatever it is can we also

36
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,180
allow that to reveal itself

37
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,060
to be known to be noticed

38
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:55,979
to be known noticed with the quality of gentleness and that

39
00:05:55,979 --> 00:05:58,759
spaciousness

40
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,940
maybe even some warmth

41
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,280
without putting pressure

42
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:50,520
on what's being known allowing this

43
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,600
gentle holding quality of spaciousness and ease

44
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:04,580
allowing experiences to show themselves reveal themselves

45
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:47,639
and can we wish ourselves well extending some kind-heartedness towards

46
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:54,979
ourselves this body is heart this mind

47
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:02,039
wishing it well wishing yourself well

48
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:05,539
with some warm-heartedness

49
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,620
and then if you haven't already resting the attention on the sensations

50
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:12,600
of breathing bringing this ease this spaciousness this warm-heartedness

51
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:23,459
to noticing the experience of inhales and exhales

52
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:16,860
and when the mind wanders as its apt to do

53
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:23,760
no need to make a story judge ourselves

54
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,839
we just very simply gently Begin Again

55
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,860
foreign

56
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:54,200
to do this practice with an attitude of warmth and care

57
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,019
sometimes there can be a little bit of harshness that Creeps in

58
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:06,360
when we notice the mind is wandered or lost in thought

59
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:14,100
or story can we even have one-heartedness towards

60
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,819
the harshness

61
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:53,459
foreign

62
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,199

[Music]

68
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:49,440
hello it's lovely to practice together so nice to sit in community even if it's right

69
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:57,179
this kind of modern version of community remember and chat boxes on YouTube and these

70
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:04,100
kinds of things so thank you for are sitting together

71
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:12,179
and I'd like to continue on this theme that I've been doing this week about letters from Mara

72
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:17,340
to leaders of his armies so he has 10 armies I'm not going to go through all

73
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:23,460
10. and he sends letters to each of them encouraging them to continue in their

74
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:29,340
efforts in obstructing or getting in the way of or preventing people from finding

75
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:36,720
freedom so I'm not also going to worry myself about what exactly is Mara I'm I'm

76
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,760
holding it right now as a rhetorical device a literary device that's getting

77
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:47,399
used to convey something and what's getting conveyed is

78
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:54,120
that we might consider these I don't know maybe these experiences

79
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:01,200
things that prevent us from finding freedom and this way of uh including this

80
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,320
character Mara is a way in that can um depersonalize it make it feel less

81
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:13,740
like oh this is a problem that we have or some failing that we have or something along those lines

82
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:20,760
and so lineage up in Arrow River Hermitage

83
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:28,440
Monastery in Northern Ontario and of course in Canada wrote these letters kind of written more

84
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:36,179
in modern times where Mara is sending letters to the leaders of his armies

85
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:42,500
trying to um encourage these armies to continue

86
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:48,240
preventing people from finding freedom and maybe I'll just say this a small

87
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:56,460
little aside is that I heard I don't know if it's true but I heard that there's an effective way to stop smoking

88
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:02,640
in teenagers was to uh rather than show them the causes of smoking show them

89
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:08,399
their lungs or something like that that they portrayed these an image of these

90
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:14,039
middle-aged white men sitting around a table cackling with how much money they

91
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:20,100
were making how they were getting filthy rich off of getting other people addicted to

92
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:27,240
tobacco products and somehow it was that that activated this inner Rebel in

93
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:33,179
people and said I don't want to be part of that here I'm going to show them I'm not

94
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:39,000
going to get addicted or I'm going to kick my addiction and I admit to something a little bit like that for me

95
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,460
too and these letters tomorrow or letters from Mara that makes me like

96
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,740
it's such a different way like it's such a shift in this orientation away from oh

97
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:55,140
there's something wrong with me I don't have it quite right to this oh no wait I

98
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:01,260
don't want to be part of this I don't have to be part of this so without taking things too literally

99
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:06,360
what I'm pointing to right here is this completely shift in orientation away

100
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:11,820
from I'm doing something wrong to this depersonalized idea of like oh

101
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:17,460
no I can do things different Okay so

102
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:23,099
um today I'd like to talk about this letter from Mara to the leaders of the

103
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:28,679
army of malice and upstancy there's maybe different ways we could

104
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:36,540
translate that but I'm gonna go with what ajampurnadamo has done from uh Mara to the leaders of malice

105
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:41,638
and upstancy and I'm excerpting this letter and it goes like this

106
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:47,099
it's your duty to see to it that beings fall into the

107
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:52,919
habits of aversion it will anger hatred in spite it's your job

108
00:34:52,919 --> 00:35:01,140
to develop mental proliferation around any unhappy feeling tones

109
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:07,440
if they're being being in question is not mindfully aware of their own mental processes and few of them are even

110
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:14,280
marginally aware then we can turn this simple unpleasant feeling tone into a

111
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,380
whole complex of aversion and resentment

112
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:26,300
the raw unpleasant feeling tone is a momentary thing of little significance in and of itself but

113
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:32,700
what fun we can have with it because being engrossed in unhappiness

114
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:38,700
or anger beings are unable to see things clearly

115
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:44,099
they cannot see their true situation and they cannot work out and Escape

116
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:49,380
so we have a whole wide spectrum of emotions to work with there's the very

117
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:54,660
mild and temporary flicker of aversion towards the driver ahead of you on the

118
00:35:54,660 --> 00:36:03,660
freeway there's that smoldering resentment towards the inconsiderate boss at work

119
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:11,520
and there's that bitter lifelong ethnic hatred that can inflame entire nations all of

120
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:16,800
these are Christopher rml and all of these are manifestations of the same

121
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,339
thing but we must be vigilant

122
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:30,500
against that one credible antidote

123
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:37,619
that is Universal loving-kindness this is the one force which we cannot

124
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:45,359
stand so stop it before it is cultivated discredit as a weakness

125
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:52,260
but little do they know that it requires real courage

126
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:57,260
to practice Universal Goodwill

127
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:03,839
so this whole idea of loving kindness sometimes we might think like oh loving

128
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:09,720
kindness that's a that's what you do when you can't do the real practice like somehow it's this lesser practice or a

129
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:17,400
booby Prize or something like this or maybe sometimes when we talk about meta loving kindness we get the sense of

130
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:23,760
oh we're just pretending to be really nice and like everyone or let's just paint the whole world pink

131
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:30,180
or we'll act like Pollyanna or something like that that's these are some of the ideas that people might have when they

132
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:36,119
hear this word of loving kindness or meta but loving kindness Mehta is not

133
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:43,320
that it has a real strength to it

134
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:49,760
it's not a false and flimsy thing it does have the strength

135
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:57,480
but the strength has a softness to it so in some ways Manta loving kindness has

136
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:04,619
this Infinite Strength and this infinite softness which is such a beautiful combination

137
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:10,079
so menta loving kindness is different than what we might think of as love love

138
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:18,720
is this beautiful thing and we need it in our lives and it's part of the human experience but mentosis well

139
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:26,579
wishing it's this deep friendliness but it has this quality of boundlessness

140
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:34,320
and unconditionality and it's these two qualities boundlessness and unconditionality that

141
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:41,700
distinguish it from what we usually think of when we say the word love so boundlessness when we look at our

142
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:47,400
life when we look at our relationships and we look at the movement of care in our life

143
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:53,640
we will see that our care our well-wishing is actually bounded

144
00:38:53,640 --> 00:39:00,839
that we tend to care for those that are immediately around us our partners our family our friends hopefully ourselves

145
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:06,780
too and that's perfectly natural this is what humans do

146
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:13,440
so boundlessness not having any limitations is a really lofty ideal

147
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,980
but that's the direction that it moves that meta moves is this

148
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:25,500
direction to No Limits to boundlessness

149
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:30,839
and in the same way unconditionality is a quality of loving

150
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:37,020
kindness because if we're honest sometimes we might say to a partner or

151
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:44,820
whomever I love you but sometimes there's this quiet little I love you

152
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:51,240
when dot dot dot you know like fill in the blank or I'll love you if you change

153
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:58,980
a little bit I love you except when you do that thing that drives me crazy here or even I

154
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:05,520
can't love me the way that I am I love me myself as soon as you know something

155
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:12,780
else happens this is a normal part of the human experience as well you don't have to

156
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:18,780
beat ourselves up about it but meta loving kindness as this quality

157
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:24,839
of unconditionality no exceptions like no conditions

158
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:31,440
whatsoever and again this is a movement of menta

159
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,660
and we're going to this direction that there's this question of deserving or

160
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:44,280
not deserving just stops making sense it's just well wishing Goodwill

161
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:51,480
so this direction that we're going with meta is one of boundlessness and unconditionality and that distinguishes

162
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:57,960
it from this maybe this different uh way we might experience love

163
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:05,579
and it's also these qualities that help provide that antidote to ill will this

164
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:13,079
antidote to malice and also kind of put in these from Mara this upstancy this

165
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:18,240
um getting stuck in one way and like nope things are this way and they're not that way

166
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:25,859
because if we think about it both ill and obstacy and all these different flavors of it they are very tight

167
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:31,740
and contracted and they have this story often associated with them I can't believe

168
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:38,220
they did this or they don't deserve Goodwill because of that

169
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:43,560
so this movement towards boundlessness and unconditionality

170
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:51,420
is the opposite movement of this contraction and separation and this dug

171
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:58,859
in the heels kind of a Feeling so loving kindness is in some ways it's

172
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:05,460
this um non-abandonment or non-rejection

173
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:11,760
this means not abandoning or rejecting ourselves

174
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:17,520
sometimes it's not so easy and there's a way that when we're lost

175
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:25,880
and ill will or obstacy that we're like cutting ourselves off cutting ourselves off from our hearts

176
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,700
and rejecting others or building a wall around our hearts

177
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:39,660
and so there's a way in which when we're practicing loving kindness we are reclaiming

178
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:47,300
reclaiming maybe that of which we have cast aside or which we have cut ourselves off from maybe all those

179
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:53,180
unexpectable aspects of ourselves which of course show up as unexpected

180
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:57,800
unacceptable aspects of others too

181
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:07,680
so maybe I'll end with this idea that the practice of loving kindness is not

182
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:16,140
an effort to convince ourselves of anything it's not an effort to pretend or demand or plead or

183
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:21,960
about some you know the loving kindness show up instead it's this practice of

184
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:27,359
tapping into something that's already inside of us

185
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:36,440
that already knows about warmth and care and respect

186
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:43,800
it's not a form of positive thinking it's it's a way of focusing on Goodwill

187
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:50,880
instead of ill will it's a way of inclining the mind and

188
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:58,260
heart towards something inside of us that already cares

189
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:05,520
that already is has warmth and this is where the strength and the

190
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,560
softness of ill will I'm sorry of Goodwill shows up of loving kindness of

191
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:16,319
manta I'm not going to talk about love and kindness practice per se there's a number of different ways we can practice

192
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:21,480
it and maybe you already have your own favorite way of practicing

193
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:29,760
but I just want to emphasize the strength and the softness and this movement towards boundlessness

194
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:37,859
and unconditionality that loving kindness and mental practice have and in this way it's a real

195
00:44:37,859 --> 00:44:45,900
antidote to me this ill will or aversion that always comes along with these stories

196
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:51,300
and I don't want to say that you know there isn't Injustice and there isn't

197
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:58,500
oppression and there isn't lots of terrible things happening in the world I am not saying that

198
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:04,140
I am saying as a practice can we tune into

199
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:09,900
this that inside of us that already knows this beautiful quality

200
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:14,940
of warmth and Care respect

201
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:24,380
so with that I wish you all a wonderful rest of the day thank you
