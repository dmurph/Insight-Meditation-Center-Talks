1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:09,600
so welcome welcome everyone as always sweet to see the uh the chat line

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,880
um okay

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,199
that reset

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,080
just all at once embrace

5
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,000
all the experience that is your life

6
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,399
i trust wherever you are

7
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,320
safe enough not to read all the signals here are all

8
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,758
the alarm bells of threat and opportunity

9
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,959
it's safe enough just to

10
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,680
melt into this moment

11
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,599
now the vigilance and all the armoring

12
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,879
all the bracing

13
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,879
the numbed out disconnection

14
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,040
all that just melts into the moment too

15
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,120
we become very alive

16
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:58,440
we surrender some of the reference points the referentiality

17
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,400
sandwiching this moment between the past and the future

18
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:20,919
diligently keeping track of where i end and you begin

19
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,360
keeping tabs on what we like and what we don't like

20
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:44,639
all of these reference points squander

21
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:50,720
the intimacy what's here

22
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,319
what's arising and passing

23
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:57,519
don't fight with yourself at any level my

24
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,920
teacher said

25
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,320
radical permission

26
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,279
for experience to arise and intensify and crest and

27
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,279
fade

28
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,480
we're truly not getting anywhere

29
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,720
not strategizing to get anything

30
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,839
letting experience soften

31
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,839
our heart through the gesture

32
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,480
of non-resistance intimacy

33
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,160
so natural

34
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,759
for us to get called back to our reference points

35
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,360
the story of me my life

36
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,440
what i want what hurts

37
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:14,160
it's like we try to take up some perch in samsara

38
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,480
and see everything from there

39
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:35,879
but the perch is really just more experienced

40
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,480
the illusion of

41
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,399
all our reference points

42
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,320
so we tolerate not knowing

43
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,120
tolerate some concern about

44
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,438
not getting

45
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,360
let me let the heart rest

46
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:33,480
away every experience becomes exchangeable with every other

47
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,520
it's the dance of a nature

48
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,320
and here resting in equanimity

49
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:40,600
we don't pick any sides

50
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:21,240
it's good too um good to sit with you

51
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:41,440
in this uh realm uh benefited from uh

52
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:50,000
brudasa wishes that um all beings dance eddie is in the breeze

53
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,360
with minds left silent

54
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,360
by laying to rest all things

55
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:09,120
um duke uh has displaced dukkha

56
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,840
which has displaced other dukkha

57
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:23,200
and it's hard to keep track of all the things we might worry about

58
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:33,000
there's so much to to care about so much to love

59
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,600
and sometimes it feels like our our nervous system wasn't really designed to

60
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:47,480
care all the time i sort of wish it were

61
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,240
but it doesn't feel that it is and of course how much rest we need how

62
00:31:54,240 --> 00:32:00,960
much the heart needs to rest what constitutes rest that changes over the course of a

63
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,399
practice but

64
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:16,398
a flower isn't meant to be in bloom all the time right

65
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:25,840
sometimes i guess confession time i really wanna

66
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:32,640
i don't they're no closed buds but i really want to pry open the the kind

67
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,120
of pedals that are closed

68
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:45,760
i guess more accurate confession is not that i really want to it's that i do

69
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,880
sometimes i know that's bad it's bad but it's like

70
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:57,440
uh i have issues whatever you know this is my impulse but

71
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,559
a flower is not meant to be in bloom all the time

72
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:08,159
you know heart opens and closes

73
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:14,320
and i was considering the analogy with with sleep sleep you know

74
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,600
sleep this like pervasive disconnection from our

75
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,039
environment we have our dreams but from what's around us pervasively

76
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:34,080
disconnected and that comes as a serious opportunity cost to just disconnect for

77
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,760
five or eight or ten hours

78
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:47,679
but that disconnection actually is necessary for our functioning for our learning for our growth

79
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:54,320
and our heart needs rest too yeah

80
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:00,480
and maybe maybe equanimity is the kind of

81
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:07,760
deepest form of rest for our heart our own hearts way of of sleeping

82
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:12,079
our heart in other words needs

83
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,398
these moments of being unstimulated

84
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,358
we usually try to to rest

85
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:32,480
through more stimulation you know it's like we're over stimulated by life

86
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:40,000
by the human condition by our responsibilities and then to soothe that stimulation we

87
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,240
kind of pile on more stimulation and build a kind of

88
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:53,358
cocoon of unconsciousness and um

89
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,320
we know those moments right of kind of like

90
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,880
usual usually technologically aided unconsciousness you know

91
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:17,359
all the streams of data full and that's a kind of rest but our heart

92
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:24,400
is actually highly stimulated and maybe we say equanimity this fourth

93
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,359
brahmavihara is is something like true rest

94
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:39,359
so ts eliot says teach us to care and not to care and um

95
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:45,838
sounds harsh can't stop caring right

96
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:53,599
just not to care we practice caring and we practice

97
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:58,640
acknowledging that our our wishes do not govern

98
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:05,838
the first noble truth do not govern samsara this realm

99
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,960
and the the buddha did

100
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,720
worry about nihilism worried that

101
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,720
the teachings this path might be construed in such a way

102
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,720
it's compatible with nihilism and

103
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,560
wanted to guard against that and it's uh

104
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,400
there's some concern you know in in emptiness one one experience is it's

105
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:49,599
highly interchangeable with others really the raw material of samsara

106
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,680
doesn't matter much at all

107
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,760
that's what i was alluding to in the sit

108
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:08,800
everything becomes one one taste

109
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,680
so the the play of change of a nietzsche

110
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,560
and sometimes people get the sense from this

111
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,680
that nothing means anything

112
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:33,920
and when nothing means anything love dissolves goodness is at risk

113
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,960
but then there's the other side living with the sense that everything

114
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,640
means everything every moment has

115
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:52,800
tons of riding on it every decision each longing this pain this hope

116
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,160
this lifetime this generation

117
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:07,200
and everything means everything and then you kind of can't stop caring or giving or

118
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:12,640
worrying or can't even justify a moment's rest

119
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:19,838
and so we trace out the middle path

120
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:28,480
the middle path between everything means everything and nothing means anything we trace out the middle path

121
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:36,240
and for me a lot of this is around the relationship the balance of equanimity

122
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:43,280
and compassion equanimity and compassion

123
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:50,720
and so um two two quotes both about uh the death of uh

124
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,400
one's father representing these two sides for me

125
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:03,200
somehow they capture it beautifully equanimity and compassion

126
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,640
so the first first uh karl over north guard

127
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:15,838
um now i saw his lifeless state

128
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,920
and that there was no longer any difference between what once had been my

129
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,400
father and the table he was lying on or the floor on which the table stood or

130
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,320
the wall socket beneath the window or the cable running to the lamp beside

131
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:40,640
him for humans are merely one form among any

132
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:47,920
which the world produces over and over again not only in everything that lives but

133
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:55,359
also in everything that does not live drawn in sand stone and water

134
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:02,160
and death which i have always regarded as the greatest dimension of life dark

135
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,440
compelling was no more than a pipe that springs a

136
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:16,880
leak a branch that cracks in the wind a jacket that slips off a clothes hanger

137
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,838
and falls to the floor

138
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,200
and catherine schultz from uh lost and found

139
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:39,599
this is the essential avaricious nature of loss

140
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:48,160
it encompasses without distinction the trivial and the consequential the abstract and the concrete

141
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,200
the merely misplaced and the permanently gone

142
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:59,520
we often try to ignore its true scope if we can but for a while after my

143
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:06,560
father died i could not stop seeing the world as it really is marked everywhere by the

144
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,720
evidence of past losses and the imminence of future ones

145
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:20,560
this was not because his death was a tragedy my father died peacefully at 74.

146
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,920
tended through his final weeks by those he loved most

147
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:33,280
it was because his death was not a tragedy what shocked me was that something

148
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:39,839
so sad could be the normal necessary way of things

149
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:47,040
in its aftermath each individual life seemed to contain too much heartbreak for its fleeting duration

150
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:53,440
history which i had always loved even in its silences and mysteries

151
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:59,760
suddenly seemed like little more than a record of loss on an epic scale

152
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:08,480
especially where it could offer no record at all the world itself seemed ephemeral

153
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:14,000
glaciers and species and ecosystems the place

154
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,280
of change as swift as in time lapse as if

155
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,800
those of us alive today had been permitted

156
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:32,079
to see it from the harrowing perspective of eternity everything felt fragile

157
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:37,920
everything felt vulnerable the idea of loss pressed in

158
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:44,000
all around me like a hidden order to existence

159
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,079
that emerged only in the presence of grief

160
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:04,480
the hanger jacket slipping to the floor

161
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:12,160
or something so sad the shock of something that's so

162
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:17,440
sad could be the normal necessary way of things

163
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:24,560
and so we have equanimity and compassion in relationship

164
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:28,480
in relationship

165
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:37,838
equanimity perhaps purifies our compassion

166
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:45,119
our compassion when purified by equanimity becomes

167
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:53,240
less compulsive less co-dependent less grandiose the self-righteous

168
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,680
more patient

169
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:07,200
and then our compassion is strengthened by equanimity actions arising from

170
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,560
equanimity are more potent have greater moral force

171
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:16,480
than those arising from clinging

172
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:24,560
and so we we zigzag our way through caring and not

173
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:30,400
caring finding finding the balance that's right in our

174
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,240
heart for our energy for what we're willing to give right now

175
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,920
and we rest and we serve and we rest and we serve

176
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:50,760
