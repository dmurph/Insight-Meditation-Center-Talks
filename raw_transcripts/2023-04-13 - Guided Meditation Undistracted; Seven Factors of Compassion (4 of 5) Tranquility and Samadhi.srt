1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:10,219
so greetings and nice to be here with all of you

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,960
and I feel kind of cozy sitting here I've been this is the second time I've sat down here to meditate in this Hall

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,320
today six o'clock there was a meditation with the group that's here

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:31,279
it's very nice and now with the with this with all of you thank you for being here

5
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,660
and um

6
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:43,320
one useful definition for mindfulness

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,960
is that it's being undistracted

8
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:56,100
and why that's useful is that it doesn't imply that we have to do anything except

9
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,379
maybe let go of our distractions and then

10
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,260
we are there aware of whatever is left

11
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:13,560
so to let go of distracting thoughts let go of thoughts that interfere with

12
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:21,060
being aware and then be aware in whatever way remains

13
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,340
being aware of whatever arises

14
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:33,420
and without you could even be without any choice

15
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,979
whatever arises in the present moment in Awareness is allowed to be there

16
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,259
and this kind of way of understanding mindfulness is supported

17
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:54,720
by the idea that uh that were present for whatever arises

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,240
easily we're not looking for something or trying to make something happen or

19
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:10,940
trying to penetrate deeply into the nature of reality we just very simple lightly calmly

20
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:18,360
receptively easily with ease whatever comes

21
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:24,060
and it can be a little bit uh easy to be impatient or feel like it's

22
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,580
not enough because after all meditation mindfulness Buddhism is pointing to

23
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:35,640
you know all kinds of fantastic great States of meditation and attainments and all kinds

24
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,180
of great things and so I mean that's what's important and just something ordinary like just whatever comes arises

25
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:47,540
in awareness may seem like it's too ordinary

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,519
but it's not the ordinary because most people live their lives distracted

27
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,540
and and uh

28
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:09,180
and they in the continuity of this ordinary

29
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:15,480
easeful undestructive state leads to Great freedom

30
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:22,260
it is a kind of a freedom in itself so

31
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:28,200
um to begin with a posture

32
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,560
that has a little bit of intentionality in it if you're sitting in a very relaxed way

33
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,580
on an easy chair or some other posture that's very relaxed

34
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,400
see if you can do a small adjustment that adds a little bit of intentionality

35
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:53,099
to the posture it could be sitting up a little bit straighter

36
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:59,819
if you're meditating laying in bed you might stick your forearm Point your

37
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:05,940
foreign forearm up towards the ceiling the upper arm can be flat in the bed and so at a right

38
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:11,459
angle the forearm points this up and and that's a little bit more virus requires

39
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:14,420
some intentionality

40
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,180
and then gently close your eyes

41
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,979
and without much more preparation

42
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:43,740
What In your experience Here and Now arises effortlessly or arises easily

43
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,860
what is easy to be aware of Here and Now

44
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,220
and as you're aware of whatever is easy

45
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:14,400
is there any momentum movement in the mind

46
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,960
to wander off in thought

47
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,639
they're kind of wandering off where

48
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:33,620
that eclipses oh where present moment awareness

49
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:40,820
kind of wandering off in thought where we lose touch with

50
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:51,419
being easily aware aware of what comes easily to

51
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:55,340
to us here and now

52
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:14,120
and if you do find yourself moving into distracted thoughts

53
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,478
you might just use the phrase or the word

54
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,380
undestructed oh maybe like a question

55
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:35,819
or a reminder to open again

56
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:41,160
in an easy way to be aware

57
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:48,120
of what's easy here what's left

58
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,100
when you are undistracted

59
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,199
for now there's nothing else you need to do you don't have to focus on the

60
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,419
breathing you don't have to

61
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:42,660
have a something that you're focusing on and

62
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:45,500
trying to stay with

63
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,460
just come back to this simple place

64
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:00,360
where you can be aware of what appears easily

65
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,319
in awareness

66
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,459
and if there's commentary and judgments about anything

67
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:42,320
that's also a pull away

68
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,140
from being aware easily

69
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:44,580
staying close to this undistracted place being aware of what comes into awareness

70
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:51,420
ease easily you might notice that the mind sometimes

71
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:57,380
settles on certain experiences other times

72
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,279
there's a shifting Sensations that are coming in

73
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:11,120
almost like the mind just moves between things and floats

74
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:18,899
and all kinds of things are appearing shifting

75
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,100
and undistracted

76
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,860
and then you might

77
00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:03,680
let awareness be more centered on the body breathing

78
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,860
becoming aware of whatever sensations of breathing

79
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,360
arise easily into awareness

80
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:08,300
oh

81
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:36,000
as you return to undistractedness

82
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:43,440
and being aware with ease for whatever is easy

83
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:51,680
easily comes to awareness whatever is easy about the breathing

84
00:15:52,079 --> 00:16:00,560
is there any tranquility calm or peace

85
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,560
in that easeful awareness

86
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,280
undistracted

87
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:08,900
what remains when you're undistracted

88
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,200
and what is it like to be aware of that

89
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:19,940
easily with ease

90
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:51,919
and if whatever is occurring here for you

91
00:23:53,700 --> 00:24:02,539
is uncomfortable or painful physically emotionally mentally

92
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:14,360
what might it be like to know it

93
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:22,740
with this easeful awareness whatever is painful

94
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:30,179
whatever is Duke let it appear let it arise easily into

95
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:38,360
awareness without becoming distracted by it

96
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:46,340
without being pulled into commentary and stories

97
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,440
undistracted awareness

98
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:01,820
of the challenges that arise simply and easily

99
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:09,200
Here and Now the hereness of them

100
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:33,779
and in the Simplicity of awareness might there also be a tenderness or

101
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:40,820
warm-heartedness a compassion

102
00:25:43,799 --> 00:25:48,740
that vibrates or was awakened

103
00:25:53,520 --> 00:26:00,120
in the ease in the calm

104
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,840
is part of easy awareness calm awareness

105
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:13,679
easy compassion easy tenderness

106
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:18,419
kind-heartedness

107
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:39,559
and now as we're coming to the end of the meditation

108
00:26:39,779 --> 00:26:48,380
bringing to mind someone in your life who has challenges of some type or other

109
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:52,640
and in these last couple of minutes

110
00:26:54,659 --> 00:27:00,419
bring them to mind and see if there can be for a couple of

111
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:06,539
minutes a simple light useful

112
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:10,799
sense of care compassion

113
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,820
tender harderness

114
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,500
kind-heartedness

115
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,000
not a doing so much as

116
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,620
what can I Rise

117
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:39,200
when we're undistracted

118
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:25,320
and may our ability to be undistracted

119
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,760
as we go about this suffering world

120
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:42,380
and allow for our capacity for simple compassion

121
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:48,080
to be present and available

122
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,919
always ready to wish everyone well

123
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:04,880
may all beings be happy

124
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:11,120
may all beings be free of their suffering

125
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:21,260
may all beings have their burdens and oppression lifted

126
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:27,980
may all beings be free of their afflictions

127
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:32,539
they they may they get well

128
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:42,020
may all beings be safe of harm

129
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:54,380
they all beings experience peace not war

130
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,899
may all beings be free

131
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:10,220
so they can breathe easily smile easily

132
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:22,880
care easily may we all care for each other

133
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:48,170
[Music]

134
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,039
thank you

135
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,360
foreign

136
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,658
thank you

137
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:20,340
so hello and Welcome to our fourth

138
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:26,220
talk on the seven factors of compassion

139
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:34,440
and today we talk about the Tranquility factor of compassion and

140
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:40,100
the samadi factor of compassion

141
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,480
so just to kind of review a little bit a few weeks ago about three weeks ago I

142
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:53,159
suppose two weeks ago I gave it a series of talks on kind of the foundational elements for compassion

143
00:32:53,159 --> 00:33:01,440
the things that ideally would be in place so that compassion can come forth in a in a healthy and useful way

144
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,799
and so learning how to be aware in a calm non-reactive way just to be

145
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:13,580
aware and to be aware what's happening with it within us carefully and well so we can

146
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:20,279
track and monitor monitor our response to compassion and how to be

147
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:26,580
compassionate so I'm just learning to be aware and then to be attuned

148
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:32,519
to attune ourselves to the people we're with the compassion that we're being present for

149
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:40,260
to find the right way to be in harmony with it before we act maybe even before we focus

150
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:46,019
on Compassion or and then appreciation

151
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:52,440
to have some deep respect and appreciation for oneself or others so that when we're compassionate it's

152
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:58,860
not pity it's not kind of uh feeling sorry for someone but uh maybe there's

153
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:04,860
something there more important than compassion which is a deep honoring and valuing of

154
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:13,638
of fathers and oneself and then there is an aspiration

155
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:19,020
aspiration that people not suffer that we don't have suffering that we come to

156
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:24,419
the end of it that we support the end of it and then there's action

157
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:31,440
and when all those five things are in place then compassion has a healthier foundation for being supportive and

158
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,599
actually nourishing for our lives rather than being debilitated by The Compassion

159
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:42,118
because it's so painful and exhausting it's actually enlivening and valuable

160
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:48,599
for everyone and um and uh this week it's when we do

161
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:53,700
have compassion to continue practicing with the presence

162
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:59,400
of compassion not just take it for granted or not just take it as being something we have to now live with as it

163
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,920
is but to begin appreciating some of the different elements that follow in the

164
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:12,060
wake of the compassion if there's healthy compassion then as we live compassionately

165
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:17,480
um there will be mindfulness there will be a kind of a natural easeful awareness

166
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:23,579
if we're coming from that motivation of being present for somebody or someone

167
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:28,800
ourselves with compassion and we don't have to work on that so

168
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,839
much to be mindful it just kind of comes along in the wake of the compassion but and that awareness that comes along

169
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:43,380
is useful so that we can really see better what's happening as we're compassionate and see are there ways

170
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:48,960
that we're operating that are harmful or not harmful and harmful or beneficial

171
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,599
are we a little bit straining are we a little bit under the burden of responsibility and contracted around

172
00:35:54,599 --> 00:36:01,200
that are we a little bit afraid are we feel like we have to jump in or

173
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:08,880
so how are we with it and to see the difference between a way of operating which is not so

174
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:15,720
healthy or beneficial and then one that is so rather than being straining to learn

175
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:21,300
how to be present and engaged with with the kind of ease or relaxation rather

176
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:30,780
than clinging to something finding a place of non-clinging so that compassion can flow more more effectively

177
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:36,619
and um the um

178
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:44,339
and so and as we make these distinctions and seeing where the challenges are with

179
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:51,119
the compassion and adjusting for it that's the effort factor of of compassion we do make some effort and

180
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,220
follow a path or make the choice to go in the direction of where it's more

181
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:02,520
useful where it's more free where it's more you know less clinging less attachment

182
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:08,940
less resistance less burden and so there is a effort factor of

183
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:15,180
compassion that comes along with the compassion that supports it and then there's the appreciation side

184
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:21,780
The Joy side of compassion there's something very where there's a there's a kind of sweetness that comes from

185
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:28,560
healthy compassion and if we don't feel that sweetness we probably should go back and review and

186
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,960
do these other steps and maybe even go back to this the Four A's awareness

187
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:40,020
Attunement appreciation to really see what's going on here

188
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:45,060
with us ourselves and then and then comes Tranquility

189
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:50,880
calmness that healthy compassion has a calmness

190
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,920
to it a Tranquility to it I've sometimes responded with compassion

191
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:04,339
to try to take care of something in the world and that seemed to be taken care of right away and because I I acted

192
00:38:04,339 --> 00:38:11,760
reactively kind of agitated I have to do something and jumped right in I ended up making a mistake

193
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,040
and once I thought there was a little fire

194
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:22,260
in the distance from the farm I was living on and without

195
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:28,980
I wasn't calm I got immediately activated I didn't take the time to take a second look before I called the fire

196
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:37,380
department and they came and I don't know what it was anymore now it was so long ago over 50 years ago but or so 50

197
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:43,740
years ago that it was some kind of it wasn't that wasn't a fire and and if I

198
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:50,280
had actually taken the time to look I would have seen that you know there was not not a problem

199
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:56,700
so this idea of being calm have enough calmness to see clearly so the calm factor of Awakening

200
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:04,020
and that is supported a lot by the ability to trust easeful awareness to

201
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:10,380
trust and awareness that's not straining or not under the burden of the need our

202
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:16,140
needs or our desires our fears that's not easy to find but it's part of

203
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:21,420
the gift of this practice as we do this practice is discovering this useful calm

204
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,940
awareness so that the compassion can exist without calmness as well

205
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:34,680
and then it comes this fascinating wonderful capacity of compassion to support concentration samadhi so the

206
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:41,940
samadhi factor of compassion that and a lot of somebody is a

207
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:49,020
unification gathering together I like to think of it of feeling so at home in our

208
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:54,480
experience that we just kind of settle into the

209
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,940
settle really deeply so that all of who we are settles together and feels at

210
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:05,460
home with itself and so what that means about samadhi is

211
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:10,640
that um it's not meant to override

212
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:17,579
Uka our challenges or override the way we're distracted or varied our suffering

213
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:25,260
um it's a samadhi should wait until we find a way to be present for what's challenging for

214
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:32,300
us find our way through it with mindfulness with compassion with care with attention

215
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:38,040
so that so that we do find that even in the midst of challenging experiences in

216
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:43,859
life we've found kind of an inner home that we're home in our hearts we're home

217
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:50,460
in our inner well-being and again that's not an easy thing to come to at all it might take years for

218
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:56,040
some people practicing to find that but that that's when we begin at that point

219
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:03,720
we can appreciate how compassion is an ingredient for a samadhi for uh it's

220
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:09,480
part and parcel of this being collected and settled and contented and and just

221
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:15,300
really kind of gathered around so that the focus of compassion the focus of

222
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:21,359
attention can be an effective way just here with what's needing to be done just

223
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:29,099
here gather together in the moment and uh and so when we have this easeful

224
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:36,300
relaxed kind of way of being present and this beef at home this in this world even if the external World we're not at

225
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:43,079
home and we're at home with ourselves we feel like we belong to ourselves we belong here we belong in this universe

226
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:50,520
in some way even though maybe even the people around us are don't feel that we belong we carry our belonging with us we

227
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:56,040
carry our subtleness with us that's part of the gift of samadhi

228
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:03,000
especially if samadhi is not held on to as some kind of only some

229
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,820
kind of deep state of concentration in meditation holding on and attached to it has to be

230
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:14,280
really kind of something special there are deep states of meditation

231
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:21,359
that happened they're called somalis and but some the samadhi in daily life

232
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:28,440
of meeting the world is more the the after effect of being settled and

233
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,839
calm whatever ability we have to settle and calm and be centered and belong and

234
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:39,619
be feel cozy and at home here um and if it is very deep states of concentration

235
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:46,200
it's kind of the the after effect of that that teaches us how to be feel at home

236
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:52,380
or be at home to ourselves that after effect is also a kind of I think of it as samadhi

237
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:59,000
and so to to allow for that reference point to be there

238
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:06,000
and and then it's really really a fantastic thing and then with that samadhi without the kind of ability to

239
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:13,380
gather around and let the concentration just be and the attention really be present for what needs our attention

240
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:19,440
and that's part of the sweetness that can come from compassion so an example I

241
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:27,119
gave in earlier a little girl who scraped her knee in the playground that we care for we care we try to be

242
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:33,180
sensitive to a tune to her and and care for the wound and in her and the kindest

243
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:40,440
most supportive way for her and so but that's is there's an ease to that we're not to learn because you know is not a

244
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:45,900
big danger she's in we're present in a kind caring away and we almost become

245
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:51,540
self-forgetting in caring for something like that and then that's self-forgetting there's

246
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:58,500
a deeper and if we're at home in ourselves and collected here for ourselves then that Gathering of attention to care

247
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:03,540
for her knee or care for her comes along with our capacity to gather

248
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:09,839
in or our unification of being focused just focused and concentrated on the

249
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:16,560
task at hand that has a sweetness to it it's so sweet to have this ability to be focused in

250
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:22,460
this kind of way and um so the the the

251
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:28,260
samadhi factor of compassion so we're going through these and we have

252
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:34,440
one more tomorrow the Equanimity Factor and what I'm hoping that you'll learn

253
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:40,140
from this is that not to take compassion as a fixed thing like you like you're

254
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:47,160
either compassionate or not compassionate and then you're compassionate whatever way you're compassionate and um and you don't want

255
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:52,680
to hear anything else you know you want you know this is my way of being compassionate or something or or you've

256
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:58,260
never thought about it you're just compassionate the way you are and think you're supposed to be that way

257
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:05,220
not aware that compassion has many flavors and many component parts many aspects many things interact with

258
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:11,160
compassion and so to learn to be mindful of compassion and appreciating the

259
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:16,740
different factors of it then then we can start playing in the playground of

260
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:24,240
compassion we can start kind of exploring it and adjusting it and finding how the best of compassion can

261
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:31,260
come forward and and so it's not just you know the compassion just happens to arise which

262
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:36,359
might sometimes not be so healthy um what we call Compassion but we find

263
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:41,400
that which is most healthy for ourselves and for others

264
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:49,140
so um so if you would like for today

265
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:54,660
um maybe focus on um tranquility and calmness

266
00:45:54,660 --> 00:46:01,140
if you have occasion for have compassion for the suffering of

267
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:06,180
others and in the circumstances allows you to take some time with it you don't have to

268
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:12,420
jump into action um so you can kind of do the experiment to kind of explore

269
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:17,760
how can you um feel the warm-hearted tender compassion

270
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:24,960
for somebody and um or for yourself and let there be a Tranquility as part of it that maybe

271
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,060
it floats on Tranquility or it's supported by Tranquility or it just the

272
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:37,200
compassion is tranquil itself and um and you know try not to feel or

273
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:44,400
fall into the Trap of the worry that you're betraying compassion by focusing on having it be

274
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:50,819
or some other person by finding the Tranquility for it actually it supports

275
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:57,140
um and helps grow healthy compassion in a wonderful way

276
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:03,260
so thank you all very much and I look forward to our time tomorrow
