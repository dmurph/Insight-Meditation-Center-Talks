1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:09,200
ah good morning so here we are today the technology

2
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:16,198
was operating in unexpected ways we have the software that uh called OBS which we

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,160
use to broadcast from the computer to YouTube ah good morning and it was not

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,840
uh working somehow took a while to set up and once it figured it out it's not

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:35,200
quite right I believe the video in uh on YouTube it's not really filling the

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,280
screen so but that's okay it's amazing that we can even be here this way and

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:48,239
I'm delighted to share this time with you and um and uh hopefully

8
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,239
we'll work out some of these bugs that are

9
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:01,160
occurring so welcome to our meditation

10
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:08,759
and um today uh to support the teachings

11
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:15,360
afterwards I would like to emphasize that uh to stay close to

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,960
something that's wholesome something that feels healthy for you in terms of

13
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,079
how you're aware so sometimes I talk about calm

14
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:34,880
awareness some people might talk about um non non-c contentious

15
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:42,439
awareness or an awareness which makes room for what's here breathing room and

16
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:48,079
awareness that's very simple and awareness that's warm and

17
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:54,040
kind an awareness which is aquanus with whatever goes

18
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:00,840
on an awareness that is not caught or entangled

19
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:09,080
reactive to what we're aware of to find a way of being aware being

20
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:16,760
mindful to recognize what's happening to know what's happening to sense and feel what's

21
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:23,959
happening in a way that feels good feels nice for you and then stay close to that

22
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:31,200
maintain it be in touch with it use it as a guide use it as the maybe the bow

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,280
of the boat that's moving through the water in a nice clean

24
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:44,480
way have it be the pedals of your bike that you're always in touch with always

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,800
moving let it be the the pitting of the cat the hand

26
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:58,360
going down gently lovingly pitting the cat we might feel depressed or angry but

27
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:07,480
it feels good to pet the cat so see let's see if we can find a way to be aware that keeps us aware keeps us

28
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:15,720
connected so to close your eyes assume your meditation

29
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,519
posture and to relax

30
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:34,599
soften let there be a gentle of your

31
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,799
body with every exhale soften relax in your

32
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:05,439
body and then to soften and relax your

33
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:14,200
mind your thinking mind your thinking activity any agitation or tension in

34
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:24,400
your mind soften around it a gentling of the Mind

35
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,320
and gentling the Heart

36
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,720
softly kind ly

37
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,840
calmly approach the heart your feeling heart with whatever

38
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,400
way you're feeling and as you exhale a

39
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:25,039
softening an opening a settling of the heart

40
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:47,240
and then becoming aware of your breathing but be aware of your breathing

41
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,240
lightly

42
00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:00,280
softly almost as if you're walking

43
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:08,800
in the park with a friend talking and you're lightly aware of the

44
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,919
trees around you so it's kind of very light awareness

45
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,240
of breathing and the friend to be talking with to pay attention

46
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:28,039
to is awareness itself how you are

47
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:33,080
mindful so number of ways to be

48
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:40,080
mindful it can just be a general feeling of being present being

49
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:45,880
aware or it could be acts of

50
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:52,240
recognition knowing what's happening it could be feeling and

51
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:59,360
sensing through your body or all of the above

52
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:11,360
see if the way that you can be in the present know the present be aware in the

53
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:21,680
present be awake in the present can feel healthy feel good feel

54
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:29,160
satisfying calm nonc contentious

55
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,039
open

56
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:55,520
receptive and then with that awareness as if awareness

57
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:15,440
is like a warm friend settle the awareness on the body

58
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,639
breathing where the continuity of

59
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:30,440
breathing is the means the way that you can stay with a con

60
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:37,680
continuity of a gentle awareness calm awareness of the

61
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,320
present like you would if you are petting a cat you might

62
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,560
feel all kinds of difficult

63
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,959
emotions but part of you would be G petting the cat gently

64
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:02,560
softly that would support the cat to

65
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,320
purr so you might be feeling all kinds of things now but let how you're aware

66
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,720
of the rhythm of breathing the coming and going of INB breath and out

67
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,600
breath stay in touch with a calm

68
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:28,440
awareness some way of being aware that feels healthy or wholesome

69
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,760
or like you're pedaling on a bike gently happily through the park but

70
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,920
there's a continuity of moving the legs having

71
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,680
contact with the

72
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320

for

101
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
for e

102
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:25,039
it's quite common for people to be

103
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:32,720
absorbed in the object of awareness the object of their

104
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,440
thinking what they're aware of what they're thinking

105
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:47,840
about in the practice of mindfulness we're Shifting the

106
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:55,640
balance so that half of our attention is on the quality of our

107
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,279
attention itself

108
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:10,200
and that half of attention that goes to that can become of our time second

109
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:16,039
nature it becomes a way of staying

110
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:26,960
connected to a nourishing way to be awake to be present to be

111
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,360
here awake

112
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:47,279
and that 50% attention to how we're aware allows us actually to be more

113
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:54,720
aware of others the people in our lives it's as if our capacity to be

114
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,039
present for people increases there's more

115
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:09,080
room more sensitivity more care and may it be so that this practice

116
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:15,919
of meditation practice of mindfulness is a training and increasing

117
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:24,200
our capacity for present moment awareness so we can have this nourishing

118
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:35,480
open attention to take in and feel and know others in a wise way in a balanced

119
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:44,039
way and in so doing to feel a deeper connection feel a deeper sense of a

120
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:52,158
shared Humanity deeper sense of people's

121
00:25:54,399 --> 00:26:01,840
challenges and then and our care our our love our warmth our friendship

122
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:11,200
friendliness can be more present may all beings be

123
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:16,039
happy may all beings be

124
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:26,159
safe may all beings be peaceful may all beings be

125
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:32,760
free and may we contribute to that

126
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:45,949
[Music]

127
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:55,080
possibility thank

128
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,240
you e

129
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:04,320
so hello and welcome to this third uh talk that I'm calling the four truths of

130
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,799
happiness and they are complement to the Buddhist teachings on the four

131
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:20,720
noble truths of suffering which I talked about last week and um these the the two pairs of

132
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,120
four complement each other kind of parallel each other but one of the

133
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:33,080
things they have in common kind of at this Center of them is they concern our

134
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:38,880
contribution to our state of mind state of heart or state of

135
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:45,440
being and uh the four noble truths have to do with how we contribute to what's

136
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:51,880
called suffering Dua emotional pain and it's not necessarily all

137
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:59,279
emotional pain but that emotional pain which we do in fact contribute to

138
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:04,679
uh and the contribution is summarized in uh the word

139
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:10,720
craving and or thirsting having thirst for stuff they kind of a compulsive

140
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:17,720
desire and that as long as this compulsive desire is operating uh there's frustration there's expectation

141
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:24,600
there's tension there's stress there is um uh more elaborate things that begin

142
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:32,480
happening around that compulsive desire which uh is uh building from a desire um

143
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,519
uh identities layers and layers of identities and stories and realities

144
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:43,399
that we live in and so we want to be careful and see

145
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:49,519
how we contribute to the suffering our role um we don't ignore the role of

146
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:56,320
others or other situations but at least we take care of our our contribution and it

147
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:03,279
makes a worldly difference for the four truths of of Happiness uh we also have a contribution

148
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:10,760
to make and uh we don't just leave our happiness to chance hoping that the world will somehow provide it for us

149
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:17,039
hoping that something out there will do it if we pay enough money or if we you know if we find the right person to be

150
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:24,279
with there all kinds of things that we're looking out there for happiness but we find it within and we find what

151
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:29,440
what within contributes to that what we can know for ourselves elves or we can

152
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,600
experience for ourselves what we contri can contribute and that's to contribute uh

153
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:41,519
wholesome states of being wholesome activities uh ethical live

154
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,640
ethically uh do the things which are wholesome that for our heart feel good

155
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:53,600
not things which are stressful not things that are dutiful and we should do and to do be the be the right kind of

156
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,679
person but to start learning to touch into it to discover

157
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:04,679
uh the natural goodness the natural wholesomeness that we're capable of of

158
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:09,919
and how there can well up from within if we're relaxed enough if we're settled

159
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:15,600
enough if we're connected to ourselves enough so part of what we contribute to

160
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:23,159
our own happiness is a practice of mindfulness is a practice of being present and aware so that that can

161
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:28,519
follow uh that we can then recognize what is wholesome recognize healthy

162
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:33,679
States and activities and then uh we can call on

163
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:40,240
them the third truth of happiness is that uh once we recognize

164
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:47,039
these wholesome states of being and mindfulness itself done well done calmly

165
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:52,600
not contentiously um equanimous is actually considered to be

166
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:59,039
extremely wholesome it can be and that's kind of like the bottom line perhaps

167
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:05,600
there but as we start connect to the wholesome as we start connecting to what feels that brings us

168
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:11,120
well-being stay close to it uh the Buddha talked about states of well-being

169
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:19,000
states of wholesomeness are things that we should maintain the causes of suffering are

170
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,960
things we want to bring to an end the conditions that bring about

171
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:31,480
well-being we want to maintain we want to stay close to it uh I've been many

172
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:37,679
situations where I felt pretty happy and then uh I had a to-do list to do and I

173
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,559
threw myself into the to-do list and I got grumpy I got irritated I got

174
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:49,200
frustrated um and U and unnecessarily

175
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:57,080
so but I gave gave away gave up on my well-being I ignored it in favor of the

176
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:03,720
things to do other times I felt connected I've maintained my sense of calm my sense of

177
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,919
ease my sense of joy and happiness and I've also had a to-do list

178
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:16,279
to-do and I did it uh out of that well-being with that well-being usually

179
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:21,639
what happens then I do a little bit slower usually I do it with more delight and

180
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:27,799
joy and usually I make less mistakes usually there's less repetition usually

181
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:34,639
gets done well the first time so while it's slow you know sometimes slow is what

182
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:40,279
gets things to done done the fastest so this idea of

183
00:33:40,279 --> 00:33:46,559
maintaining uh and that's some message that many Buddhists don't seem to get because there's so much emphasis on

184
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:53,519
letting go not holding on to anything um and uh so much emphasis on

185
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,559
um me just showing up for the next moment the next moment that there's no

186
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:04,720
no sense of let's maintain something um so the example that of

187
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,158
petting the cat uh you have to maintain the petting for the cat to keep purring

188
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,679
and you get instant feedback if you stop so that there has to be maintaining

189
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:23,118
of something so it's our heart the way we nourish nurture pet our heart pet

190
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:29,040
care for it it needs maintenance it needs attention needs care

191
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:36,440
this doesn't have to be selfish it doesn't have to be at the expense of others it doesn't have to be um uh kind

192
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:44,200
of uh done with attachment doesn't have to be done with any clinging um maintaining is not the same

193
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:52,320
thing as attachment maintaining you know I maintain my car usually I go get the oil

194
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,400
changed but I have no attachment to you know in a sense to do or not doing it

195
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,440
just a matter of fact thing to do so we maintain our heart we maintain the

196
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:11,000
wholesomeness that's here so that's so we contribute to our happiness and the word

197
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:19,160
contribute is a choice word because it's not meaning we cause it uh this is uh to have to be the cause

198
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:28,160
of our suffering and focus on causing it to happen just messes it up but what we do is it's almost like uh

199
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:34,200
uh uh let me be happy the heart willing kind of an openness in allowing

200
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:40,400
and trusting because who knows what the heart wants to reveal what's what it wants to show at any given time there

201
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,960
might be unresolved anger or grief that needs to come that doesn't look like

202
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:51,079
conventional happiness however there can be a way in which it feels good feels

203
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:56,240
healthy to let it be there feels like there's a healthy awareness capacity to

204
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:03,480
be present they this is good and this is true this is really connecting to a true

205
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:10,480
process a true uh depth of what's really concerning me and it's good to be here

206
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:17,640
with it and so then we maintain the goodness or the healthiness of how we

207
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:24,839
relate to our anger how we relate to our our um grief um we don't looking for

208
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:30,560
kind of cheerful mindfulness I mean cheerful happiness we're looking for a way of being that

209
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:37,280
feels so good that feels right given the circumstance and U and th that's

210
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:46,480
contributing the conditions out of which well-being and joy can arise the Buddha used a language

211
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:55,480
a language of uh birth to describe Joy appearing for us a a joy is born it's

212
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:00,880
not something we cause and so sometimes we have to spend time letting something

213
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,480
gestate letting something mature and Sprout for joy to arise we have to

214
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:15,040
contribute the care like a gardener would care for a garden and but then so the third Noble

215
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:23,520
Truth of happiness is uh maintain the well-being

216
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,920
maintain a satisfying form of awareness of mindfulness

217
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:37,160
maintain care and friendliness maintain Joy maintain Delight stay close to it

218
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:44,079
stay in touch don't get too far away from it by getting distracted and busy and overwhelmed by the to-do list or

219
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:52,160
whatever is going on you can do that but uh to allow this Garden to grow

220
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,800
to allow the happiness to grow to allow the clarity to grow and the freedom to

221
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:03,560
grow uh the conditions the right conditions have to be there not just

222
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:09,880
wishful thinking not just touching in just a few times a day to some kind of

223
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:17,800
calm state but for the garden to really grow it needs to be have sunlight on it all

224
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:24,440
day long so to maintain these good things and maintain it through the

225
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:33,040
day e said difficult to do but satisfying to do and it becomes

226
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:38,599
second nature like riding a bike after a while becomes second nature we can

227
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:48,359
live closely in touch with our inner well-being our inner wholesomeness it is

228
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:55,119
possible so um so this is a

229
00:38:55,560 --> 00:39:03,880
third truth of happiness and so um today as you go through your

230
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:10,119
day find a way to remind yourself again yesterday I suggested tying a string

231
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:16,319
around your finger maybe today do something a little bit more uh reminds

232
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:21,640
you even even more strongly perhaps or you can put a timer on your phone to

233
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:28,359
maybe to go off every 10 minutes or something or you you some kind of

234
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:34,520
reminder and um check in and see if you can tap

235
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:43,599
into what feels wholesome within and if it's if you don't feel anything wholesome within that's a time to uh

236
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:50,319
we're finding out how to be aware in a Wholesome Way how to be aware in a way

237
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:58,160
that feels good feels satisfying feels calm feels spacious feels

238
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:05,599
um supportive uh is invaluable at the minimum no matter how difficult things

239
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:11,760
get 50% attention on how we're aware so that how we're

240
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:18,000
aware um can be nourishing for us beneficial and create the conditions for

241
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,280
other wholesomeness come out to be born and the fact that it's 50%

242
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,920
attention on yourself and how you're aware embodied awareness being connected

243
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:34,960
here doesn't mean that you does not mean you have to have less awareness for other people or for the activities you

244
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:41,200
do it actually can give more because our capacity to be aware can

245
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,680
grow and to have this 5050 uh awareness of here awareness here

246
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:54,920
with how you're aware how you are and 50% with what you're doing people you're with um creates the conditions that the

247
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:01,480
sum total of your awareness may be triples so you clearly have more

248
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:07,599
awareness for what you're doing than you had before but you do it with this able

249
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:13,920
to stay closely in touch with what's happening here so you

250
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,319
can know yourself better but maybe also you can be stay in touch to

251
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:27,319
maintain what is good maintain the wholesome maintain it through the day so

252
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:32,359
so I wish you well with that I hope you take this on and see what you learn in

253
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:37,559
the process thank you
