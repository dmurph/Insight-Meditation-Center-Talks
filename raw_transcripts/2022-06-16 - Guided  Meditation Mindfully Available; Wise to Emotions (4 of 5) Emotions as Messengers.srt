1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:10,080
hello everyone and happy to be here and

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,920
wonderful to have this to have this clear sense of

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:22,000
meditating together with the in community with others

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,240
even though i'm looking mostly at the camera as i speak

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:35,040
i have a very rich sense of um those of you who are at the other end of

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,920
this and seeing that chats helps tremendously with that and and um both the names that i recognize

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,160
and those that are new and so thank you all for being here

8
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:59,039
one of the attitudes with which to meditate

9
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,280
is an attitude of curiosity or interest

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,880
of wanting to really know what is happening here in the moment in our experience

11
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,799
and to have that kind of interest in knowing

12
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:27,400
what is here while at the same time not trying to understand

13
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,520
and the reason not to try to understand is then we will be not meditating we'll be thinking

14
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,479
reflecting probing so the art of this is to have that

15
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,920
interest where the eyes the perception the attention

16
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,960
is has a nice alertness to it

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:58,880
as if we're trying to discover the message that's available here

18
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,920
as if we're trying to understand it we're available for it and so rather than trying to figure

19
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,400
anything out there is heightened availability as if there is a profound message to be

20
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,440
discovered here but only a message that only can be discovered

21
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,120
if we don't actively try to discover it but rather be available to it so that

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,800
kind of interest and and it might be

23
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,360
and some of this has to do with beginning to understand the deeper conditionality deeper

24
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,560
conditions that are coming into play that are operating in the moment as we're living our lives

25
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,879
and the message that we can receive is that see the deeper structures of what's happening the deeper

26
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,959
motivations and emotions and the other thing that the message

27
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,800
might be is something about the potential of what's possible

28
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,159
and it becomes really clear that it's not just of the moment but

29
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:13,120
what future we create for ourselves maybe in the next moment the next minute by how we are here

30
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,760
and so this availability to wisdom availability to understanding

31
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,680
um an interest to understand to see

32
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:34,400
while not trying to so available but not figuring it out as if it's going to be

33
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:41,040
arise it's going to be it's going to appear if we have this attentiveness

34
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:50,239
so to sit in a meditation posture

35
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,400
and maybe to think of the alert posture as a

36
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,840
that's alert to

37
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,720
just to be available to sense and to feel if you're going to go into the woods to

38
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,239
listen to the hear a sound of a faint bird

39
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,680
there might be a physical uprightness lifting up of the body

40
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,600
kind of to hear and listen

41
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:32,720
and so this alert posture and then closing the eyes

42
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,160
to also begin a process of settling into the body

43
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,800
maybe settling around the alertness

44
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,720
so the unnecessary tensions and holdings are released

45
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:02,560
taking a few long slow deep breaths and savoring each breath taking your

46
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,759
time really sensing feeling the body

47
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:14,159
expand filled with air stretch as you breathe in

48
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,880
and maybe relaxing into a longer exhale

49
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:29,840
maybe with a sense of ah relaxation

50
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,840
settling

51
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,759
a deep long inhale in a long exhale

52
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:53,560
relaxing the thinking mind quieting the thinking

53
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,960
letting your breathing return to normal

54
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,759
taking a few moments to be attuned to the rhythm of breathing

55
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,080
in your body

56
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,319
breathing is connected to so many different parts of our being

57
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:52,639
it's at the crossroads if you be available

58
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:00,160
for the message of breathing for the deeper experience of what's

59
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,280
happening as you breathe what is revealed

60
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:38,319
and then for the next few exhales relaxing whatever energy agitation

61
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:44,440
there is of in thinking

62
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:53,120
the thinking mind quieter as you exhale

63
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,639
settling more deeply

64
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:12,039
on the exhale as if the thinking mind can rest

65
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:19,240
can let its weariness settle down

66
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:42,159
and if you're present for your mind in some quiet open available way

67
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:49,760
as if there's a message or a deeper understanding deeper insight

68
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:56,160
does anything arise when you quietly make yourself available

69
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,399
to sense and feel the thinking mind

70
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:41,360
and taking one deeper breath and exhaling

71
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:46,560
returning to natural breathing

72
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,560
your normal way of breathing

73
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,519
available to the experience of breathing

74
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,200
and continuing with the rhythm of breathing

75
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,680
maybe within the breathing itself

76
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,839
if you what a message what emotional message

77
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,240
what emotional understanding comes if you're available

78
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:03,160
to see or feel your emotional life as you breathe

79
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,680
is there a unique message or understanding that appears

80
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,519
when you take into account when you feel both your breathing

81
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:48,120
you're connected to your breathing and you feel your mood or emotional state

82
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,639
what what does mindfulness or breathing contribute

83
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,440
to a better understanding

84
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,560
and then continuing now in silence with your breathing

85
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,319
but perhaps with an openness that's available

86
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,959
for a deeper experience

87
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
so

88
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,840
you

89
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,440
so

90
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,278
one way of understanding mindfulness

91
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,840
is that it involves an availability

92
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,080
to experience we're available

93
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:07,158
we don't assert ourselves we don't pull away

94
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:14,799
we don't project our ideas we don't

95
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:21,279
shut down or avoid

96
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,600
but we're available for experience

97
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,480
we get distracted and then we return to that availability

98
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:44,159
and in this way we're not asserting ourselves

99
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,760
not protecting ourselves

100
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:10,080
and as we come to the end of this meditation imagine that in a safe way

101
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:19,440
safe situation you're simply attentive present

102
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:26,559
mindful innocent feeling of it with availability you're

103
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,559
available

104
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:39,760
to be mindful to be attentive to the social situation

105
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,320
not asserting yourself not pulling away just available

106
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:57,880
available to feel and sense know the humanity of someone else

107
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:10,520
available to sense and feel what animates them

108
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:19,720
more fully who they are and how they are

109
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:35,039
and through this availability good will and kindness

110
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:41,600
every very different life then if we assert our goodwill assert

111
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,080
our kindness we're available to our kindness our

112
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,080
goodwill

113
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:03,840
we're available for love to arise

114
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,320
in the space of not knowing

115
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:17,919
the space of possibility

116
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:25,919
in the space of knowing others more fully

117
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,159
and in this way our meditation practice

118
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:41,360
can benefit our wider life

119
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:47,039
and others in our life may it be that this meditation practice

120
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:54,320
we do serves for the welfare and happiness of others

121
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:03,600
may it bring others safety happiness peace

122
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:10,240
and maybe even freedom at least the freedom

123
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:18,360
from our assertive assertiveness our neediness

124
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:23,360
our projections unto them

125
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:33,799
may we be safe for other people may all beings be happy

126
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,830
[Music]

127
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,299
[Music]

128
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,799
so

129
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:14,679
so continuing the discussion about emotions

130
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,600
people have many attitudes towards their emotional

131
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:28,919
life some people are shy of their emotions or

132
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,720
troubled by their emotions some people don't pay much attention to them

133
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,840
certain emotions are considered wrong or inappropriate to have or we have an

134
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,200
aversive relationship to them or were ashamed of having them or

135
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,799
and some were happy to have some were delighted and hold on to there's a wide range

136
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:56,399
of ways to relate to it in the dharma

137
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:03,519
in practicing with emotions it's useful to respect all emotions

138
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:09,039
to all emotions in a sense that all emotions have a place and that

139
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:15,279
buddhism buddhist practice is not meant to negate or squash or

140
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:22,080
push away any emotion but in that more respect and openness to

141
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:29,039
experience the full range of emotions that we have to come to healthy emotions to come to a

142
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:35,360
healthy relationship to emotions and a healthy source for emotions

143
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:41,760
and one way to relate to emotions for this purpose is to

144
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:48,399
see all emotions as maybe all you know provisionally at least all emotions

145
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:54,559
to be a message all emotions are pointing to something

146
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:59,919
and so right we don't want to kill the messenger before we've seen the message we don't

147
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:06,720
even after we see the message but to think of emotions as pointing to something

148
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,800
that's deeper some emotions are

149
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:19,200
arise out of other emotions some emotions come together with other

150
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:26,480
emotions sometimes if the predominant emotion might be grief

151
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:33,118
but there might be mixed in there there might be a sense of guilt

152
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:39,839
there might be some shame there might be anger and it's the in in in part of the whole

153
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,040
complex of how we're feeling at a particular time but maybe we focus mostly on the grief

154
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:51,679
or we feel we might sense the other ones are there but we feel somehow it's wrong to have those

155
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,280
but they're part of the complex and maybe they're needed part of the complex they're they all point to

156
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:02,400
something and if we see them all these emotions as being

157
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:09,040
messages messengers that are pointing to something then we can easier to respect them

158
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:16,160
and take time to get to know them more if we take emotion some emotions like anger as

159
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:21,520
being anger in and of itself

160
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,200
without being connected to something deeper then we can have an aversive relationship to anger we can feel

161
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:34,480
ashamed for having it or upset for about ourselves or something but if we see anger to be a message

162
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,920
and then we ask what is going on here what's it pointing to more deeply

163
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,839
and in the broadest terms um the uh some emotions

164
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:51,119
uh uh arise out of attachment they rise out of something we're holding

165
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:57,680
on to and clinging and um and so the message might be the pointer is

166
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:02,880
is to discover what are we attached to here and

167
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,599
so rather than cutting caught up in the anger by itself

168
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:15,680
and relating only to the anger if we do that then we're missing the deeper message a deeper understanding

169
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,400
but if we look and see the anger represents something it's a manifestation of something that deeper

170
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,800
what might that be so in terms of other emotions it might be that we're hurt

171
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,920
and that the being hurt is the primary um more primary than the anger which is

172
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,320
secondary and so the anger is pointing allowing the anger to point back to the hurt that

173
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,440
might is what might might be what really needs our attention what we want to practice with

174
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:55,440
that's because it's more primary that's somehow the source that's prompting the anger

175
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,040
it might be that anger what underlies anger is fear and so

176
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,240
if we just stay with the anger and blame someone and get angry with someone we

177
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:12,960
won't feel the fear we won't know the recognize that we're afraid as well and recognizing the fear doesn't make us

178
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,960
weak the anger make us strong well recognizing the fear can actually

179
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,400
give us a lot of strength if we learn how to be with fear in a useful productive way

180
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,800
but then we're more connected to what's primary we're coming home to a deeper way and now we know what needs to be taken

181
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:38,400
care of we know better what needs to happen but uh both hurt and fear

182
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,160
may be related something even deeper those are kind of messages too and what's more deeply what's going on

183
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:49,359
that's more deep here and that's where there might be attachments and there might not be

184
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:54,880
attachments if there are attachments clinging then that's what we want to see in this

185
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,800
practice that is really the the heart of moving towards freedom

186
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,000
is to see where we're caught if we're not uh attached and

187
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:12,160
caught then below the the fear and the hurt there might be some something that's

188
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:17,200
really precious something that's tender or loving or or

189
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:22,240
appreciative or grateful about this life what's going on here

190
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:29,680
there might be some deeper place of being at home that maybe makes us feel more vulnerable

191
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,040
and rather than avoiding the vulnerability or the tenderness or the love

192
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,880
the task is the dharma task is to discover how to find strength in that

193
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:49,440
how to find ease with that how to be wise about that so we can stay in touch with that as we go through our lives

194
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:56,320
so whatever the emotion might be it should be respected

195
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:03,359
and what respect means is kind of how i understand the etymology of the word the etymology game

196
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:09,760
is that it's to look again to inspect again to respect to take a

197
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:15,839
second look or a third look and really spend time getting to know this experience what is this

198
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:22,400
and then be available to feel or sense what else is happening here what is it what might it be pointing to what might

199
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,760
it become be coming out of not so much by to analyze what it is

200
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:34,480
but this is why mindfulness is so helpful we're kind of like available to notice

201
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:42,480
what's going on in the cracks of it what's going on underneath it if we open up the attention more widely

202
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,480
and look beyond the the secondary emotion or the thing that's strongest

203
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,480
at what it's pointing to then we might start seeing deeper and deeper

204
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,960
sources and processes that are going on so in this way we're respectful

205
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,720
and um and so what's the message

206
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:11,760
as i've said now a few times even the most you know

207
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,800
even i'll say this differently even the most difficult challenging maybe painful

208
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:24,400
maybe even uh inappropriate or emotions that we might feel

209
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,160
the more strong they are stronger they are the more they represent that there

210
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:36,400
is something important for us to delve into and see what's going on there probably is some strong attachment

211
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,680
some strong clinging to something and and the stronger the reaction the

212
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:48,880
stronger the despair the stronger the grief the stronger the anger the stronger the whatever it might be

213
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:55,200
the more it actually is a messenger it's hard to take this idea in sometimes

214
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,720
when the strength of our reaction strength of our emotions has a lot to do with the terrible things that are being

215
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:06,880
done to us are happening in the world and and uh

216
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,920
i don't want us in any kind of way say that we're responsible for our emotions and because

217
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,760
you know there's terrible things that happen to us but the stronger the reaction we have

218
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:23,200
the more uh the richer opportunity more important opportunity there is

219
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:29,119
uh to see where like the bigger the reaction the deeper

220
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,800
in our psyche and our mind and our hearts is where the attachments might be

221
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,800
and so the stronger the reaction the more it can it it's a doorway into understanding the depth of what's going

222
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:47,200
on i've seen this a lot of times on retreats uh the classic example on a meditation

223
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:52,400
retreat is we try to make these safe places for everyone

224
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:58,880
but occasionally something happens that you know that is not so safe not you know what the

225
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,200
very thing they were trying to protect people from happens i remember once there was a um

226
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:10,560
we were at renting facilities in a kind of a university

227
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:17,280
and there was a fire in a distant building in university and um

228
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:24,160
and uh there were helicopter firefighting helicopters that came flying over really close to us and there

229
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,720
was a lot of noise and maybe some smoke

230
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:37,520
and uh there was a woman at their treat this is many years ago now who has still had

231
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:44,000
a legacy traumatic legacy from growing up uh with the bombings in europe during

232
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,280
world war ii and uh the sounds of the helicopters and the noise and everything seemed so much

233
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,480
like what she was familiar with that had been so troublesome she got

234
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,760
really frightened and um but because she was on a meditation retreat she kept practicing with it

235
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:09,760
and going deeper and deeper and discovering where the knot was where she was still knotted up holding herself

236
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:17,520
in fear and protecting yourself unnecessarily and it behaved it was able to let go

237
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,640
so on retreat it's a very special environment to to kind of really

238
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,960
the stronger the reactivity the more it points to conspiring something really really deep

239
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:36,480
uh sometimes and um and sometimes perceiving the message of uh

240
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:43,119
is um there's respecting emotions is we're respecting our love our

241
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:49,599
kindness our compassion to give it time and when we connect to that and use that

242
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:56,240
as a message to what's more deeply or deeper maybe we connect that to our freedom

243
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:03,119
we feel we see ah this this good will i have this compassion i have

244
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:10,640
it's arising out of freedom and the freedom is maybe the greatest gift we can give

245
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:16,480
to connect to that sense of freedom that we've discovered and to let that be the vehicle

246
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,520
for our care of the world so you might try this

247
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:30,560
to whatever your emotions you have today um if it's safe if it's appropriate maybe

248
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:36,400
to step away a little bit be on your own and reflect more deeply

249
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,520
what is this a message of what is this pointing to if this is a messenger

250
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:47,599
what's uh more intimate deeper more important here what can i discover

251
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,720
and maybe all the emotions are pointing to something deeper than

252
00:44:52,720 --> 00:45:00,680
themselves so thank you and i'll continue tomorrow
