1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,240
okay good morning so we'll go ahead and get started now

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,920
with the meditation just settling

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,119
in to where you are

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,039
perhaps closing the eyes if that's comfortable for you

5
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:34,000
having a sense of taking your place finding the spot where you're going to

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,719
sit or stand or lie down

7
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,160
and feeling into how it is for the body

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:54,680
to be in that posture right now just an overall sense of the body

9
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,840
then bringing attention to the place where you're sitting the place that's supporting you

10
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:19,840
chair or the cushion or maybe the couch or bed

11
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:29,040
and just feeling the balance of the body against that surface

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,680
and letting it support you letting go of it

13
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,159
to be supported

14
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:48,200
by your seat and ultimately by the earth

15
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,159
finding some balance sometimes i rock back and forth a little bit or forward

16
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,239
and back just to find that middle point

17
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,080
or something close close enough

18
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,760
so that it doesn't take so much effort to be upright

19
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,760
and perhaps taking a breath that's a little deeper than usual

20
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:51,400
and then on the exhale letting the body soften

21
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,599
maybe imagining it expanding a little bit

22
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:16,120
softening the face and the eyes

23
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:34,959
even softening the thinking muscle in the brain if you can imagine that

24
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,200
and down through the throat and the shoulders

25
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:57,680
down into the chest area and the torso it can help to imagine the spine as

26
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,159
a support and everything else relaxing around that

27
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,640
softening down through the belly

28
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:29,240
into the legs letting go of any sense of bracing

29
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,479
and on out to include the feet and the hands

30
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,639
if we've been busy up in our head thinking or

31
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,840
reading something on the screen or talking

32
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,639
we may want to imagine bringing the energy down into the body

33
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:23,199
letting the energy of the mind spread out through the body

34
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,840
softly

35
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:58,280
perhaps sensing how there's an aspect of the body that is an extension of the mind

36
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,080
if we have an emotion or a mood or a predominant thought we've been

37
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,280
caught up in there may be some echo of that in the body

38
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,319
and we just noticed that just have mindfulness of that

39
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,919
you don't need to change anything

40
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:20,880
so intending to use the body as the main object of mindfulness for this sitting

41
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,319
and if at any time that becomes uncomfortable or difficult

42
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,880
it's possible to remember the ground where you're sitting feel that connection

43
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,400
or to open the eyes

44
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,280
what if you can staying with the simple energies of the body

45
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:56,840
the various sensations it has coming and going it's a very rich area of

46
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,039
practice just to be with that

47
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:15,599
perhaps using the natural physical sensations of breathing as a gentle rhythm in the background

48
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,520
flowing through the body

49
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,360
so

50
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,920
exploring if the space of the body

51
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:46,560
and the general stillness of the body can begin to

52
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:55,000
calm the mind even just a little bit

53
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,839
even if the body is not a very comfortable place today

54
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:34,320
there's a way in which its steadiness can support the mind

55
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:45,000
often the body is moving a little slower than the mind and that can be useful in meditation

56
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,480
as we continue to settle into the body soften

57
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:41,519
the muscles we may sense a kind of energy in the

58
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,519
body

59
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:54,959
not always but maybe kind of a subtle sense

60
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,240
of vibration or flow

61
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:09,600
warmth sensations a bit below the

62
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:17,839
more surface level sensations of muscles and skin

63
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:31,320
and just including that in the mindfulness

64
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,839
foreign

65
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
uh

66
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,840
and it may be that as we tune into

67
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:37,760
the energy of the body and we sometimes encounter

68
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:44,640
tight spots or knots

69
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:51,919
or areas that feel constricted or like a wall

70
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:57,840
any of those these are normal

71
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,799
and one way to include them in the meditation is

72
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:12,799
to create some space around such a spot

73
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,799
allow the attention to be broader than that

74
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,160
and not get drawn into the tight area

75
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:31,480
and just let it be in that broader attention

76
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,960
that may be enough for it may be possible to gently pass the

77
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,200
breath energy through such a spot

78
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:11,960
but just generally giving it space seeing how that is

79
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,640
yes

80
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,400
so

81
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,360
foreign

82
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,039
as we continue

83
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:10,080
bringing in widening the mind to include

84
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:17,120
the heart so bringing in a sense of care

85
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:21,799
of love for this body

86
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,840
softening this connection between the mind and the

87
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:41,158
body to a sense of compassion

88
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,840
the body holds quite a bit

89
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:06,559
and as the body supports the mind the mind supports the body

90
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:18,279
so touching in with the breath breathing in and out

91
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,840
perhaps smiling a bit in the mind

92
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:38,279
feeling the mutual friendliness between mind and body

93
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,640
if there's been any sense of ease or peace

94
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:13,120
or appreciation emerging through today's sit allowing

95
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:19,600
that to pervade the mind and the body even if it's just a little bit

96
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,650
i'm moving toward a unification [Music]

97
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,640
a wholeness

98
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:35,519
as we gently begin to bring the mind out of meditation

99
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:43,520
you can imagine bringing our whole body and mind

100
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,360
out into our life today

101
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,360
remembering the way that we can bring space around

102
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:02,799
areas that are tight remembering that there are layers below

103
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,320
the surface going on

104
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:13,520
and if this is true for us it's true for others

105
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:22,159
so we can bring our wholeness and our gentleness

106
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:31,000
and our understanding of how it is to be human into our interactions today

107
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,880
perhaps with a sense of just like me

108
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,559
just like me others have these layers

109
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:54,240
and others have a wholeness we're connected in this

110
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,840
mind and body of being human

111
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:11,600
so we turn toward how we can help how we can be supportive

112
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,440
how we can love those around us

113
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:27,880
how we can be at ease in all the ups and downs of the world

114
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,080
may our body carry us through the day

115
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,840
in a way that's useful and helpful

116
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:51,919
offers some degree of peace to this world

117
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,120
in whatever way we can

118
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,200
may all beings be at ease

119
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:55,440
so [Music] this series is called the the depth of the body

120
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:04,399
and we talked yesterday about how the body is a place to feel many of the energies of life

121
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,840
the very process of life is occurring here

122
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,679
many mind states impact the body in various ways and we

123
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:23,120
can get a lot of information through mindfulness of the body very much helps us to be

124
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:29,679
less reactive and to have more wisdom in the moment

125
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,600
but it it can be that as we do more mindfulness of the body practice

126
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:42,720
we will start to encounter sensations in the body that seem to be longer lasting

127
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,760
and that may not be about something that seems to be immediately happening in the

128
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,520
present moment so we can encounter what are called

129
00:30:53,520 --> 00:31:00,399
bodily knots where the energy is frequently restricted in a similar way

130
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:06,960
you know it's [Music] we always have a particular tight spot you know we sit down to meditate and

131
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,799
after five or ten minutes we feel a sense of hardness in the shoulder for example

132
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:19,519
these things are very normal i want to first of all normalize them

133
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:26,240
and so in this case we have the body informing the mind you know we have something going on

134
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,960
in the body um that's quite normal this isn't very many people encounter this

135
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:39,600
and in the sutures there is a teaching about four kinds of bodily knots

136
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:47,840
and it's an interesting list not so frequently taught so i thought we could have a look at that today

137
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:54,159
at least as a start so here's vikibody's translation of this

138
00:31:54,159 --> 00:32:02,720
suta there are these four knots what for the bodily knot of covetousness

139
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,399
the bodily knot of ill will the bodily knot of distorted grasp of

140
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:15,279
rules and vows and the bodily knot of adherence to dogmatic assertion of truth

141
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:20,399
don't worry we're going to unpack those into clearer language

142
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:25,679
and then it goes on to say that the eightfold path what we practice in this

143
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:31,600
tradition is the way to understand and develop [Music]

144
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:38,880
the mind to overcome these particular knots so let's let's talk about these

145
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,880
i think the first two are fairly easy to understand so the first nod of is

146
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:52,080
covetousness or envious desire so my dictionary said it means inordinate

147
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,600
desire often for the possessions of others and the suta is saying that covetousness

148
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,640
creates a bodily knot so if we're fixated on wanting something

149
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,679
that we don't have it can create a tight spot in our body

150
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:13,919
in the language i'm using here that would be in the energetics of our body so this you know this might make some

151
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:23,039
intuitive sense as if we're grasping for something there would be a an impact in the body and we can also experience this

152
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:30,000
um and then the the second knot is kind of the converse of that so the bodily knot

153
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,399
of ill will so if we feel aversion towards something or someone and

154
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:41,760
energetically we may be pushing it away or resisting it in some way and so then

155
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,640
again there's some contraction when we do that constriction and this is also you know maybe quite

156
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:56,080
sensible and so i encourage you to explore this you're in your own experience if you're feeling

157
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,679
aversive or uncomfortable or have some

158
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:08,800
ill will toward a person is there an impact in the body you know in the sense of some tightness and if we

159
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,480
carry that for a long time it may turn into one of these knots it's

160
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:22,398
a little bit longer lasting if you will so then the third one is said to be the

161
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:28,878
distorted grasp of rules and vows which gill would translate as practices and

162
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:35,440
precepts so this is um actually not an unusual idea in buddhist teachings the buddha

163
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:42,158
knew very well that people can get hung up on conceptual understandings of

164
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,358
ethics or of rules such that they become inflexible and that's the problem is

165
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:52,960
when they become inflexible we can have uh rigid thinking around

166
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:58,079
various spiritual practices that we do and even sometimes about the precepts

167
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:05,119
and if we have this kind of rigid thinking that's that's what can bind us up internally

168
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:11,760
a friend of mine was on the three-year retreat that is sometimes done in tibetan practice

169
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,440
and they one of the things they do on this type of retreat as they learn

170
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:24,400
various rituals and then you know go through the process of learning them and he got fixated on one of them and he

171
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,440
really wanted to perfect it some kind of an offering ceremony and he

172
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:36,480
started correcting everybody else about what they were doing wrong and he practiced again and again with kind of

173
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:44,000
furrowed brow to get it just right and the other retreatments were getting irritated by this behavior

174
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,240
and so but he didn't realize he had gotten so fixated on it and the the spell was broken when one of the other

175
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,680
yogi's threw a vase at him luckily it missed but the the point was

176
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:02,720
made and he realized that he was really kind of grasping onto that so if we're holding on to

177
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,760
fixed ideas about our practice or even about the precepts we can create a

178
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,599
knot around that holding it's interesting and then um

179
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:22,160
so then we come to the fourth one and then i'll talk a little more generally so that is getting stuck on a view of

180
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:27,359
what is true so the teachings say that a person with this kind of knot

181
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,800
will assert only this is true everything else is false

182
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:39,520
and so it's easy to go to extreme examples of that places where people have really gotten stuck on just

183
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:45,119
one idea of what's true but you know we hold all kinds of things like

184
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,160
there is only one right way to load the dishwasher

185
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,280
all other ways are wrong or any other such thing around the house

186
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:01,680
have you ever gotten into a conflict with someone about these things so i don't know if the thing about the

187
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,520
dishwasher would bring about a bodily knot but it might be that our our political or

188
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:12,800
philosophical views could do that if we're clinging to them quite tightly

189
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,839
so it's interesting isn't it that attachment to a view can show up as

190
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:23,359
tightness in the body and i encourage you to explore this if this makes sense

191
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:30,640
so in some ways we can't hide uh rigidity of the mind it will appear in the body maybe it wouldn't be visible to

192
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:36,880
others but we will we will come to feel it so

193
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:42,160
i think this this list of four bodily knots has the potential to evoke

194
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:49,280
compassion uh we all have these knots to varying degrees because we're not free of these

195
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:55,520
things and we've created them by thinking that such movements of mind are going to

196
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,560
bring us safety in some way maybe it feels like grasping after

197
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,839
things or pushing them away or having fixed views about things

198
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:11,280
will provide some kind of certainty or security for us which is what we you

199
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:18,960
know some part of the heart really just wants wants it to be certain safe secure

200
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:24,000
but if we do that in the wrong way it can lead to a constriction so it was

201
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,240
sort of a good idea but it was held in the wrong way and a lot of practice is

202
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:38,400
about untangling some of that that we've done with our mind so i don't think we need to analyze

203
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,320
every knot that we have in great detail i think maybe the top level point of

204
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,680
this teaching is to show us what we're up against in a certain way

205
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:57,040
these are deep habits of the mind and they get stored deeply in our energetic system

206
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:03,760
but by touching into them gently we can start to unravel these knots not

207
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:11,520
so much by analyzing them and figuring out why is this there and what caused that and what in my past led to this i

208
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:17,280
don't i don't know that that is so useful sometimes sometimes but not every time

209
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:23,359
um meditation practice offers us the possibility of unraveling these a little bit in a

210
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:28,480
deeper way than language might get to um

211
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:35,359
so of course there's you know some care is needed in doing this we would want to approach

212
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:41,520
these knots um somewhat gently and that was why i suggested staying

213
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:48,240
connected to the ground or opening the eyes definitely

214
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,599
we don't want to use covetousness and ill will in our approach to working with

215
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:59,040
bodily tension no covetousness being i'm gonna get in there and

216
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:05,119
really make it um go away you know kind of wanting to get it to be a certain way

217
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:11,359
and ill will is i'm gonna push it away or make it you know destroy it in some

218
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:16,720
way these are movements of mind that are not supportive or you know probably only

219
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,400
make the knots tighter so we have to learn how to hold them with space

220
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,599
how to touch into them not um for a long time maybe just

221
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:34,079
touching briefly and then go back to the breath or do some other practice

222
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:41,440
but slowly over time i hope to impart the idea that we can unravel these knots because they

223
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,640
of course represent issues in the mind the very issues that meditation addresses

224
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:53,839
and for some people it's useful to work in the realm of the body so if this is useful i i offer that

225
00:40:53,839 --> 00:41:00,160
but we we might also make one additional point which is that the suta is not saying that

226
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,280
every knot we have has to correspond to one of these four difficulties it's very

227
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:12,079
important that we don't just start trying to map like that these are four possibilities and of

228
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:18,720
course there are other possibilities one time joseph goldstein was practicing

229
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,079
with upandita and he reported that his meditation was

230
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:29,359
generally going well with lots of smooth pleasant energy flow in the body

231
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:35,520
except that he was experiencing a block in his neck so you know like the word not that i've

232
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:41,599
been talking about today and upon data looked at him and said block

233
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:48,480
that is a judgment you are experiencing tightness so we also have to remember that the

234
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:55,280
word not might be a bit of a prejudgment in some cases so um we can feel tightness for a

235
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,640
variety of sources it's worth looking at these four because the buddha identified

236
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:07,359
them as the most common ones so covetousness ill-will wanting and pushing away

237
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:12,880
and then also two ways of attaching to certain kinds of views or ideas one of

238
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,640
them being ideas of how to do practice and what is you know

239
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:26,240
practices and precepts as it's called and the other being views of what's true or what's right or what's correct

240
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,440
those are areas where we get stuck but you know it might be that we have um

241
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:38,720
something physical going on or it might be that what we need to work with that particular tight area is not

242
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,760
to judge it as something that's bad or needs to be gotten rid of in any way and

243
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:50,640
just hold it as tightness just be mindful of that very neutrally so there are a number of so many different ways

244
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:58,240
to work with these but if we use it you know wisely this understanding of tension in the body we

245
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:03,599
can really expand and broaden our practice

246
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:10,720
so i wanted to bring this in as a kind of a method or an understanding that is at least for me

247
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,160
has been very very fruitful to try to find ways to work with tight

248
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,760
spots in the energy system so if it's of use to you also i hope

249
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,359
you'll explore and have some confidence that with care and with compassion

250
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:34,160
there are ways to slowly over time loosen these knots just a little bit

251
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:41,760
and even if some of them just become a little bit loosened then the body starts to open up and

252
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:47,040
kind of in the space that opens there can be room for more well-being

253
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,400
even a very deep sense of well-being so tomorrow we will

254
00:43:52,400 --> 00:44:00,319
continue our exploration of the depth of the body by by using the body as a support

255
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:06,240
for concentration practice or for gathering the mind into this deep sense of

256
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:12,640
well-being so one more dimension of the body that we can explore

257
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:18,000
so i wish you very well for the day or the evening and

258
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,839
please take care of your body be well
