00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,559
hello everyone and welcome to this morning meditation

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,639
and one of the possibilities that can come from

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:22,080
meditation is being refreshed and one of the great refreshments is

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,480
becoming simple is simplicity of being

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:36,320
and one of the values of developing samadei

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,399
with the inconstant changing nature of experience is how it's endlessly

7
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:48,160
refreshing it simplifies so much in the mind just

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,680
be and as we stay with the changing nature of the present moment experience

9
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,719
resting in it trusting it relaxing with it

10
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,960
uh we start seeing how it's the thinking mind

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:16,320
that uh uh more often than not

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,479
keeps us in the old groove keep us keeps us in the old familiar thought patterns

13
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:27,759
that sometimes can be debilitating undermining us

14
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:34,400
and uh and to step out of the normal stream of

15
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:43,600
thoughts and thinking into this different stream of direct experience direct sensations

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:52,079
and develop the samadei of change samadei of inconstancy samadei of of uh

17
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:59,200
the changing nature of the present moment is Uh

18
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:06,719
one way to be refreshed one way to appreciate a simplicity of being

19
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:13,360
simplicity of mind simplicity of thinking no longer needing to interpret

20
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,720
no longer needing to judge and evaluate no need no longer a need to remember or

21
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,239
plan or fantasize

22
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,920
that for the duration of the meditation allowing oneself a simplicity of being

23
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,640
with direct experience and that samadei of change

24
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:46,760
is one of the one of the places to experience that is with the changing sensations of breathing

25
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,640
so to assume a meditation posture

26
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,640
and

27
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,040
the meditation posture I find it helpful sometimes to

28
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,319
view it feel it as kind of a temple

29
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,879
and I'm entering a sacred sanctum sacred

30
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,480
space a sacred grove of trees someplace that's

31
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,040
special by assuming this posture

32
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:36,000
and to gently close the eyes and to feel

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,920
whatever is familiar about being in your meditation posture

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,440
maybe making small adjustments in the posture to be a little more comfortable

35
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,959
and then to

36
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,159
take a few fuller breaths where the inb breath inb breath is a time to feel more

37
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:24,359
fully your torso and the exhale a time to relax settle

38
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,960
and letting your breathing return to normal

39
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,240
but still stay close to the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

40
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,638
and as you breathe in feel the muscles of your face

41
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,280
and as you breathe out soften in the face

42
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:33,080
as if your muscles of the face can fall away from the skull

43
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,479
as if the rhythm of breathing in breathing out is a bit of massage for

44
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:51,080
the face through feeling and relaxing

45
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:09,758
breathing in and feeling the shoulders exhaling and softening the shoulders

46
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,680
where the gentle rhythm of breathing

47
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:32,599
is there to help you connect to your shoulders relax your shoulders

48
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:48,199
and then doing the same with your belly

49
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:56,840
and if the belly moves as you breathe feel the belly as you inhale

50
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:03,639
releasing the belly as you exhale

51
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,720
staying close to that rhythm alternation of breathing in and

52
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,039
breathing out

53
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,280
and on the inhale become aware of whatever sensations

54
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,199
are associated with your thinking mind

55
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:55,960
maybe energy activation a little contraction or pressure

56
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,440
maybe you think from from a particular location

57
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,039
where there's some subtle sensations of a gathering

58
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:20,280
coalescing of as you exhale

59
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,360
to relax the thinking mind

60
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:06,920
and then to relax into the body breathing

61
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:15,279
wherever you feel your breathing in the body wherever it's easiest for your body

62
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:23,959
itself to experience the sensations the rhythm of breathing

63
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,240
relax into that place

64
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,279
and maybe at the beginning of the inhale the end of the exhale

65
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,560
there's the gathering place for attention

66
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,560
awareness

67
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,959
as you breathe in and breathe out

68
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,760
orient your mind

69
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:27,040
towards breathing almost like from the back of the mind

70
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,680
back of the skull

71
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:40,839
you establish a direct line like the light of a lighthouse

72
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:54,720
that touches down on the physical experience of the body

73
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,720
breathing

74
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:29,240
as you inhale receive the sensations of inhaling

75
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:54,760
as you exhale allow the sensations of exhale

76
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,040
to come and float away

77
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,440
like gentle waves washing up on the sand beach

78
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:50,000
and receding this constant movement and change of

79
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,959
breathing in the body

80
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:04,760
and you might notice how thinking can pull you away from that

81
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,800
into old habits of thinking

82
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:18,200
into the repetition of familiar themes and ideas and feelings

83
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,399
for now return to breathing

84
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,079
reorient yourself to the radical simplicity

85
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,320
of the rhythm of sensations coming and going as you

86
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,320
breathe

87
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:18,279
like the sand that continuously feels

88
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,680
the movement of the waves coming and going

89
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:37,519
in shallow water by the beach your body continuously feeling sensing

90
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:44,440
the changing nature in the mind

91
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,320
becoming simple quiet

92
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,560
as it enters the samadei of breathing

93
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:36,519
relaxing the mind letting go of the complexity of thinking

94
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:45,240
in favor of the simplicity of the body breathing

95
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:54,080
letting that be a vacation a sacred Sabbath

96
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,320
from all the thinking that you normally do

97
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,799
simplicity of breathing

98
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,158
with a little bit of simplicity

99
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:03,600
maybe there can be a little bit of samadei of simplicity samadei of simple

100
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,600
breathing

101
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,080
a gathering a settling together

102
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:21,559
with breathing at the center of all things

103
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:30,720
a center which is shifts and changes and oscillates moves

104
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,760
gently in the body

105
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,760
and awareness receives it

106
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:54,320
awareness doesn't go out to find or search

107
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:00,519
but settles back and receives the experience of breathing

108
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,320
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

109
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:21,760
with your eyes still closed imagine gazing upon the world with a

110
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,480
receptive gaze

111
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:36,000
where the world experience of the world comes to you

112
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,880
you don't have to search

113
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,159
you don't have to do the looking but allowing

114
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,840
the world to come into sight

115
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:03,559
and imagine that you can do that with the people of your lives

116
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:13,880
and as they come into view as they appear in the mind and your memory

117
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:22,480
to appreciate the simplicity of seeing

118
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:29,398
that wants nothing searches for nothing

119
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:37,639
a seeing which is receptive and fresh

120
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,720
and in that receptivity that freshness

121
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,200
to wish simplicity of being

122
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:06,600
freshness joy safety and peace

123
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:14,760
to others as you experience for yourself

124
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:26,880
may it be that how we learn to be in meditation the simplicity the peace

125
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:34,440
the non assertiveness the care

126
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:43,799
helps us to go out into the world to care for the world itself

127
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:53,360
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

128
00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:03,159
may all beings be peaceful may all beings be free

129
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:16,670
[Music]

130
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,880
thank you

131
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,080
so hello and welcome to this

132
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,840
continued series on insight and today I want to emphasize that

133
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,880
insight I think of insight in this insight

134
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:44,559
meditation as being more like revelation than it is as searching

135
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:56,159
as it is straining to see and understand something it's a understanding it's a seeing that

136
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:03,039
reveals itself to us that we're not searching for something

137
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:08,080
we're allowing something to show itself to us

138
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:14,559
but we're preparing ourselves for to be good re recipients of this what gets

139
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:22,720
shown to us and so practicing samadei quieting the mind getting focused and

140
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:29,840
still cultivating a simplicity of being with our experience so that the mind is

141
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:35,600
not jumping around so much but the mind settles down the mind gets steady and

142
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,120
quiet and so and then the insights of inside

143
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:48,080
meditation uh again is not a searching it can arise

144
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:54,960
out of the real radical simplicity and all the insight that you need in a deep

145
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:02,640
way comes from can come from resting experience with the breathing

146
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:11,679
and the one of the primary insights that we're looking for or waiting for or allowing for insight meditation is that

147
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,360
of inconstancy change impermanence

148
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:23,360
how things are constantly arising and disappearing appearing and disappearing

149
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:30,480
and um and that and that insight that revealing

150
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:37,360
of change uh can happen completely with the breathing all that you need to see and

151
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,440
change and impermanence and constancy can be experienced uh first and foremost

152
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:51,440
in the changing experience of breathing and the advantage of this is the breathing is relatively simple the

153
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,480
advantage of this is the breathing is the mo sitting in meditation is um is

154
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:07,279
the largest movement the biggest kind of generally the biggest changing sensations that we experience and so we

155
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:12,878
don't have to go searching for it it's there for us to experience generally

156
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:20,878
sometimes breathing is counterindicated when people get uh maybe uh too anxious

157
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:26,398
around the breath or it's too awakens difficult emotions

158
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:34,800
or sometimes the breathing gets very very subtle but generally uh uh medit in insight

159
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,800
meditation the way I was taught was having the central focus be on breathing

160
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:49,040
and I found that really beneficial icial to help with the simplicity of the practice that uh I wasn't looking around

161
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:58,000
for things to have insight about i wasn't looking to have insight um the we

162
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,760
talk about the insight into impermanence change and constancy um but the idea is

163
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:10,480
not to go looking for that so much but to relax and open to receive it uh to

164
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:17,040
let it find you rather than you find it and it will find you if the thinking

165
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:24,720
mind is not predominating if if we're not seeing the world through our thoughts if we're not uh the only

166
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:29,920
part of the world we're seeing is thinking we're inhabiting inhabiting our

167
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,119
thoughts living in our thoughts consumed with our thoughts making up worlds with

168
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:42,160
our thoughts if that whole movement can be quiet for a while and we step out of the stream of

169
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,760
thoughts the constant stream of thinking all the time and and step out of that

170
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,960
stream and into this other stream the river of change within us and today I'm

171
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,359
emphasizing the breathing to help with that simplicity of being and to get uh

172
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:07,040
gather ourselves orient ourselves not just around the the breathing but but uh

173
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:12,320
allowing ourselves to take in all the sensation sensations of breathing that

174
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:19,359
come and go it might simply be recognizing the coming and going of inb breath and out breath it might be seeing

175
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:24,560
the individual sensations that uh occur even within an inb breath or within and

176
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,680
out breath and in doing that uh one of the

177
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:37,280
advantages is we can see how much uh we disconnect from that and we return to

178
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:43,839
the old habit of thinking and thinking is a leading cause of all

179
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:49,119
kinds of psychological challenges depression can be come from a lot of

180
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:56,240
rumination thinking about oneself a lot is said to be one of the leading causes for

181
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,520
um all kinds of psychological challenges because if we're thinking about

182
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:08,000
ourselves all the time we're repeating usually often challenging thoughts debilitating thoughts undermining

183
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,359
thoughts and um or an attitude that is not so healthy often with ex excessive

184
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:21,920
self-p preoccupation and so to get refreshed willingly to be refreshed or to

185
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:27,280
trustingly that it's okay to put that aside it's okay not to be thinking so

186
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:34,880
much about oneself thinking so much about reality thinking so much about our desires not only is it okay but over

187
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,720
time we begin appreciating that it's really refreshing it's really healthy

188
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:47,040
it's really beneficial to keep coming back to the direct

189
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:54,400
experience in the body and you know with breathing and to and the rhythm and it

190
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:01,040
it's easier for the mind to get focused to get centered

191
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:06,720
uh if there's actually a subtle movement in the focus of attention it's almost

192
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,839
restful for the eyes restful for the mind to follow a simple ordinary

193
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:17,040
movement that comes and goes that arises and passes or that flows peacefully

194
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:22,320
through us and so um the as I many times

195
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:28,560
say that it's like sitting in the riverbank and watching a river go by or sitting at the beach and watching the

196
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,760
waves come up on the shore and down and um

197
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:43,040
and I can do that for long periods of time it's something very refreshing and nice and renewing to watch uh the very

198
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,800
simple rhythm of something coming and going and so to ride that to surf on the

199
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:55,520
movements of the breathing to uh receive it to let it wash over you uh and let

200
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:02,240
enter into the samadei of breathing and um as an alternative

201
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,920
to the kind of unhealthy samadei of thinking where we get absorbed in the

202
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,760
world of thinking and for some of us the level of concentration we need to be

203
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:20,560
with the breathing is comparable or maybe the same uh as the absorption the

204
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:27,200
concentration we have for our thoughts there's a phenomenal kind of zeroing in

205
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:33,599
focus on thinking which many people have at some some point in their life and um

206
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,920
and we're learning what to do here is to kind of turn that around

207
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:46,079
so rather than a straining somebody straining focus on thinking

208
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:53,200
there can be now a wholehearted relaxed focus on the breathing

209
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,480
and in having insight around the changing nature of breathing

210
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:05,280
um to not be looking to have insight but uh

211
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,400
cultivating a receptivity cultivating a simplicity cultivating ing just an

212
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,839
allowing of experience to be seen uh carefully

213
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:26,800
and um and um until really the magic of of um

214
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,880
insight reveals itself to you that uh you can certainly sometimes see in

215
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,920
constancy and change but to the magic of it is when it it

216
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:45,359
really begins to um being absorbed with it or settled on it or it begins to be

217
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:53,119
compelling and you're right there with it in a delightful way and some of the

218
00:40:53,119 --> 00:41:00,640
some of the qualities of samadei some of the johnic factors of joy and happiness

219
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:07,520
can arise with this receptive open entering into the world of change and

220
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:12,520
changing nature of uh the breathing

221
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:20,800
so uh the same thing can happen in daily life where we discover the the delight

222
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,960
the joy the benefit the refreshment of stepping out of our thoughts in daily

223
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:33,359
life and being here for the simplicity of our experience here and now the

224
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:38,880
richness of it it might be more boring than reading a great novel or watching a

225
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,560
great movie but there's the art of meditation is to teach us what that it's

226
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:51,280
wondrous to be alive to be present to be conscious and to be here connected in

227
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,960
the in a threedimensional way or multi-dimensional way with our present

228
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,560
moment reality rather than in the two dimensions or one dimensions of mental

229
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:11,520
preoccupation so um insight as a form of revelation

230
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:18,880
so thank you and um may the world of change moment by moment

231
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,799
be refreshing for you
