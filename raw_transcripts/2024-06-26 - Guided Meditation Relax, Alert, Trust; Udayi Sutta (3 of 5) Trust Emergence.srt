1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,600
so good morning everyone or good

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,600
day I think there is an invaluable

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,640
tendency or maybe not tendency but an invaluable

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,040
approach of offering meditation instruction which is radically

5
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,800
simple but sometimes the simpler and more profound it is the more difficult

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,039
it is to enact so one of them so at the beginning

7
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:49,280
of many meditations I offer something which maybe seems kind of

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:57,680
preliminary and that is I I mentioned to uh let your body be uh posture which is

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,040
expresses both being relaxed and alert an alert

10
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,320
posture in which you can relax and

11
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,240
um and any any meditation posture at all can find some balance of those

12
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:21,479
two if you're uh sitting in a chair or

13
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,960
couch using the back rest it might be helpful to sit up a little

14
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:34,159
straighter maybe not be quite as leaning back as you would kind of on your own do

15
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,360
but still using the support but uh sitting up more so the chest opens up a

16
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,640
little bit if you're lying down maybe there's a way of also adjusting the

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:53,119
spine the shoulder blades um maybe if there's a pillow so that maybe um the uh

18
00:01:53,119 --> 00:02:00,360
some part of you the chest is more alert the some people will have their arms the

19
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,799
upper arms flat on the bed next to them or the floor next to them but their

20
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:11,680
forearms pointing to the ceiling one or both and uh and that brings a kind of in

21
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:19,120
intentionality and alertness and engagement that uh can also help this

22
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:26,120
alertness but this uh instruction to have a balance between being alert and

23
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:31,760
relaxed is also appropriate for the mind and for what we do in

24
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,680
fact it's enough that could be this can be the only instruction that meditation is

25
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,599
to stay alert and

26
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:51,440
relaxed and when we do that uh or say just add one more step

27
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,560
alert and relaxed and let nature take its

28
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:04,480
course and uh what alert and relax does is makes an

29
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,680
awareness that kind of clarity that allows whatever is there to be known

30
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,799
without us interfering with it just letting it be there let it be received

31
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:21,840
let it be known let it kind of arise and be there without a a relationship to it

32
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,400
not without a relationship being for and against it without a relationship of

33
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:34,000
defining ourselves by it without uh telling stories about it and predictions

34
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:42,080
of what this means very very simple just make space to be aware and why this is so profound

35
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:50,080
is that that is not what the Mind often does alert and relaxed is to be free of

36
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,599
attachments free of reactivity and so the reactive mind

37
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:04,680
begins to quiet down but the deeper natural mind the natural

38
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:13,000
functioning of our body and mind has a better opportunity to show itself to arise to be there some of that is the

39
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,560
are our body and mind's uh Power for healing spiritual healing psychological

40
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,520
healing that sometimes works uh at times is one of the best sources of healing we

41
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:33,080
can we can tap into at other times it's it's allowing deep spiritual or deep

42
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:42,199
humanistic um uh goodness wholesomeness to arise and flow that we have a wholesome natural

43
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:52,280
source within that's often covered over or diminished by the unnatural or or

44
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:57,320
synthetic or uh UNH wholesome kind of movements of

45
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:05,600
the mind that require our reactivity so a profound

46
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,479
trust in the natural functioning of our body and mind if we

47
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:20,080
get out of the way of all reactivity and even even being free of relate relating

48
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,840
to things instead to just be

49
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:31,639
alert and a and relaxed

50
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,600
to be aware awake and at

51
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,479
ease that's it so to establish

52
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:53,800
a posture that expresses some simple balance between being

53
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,080
alert and relaxed

54
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,120
letting the eyes be relaxed resting in their

55
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:15,319
sockets the eyes pointing in a direction where their eyes are

56
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:21,680
relaxed often it's gazing down 45Â° or

57
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:30,240
so and if it's nice gently closing the eyes

58
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:43,639
and to some degree you are aware there's a degree of

59
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:49,198
alertness that operates without any effort on your

60
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:57,319
part for a few moments here notice on the edges of your

61
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:04,000
attention or ways in which you are

62
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,759
aware without even it intending

63
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:21,440
to how certain Sensations sounds feelings

64
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,879
experiences that were not intended that you weren't directing yourself to know

65
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,599
come into the field of

66
00:07:51,319 --> 00:08:01,440
attention and part of you where beyond the edges of your tension

67
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:08,280
pressure agitation there there exists within you probably

68
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:16,159
also some degree of being at ease being

69
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:27,720
relaxed maybe the joints of your small finger are relaxed

70
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,919
and so to sit

71
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:56,680
here breathing remembering the relax

72
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:01,160
part as you exhale

73
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:11,240
remembering the alert part as you

74
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,560
inhale all along

75
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,399
trusting that you need to do nothing else

76
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:37,600
then be alert awake relaxed at

77
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,600
ease in whatever way is easy for

78
00:09:51,079 --> 00:10:00,160

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:28,480
seconds for a minute let go of all mistrust

114
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,960
so that sitting here there is no active

a a full

117
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:56,240
trusting of the natural processes of our life here and

118
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,520
now of the Mind of the heart of the

119
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,559
body and being aware is getting out of the

120
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:14,559
way and trusting just being

121
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,840
here and aware

122
00:27:46,519 --> 00:27:52,440
there is a principle in Psychology that when a group of people

123
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:58,720
are together when one person

124
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:06,679
as calm awareness of the situation the group the whole group

125
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:09,679
moves towards

126
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:19,760
Health may it be that we are the calm

127
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,399
person not just calm but alert awake

128
00:28:25,399 --> 00:28:31,000
aware attentive to what what's happening happening with

129
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,880
others that our capacity to be mindful and

130
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:45,720
nonassertive is a clear comes with this clear strength of

131
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,960
presence of

132
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,039
attention of making space and allowing others to be

133
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,960
themselves so some other process can

134
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:11,240
unfold that is not based on our reactivity our sense of

135
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,080
urgency may it be that our practice that we

136
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:28,640
do supports the world that we live in to be less reactive

137
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,398
less hostile less

138
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,279
afraid less conceited and

139
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:48,080
greedy may we support the forces of goodness in this world the natural

140
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,760
forces of goodness may all beings be

141
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,240
happy may all beings be safe

142
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:07,799
may all beings be peaceful may all beings be

[Music]

144
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,720
free thank

145
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
you for

146
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:28,039
so welcome to this third talk on the upay suta those of you are interested in it's

147
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:37,480
in the numerical discourses the fifth chapter uh suo in bod's Translation suo

148
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:44,159
159 and uh what I read here is an excerpt from it then I'll read it

149
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,679
again so the Buddha said talking to his main attendant monk

150
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:57,960
Ananda it is not easy Ananda to teach the dhama to others

151
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,679
the dhma should be taught to others with five qualities when five qualities are

152
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:12,639
established with oneself which five the dhma should be taught to others

153
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:18,799
while thinking I will speak step by step

154
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:27,000
progressively that DBA should be taught to others while thinking I will speak for practical

155
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,360
reasons that dhama should be taught to others

156
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:38,799
thinking I will speak grounded in kindness the dhama should be taught to

157
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:45,639
others thinking I will not speak for material rewards the dhama should be taught to

158
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:50,799
others I will speak without wounding myself or

159
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:56,440
others and now one of the ways of understanding this text or trans

160
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:03,320
interpreting it is is it not just about how we teach uh teaching the dhama but

161
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:10,760
uh how we speak to others that we do we speak in a clear sense of progression

162
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:17,840
and building a building our our explanations or reasons we speak for

163
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:23,440
reasons we understand the causes and the conditions and the reasons for why we

164
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:30,080
say what we're going to say we speak with is it uh we speak with with kindness one of the great questions

165
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:39,480
is is when I'm about to say kind and um and uh we can speak not for

166
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:45,559
material reward not for to acquire things and get

167
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:52,480
things and uh and uh without wounding myself or others my harming Myself by

168
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,279
what I'm saying am I harming going to harm someone else so

169
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:05,320
uh for these five talks I'm not going in the same order because I want to connect them to the five core teachings from

170
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:11,599
last week so for today I'd like to uh connect last week's two I will not speak

171
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:17,720
for material reward and um and uh I'd like to suggest

172
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:24,158
that instead of speaking for material reward uh we can speak for Dharma

173
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:30,760
rewards and uh the Dharma is that which is without without conceit without greed

174
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:38,919
without hatred without hostility the Dharma is that which is free of self-

175
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:46,398
preoccupation acquisitioning but for Dharma rewards is to the rewards that come from deep

176
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:52,320
within that uh that part of ourselves is a it's a natural

177
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,359
functioning that we we best create the conditions for it to flow

178
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:05,040
freely than to engineer it it belongs to the mind of attachment

179
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,960
to reactivity that we're trying to control and fix and get things in some

180
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,079
kind of self-centered way and um and to not be involved in

181
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:27,839
this U material gain uh pursuit of wealth of Fame of status of um of praise

182
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:34,920
there's all this stuff that's kind of more surface stuff that belongs to the world of of

183
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,800
attachment of um clinging of

184
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,000
reactivity and uh and so to pay attention so for a Dharma teacher do not

185
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,359
teach the Dharma uh based on any of those things so it takes a lot of self-awareness for to teaching the

186
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:58,440
Dharma to make sure that they're just teaching freely coming from the Dharma place

187
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:05,359
not from the greed place not from the um conceited place not from the attachment

188
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:13,640
to self or the praise or status place and um and so um and so one of the

189
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:21,359
primary interpretations of this uh uh line uh I will not speak for material

190
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:29,000
reward is to not speak for uh for for monetary gain and it's interpreted to

191
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,960
mean that when they teach dhama should be taught freely without any expectation for anything in

192
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:40,400
return material things or monetary things just uh teach him because that's

193
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:48,119
what is inspired one is inspired to do and um and so

194
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:54,720
uh um this is a you know ancient principle from the time of the Buddha and one that

195
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:02,280
some people hold to very closely the monastic community often hold to this very closely and uh and here IMC we hold

196
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:08,079
to this that uh the people who teach here to teach freely um without

197
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:15,560
expectation of uh receiving anything in return and um I think it's a

198
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:22,280
beautiful uh way of teaching the Dharma it's a beautiful way of being in the world and so for those teachers here who

199
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:31,680
teach this way um it brings me a great joy to see them uh with this kind of General generosity and and um and uh

200
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:38,800
care and love and kindness that they which they teach so uh but for ourselves you know

201
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,119
outside of teaching um uh not to speak

202
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:52,319
for uh for material reward or physical reward or um now it's not nothing wrong

203
00:37:52,319 --> 00:38:00,720
with acquiring uh enough uh monetary wealth to live

204
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:06,800
safely there's nothing wrong with having physical goods and things in order to

205
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,359
live well but uh uh we have to be very

206
00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:20,520
careful that our interactions with others with our friends and our that we're not kind of subtly um or not so

207
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:26,160
subtly working the system trying to get something trying to have something have

208
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:32,560
an exchange if I give you uh apple pie then certainly next week you'll give me

209
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,839
uh a chocolate cake and uh kind of expectations for something in return

210
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:43,599
material in return however if I make you an apple pie and I just love making

211
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:50,880
apple pies and making and giving it to to others to share and um and my reward

212
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,280
is the Del light The Joy my my reward is the inner sense of happiness and

213
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,480
contentment and and maybe that the shared Joy the shared contentment that

214
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:07,720
uh we have with others and um and that nourishes something inside of me that

215
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:13,000
greed and expecting something in return does not nourish in fact it does the

216
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,760
opposite there's this deep feeling of natural goodness or Natural Health in

217
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,680
the heart and the spirit that um gets a little bit or very much squashed and

218
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,240
lost if um we get involved in um the the

219
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:36,920
whole Market of exchange and expectation and wanting something in back there's

220
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:43,960
nothing inherently wrong with exchange and wanting things back just that if we if we're caught in

221
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:49,000
it uh we're limiting uh something much more profound

222
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,119
that can happen so it's not judging something as being wrong so much as

223
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:01,200
being sure not to limit what's real the best for us and one of the important

224
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:07,640
roles that something like meditation has spiritual practice has is to connect us

225
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:14,119
to this deep natural goodness that's within deep natural wholesomeness that

226
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:21,200
is that kind of arise and be there that um

227
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:28,560
that the Buddha talks about the wholesome qualities that can grow and become abundant that they can suffuse us

228
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,079
and spread throughout us that this is possible the day and

229
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:43,599
night uh allowing wholesome qualities to grow and um as opposed to day and night

230
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:49,960
uh living in a world of that diminishes us or stresses us or brings tension in

231
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:59,480
us the world of anxiety and urgency and and um demands and expect ations and and

232
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:06,440
uh judgments and wanting things to be just right in control uh this is a world of stress

233
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,760
that's so easy to fall into and so spiritual practice can help us to relax

234
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:17,480
that to get out of the way to open up the space of the heart space of the Mind

235
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:23,599
awareness to allow things to settle that need to settle that can settle and allow

236
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,680
things to um emerge which can emerge

237
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:34,119
and um and so Dharma life is a life of

238
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:40,400
emergence not of reaction it's a life of the emergence

239
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:50,720
of something not the life of emergency and um so uh so for me what

240
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,599
I'm doing here today is tying this quality that of speaking not speaking

241
00:41:56,599 --> 00:42:03,280
for material reward to the naturalistic orientation that I talked about last

242
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:10,359
week um that uh that I have a deep trust in this naturalistic processes of human

243
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:17,280
life that the Dharma is tapping into in fact sometimes the word Dharma is maybe

244
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:26,640
the one of the closest poly words to our English word nature and uh and so to uh trust the

245
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:35,359
Dharma is to trust our nature trust the naturalistic um uh functionings

246
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:43,960
activities of our inner life so um May

247
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:51,640
you know goodness or wholesomeness may you know good

248
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:57,640
qualities within that can emerge and be allowed to

249
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:04,720
spread and grow within you and and that you learn

250
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:13,200
to be careful and attentive and and uh alert to the ways in which reactivity

251
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:22,240
tensions uh sense of of urgency sense of anxiety covers over these good qualities

252
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,079
diminishes them and um because we have the

253
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,079
capacity to live an abundant sense of

254
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:42,680
wholesomeness and ideally we're not sacrificing that

255
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:50,559
capacity for anything at all let our goodness let our

256
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:56,760
wholesomeness be the source of our gift being a gift for this world of ours may

257
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:04,280
we all support and help this world with the

258
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:13,680
gifts we have not through the anxieties we carry so thank you very much
