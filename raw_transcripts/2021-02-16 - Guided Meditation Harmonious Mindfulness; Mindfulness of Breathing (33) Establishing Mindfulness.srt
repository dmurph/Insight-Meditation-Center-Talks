1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:08,880
so good day warm greetings to the meditation session we'll do now

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:17,840
and i'm quite actually quite happy to be sitting here and sharing this time with you

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:25,519
and as an introduction to this sitting one of the really key parts of

4
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,880
mindfulness of breathing is not the breath but rather is

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,920
the mindfulness that we bring to it i like to think of mindfulness of

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,079
breathing as being the meeting place of the body breathing and the

7
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:51,039
awareness that experience it that knows it and so the mindfulness the awareness how

8
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,680
we bring our attention to the breathing is a essential component part of this

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,199
practice and sometimes it's a good idea to spend a little bit of time

10
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,920
studying investigating just the nature of the how we are mindful

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,960
how we are aware and one interesting place is when the

12
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,280
mind wanders often thought and when we notice that how are we with

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,720
that are we critical are we upset discouraged or might it be possible to be

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:37,439
rather matter of fact about it without any real emotional reaction at all just oh

15
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,560
mind is wandered off that's what's happening and then to

16
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,960
begin again with the breathing where the beginning again the returning to the breath is a

17
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,399
pleasant event that

18
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,520
rather than jerking the mind back hurrying back getting back to scourge in a discouraged

19
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,280
way there's something about returning welcoming back the breath

20
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:16,640
or starting again with the breath or if you bring you bring your back your mind back to the breath

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:24,560
that that movement is is harmonious it's gentle it's useful has a feeling of calm

22
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:30,800
maybe even a feeling of pleasure so that maybe in a way you begin looking

23
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,480
forward to the opportunity to start over again to begin again

24
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:44,800
here and then how we are with the breathing

25
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,280
and i think of it as having both having a light touch

26
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,720
but also a touch that's committed apparently the latin roots for the word

27
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:04,239
commit comes from the same root as the word mitten it has to do with touching

28
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,120
touching with something but to touch it so being committed but being light

29
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,560
the light touch but a light touch that's continuous right there stay there

30
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,680
stay there the uh

31
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,640
sometimes the analogy has been used of picking up a bird that's been stunned

32
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,920
maybe come in the house and you have to take it outside and you want to hold it in such a way

33
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:41,680
that no way do you hurt it but you also hold it clearly you hold it

34
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,879
kind of not a firm is the right word but you really keep it in your two palms of your

35
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,879
hand so you stay connected to it and then once you're outside you let it go

36
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,560
so this commitment to the bird that's tender and soft commitment to the breath where we're

37
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,000
seeing if we can stay there continuously but with a light touch

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,599
so the mind begins to be light and soft and calm as well

39
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,840
and of course the mind will wander away and then to experiment with finding a

40
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,959
way to begin again that's enjoyable that is

41
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:27,440
harmonious with the process of meditation and when the mind you notice the mind is

42
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,680
wander off notice that in a way that's harmonious with the meditation so it's all about

43
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,280
the how how are relating to what we are knowing and now that's

44
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:47,280
really one of the key aspects of this practice so with that taking uh

45
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,600
assuming your meditation posture

46
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:01,520
and before we begin with the further

47
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:10,320
perhaps you can take a few moments with your mind to see if you can

48
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:17,680
find a way of knowing being aware mindful that has some

49
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:26,320
feeling of ease to it not in a hurry but also not held back

50
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:34,160
and then with that mindfulness take a few long slow deep breaths

51
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,720
maybe three quarters full so you don't get winded or strained

52
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,919
and an exhale that in a relaxed way

53
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,840
is longer than usual

54
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:06,319
breathing in in a gentle long exhale

55
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,800
without going so long it's a strain

56
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:21,840
breathing in and exhaling

57
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:38,080
and then letting the breath return to normal

58
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:50,880
and take a few moments on the inhale to feel

59
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,880
the muscles of your shoulders

60
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:03,840
and on the exhale to relax the shoulders

61
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,479
on the inhale to feel down your arms and your elbows

62
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:27,919
hands and on the exhale to relax the arms hands

63
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
soften

64
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:56,840
as you breathe in feeling any tensions or holding in the

65
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
chest

66
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:13,840
in the exhale to relax the chest

67
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:27,680
breathing in and feeling your belly

68
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:41,599
on the exhale relaxing the belly

69
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:50,480
breathing in and feeling your legs knees and feet

70
00:08:51,920 --> 00:09:09,839
and exhaling softening relaxing

71
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:17,920
on the inhale feeling the muscles of your face

72
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,839
and on the exhale relaxing

73
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:56,640
and on the inhale maybe feeling the energy or the pressure tension

74
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:05,839
associated with thinking and on the exhale relax

75
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:18,800
the thinking mind

76
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,959
and then as if you have all the time in the world

77
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,320
but without delaying

78
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:38,240
center your attention on the body breathing

79
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:49,680
wherever the breathing is most clear for you pronounced or most enjoyable

80
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,199
the belly the chest or the nostrils

81
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,720
or some people prefer to experience the whole breath body

82
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:15,839
the global experience of breathing

83
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,680
and as a little experiment

84
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:43,839
let go of the focus on breathing maybe think about something

85
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:52,880
and then see if you can come back to being with your breathing in a way that feels where the how you do

86
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,079
it is pleasant or relaxed or

87
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:11,839
harmonious with a peaceful meditation

88
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:21,839
and then as you're with your breathing how are you with it how are you relating

89
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,800
to this to your awareness

90
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:39,839
are you straining are you uncommitted

91
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:48,160
can you be committed to your breathing in a soft way

92
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:57,200
but committed where awareness of breathing is

93
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,800
welcoming receptive

94
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,120
maybe as if you and your breathing are walking

95
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,480
together hand in hand friends walking in a park

96
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:26,000
holding each other's hands lightly gently lovingly so awareness

97
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:35,839
is together with your breathing

98
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,360
and if your mind wanders off

99
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,120
tend carefully with how you begin again

100
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:03,040
with your breathing how you return to be accompanying your

101
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,320
breath hand in hand

102
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:31,839
receptive to breathing in and breathing out

103
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:31,600
when you find yourself lost in thought experiment with beginning again with

104
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:37,679
breathing so that beginning again

105
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,960
is enjoyable or a pleasant thing to do

106
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:54,400
what would it take to land back on your breathing

107
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,240
to receive the breathing again

108
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:09,840
so that you enjoy doing it

109
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
so

110
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:56,480
as we continue meditating can you allow the experience of

111
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,240
breathing to come in more fully

112
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,840
to awareness

113
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,240
as we let go of thinking there could be more room to experience

114
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,838
the fullness of a single breath

115
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:30,000
as inhale fills the body with air

116
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,839
so it fills awareness

117
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,319
mindfulness of breathing is the meeting place

118
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:25,838
of the body breathing and the knowing of it

119
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,560
and how that meeting happens

120
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:38,240
is central to this practice

121
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:44,400
to have the meeting be clear definitive

122
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:53,839
as complete as possible and peaceful calm

123
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:07,839
light soft

124
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:18,000
allowing things to become quiet quiet in the mind quiet in the body

125
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:35,839
in a tender contact between awareness and the body breathing

126
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,759
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

127
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:03,040
to carefully allow whatever calm or subtleness you

128
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:08,880
might have or allow whatever

129
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:15,280
challenge you might have and how that is touches you or touches

130
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,760
your heart

131
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:28,880
and open up that sensitivity to the world around you

132
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,838
bring into your awareness the people of your life

133
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:49,838
your neighbors people in your town or province

134
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,480
people you know and don't know

135
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:04,318
imagine that they're all held

136
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,039
in your expansive tenderness openness

137
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:24,319
and how we are in relation to other people is at the heart of

138
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:32,000
refuge in sangha how we are

139
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:43,440
and without any obligation without any one even knowing

140
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:55,520
can you find within you the well-wishing for others

141
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,960
the idea that it would be wonderful if others were happy and peaceful

142
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:07,039
and that you wish it for them

143
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:16,640
and is if you're a lighthouse shining the light of

144
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:24,400
well-wishing across the earth sit here for a few moments

145
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:33,839
spreading the light of your good will into the world

146
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:42,800
a good will that may be is can be expressed in these words

147
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,839
may all beings be happy

148
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,760
may all beings

149
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,160
be safe

150
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,880
may all beings

151
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:21,520
be peaceful may all beings be

152
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:35,920
free and may it be that in even the smallest

153
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:43,838
ways or in big ways we contribute to that possibility

154
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,929
[Music]

155
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:49,760
so for those of you who came to the

156
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,200
meditation just now thank you for those of you who came at

157
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:01,040
the 15 minutes earlier and had this longer sitting and thank you for those of you who might have joined

158
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:07,119
at the regular time or anytime it's always what you're welcome to come and

159
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:13,520
what's wonderful about this electronic medium for meditation

160
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:18,720
together is that it's uh everyone enters the meditation room and

161
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:24,480
in a sense quietly so

162
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:35,040
so some of you will find i see that the idea that the 15 minutes extra meditation is a lot

163
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:40,880
longer and certainly if you're used to one

164
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:48,319
length of time it takes a while to kind of get used to the the longer period

165
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:55,280
and once after a while it becomes normal the longer period it can seem to go quite quickly and and

166
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:04,319
anything shorter it feels like we're not quite you know finished maybe so it's well worth

167
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:11,680
doing the stretch so hopefully this week is is um nice for you and if it's not nice

168
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:18,318
i hope that it's educational you learn something about yourself that you wouldn't have learned otherwise

169
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:31,359
so you know in the overall series on this

170
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:36,960
mindfulness of breathing we're halfway through the 16 steps

171
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,880
but we're kind of taking this week to a kind of review or just kind of begin

172
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:48,240
over again in a certain way and beginning and over again is not

173
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:55,520
really starting over completely but meditation it's often useful to

174
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:01,200
think we're always beginning over that often you know our lives are ups

175
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:07,760
and downs we've been active in our life and we sit down to meditate and we don't sell them we just drop into

176
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:15,680
you know the depths of where we were before but rather it's always kind of a beginning over

177
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:23,119
and now learning how to be a beginner learning how to engage in it in a in a way that is harmonious with

178
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:28,800
meditation or supports the enjoyable settling in

179
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:35,200
is part of this art and not to be in a hurry not to be striving but to be diligent

180
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:42,240
and to be you know wholehearted and showing up in a way that ah this is really good to be here

181
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:48,800
and in the instructions the buddha gives the preparation for

182
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:56,880
the first step is the is the instruction to establish mindfulness

183
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:04,400
and this idea of establishing awareness i i like the expression awareness

184
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:11,200
establishing attention here i've asked a number of people how they

185
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:17,920
understand this idea of establishing awareness and many people respond that it for them

186
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:24,960
it means to allow for it to enable it awareness or attention is a kind of a

187
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:33,119
capacity that in all our conscious moments is operating and to establish it is to open up more

188
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:39,280
fully to what's already here and and maybe to center oneself in that

189
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,720
awareness to be rooted in here

190
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:50,640
some scholars have said that the pali word for establish could also mean to stand next to or

191
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:56,720
stand close to um it's to uh to really accompany something

192
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:02,480
and now this idea of having awareness uh established like it's like it's really

193
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:08,960
rooted here in the present moment and to do that a fair amount of what we

194
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:14,240
have to do is to let go we have to let go of the ways that thinking

195
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:20,240
preoccupier so much that we don't even know we're aware we get pulled into its drama as its

196
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:25,839
stories its concerns and there's something about letting go

197
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:31,040
enough of the storylines the thoughts the ideas the preoccupations

198
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:37,280
so that we're clearly cognizant that i'm here in the present moment

199
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:44,160
and something as simple as i'm here in this body i'm here in this place

200
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:51,680
begins to establish and um and so the question is uh

201
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:58,640
you know more fully for you what does it mean for you to establish yourself here in awareness

202
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:05,680
and attention and how do you do that establishment that that you're finding a place that's

203
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:10,720
wholesome finding a place that's a healthy or helpful or even

204
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:17,520
healing a way of being really being here in the midst of what's going on it might be that there's a lot

205
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:24,000
of emotional turmoil or difficulty in physical pain there might be challenges that go on

206
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:29,680
there might be challenges around you in the environment but if it's appropriate to be meditating

207
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:35,920
what does it mean to establish yourself peacefully or another way of saying

208
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:43,680
which i like quite a bit for myself is the idea of becoming sitting and practicing without

209
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:50,559
being in conflict with anything and what does it mean to sit here

210
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:56,559
without conflict and so then you know we're kind of looking around and seeing where is their

211
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:02,079
conflict where am i caught up in responsibilities or desires or

212
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:07,119
resentments and what are these and not to necessarily to make them go

213
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:15,119
away or to let go of them if it's not easy to do so but what is it like to be sitting in the middle of it

214
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:23,119
established and so this image of sitting in the middle

215
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:28,559
and just being present for the experience i think i've said this recently my son

216
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:34,720
when he was um he went into kindergarten and he was kind of young for the kind of in the

217
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:40,160
younger end of i forget exactly what he was but i think he was still four or something

218
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:47,200
and four and a half maybe and um and he went to kindergarten and and

219
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:53,760
the first month or two he would find a small little kids chair and place it right in the middle where

220
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,880
all the kids were playing in the classroom and he would just sit there and watch

221
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:06,640
everything that was going on and it was only after a couple of months they left his chair and started interacting and playing with the kids

222
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:13,359
and no one ever felt that he was troubled or upset or afraid he was just that's what he did he just

223
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:20,000
sat right there confidently in the middle and just took it all in and this whole new environment

224
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:26,400
and so he established himself in the room of you know probably chaos kids kindergarten kids

225
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:34,079
playing and running around and so to establish oneself

226
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:40,799
to root oneself here to i know some teachers who have

227
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:47,359
emphasized that simply having your two feet rooted you know firmly on the ground

228
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:53,520
or in the cushion meditating your butt firmly on the seat that's you know that's really where the

229
00:55:53,520 --> 00:56:00,480
heart of it is really here established here i had one one teacher who

230
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:06,400
gave this wonderful teaching and he said that a successful period of meditation

231
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:14,319
sometimes he said sometimes because it could be so wild and so maybe agitating or

232
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:21,920
what's going on within as we meditate that a definition of a successful period of meditation

233
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:27,440
is that we did not leave our seat and he said sometimes like the rodeo but you

234
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:33,760
stay in your seat stay on the saddle and and the reason he called it a success is

235
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:39,040
that we don't give in to it we don't give up because of it

236
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:44,079
and sometimes just simply hanging in there and staying it doesn't look like it's a wonderful

237
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:50,079
meditative experience but it takes a uh we're cultivating a lot of strength a lot of stability

238
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:57,520
and the ability to to keep our seat to hold our ground here i'm staying here

239
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:03,920
and and so what's the nature of how we establish

240
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:09,599
awareness what's the nature of the way that we practice awareness practice attention

241
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:15,760
and this took me a long time to understand for myself because i had a lot of agendas sometimes

242
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:20,880
when i was practicing like sometimes i had the agenda to get concentrated and i was pushing and

243
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:27,040
straining and trying my best and judging myself and and comparing myself to the when i was

244
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:35,119
meditating in the room with other people kind of part of me was comparing myself with others those you know and trying to catch up or

245
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:42,319
be as concentrated as them or be as mindful as them or so or as still as them or something and all

246
00:57:42,319 --> 00:57:49,440
this swirl of comparative mind swirl of needing to accomplish something needing to prove myself

247
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:55,040
and then there was a the attitudes of not liking what i saw in myself and being upset with this and that

248
00:57:55,040 --> 00:58:00,319
that happened and the mindfulness then had a sting to it that it wasn't just being mindful of

249
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:06,079
something but there was little barbs like i was like poking at myself or criticizing myself

250
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:14,000
kind of together with being mindful and slowly to learn to simplify and

251
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:20,319
simplify and simplify the awareness all this extra stuff that we bring along

252
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:26,799
so much so that some people can would say that the whole process of meditation like the whole process of the 16 steps

253
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:34,559
of anapanasati is a process of simplifying awareness so it becomes comes into its pristine

254
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:40,799
purity or its pristine simplicity just aware

255
00:58:40,799 --> 00:58:47,760
to see clearly without the seeing having any filters without the seeing

256
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:53,839
having any obstructions to it and just to see just to see

257
00:58:53,839 --> 00:59:00,799
and to trust that that's enough is supported with the idea that the actions how we take care of

258
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:06,000
things that will come later first we're learning this ability to

259
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:12,799
see in this clear simple way and that allows us to see better what

260
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:20,160
can be done and what should be said or can be said there's more wisdom that way

261
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:26,319
so finally this is a quest for simple awareness tranquil awareness that

262
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:34,079
is committed and established and just stays here with the experience um maybe it's inspiring for you to

263
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:40,880
remember the little saying that if you want wisdom the wisdom of how to live in this world

264
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:46,079
become tranquil have your awareness established

265
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:54,400
in its simplicity and learn how to be content with that that's enough that in them for now it's

266
00:59:54,400 --> 01:00:03,920
just enough to sit here and be present later can come the action the response

267
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:12,000
so establishing awareness so thank you very much and

268
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:24,000
let's all of us continue with our awareness practice thank you
