1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
thank you everybody good to be here with you all

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:15,360
yeah just a feeling the enthusiasm and happiness in practicing together in this

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,640
mornings and and these days and so

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,480
um I received a request that I didn't say anything about myself introduced myself

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,780
yesterday and some people don't know me at all so maybe I just say a few words

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:40,760
um today about myself and so I'm in Chan I'm a long time

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,440
IMC IRC practitioner a few decades here

8
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,260
in the community and also have been practicing primarily

9
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:59,039
with the guild Franco for the last close to two two decades

10
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:06,299
um I've been very fortunate to be able to practice English community and

11
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:12,140
receiving the teachings and so in this last a few years having

12
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:19,260
under the training to be able to teach Dharma in the community and so I'm in

13
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:25,380
the current IRC IMC teacher training cohort

14
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:33,420
um and having very fortunate to be able to share Dharma share the practice with

15
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,780
everyone and so today we'll continue

16
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,220
and so in our meditation yesterday

17
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,100
um the focus was relaxation or relaxing

18
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:58,860
today we'll be expanding to add another word that starts with letter r

19
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:07,619
and that is recognition and so when our body mind and heart are

20
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:16,980
at ease and relaxed it is conducive for Clear recognition

21
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,739
to come forth and so today we'll um

22
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:32,280
kind of progress around this relaxed field and to begin to see things clearly

23
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:40,340
and so with that as the intro will begin our meditation together

24
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:50,099
so take a few moments to allow yourself to settle into a meditative posture

25
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:55,340
whether it's a sitting standing lying down

26
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,540
give yourself a few moments to arrive

27
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,920
Here and Now

28
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:24,140
ing clearly that you're arriving

29
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:30,980
at this moment in this space

30
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,599
with this experience

31
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,879
maybe start by having a global sense of the body sitting

32
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,700
lying down standing

33
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:09,200
allow the sense of a presence to come for us

34
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:27,180
we'll begin by inviting relaxation and ease

35
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,699
in the body mind and heart

36
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,680
will do a gentle scan of the body

37
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:49,280
from the bottom of the feet all the way up to the top of the head

38
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,560
relaxing your feet

39
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:10,100
maybe toes bottom of the feet top of the feet

40
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,440
relaxing legs

41
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,479
in the fleshy part of the legs the muscles

42
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:47,880
relaxing the knees thighs

43
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,500
it's a very gentle invitation

44
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:03,080
not an imposed expectation or a demands

45
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:23,240
soft soft invitation relax

46
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:35,160
allow the pelvic area to settle down naturally

47
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,340
giving to the wonders of gravity

48
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:50,780
nothing we have to do just resting down

49
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,840
relaxing the belly

50
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:17,960
softening and easing up any holding heightening

51
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,759
that it can't be softened

52
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,639
you know for me there is a sense of just gentle opening of the belly

53
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,319
as I breathe in

54
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:57,620
the relaxed settling as I breathe out

55
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:18,620
using up at the lower back ever so slightly

56
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,840
not a big project

57
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,399
softening and opening up the chest

58
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,159
ever so slightly so the shoulders can draw

59
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:56,959
relaxing the muscles and the upper back

60
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:10,579
let's flip out sense of your whole torso right now

61
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:38,600
letting shoulders arms and hands naturally drop

62
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:00,079
softening relaxing the neck

63
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:09,000
relaxing the face muscles and the face

64
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,560
jaw inside of the mouth

65
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:26,060
relaxing the forehead skull

66
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:45,260
what's the global sense of your body right here and right now

67
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:06,260
maybe a sense of a little more grounding now

68
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,019
relaxing the heart and the mind

69
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:24,199
however you may be associated with them

70
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:10,260
as the body mind and heart Settles

71
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,560
being a little more relaxed

72
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:21,920
and they began to recognize

73
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,300
different experiences

74
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:35,899
maybe you're recognizing a little bit of a calm

75
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,579
or maybe a lot

76
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:57,200
or maybe it's easy to recognize the thinking mind

77
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:15,019
so recognition naturally happens

78
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:21,860
when the body mind and heart are at ease

79
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,360
and clear seeing naturally happens

80
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,440
in a relaxed field

81
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,620
let me recognize the sound

82
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:12,019
and my boys the ambience the sound

83
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:45,000
and they recognize certain emotions

84
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,899
in the heart

85
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:17,240
allow this recognition

86
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:28,279
to be carried through in a useful and relaxed away

87
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:50,120
in simple recognition

88
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,779
a very light touch

89
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:39,360
it's a relaxation and direct connection

90
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:46,340
can happen anytime in the course of the meditation

91
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,820
maybe you'll recognize certain tension

92
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:04,100
extra tension like Joe was built up

93
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:15,440
invite relaxation and ease

94
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,520
social relaxing and recognizing

95
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,020
and support each other

96
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:59,700
a relaxed attention and hold our experiences like a holding

97
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:03,799
the premature baby

98
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:09,020
from yesterday's story

99
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:29,240
nothing to do is kind gentle contact

100
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,700
with the movements of the breath

101
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:44,179
tingling Sensations and the feet

102
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,299
and

103
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:11,340
it's inflating movements in the mind emotions

104
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,520
thoughts

105
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,440
holding them like a holding a baby

106
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:41,539
and when they leave allow them

107
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:48,980
allow them to leave on their own terms

108
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:12,059
as I rang the bell to end to the sitting if you like

109
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:21,740
you can stay in the meditative mode to receive the dharmette

110
00:29:31,040 --> 00:30:11,440
[Music]

111
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:58,500
so a transition to the short dharmette

112
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:03,919
so today I'll continue the theme of

113
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:09,779
multifaceted nature of our normal practice

114
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:18,840
and I read one story yesterday um from this book a monastery with Ing

115
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:24,779
and this is the book that I've been reading from and

116
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:31,620
um we spoke about how an engineer who um

117
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:37,860
this practice kind of ran into a wall and this wall was a

118
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:46,080
kind of a how he was practicing with all of this conceptual Frameworks that were stuck in

119
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,720
his head and what happened was when

120
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,419
um the app is offered a new instruction

121
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:05,340
which is a holding the baby in premature maternity award

122
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:13,380
and through this gentle contact with the baby something opened up after

123
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:20,340
and this transition and so today I'll read uh yet another

124
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:27,480
story in this book [Music] um and there's a story touched a yet

125
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:33,539
another dimension of our practice and that probably all of us would have

126
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:41,100
to face at some point of our practice Journey so you know without spoiling you even

127
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:46,580
further I'm gonna read to this story for you

128
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:55,140
the story is called finding the right teacher

129
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:02,580
many people arrived at the monastery hoping to be admitted to the monastic

130
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:07,919
order some were sent away since what they were

131
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:14,299
searching for was not to be found in the monastery

132
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:21,019
once there was a 30 year old man who arrived at the monastery feeling

133
00:33:21,019 --> 00:33:29,100
exhausted discouraged and hopeless he had decided he was no longer capable

134
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:35,580
living in the worldly life perhaps he hoped the monastery would

135
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,919
provide him with a pass that would bring him freedom

136
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:48,059
it was the birth of his second child that had pushed the man over the edge

137
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:54,240
he could no longer manage to live with the frustration and the demands on his

138
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:02,340
time that her family life had become he was also worn down by his older

139
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:08,760
child's constant of pushing the limit of acceptable behavior

140
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:15,378
decide to comment makes how many of us would relate to that right

141
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:26,480
when he came to the monastery he asked that he be put under the care of the abbess

142
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:33,240
or another great teacher who could help him find peace

143
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:38,940
he felt encouraged when he was told that this could be arranged

144
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:47,398
however first he would have to prepare himself and approve himself to be worthy by

145
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:55,500
sitting alone in meditation for seven days in a small waiting room next to the main

146
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,560
to the main entrance of the monastery

147
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:07,980
the man cry to the first two days during the third day

148
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:14,339
he was washed with alternating waves of nausea and the fear

149
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:19,560
the fourth was a spander reviewing his life

150
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:24,720
for the fifth and the sixth days he seems to be questioned

151
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,599
every belief he had by the seventh day

152
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:37,800
he was beginning to feel calmer and certainly more rested than when he had

153
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:44,400
arrived the days earlier add to the end of the seventh day

154
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:51,660
he eagerly waited to be admitted into the monastery and to find out who would

155
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:57,420
be his teacher when the seventh day was over

156
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:05,339
Abbas and herself came for the man she congratulated him on completing the

157
00:36:05,339 --> 00:36:12,720
solitary retreat come said the abbess and I will introduce you to your new

158
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:19,859
teachers it took a while but we have found the ideal people who

159
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:27,500
can help you find both your spiritual strength and the freedom

160
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:35,160
the abyss then led the man out to the front gate of the monastery

161
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:41,820
waiting for him there were his wife and the two children

162
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:48,359
happily to see them the man raised out to embrace them

163
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:54,839
then the abyss declared your wife and the two children are your

164
00:36:54,839 --> 00:37:04,320
ideal ideal teachers in your case nowhere else but in your own family will

165
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:10,920
you find the freedom you're looking for with that

166
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,799
app is close to the monastery gate

167
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:25,800
hmm okay so how many of you can relate to

168
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:31,800
the story and I can certainly relate it to the story myself

169
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:38,339
I'm having a child who knows just exactly which button to push and what

170
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:45,000
time and I can say for certain and that

171
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,960
um at times he is my best teacher

172
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:57,599
and practicing with the family is humbling challenging

173
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,160
and enriching

174
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:10,200
and I like this um specific words that the appest said

175
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:16,380
um that is said to the man that is

176
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:22,140
and that's where um you will find your spiritual strength

177
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:25,700
and the freedom

178
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,280
that's where you can find a strength and the freedom

179
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:42,300
and so for myself I can say for sure and that this years of a practicing with

180
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:47,400
a family child um

181
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:54,900
both my son and myself are growing and maturing in various ways

182
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:00,599
and so this is story um pointed out to some aspects of the

183
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:05,820
practice that all of us may have to consider at some

184
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:13,859
point prominent aspect that I like to share

185
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:19,680
um you know baby based on my own interpretation of this story there may

186
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,020
be many different interpretations of the story but that this is just the one

187
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:31,619
aspect of it which is that the Dharma practice is not

188
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:37,820
to escape from the challenges that we face

189
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:46,500
but rather were cultivating skillful ways to meet our challenges

190
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:54,480
and so this 30 year old man went to the monastery and had this a sense of trying

191
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:01,280
to escape out of the challenges that he was facing

192
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:08,579
and so somehow stay in the monastery would be the solution for him

193
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:16,859
into the overwhelming demands from the family kind of overpowered

194
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:25,619
audacity and yet and this is seven days solitary

195
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:31,740
retreat maybe in some ways um

196
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:37,800
opened up a little bit something inside of him

197
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:44,339
maybe you know this is a my own interpretation maybe I had a little

198
00:40:44,339 --> 00:40:52,500
sense that um and that the solution is not found out

199
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:58,880
there but rather into something within

200
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:08,099
and the app is certainly recognized as for him and the practice has to unfold for this

201
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:14,000
particular man unfold in his family life

202
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:19,920
but of course you know you can see this is a Story the app is instruction seems

203
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:27,300
to um abbas's instruction and the seven day solitary Retreat it seems to somehow did

204
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:34,320
a little magic here but it is a story it is a tale in real

205
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:40,700
life there may be many many ways that

206
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:47,579
can support us to skillfully navigate meeting with the challenging situations

207
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:54,420
in life and for each of us and we may over time

208
00:41:54,420 --> 00:42:01,140
find ways to engage meet with the

209
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:07,140
difficulties and challenges and what I want to offer a few words and

210
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:13,560
just some pointers of you know how we might meet with the challenges just like

211
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:21,599
this person who went on to the monastery to look for a teacher and sometimes when

212
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:30,000
we are overwhelmed by our own challenges finding a teacher finding a trustworthy

213
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:38,040
friends or a therapist and to talk about the challenges can be helpful and that

214
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:45,660
can offer a certain kind of a resource for us and other times maybe we know something

215
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:53,160
for ourselves how not to be caught by the overwhelm

216
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:59,280
and for myself staying close to mindfulness of the body

217
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,859
practice has been game changing in so many ways

218
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:12,300
in meeting all kinds of the challenges by staying with the felt sense in the

219
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:20,579
body it allowed me to see through many kind of mentally constructed

220
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:25,920
stories and surprisingly many of this

221
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:32,940
stories can both feel like enormous challenges that we can't get through

222
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:39,599
but when we're really staying with the body we began to see

223
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:46,520
that this are mental constructs that are not so solid

224
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:54,560
and there may be other ways that we can meet what the challenge is

225
00:43:54,560 --> 00:44:00,180
for example turning to something that might provide a resource that supports

226
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:05,819
us like a loving kindness practice compassion practice

227
00:44:05,819 --> 00:44:11,040
or maybe we do simple things that may be

228
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:16,579
supportive and helpful like going to explore nature

229
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:21,660
becoming more physically engaged in certain activities

230
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:28,560
like a garden name or going out for a run or cook a meal for

231
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,960
the family I'm naming this um

232
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:39,540
because there are many many skillful names that may be possible available

233
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:46,680
in different situations and at different times under the art of the practice is to

234
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:51,839
learn what might be suitable for our own situation

235
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:59,900
and so curiosity patience openness and courage to kind of explore

236
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:06,540
at different aspects and go a long way and no matter what practices we choose

237
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,900
to do

238
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:18,359
and so I think that may be enough to be said for today

239
00:45:18,359 --> 00:45:23,460
um maybe one last point I wanted to say is

240
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:31,319
also that it's helpful to recognize what might not be supportive in situations in

241
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:39,599
challenging situations like a resorting to unwholesome Indulgence might not be helpful

242
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,760
and kind of binge watching news may not be very helpful

243
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:51,359
or resorting to various toxic kind of addictions may not be helpful

244
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:58,640
and these are the things that over time will begin to be able to discern

245
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:04,619
and so my invitation today I is

246
00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:11,060
to invite us to include the challenges in our lives

247
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:18,300
include practicing with the challenges when we are able to do this for

248
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:24,060
ourselves this will be beneficial both for

249
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:33,480
ourselves and for all beings all around and so may this practice with challenges

250
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:39,000
be a beneficial resource for all beings everywhere

251
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,980
thank you everyone for your attention and I'll see you tomorrow
