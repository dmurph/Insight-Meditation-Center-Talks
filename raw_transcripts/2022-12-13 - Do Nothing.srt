1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:08,639
so good evening everyone and welcome nice to be with you all nice to sit here

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:15,660
and uh I've been sitting here you know

3
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:22,199
during this pandemic um sitting here teaching alone

4
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,480
with the camera a lot of the time

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,260
and but to have 45 minutes to sit with others in silence something we used to do all the time and I think I took it

6
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:41,160
for granted but I haven't had that much experience of it over the last period

7
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,219
so it was nice to sit with you this way thank you

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,000
and um I debated whether just to take the evening as a time for questions and

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,520
responses but um maybe we can still mostly do that

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,939
but partly out of that sitting and a little bit I've been thinking about this or being with this topic for the day I

11
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:14,119
want to share with you and um there is a lot of value

12
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:19,340
if all you do in meditation is nothing

13
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,619
if you sit up straight or some appropriate medical you know their way

14
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:31,140
of being with your posture kind of present here

15
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:37,340
and then notice all the ways you try to do something

16
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:43,740
some of it is you notice that you know if you've been kind of running around all day you might feel that your body is

17
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:51,600
still kind of running wants to run around and you feel kind of the urge to vote or to move or to shift or

18
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,380
um and then the eyes don't want to sit still the eyes are doing something they're still darting around maybe

19
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:04,740
and then slowly just by doing nothing um things settle and quiet down

20
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:11,760
or you might notice that you're thinking a lot and the thinking is soft into doing a lot of thinking is motivated by

21
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,200
some form of wanting wanting something or not wanting something and there's a kind of activity of doing

22
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,640
wanting reaching trying to understand remembering planning

23
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:30,660
figuring things out telling stories to yourself it is a kind of a doing

24
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,319
and if the rest of you doesn't do much if you sit quietly with your eyes closed

25
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:43,379
sooner or later you start noticing all this doing in the mind and you might also notice that the kind

26
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:48,900
of the mind at some point doesn't want to do it anymore it's like you know it's a lot this is a

27
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:56,459
tiring or you know isn't there some other way of being maybe it's just you know enough of that already somehow the Mind itself will sometimes

28
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:02,459
begin to settle partly because if there's a lot of thinking there's tension in the mind or

29
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:07,860
pressure and so you feel the tension and pressure after a while and that's the that's kind

30
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:13,080
of represents some of this doing momentum of the Mind and just sit quietly it kind of settles

31
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:20,099
down and quiets things quieter and quieter and a lot of it comes from not doing

32
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:26,280
and I say it because some people bring the habit of doing and fixing and making

33
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:34,140
something happen and trying to attain something trying to get concentrated with them into the meditation practice

34
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:41,280
and it's not uh wrong to do that in fact sometimes it's helpful and nice to have that sort of intention or direction that

35
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,280
you're practicing but a lot happens just by not doing

36
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,159
keeping it really really really simple and for sometimes as you know as a teacher I

37
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:59,120
some people who are you know really doing is their specialty

38
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll tell them to in meditation that the only thing they should do in meditation

39
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,099
is to avoid doing anything just that's it like I I given I

40
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:18,900
shouldn't give them any practice like folk follow your breath that's just too much doing for them just just be really attentive to every

41
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:25,080
movement of the Mind the heart the body to try to do something make something happen fix something

42
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:31,199
and just don't do it so they just don't do it a school of meditation

43
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:38,160
and what's remarkable about this it is not a passivity if you're sitting you

44
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,580
can fall asleep if you're laying down or too slouched in the couch or something but it's not passivity

45
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:50,400
it's the releasing of a healthy kind of energy inside of us there's a different

46
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,639
kind of flow of attention of sensations of aliveness of presence that's

47
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,060
available in the body that it's very different feeling than that of being agitated or over

48
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:08,699
caffeinated you know like you plug yourself into an electric outlet and like wow

49
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:14,400
and um you know you feel kind of Jake all Jane gold or something but as we

50
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,160
settle some of the tiredness some of the tensions some of the all kinds of things

51
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,820
begin to settle away and something gets released inside and some people call it a movement

52
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:33,720
towards Harmony where the energies the sensations the feelings the emotions the in our body

53
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,820
begin to kind of gather together organize themselves settle and there can

54
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:45,720
be start being a nice feeling of of the there's comfortable to be in the body it's nice

55
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,900
to be here even if there's pain sometimes there's pain in the body even so there might be some other parts of

56
00:05:51,900 --> 00:06:00,000
the body where there's a kind of a nourishing feeling of wholeness nourishing feeling of presence or of um

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:07,259
kind of like you're in a warm bath you know wow this is cool and um and the remarkable thing is

58
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:14,039
that's the kind of a good feeling really good to be in your body it's like really good to be present and be here

59
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:19,800
can come believe it or not if I'm not doing anything but you're kind of like a high quality

60
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,080
not doing you know really really sitting up and not just letting be letting be letting

61
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:32,639
be and then sooner or later and what becomes even more delightful

62
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,940
is uh with this at some point what's kind of not the only thing that left which would become stands out in

63
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:45,419
highlight is that our minds can know our minds can be aware

64
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:51,960
and awareness which is not being um recruited to accomplish something to

65
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:57,720
do something it's not being hijacked to be critical or angry or about something

66
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:04,380
or to be somehow you know it's not being hijacked by thoughts which are kind of undermining

67
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:09,479
or those which are somehow mean-spirited in some direction or other

68
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:15,000
uh there are thoughts that the the awareness becomes more and more left

69
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,400
alone because the doing quiets down and the

70
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,280
and the awareness starts to become a kind of uh Lucid clear vibrant it

71
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:32,099
becomes its own kind of wonderful thing like just like the body feels like you're in a bath after a while that the

72
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:38,580
mind the awareness can feel like um and the fog is cleared

73
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:46,139
it was just like suddenly you know the clouds with fog has to speak clearance completely everything's so clean and clear and it feels so good

74
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:54,080
foreign talk was a little bit of a

75
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:01,560
coming out of an appreciation for how much can happen by not doing in meditation

76
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:09,300
and one of the ways to use mindfulness is to be attentive and very attentive to

77
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,759
how you're starting to do something oh there it is trying to make something happen trying

78
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:21,900
to get trying to get rid of something and see and experiment with nice and Chase it's really good to see all that

79
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:28,680
and and back away just okay don't do it just let it be and then see what happens next and see

80
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,080
what happens next and so the mindfulness is used to support this not doing rather

81
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,120
than mindfulness being used um in support of attaining or getting or

82
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,940
fixing or correcting or whatever else it gets caught in

83
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:53,580
and um so I offer these the words kind of like a little bit in a kind of oh that I feel this evening there's a

84
00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:00,300
whole process of what can happen we can unfold and we sit and meditate that it can feel like super

85
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,700
healthy super good and um

86
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:10,920
and you didn't accomplish anything imagine that

87
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,040
anyway so that's my words I hope they make some sense I hope they're a little bit inspiring for you too maybe

88
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,140
appreciate the value of not doing in this kind of high quality way in which

89
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:30,600
we do it in meditation so now if you have any questions comments or protests

90
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:38,360
hey you're welcome to uh to take the mic and speak

91
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:04,019
hi good evening thank you so much for the sitting what's your name what's your name um and Rose and oh hi

92
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:09,959
um the part where you were saying go about like noticing when you are doing

93
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:15,959
something but but what about like when you're trying to investigate try to investigate you

94
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:23,580
know that or like anything with like with the those acronyms or the raft I mean isn't that like a good thing yeah

95
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:30,180
yeah yeah well there's many ways of practicing mindfulness and so there are ways that are more active like this and

96
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:36,300
um I spend a lot of time in meditation just being with my breathing I choose my breathing I'm there with it so I'm kind

97
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:41,459
of a doing something there and um and sometimes uh using like the

98
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:48,360
raft is really helpful the acronym you know practice because if you don't do it it's worse

99
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:54,660
and um because then you're really caught up in everything but if you go through this kind of Investigation things settle

100
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:01,440
down you see clearly what's happening and you see what it you see what you can stop doing you see what you can relax

101
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,700
so part of over time what we learn in doing this practice that we learn when it's

102
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:14,640
wise to be a little bit more actively involved and to do something like this and when we're better off backing off

103
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:21,540
and doing nothing but both are needed and at different times different things are useful and so

104
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:27,480
I think the maybe a little bit that talk my words today were motivated by

105
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:33,240
I meet a lot of meditators who err on the side of the doing part

106
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,940
and they don't understand the not doing part very well both both are good and if

107
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:43,980
right now you're kind of learning and getting your bearings with the doing part and you're enjoying it and it's

108
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,880
working for you can doing it well it's not so much enjoyment just

109
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:57,240
being aware that I am doing something that I would I would probably rather not want to be doing so just

110
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,540
but up thank you once you notice you're doing something you're not wanting you don't want to do

111
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:10,440
you uh the uh you might be halfway there oh wow so don't underestimate how

112
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:15,480
powerful it is to somebody say oh look at them doing it again I'm doing it I don't want to do this

113
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:22,500
um congratulate yourself and then let it be just okay I'm gonna watch you for a while

114
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:28,019
I'm just going to be with you for a while as opposed to getting in there and immediately and do something so see if

115
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:35,339
you can appreciate what you've done and maybe maybe that's all you need to do now you can just okay I'm gonna keep my

116
00:12:35,339 --> 00:12:41,880
eye on you and and what will happen is it'll probably settle by itself then

117
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:49,139
thank you so much that was really helpful a lot of the a lot of the difficult things we do in our mind and this is not it's not always true

118
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:55,459
um don't they can't really be sustained if they're being watched

119
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:02,240
and so you don't have to do anything but watch

120
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,880
so so someone else

121
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,820
hello I haven't been here for years it's so

122
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,980
nice to come back in person I'm Lika and um

123
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:36,899
in my family add runs in our jeans and so this idea of not doing is I feel more

124
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:42,540
difficult it's difficult more difficult yeah on that level because the mind is

125
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:47,639
constantly distracted externally also

126
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:53,700
we get paid to be very efficient and do a lot here in Silicon Valley oh

127
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:59,160
yes good it's so efficient you know efficiency get it done do do do to-do

128
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,800
lists right um so since I'm not retired yet

129
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:12,600
or independently wealthy How can I sit with nothing and do nothing when

130
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:20,220
everything around me is always make moving moving moving and like my mind always grabs on like that there's a

131
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,800
secret visualization practice is when you when Silicon Valley is

132
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,860
coming down heavy on you telling you should to be efficient you visualize yourself this is taking your tongue out

133
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:37,440
at all of the Silicon Valley [Laughter]

134
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:44,940
that's what you think of that at least when you're meditating it's like leave me alone enough already

135
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,040
um so so um yeah you know we have an episode of

136
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:56,639
these things become habits or become kind of even addictions at times to doing and making all that so it's really

137
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,279
helpful to have some something like meditation that breaks the momentum of being pulled and caught and on and on

138
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:07,620
and on it's unhealthy the way that people are caught in the efficiency cycle and doing

139
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:13,139
and doing and pretty soon they're being efficient in

140
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:19,380
Recreation play eating sex you know sooner quicker the better right

141
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:25,320
so because we want to be efficient so so there's coming to Habit so you

142
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:32,160
want to kind of you know learn break break that cycle if it can but it's hard you know the addictions

143
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,040
are mental addictions habits are hard to break and sometimes meditation is sometimes

144
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:44,399
it's not strong enough and sometimes exercise is stronger you know other things sometimes you know

145
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:52,019
work better than sitting meditating if it's really get caught in something and then for uh people have so-called

146
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:58,560
attention deficit disorder I have friends colleagues I have a friend close friends who are meditation

147
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,720
teachers who have that so it's possible you know to have that kind of mind it's

148
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:10,320
better not to call it a disorder it's just another way of mind's work and then you have to just learn how to use he

149
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:17,720
worked that mind and use that use that kind of mind and what my friends have learned to do is one of them especially

150
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,880
he concentrates in short spurts I can he can get very concentrated for a

151
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:30,839
few seconds and he's just content with that and then he gets around to doing again gets around through it again and so he but he

152
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:39,259
can't keep the focus but he just does it in small spurts and he's just very happy with that and it's worked to work really well for him

153
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,639
there's some shows other ways of doing it but

154
00:16:53,820 --> 00:17:02,279
I was there someone told me that there's a Buddhist country in Asia where the Buddhist monks have been

155
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:08,819
prohibited to teach teachings on contentment because if content workers don't work

156
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,240
very hard

157
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:36,000
hi my name is Nicole and um I'm really glad to be here again after so long not

158
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,640
being here so thank you um I was just listening to what this

159
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:48,660
young lady was saying and I really agree with that is that we're taught you know especially as women to be efficient and

160
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:54,900
to do do do and take care of everything but what I found in my practice is that

161
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:01,740
when I meditate and I take that time just to blank my mind out for some

162
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:07,500
reason I I can't explain it you maybe can explain it but I'm more efficient

163
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:14,820
it's like there's a time to be efficient and there's a time not to be and once I learned how to separate and give myself

164
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:21,900
the permission not to be like let's say here for 45 minutes something happens in

165
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:27,240
the mind where I'm able to keep track of things better I'm able to be more

166
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:34,380
efficient I'm able to get more done but it's kind of compartmentalize like there's a time and a place for it but

167
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,780
when I added meditation and blanking out my mind I got more efficient when it was

168
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:47,460
time to be official yeah yeah yeah exactly I feel the same way there's a way in which the mind that's overly busy

169
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:53,220
is scattered and not really be able to focus very well and it's also not very intelligent it's not very not very

170
00:18:53,220 --> 00:19:00,260
creative and so a settled mind A Quiet Mind a focused mind sometimes is much more uh

171
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:07,039
just efficient or creative and just really being present for what needs to be done maybe Alex makes less mistakes

172
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:13,500
doesn't forget as much things and the mind is more organized and available and

173
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:18,720
attentive and I've I I do that sometimes if I feel

174
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:24,679
like I don't have enough time for it all the things my to-do list um I'll meditate

175
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:30,419
and it seems like the last thing you should do when you have you know waste your time meditating when you could be

176
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:35,580
doing things but I find that when I finish even 10 minutes of meditation I

177
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:43,980
have so much more time than I thought before and then I go about doing what I do and I it seems like it all works out

178
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:50,240
I think it brings about a a better perspective yeah yeah

179
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:16,919
hi I'm Caroline and this is a ongoing

180
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:23,100
question that I've had that I ask many people about but always wanting to find

181
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:29,700
out more tips and tricks I can get to a point where I'm

182
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,340
doing nothing doing in into the into the nothing the white room a little bit

183
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:41,700
louder I I can get into the white room yeah um but

184
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:47,340
I usually have this song stuck in my head and the song

185
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:54,120
changes but there's always a song that's kind of just pops in and just and I don't know

186
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,400
what to do with that yeah because there's you know I'll notice it and I'm

187
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,940
like okay there's that but it's just it's distracting it can be

188
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:12,059
distracting yeah well if it's not distracting you can sometimes some people have succession

189
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:17,460
leaving it in the back depending you know in the background and just continue with their meditation

190
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:24,240
and then no no don't worry about it um some people find it useful to

191
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,760
um try to understand what's going on with the songs going on you said it's

192
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,280
distracting that might be it's very reason to be there maybe it's uh

193
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:42,480
something I know some people they use the songs in their head to comfort themselves when they're anxious

194
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,520
and so I know one person who had for years in meditation until she saw wow

195
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,980
every time I get a little anxious that's when the songs begin and once you understood that then it

196
00:21:52,980 --> 00:22:00,240
became a whole different world to live in and so to kind of sometimes to let this let the singing go on but then feel kind

197
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,659
of in the cracks of it is there any what's what's the subtle emotions that seems to be behind it

198
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:12,299
and is there something some discomfort some anxiety some something that seems

199
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:19,080
to come along with it and if it is then we would bring mindfulness to that not to the songs

200
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:24,900
and see what happens see if that can be settled um it's it's tough though because

201
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:31,020
songs are very very often sorry it can be difficult because songs can sometimes

202
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:38,100
be very easily leading you into memories yeah you know exterior things so it's

203
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:45,000
it's yeah but it's interesting to say all right just so it might be interesting for you to uh really learn

204
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,960
mindfulness of emotions and it's possible if you develop a much really rich or really

205
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,059
um you know uh skilled understanding of how

206
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:02,640
to recognize and how to practice how to be with emotions that this would give you a big handle on what's going on for

207
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:09,419
you and so um I don't know if you ever heard the have heard the intro class but the the third

208
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:14,940
day of the intro class that I I've taught for years you find it on Audio Dharma his mindfulness of emotions and

209
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,980
there's all kinds of talks on different emotions and mindfulness you know emotions and if you get a handle on the

210
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:25,799
emotions thing it'd probably go a long way just learn the skill like the raft thing

211
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:35,419
and um the um you know it's possible that the the

212
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:45,179
you know being caught being distracted in songs is um a tip of the iceberg or the

213
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:51,240
the wormberg or something of something some depth inside of you something really deeper that you haven't really

214
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:57,059
addressed or connected it's just just the beginning of something it's a deeper intimacy deeper connection to something

215
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:02,520
really important so I would uh you know things well worth looking into

216
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:09,480
and then if it's just that turns out it was just a habit that you're caught in and then sometimes you can uh I've known

217
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:15,780
people who who then um went along with the singing

218
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:21,299
but they changed the song and uh and I know some people who

219
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:28,080
there's a there's a kind of a loving kindness songs that people do and they sing the love and kindness phrases at a

220
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:36,360
nice tune and they just do that and then the Mind wants to go into the old songs but it's busy with a living kindness

221
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:42,960
kind of tune that you're playing and that's healthy and good and that kind of begins changing the the kind of shakes

222
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:51,600
it up in there a little bit then maybe breaks the habit and then you can start singing slower and slower until you get

223
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,899
quiet those are all very helpful thank you

224
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:09,620
it's a real bracket here today Jim they're back and forth again

225
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,000
[Laughter]

226
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:23,400
yeah sorry about that Jim you're getting your workout my name is Anne

227
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:29,220
uh so I've got a number of Health stuff going on that have got me all kind of

228
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:36,059
worried and during the day I seem to be able to you know just notice the emotions notice

229
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:42,059
the worry notice the fear whatever whatever and I've I have ways of processing it or managing it or just

230
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:47,100
observing it whatever but lately I've been waking up at like

231
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:53,159
three in the morning and the mind is all wanting to solve all the world's problems that I'm dealing

232
00:25:53,159 --> 00:26:00,120
with and the brain doesn't I don't have access to any of the the

233
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:06,960
processing you know things okay this is how we can handle now we don't need to deal with this now we'll deal with it tomorrow it doesn't work at three in the

234
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,440
morning and so I end up like losing an hour of sleep and I'm wondering if you've got ideas of

235
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,460
sleep meditation something to deal with the three o'clock in the morning

236
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:25,080
Baddies  I don't know what the the one thing

237
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:32,640
that's useful to do is if you get a sense that this is a regular pattern so when you wake up and there it is again the same pattern same way and you you

238
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,220
know you have worries but same patterns the same kind of same same degree of

239
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:44,820
wakefulness say My Everything feels the same like here I am I've tried the best I can to fall asleep but I've laid on

240
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:51,419
that side and this side still left counted cheap I've done everything but I know what's going to happen here I'm just going to be awake for the next hour

241
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:58,200
an hour and a half and maybe I'll fall asleep at some point but but you know this is this I mean this is

242
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:03,900
what's happening is um is uh get up and meditate

243
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:09,600
just get out of bed and go find your meditation seat and um and just take the meditation

244
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:17,100
posture because the quality of attention uh in the meditation posture quality of

245
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:23,640
beginning to kind of not get caught in the concerns it's much higher in the meditation posture or meditation than

246
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:29,700
laying in bed and so it might break the the

247
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:36,900
the reactivity or the Cycles or the pull or kind of let something relax more deeply then you can relax when you're

248
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:42,600
laying there that's that's brilliant yes I've gotten up and walked into the kitchen and

249
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:48,779
gotten something to drink and that will sometimes break it but this sounds like a more direct yeah and you might not

250
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:54,059
even prepare yourself so you have like a right have it all set up all set up so you just have a warm blanket you can

251
00:27:54,059 --> 00:28:00,179
just put around you right away and and just sit there and be in for a while and

252
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:08,039
it's remarkable that I was really surprised when I started meditating that even when I had a good night's sleep I

253
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:15,240
would get to meditate in the morning and I was uh be more relaxed and rested after the meditation than I had when I

254
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:21,000
woke up from meditation so there's something can really qualitative good can happen there so so two things can

255
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,940
happen one is it allows you to relax and let go and settle the other because we're practicing

256
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:32,460
mindfulness you might discover better than you are in bed what's really going on

257
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:39,380
maybe there's something that needs to be addressed yeah thank you

258
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,419
and there's also something which happens apparently that um

259
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:53,520
some of it might just be aging and so it just kind of like as some

260
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,980
people are getting older don't sleep as well and wake up in the middle of the night and rather than taking it being in

261
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:04,919
some great big psychological problem it said maybe your sleep patterns are

262
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:07,519
changed and

263
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:17,539
so you know maybe other things to be shifted so you can wake up in the middle of the night and do something efficient

264
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:22,980
and then go back to bed go back to you know and sleep in late

265
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,880
you know

266
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:47,460
foreign I'm Amanda

267
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:56,039
it's been a while several years perhaps that I've meditated at in this Buddhist

268
00:29:56,039 --> 00:30:03,299
fashion but I have been micro dosing meditation

269
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:09,960
I realized that the important parts of the day to keep them from

270
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,000
running into each other I could just take

271
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:22,559
three breaths if I could even remember one two three

272
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:30,000
it would help me to move quietly from one

273
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,760
activity to the next and I do that quite a lot

274
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:41,820
during the day whenever I think about it and when I go to sleep

275
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:46,860
so today when I came here to sit

276
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:54,059
it was as if I had leg room that I hadn't forgotten

277
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:59,880
the whole meditation process I had kept it with me in kind of a

278
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:05,580
little bag and to be able to sit here and just

279
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:13,919
be at leisure reminded me that I hadn't forgotten fantastic kind of

280
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:20,700
second nature was in there waiting for you and you kept it alive these three minutes three breath meditations yes

281
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:27,059
what a great thing you're doing running through the day thank you

282
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:32,279
yeah I love the expression micro dosing on meditation [Music]

283
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:36,080
I hear it's good for depression too

284
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:57,320
hi my name is Jay um so I've been spending I haven't spent too much time on super study but

285
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:03,000
moderately and you know the sense I get often

286
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,700
is I read it and sometimes I can feel it's just loaded you know more than just what

287
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:14,880
it's just the words I can feel a sense of compactness in it

288
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:21,539
and when I encounter there are times when there are like

289
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:27,240
three refrains you know how they're well this stuff is repeated like this

290
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:34,200
refrains like it goes like three times yeah so those times I I by the time I get to

291
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:39,240
the third time I'm sort of checked out and my question is this I feel like

292
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:44,340
the Buddha doesn't say this is the sense I get that he doesn't say anything non-essential

293
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:50,460
keeps it you know tight and compact and uh

294
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:57,480
so when I read this it feels like um that's the right word

295
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:04,380
it almost goes uh against the grain of all the other but not when he doesn't repeat

296
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:09,720
versus repeating there's a there's a difference I'm not sure I'm explaining this right

297
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:16,620
this is in reading the scriptures yeah so I'm wondering why he repeats three

298
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:22,440
times you know oh is there is there is there a more because the flavor of that feels very

299
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,659
different from all the other when he's not repeating it feels so Compact and essential and like you know he said

300
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:33,480
everything he wanted to say because you know but here he feels like you sort of so so this ancient this ancient

301
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:39,600
literature that that was originally composed to be chanted

302
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,850
and uh and when we you know when you enchant the refrain when you sing if you don't don't listen

303
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:52,740
[Laughter] a song that has a refrain

304
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:58,019
um most people are quite happy that there's a comfort in that and uh and a

305
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:04,500
familiarity and a delight to be able to oh there's the refrain and you go back into it there's the Rhythm and everything and it just feels really good

306
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:10,618
and it goes sinks deeper and deeper I've done years of chanting Buddhist chanting now repeat the same thing over and over

307
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:16,858
again and it goes in deeper and deeper it's almost like the layers each time you change it goes in deeper because

308
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:23,700
there's a different avenue of absorption enchanting than in reading that we then

309
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:31,339
it's very different and so uh this um this ancient chance which we became

310
00:34:31,339 --> 00:34:38,040
translated into English and printed it's kind of deadly to read sometimes I

311
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:44,339
mean it's the same if you want to go to sleep read some of it

312
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:49,919
it's um so just answer your question yes and uh when when you guys chanted it was

313
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:58,260
that in Pali was it in English sometimes in oh sometimes I've done all kinds of things probably English sino-japanese

314
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:04,440
well any feeling effect even if it is in a different language oh then it's then it's not the words don't mean so much to

315
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:11,520
me then but then it's the chanting uh the um the Rhythm so this the Rhythm the

316
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,460
tone The Voice the the vibrations in the body the concentration

317
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:23,160
that's needed sometimes you run a chant in a different language you have to be more con really present and by the time

318
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:29,520
I finish chanting uh you know I'm not distracted anymore so it's very focusing and that's the

319
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:37,320
other you know so what you might do if you're like to read these sutas is um memorize some of

320
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:44,099
it and then uh and then repeat it from memory over and over again see how it

321
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:51,660
affects you just not you can just do it you can't just be repeated in your mind doesn't that be out loud but uh see in the

322
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:57,060
ancient world they didn't have books either and you couldn't go to the library and pick up a book or you know like I'll

323
00:35:57,060 --> 00:36:04,380
I'll look at this later you know the only time it was there is well either you had to hear someone speak it or you

324
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:10,560
have to memorize it and people's ability to memorize was much better back then our ability to memorize has decreased

325
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:17,040
dramatically in our culture and um and then people would memorize it and then they have their library with them and

326
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,560
then they'd repeat it to themselves to think about it and be with it and um but

327
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,960
memorization also requires much more something deeper inside of us than just

328
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:34,920
knowledge wow that's great uh just to follow up on that so sometimes I go to the Zen Center

329
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:40,440
in the city and you know I used to skip the after the 540 sit at the end they would have

330
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:46,079
the you know the service and lately I've been staying and

331
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,839
sometimes the chant in English and then they turn it and sometimes they chant in Japanese and when I do the Japanese one it feels

332
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:57,900
awkward like I don't understand anything but from what I'm taking you're saying still do it there's still um there's a

333
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:03,960
there's something yeah yeah but give yourself over to it

334
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:09,000
uh and if you find any resistance or any boredom or any

335
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,180
um judgments about it or you know anything that's uh that's all extra

336
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:21,359
and you look you can learn not to succumb to those kinds of reactions to what's happening and just kind of give

337
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:27,359
yourself over to it completely as if it's the most important thing in the world and by the time you finish

338
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:34,920
your mind will be still and quiet if you're struggling with it then angry

339
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:42,960
and why am I doing this and it's a foreign language I can't understand it this is ridiculous it's a self-fulfilling prophecy

340
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,240
it is if you think it that way but if you don't think that you it can

341
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,180
become something quite meaningful great thank you

342
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,079
yeah the we should say this is chant the heart suture in English I used to center it a lot and there was something very

343
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:11,220
powerful you know there's these lines no ears no no eyes no ears no nose no tongue nobody to do to do it's like drum

344
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:17,220
beat and it goes over and over it kind of goes deeper and deeper and it's like this negation that you hear and like

345
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:24,420
something let go something let's go something lets go each time I mean I didn't even know what was being let go but like look everything goes everything

346
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:31,140
goes and it's just like you know it was kind of lovely emptying

347
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:41,180
it's a gym up here

348
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,320
hi my name is Michael um earlier you spoke about the mindfulness or meditation of doing

349
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,900
nothing versus doing something and I was going to ask what would you suggest is probably the best way to segue between

350
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:03,180
the both um enjoy yourself enjoy it it it took me

351
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:09,540
back to a time when I was a kid in mass and trying to get through church rather quickly and doing the prayers and the

352
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:15,359
Hail Marys and our fathers and oh no he's the the clock didn't move and sometimes I'll catch myself in the

353
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:21,480
middle of mindfulness and am I doing it right am I doing it wrong and I try and segue between doing something doing

354
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:27,119
nothing yeah I think all those things you have

355
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:33,839
all those tendencies in your mind the response to all of them is slow down

356
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:38,359
thank you slow down

357
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:45,839
