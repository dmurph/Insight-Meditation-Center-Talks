1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:06,779
so good morning everyone somehow I feel particularly happy to sit here today

2
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:15,300
happy and content somehow um which maybe I shouldn't be because

3
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,300
um I don't have a talk really thought out I'm just here and I debated

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,420
whether to just take questions today that seems like it's nice to do that

5
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,180
periodically and but there is something that I would like to talk about that I

6
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:43,140
think I'd enjoy talking about it just hasn't been formulated so I might bore you

7
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,079
as I find my way but it's just wonderful for me for me a wonderful topic of our

8
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,180
thinking and uh over the years of practice my

9
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:59,219
relationship to thinking has changed and as deep end and

10
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:06,600
expanded and all kinds of interesting ways for me at least and that um

11
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,720
and I would say that I have a very friendly relationship with

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:18,240
my thinking world my thinking that I think a lot of people can't say I couldn't have said that when I was

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,299
younger but also it's friendly in there I feel like mostly my thoughts are friendly

14
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,000
thoughts and really characterized by that I don't feel particularly challenged by

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,079
the thoughts that I have and I kind of kind of sometimes to lighten them and appreciate them and

16
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:45,720
and also um don't you know I've learned over the years of practice to not give a lot of

17
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:52,979
authority to them so that makes it easier to have a much simpler relationship to them

18
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:58,140
the the I think it's very easy because I've

19
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:03,180
had this plenty in my life of having thoughts that were compulsive

20
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,720
that there was stress involved and the Very thoughts that I had and um

21
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,900
into some point become free of that is a wonderful thing it's a possibility for all of us

22
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:23,280
though some people there's they're living so much so long or I did this certainly lived so long in thought

23
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,099
streams that were just taken for granted just assume to be normal that's what

24
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:35,220
life is sometimes you know this famous quote you

25
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,440
know I think therefore I am is um I think points to at least for

26
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,980
some of us that we identify with ourselves our thinking it's like who I am my thinking

27
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,440
and so if I think it it must be right there must be me or this must be the

28
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,140
real thing um certainly my thinking happens to me I

29
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:06,800
mean I take responsibility for it but I don't identify myself with it it's not like who I am it's just kind of like a

30
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,900
appendage sometimes and maybe no different than some of you maybe when

31
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:19,080
you clip off your fingernails once your fingernails are on I don't know where the counter or whatever you put them

32
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,980
whenever they fall they probably don't look at them so that's me

33
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:32,819
I better save them and you gather them up and you go around and you probably get a lock at the glass locket that you

34
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:38,280
carry carry with you and so you can show people like probably have it right over your hearts because then you show people

35
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,879
like about here look you know mostly once they're clipped you

36
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:52,220
know there's you know it's like oh you know I think for many people it's like a the relationship to clipped finger nails

37
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:59,280
uh you know is pretty pretty light pretty you know I bet there's not much

38
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,319
compulsion except like oh where's the right place to throw them away

39
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,720
and um so it thoughts you know but we can we have that kind of light easy

40
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:16,320
relationship with thoughts but we don't identify them because we think it it doesn't mean that's you doesn't mean you

41
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,040
have to Define Yourself by the thoughts that you have and so a big part of this for

42
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,380
mindfulness practitioners is in fact to learn to be mindfulness of thinking it's

43
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:34,020
not easy because sometimes thinking is the is the filter through which we see

44
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,240
the world we don't see the filter but over time you've become more you can

45
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:46,220
slowly become more and more cognizant of our thinking how we think different people think in different ways

46
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:53,520
some people it's clearly in words and a voice in the head that speaks some people it's in images a lot that

47
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:02,780
they think some people in other ways there's a that the primary way of knowing or processing or understanding

48
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:09,060
and um so to first become aware of how you know what how what is your way of understanding your life how to use

49
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:15,540
understanding arise for you and um and then uh notice whether it's

50
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:22,080
stressful or not ice that if this kind of feels heavy or dense or kind of contracted

51
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,180
whether it feels agitated the way that you know the way that you think

52
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:33,060
and um so and are there different circumstances in

53
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:39,840
your life where thinking is more likely to be stressful and other circumstances where it's actually kind of nice to think you enjoy

54
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,320
it maybe some people which when they're alone they enjoy their thoughts more some people in their

55
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:53,940
loan are oppressed more by their thoughts some people in the shower enjoy their thoughts because finally you kind of not

56
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:01,199
that's a place to sing and even if you can't sing and think it's going to be

57
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:08,340
um there's all kinds of different kind of scenarios so understand the different contexts for how we think and to begin

58
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:14,340
appreciating their differences and once you understand there are different ways of thinking and different qualities of

59
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:20,940
thinking then to appreciate that the way you think is somewhat optional that you

60
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:27,960
might have options that to think differently maybe think without stress stress

61
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,979
without compulsive compulsivity without um you know getting identified with your

62
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:42,539
thoughts this is who I am and um and so and then also to appreciate there

63
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:50,160
are different kinds of thinking and the one that I think Buddhism what practice wants to address the most is

64
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,220
what I call discursive thinking and this is a thinking that storytelling

65
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:02,340
the carrying on a discourse a conversation in the mind sometimes we're talking having conversations with other

66
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:08,460
people reviewing what we said yesterday to figure out a better reply that we didn't

67
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:14,039
give yesterday or planning ahead for a conversation you're going to have and what that

68
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:19,139
person says X I'm going to say why and but they say this you know kind of figuring out what's the best thing to

69
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:25,620
say in a situation sometimes they're stressful situations like you have to go talk with a boss in a difficult

70
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:31,919
conversation or have a challenging conversation with a friend or are you going to show up and have it and meet

71
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,680
with a one-on-one with a Buddhist teacher you know that would just for some people

72
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,900
they rehearse for that they're planning it out

73
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:49,020
and uh so so and sometimes that's where the opinions come we have opinions ideas

74
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:57,120
commentary to make about things wow look at that person those shoes are just not

75
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,180
not up to Snuff you know how how could those people wearing those shoes

76
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:09,660
or um you know on and on my son I just learned last night my son

77
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:16,860
is going to a kingdom party and uh so it kind of just that's only

78
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:24,379
something I learned about this last week a kingdom party we should all go to Kingdom parties no

79
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:31,620
I have no idea what's happened to that that kind of party but um but um

80
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:38,959
I didn't know what to think so I didn't have any commentary about it I was just kind of like wow

81
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:46,680
laughs maybe this is an anti-patriarchy party that would be nice

82
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:53,220
anyway so um so um he went to the basement and dug out

83
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:59,339
my wife helped him take out all the pink clothes that he had in storage because periodically in his life he liked pink

84
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,440
clothes and so he didn't forgot he had them so apparently that was

85
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:11,339
necessary for this party so um so commentary

86
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:17,640
judgments oh no I a young man should not wear pink that's

87
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,920
not quite up that's not right maybe it should be blue that's right so like mind

88
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:28,519
makes these stories right and lives in these stories and and those stories can be

89
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:34,140
perhaps very strong emotions connected to them very strong fear connected to

90
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:40,560
them very strong anger connected to them very strong kind of kind of criticism of self and

91
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,019
others and so the discursive mind the storytelling mind that can be can have a

92
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:52,200
huge impact on on ourselves and a huge impact on others

93
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:58,980
and on ourselves a story making mind is because it's often very repetitive we repeat over and over again the same kind

94
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:05,760
of story idea theme and um and as it's repeated the the

95
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,399
emotional impact of them gets repeated as well so if we're telling constantly telling

96
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:17,880
stories about how terrible we are then slowly that wears us away and you

97
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:24,959
know we start getting depressed or exhausted or just may shrink and contract in some deep way

98
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:31,980
if we keep telling our store sells stories which are lies about how fantastic we are delusions of grandeur

99
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,200
and then we start telling that to everyone else we might

100
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,140
believe the delusion the conceit around it which is also very stressful for at

101
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:49,440
least for others but for maybe for ourselves so the stories we tell repeatedly have a

102
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,320
big impact on us and so do we want to be careful of what we say

103
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,260
and we want to live in the storytelling mind our storytelling Minds a little bit of a

104
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:08,459
fantasy even if we're predicting the future or remembering the past some people love to remember the past

105
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:16,079
and it brings some people a great Delight which is wonderful and can be very very healthy part of their life but

106
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,839
sometimes the memories of the past are hard and sometimes the memories of the past are not accurate

107
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,540
and um and so you know are we weighed down by them are we

108
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:33,839
what's the effect these stories the discursive mind has and I think there's a lot of suffering

109
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:40,740
from the discursive mind a lot of stress that comes from that and so and to live in that as if that's

110
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:47,040
the way to be is I think unfortunate unfortunately how many people think or

111
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,440
just assume and it's never been questioned it's just this is the way things are reality has been built this

112
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:59,220
way and and the way I see the world through these stories must be true because I'm seeing it through those

113
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,260
filters and so it must be true so one of the phenomenal things that can

114
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:11,279
happen for meditation practice I think I think most meditation practice is the calming of the thinking mind

115
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,560
so that we discover that we can breathe and be alive and be happy or just

116
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:23,519
experience life without that discourse of mind running it's kind of like the hum of the

117
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:30,060
refrigerator has gone off and we didn't even know it was on until it went off and ah that feels good and so to have

118
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:37,860
the discursive running mind ah that feels good and not a few people that's why they cherish meditation because it's

119
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:45,000
the one place where that thinking mind gets quiet enough that it's not so stressful not so not so oppressive not

120
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,720
just kind of constantly churning and churning and so just meditation it calms down

121
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:55,860
quiets down and um but for our practice of

122
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:01,200
mindfulness meditation it's not just to have a quiet mind or a calm mind and get

123
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:07,800
that relief it's to have that calmness as a vantage point to be become wiser

124
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,680
about how we think to use that as a as a as a orientation

125
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:20,639
the calmness to then look at our thinking more carefully when the thinking mind begins again how am I

126
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:27,360
thinking what's the quality of my thinking what's the primary themes that what I

127
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,959
think not a few people only discover the regular the themes of their thinking

128
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:40,760
when they go into meditation retreats because for seven days maybe there's

129
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:48,600
very little stimulus that's usually Keeps Us distracted you don't have the radio or the TV on or

130
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,639
your computer on some people have multiple things on at the same time like

131
00:13:53,639 --> 00:14:00,779
my son I I've seen him with three monitors that

132
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:08,519
he's tracking and he seems to be able to do it he's also figured out to listen to they

133
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:14,459
record all the classes in college and so he doesn't listen in class he doesn't go to class sometimes

134
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:20,220
and he says that professors talk too slow so I don't not interested you know it's like my mind wanders off and I talk

135
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:25,740
to people next to me or or I'm on my phone but what I've learned is that I learned

136
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:32,880
much better if I go to the if I listen to the recordings because I put them on two or three times

137
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:40,079
speed and then I have to really pay attention

138
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,899
and then I learned so anyway so like you might just say

139
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:51,480
that he shouldn't have three monitors on and tracking them all if he can you know who knows

140
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,180
maybe there's a whole new generation of people born with it you know being evolving into different brains

141
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:02,760
maybe most of us are the old version of them

142
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:09,000
Evolution continues right so um

143
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,180
but um but to see the repetition on Retreat to see how we we don't have the

144
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:22,440
distractions that we don't normally have or the interruptions to spend hours at a time on Retreat just left with yourself

145
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:28,740
and looking at yourself and seeing yourself and sometimes it's a little bit distressing for people or for some

146
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:34,800
people very distressing to finally discover what goes on in there I had no idea that this is what I was thinking

147
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,180
all the time this is terrible or wow I'm better than I thought I was

148
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:47,279
that's less often than the first and um

149
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,980
and uh to just you know and so some people discover how much they um are

150
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:59,220
afraid because all their thoughts who most of their thoughts are the themes is so much fear worried about this worried

151
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:06,060
about that worry about that some people discover how much they're trying to escape and run away by going into

152
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:13,199
fantasy some people discover how much they're driven by desire and their sexual desire because they

153
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:20,820
have fantasies of Galore and so it goes on and on so it goes you know so so there's themes and so wow I had no idea

154
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:27,480
that this is what what drives my mind and what goes on all the time if his mind is left to itself

155
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:32,699
that's considered really fantastic for inside meditation to start seeing Oh

156
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:39,000
this is how it is this is how it is and for the purposes of inside meditation there's absolutely no need

157
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:45,920
for shame no need even for embarrassment though it's occasionally it's embarrassing

158
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:53,579
the um the it just is you you want to be able to see it clearly and learn not to

159
00:16:53,579 --> 00:17:00,240
Define Yourself by it and this defining ourselves by the thoughts we have is one tremendous

160
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:08,040
source of suffering so so then we slowly kind of begin to

161
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:14,339
not be so committed to our thinking mind discursive mind we're not so focused on

162
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:21,120
or interested in it and that makes it a big difference it's there's no switch to turn it off

163
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:27,120
so it's hard to kind of just say at the stop but it is possible to lose interest in it

164
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,000
and as we lose interest to it can kind of recede into the background it doesn't it doesn't have us by the throat or by

165
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,399
the nose and it just kind of does its thing and we can take you know be more present in other ways

166
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:45,600
also when we start seeing the quality and the characteristics of our descriptive word we're thinking all the

167
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:53,400
time it's possible to change what we think and um and to change the stream of our

168
00:17:53,400 --> 00:18:01,380
thoughts if the thoughts are always ones ones of doubt try out intentionally thinking thoughts

169
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:07,559
lots of confidence think about the things that in your life that you're confident about

170
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:12,720
and uh and that could be the most mundane simple thing you can ever

171
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,020
imagine you have some confidence you know how to put on your shoes you know some people that's a challenge

172
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:27,539
but you know that's an example of something very simple you know you have confidence that you know which drawer to

173
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:33,900
put your silverware in you know you never think about this it's done on automatic pilot but to start

174
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:39,299
thinking about what you have confidence in that's small and then slowly expand

175
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:45,419
it and get a sense of what it feels like to think confident thoughts as opposed

176
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:52,799
to always thinking doubtful thoughts if you have mean thoughts cynical thoughts

177
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,980
um try out having kind thoughts it doesn't have to be insincere ones

178
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:05,760
maybe there are certain things you can be you had you have kindness for the neighbor neighbor's dog

179
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,000
when you see it you just wouldn't you know you fall in love or something so begin where you can and have start

180
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,700
having kind thoughts regularly and see what that's like now when I was

181
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:23,340
a new sense student Buddhist practitioner I would have thought anything like that

182
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:29,460
was artificial anything like that was kind of like painting a saccharine picture of the

183
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:34,740
world well maybe it is but it doesn't have to be

184
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:41,340
but more importantly um is it the better alternative

185
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:47,220
is it better to continue with the meanness is that it better to continue with the doubt

186
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:53,419
than it is to insert Maybe ten percent of the time where

187
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:59,520
thoughts of confidence the thoughts of Goodwill thoughts of kindness

188
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:06,260
and what happens how does that influence you how does that condition you how does that change you

189
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:13,740
so this began shifting our relationship to thinking and this shifting relationship to discursive thought

190
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:19,860
begins allowing us to not to put it down to not be identified with it

191
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:27,000
and then we can start with especially with the help of meditation start Discerning that there are other ways of

192
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,760
knowing that there's other ways of thinking than discursive thinking

193
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:41,220
and uh and it's fantastic to start discovering that

194
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:46,620
um certain that is that there can be knowing

195
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:54,000
something before you think it and maybe it's obvious to some of you but for me that was a great discovery

196
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,080
and as I kind of got wind of it wait a minute here why do I always I was focused on

197
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:07,640
thinking as being what told me what was going on in life and then I noticed that things are quiet

198
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:15,679
there's a knowing there before I think why do I think I have to think

199
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,240
what if I just maybe I just content with that knowing

200
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:27,240
and it turns out we know a lot of things without thinking so

201
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,179
um I think for all of you are going to leave when you leave here through one of the doors that we have

202
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:39,980
you know it's a door no I think I I bet none of you are going to try to leave Through the Windows

203
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:46,940
it wouldn't occur to you maybe I said I told you now some of you will try but

204
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:54,659
but you know you know that you know if you want to leave you go through a door but you I suspect you don't think that

205
00:21:54,659 --> 00:22:02,039
you're not planning ahead you know now I'm in this building buildings have doors doors are the ways to get out but

206
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:09,000
you know doors big enough are they small enough but do I have the right clothes to go through the door you know that you

207
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:16,260
don't think about the door but you know it's a door that that's it knowing which exists

208
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:22,559
somehow in the cognitive mind that doesn't require active thinking

209
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,799
so a silly example but there's actually lots and lots of that going on all the time

210
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:35,159
one area that uh that's somewhat complicated in our life or what this operates a lot is driving

211
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:41,340
we make a lot of choices as we drive because we see something we know what it means but when we might be having a

212
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:46,440
conversation with a friend sitting in the passenger seat and we're mostly kind of thinking about that we're not

213
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:53,880
thinking about there's a pedestrian stepping in front of the you know into the crosswalk so slow down and stop

214
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,980
there's a lot of processing that goes on to make that act to do that but that all

215
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:06,559
happens in this kind of non-thinking world of cognition understanding and that's a good thing to do

216
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:13,740
my suspicion is that for most people this non-thinking place where we know

217
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:19,500
something tends to be wiser than most of our active thinking

218
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:25,100
it tends because a lot of the active thinking that we have is being fueled

219
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:30,539
by things like greed desires by ill will

220
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:37,020
hostility anger by fear anxiety by confusion and not to understanding

221
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:45,000
what's going on and and when it's fueled by that that has a very different effect on us when

222
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,039
our thinking or knowing is not influenced by those sources

223
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:57,059
and this deeper way of knowing can be influenced by these emotions these motivations but they're much less likely

224
00:23:57,059 --> 00:24:03,000
to and that's less likely to be driven by them or pushed by them because of the

225
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,580
the strong compulsive way in which discursive thought spins

226
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:14,700
and runs and it insists and and demands almost on the Mind from the heart

227
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:21,120
and so to learn how to quiet the mind enough to discover what you know

228
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:28,740
before you think it is fantastic it also can discover that you still can

229
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:34,380
have thoughts but the thoughts are not stories

230
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:39,659
simple thoughts like it's a door there's someone else in front of me I'll

231
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:46,620
step aside okay let me step aside let somebody else go through the door those could be thoughts but it's not a

232
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:53,580
big story of who did what to who and so to and so it might be very boring

233
00:24:53,580 --> 00:25:04,039
the thought you know let someone else go through the door first but the richness of how we have a a a a

234
00:25:04,039 --> 00:25:09,419
valuable healthy relationship to the present moment and that people in the present moment

235
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:16,080
belongs closer to that world than the story making world that we're making up and living by and

236
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,840
worried about and um and so to be able to click quiet

237
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:29,039
enough the mind and start seeing this other way of thinking that's really simple that's present moment thinking

238
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:35,760
that simple statements in the mind or recognitions in the mind knowing the Mind something that has a chance to be

239
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:42,299
more connected to the deeper knowing Within in the teachings of the Buddha what

240
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:48,840
happens what he points out which I would concur with is that as the discursive

241
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:54,539
mind of desires and ill will and fear begins to abate

242
00:25:54,539 --> 00:26:00,779
the sense that the that we're uh contracted or scattered or agitated by

243
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:05,880
the thoughts dissipates and thoughts and thinking can now seem

244
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,980
like they're happening in a very spacious way they're kind of there's there's lots of

245
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:16,799
room for them and some people actually talk about how feeling their mind has become expanded then open

246
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:22,559
and the mind starts feeling settled or calm and the atmosphere of calm the

247
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:28,820
atmosphere of expansiveness of Mind expansiveness of thinking creates a very different atmosphere

248
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:35,279
within which this deeper knowing can occur I think then the deeper and deeper

249
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:43,380
sources of knowing that comes out of some of the ways we can be in the world with compassion and love and care and

250
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:49,559
friendliness with wisdom can operate them so this whole Enterprise this whole

251
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:57,299
approach of becoming mindfulness mindful of thinking and really taking time to know how we

252
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:06,299
think and what goes on and distinguishing different kinds of thinking is a really important process for coming

253
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:13,320
to tap into the deeper sources of wisdom of peace and love which our hearts are

254
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:19,260
capable of and have those inform how we think to

255
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:27,779
have those be the motivation for thinking or that atmosphere for thinking rather than fear or anger or

256
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:34,460
repression or pain living in pain and what comes from all that

257
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:41,460
so um that process is a slow process it's a worthwhile process

258
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:47,580
is a process I think that occurs as we start practicing mindfulness in all areas of our life

259
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:52,980
and I hope that the time will come that you will say

260
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:58,980
that it's friendly in there it's a friendly place in there you don't

261
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,980
mind like you and your friends are like best you and your thinking are kind of like best friends

262
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:12,059
and um and you enjoy each other what should I do mostly

263
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:17,340
I want to say one more thing about this world of thinking that maybe also is a

264
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:25,559
nice experiment to do that in different settings different ways we tap into different cognitive and

265
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:33,840
processing parts of the Mind and so how we understand or come to

266
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,880
understanding when we're left to ourselves just to think about ourselves privately in our minds

267
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:46,559
it can be very different than how we do so if we're talking out loud so I found that sometimes when I feel I

268
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:54,059
felt kind of challenged by life circumstances that I find it useful to um I do mostly

269
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:59,580
do it when I'm driving is to talk out loud to myself start talking about what's happening in

270
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:05,520
my life it kind of review it out loud or describe what's happening or my

271
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,559
relationship to it out loud because I found when I speak out loud it's like a

272
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,779
whole different part of my mind or my heart is engaged and if only involved in

273
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:21,539
discursive thinking which feels much more for me much more limited in quality

274
00:29:21,539 --> 00:29:26,720
other times I find that thinking quietly to myself not talking out loud

275
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:33,840
changes where I am if I'm hiking in the forest then I I have a for me that's

276
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:39,840
this place where I feel much more peaceful and it's very reassuring to be in those environments and so I find that

277
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:46,919
changes how I think um if um if I'm exhausted I think a lot

278
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:52,440
more interestingly after I take a nap and I've been oppressed by my thinking

279
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,260
when I'm in sleepy and sleep deprived and um and then I realize you know Gil

280
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:04,460
you're not you're not thinking very well there's not much hope for you here

281
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:10,980
take a nap and then I take a nap and then the biggest problem I have with naps is I

282
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:16,799
don't want to wait I wake up but I don't want to get out of bed I'm just so content just looking at the

283
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:22,260
ceiling but then in that contentment my thinking has changed and I have a whole

284
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:28,980
different way of thinking so um so where you think how you think when

285
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:36,179
you think and whether you think out loud or think privately to yourself

286
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:43,380
um is these are all different things that um and also you might sometimes experiment to do is to put on music

287
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:49,559
do you think differently depending on the music you hear these are all ways of breaking the

288
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:55,500
hegemony of the discursive mind all these ways of not kind of assuming

289
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:01,380
just because you're how what you're thinking in one way that that's the nature of reality this is the truth this

290
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:06,899
has to be the way it is don't let your thinking mind have a

291
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:15,259
negative influence on you be very careful about that don't give it a lot of authority

292
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:22,740
and if you want if you want to give authority to some deep understanding deep wisdom you have to really dip down

293
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:27,779
below that discursive mind this curse of mind is kind of like a it's kind of like

294
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:33,840
a static that interferes with our ability to

295
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,659
connect with the deeper sources of wisdom and knowing we can have and the deeper sources of Courage

296
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:47,600
as we live our life so that's my non-talk

297
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:55,340
I hope that was okay some of you I think some of you think so

298
00:31:55,340 --> 00:32:00,960
it might be relevant so uh it's 10 30 we usually go to 10 45

299
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,720
so if some of you would like to ask questions or commentary or

300
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,720
testimonials

301
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:19,919
thank you Gil if you can say you're named when you free speak it's kind of nice I'm Carla

302
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:27,720
um this was the perfect talk that I needed today I've been struggling

303
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,240
with these oppressive thoughts because I'm going through

304
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:40,320
very difficult situation a rift with my best friend and it seems like I can't bring us back

305
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,360
together and so I have these repetitive thoughts

306
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:52,020
I should have said this if only she thought that and then I'm trying to peel that away I'm telling

307
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:58,559
myself okay I'm defending myself for a reason oh because I'm feeling

308
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:06,120
shame because of the things she said to me I've been accepting her point of view

309
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:13,620
okay I actually have nothing but good will towards her I could set that aside

310
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:19,580
but then the feelings of the loss the feelings of the hurt

311
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:25,260
they just keep coming back the feelings seem to be the source causing the

312
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:31,860
thoughts as opposed to we usually talk about the reverse just won't resolve

313
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:37,080
any suggestions yeah sometimes our emotions are the source for how we think

314
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:42,899
and sometimes thinking is the trigger for the emotions and it's fascinating to see that which direction it goes at

315
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:49,320
different times and for you it sounds like uh there's something deeply emotional to you have

316
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:54,779
to sort through or to heal or understand so I'm glad that you understand what it is because that's probably where the

317
00:33:54,779 --> 00:34:00,899
work really is and um so how since you know since you understand some of them and see them how

318
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:07,140
they shift and change over time you're you're kind of in a in a you know

319
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:13,500
that gives you an important kind of options for how to work with this and

320
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:19,618
one thing you might try doing is spend the next month or so because this is an important relationship so you don't want

321
00:34:19,619 --> 00:34:24,858
to be in a hurry necessarily to solve it so spend the next month every day

322
00:34:24,859 --> 00:34:30,000
writing a letter to your friend telling her what you want to say telling her

323
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,720
about all this about you know how you're feeling what's going on your shame your despair your well you know just put it

324
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,378
put write it all in the letter to your friend don't don't um don't send the letter

325
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:48,839
so let it be uncensored uninhibited just write it there this is not a time to be

326
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:56,040
censored or be inhibited or just write what's in your heart and if you're real for example if you're Furious just write

327
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:01,500
the fury just write what's happening you know and then maybe each day

328
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:07,200
um burn it or throw it away but do that do that for a month to really see if you

329
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:14,579
can kind of really uh get these feelings and emotions really known and expressed

330
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:21,960
and recognized and because without them without being really well recognized and given some

331
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:28,200
expression some respect that way they might not have a chance to move on to the next thing

332
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:35,579
all emotions want to move on that's why they're called motions emotions they want to move on but we tend to

333
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:42,540
bottle them up we tend to restrict them and hold them back and we get or get stuck in them and so sometimes there's

334
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:49,320
something a safe situation like writing a letter we're used right so it doesn't have to be a letter to your friend but simply where you write it and write it

335
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:56,160
and then and then you know throw it away so you don't have to even

336
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,920
go back and read it it's just you don't do the next day do it again and see after a month of doing

337
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,320
that see what happens that's really interesting it's like

338
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:15,780
getting those thoughts out putting them on paper and then walking away from it yeah yeah and some people will do this

339
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:22,320
and actually uh they don't just kind of just kind of crumple them up and put them in the trash can they um they do a

340
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:29,460
little ritual each time like maybe I don't know what the ritual would be but I've known people who have buried it in

341
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:36,119
a nice place like like a funeral you know for something something that's

342
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:41,359
healed right to you thank you

343
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:44,300
thank you

344
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:52,460
yes please

345
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:05,880
hi thank you very much this is a very very appropriate topic for me to hear from

346
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,240
you today the wisdom was very very insightful and very effective

347
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:19,320
a lot of times fear uncertainty and doubt fear uncertainty and doubt about a topic

348
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:27,660
perhaps maybe Health maybe some other career or you know issues and so forth create a uh as you as you call a

349
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:33,720
discursive thought that just never ends and it always an end product of it is just you dragged

350
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:41,880
you down and emotionally and thoughtfulness and it goes from bad to Wars you know as you call it so how

351
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:49,079
about the role of fact finding in trying to alleviate this fear

352
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:54,720
uncertainty a doubt in addition to calming down head your mind great very

353
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,660
nice well I think the first Factor disco to be clear about is that you have fear

354
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:06,599
uncertainty and doubt because to see oh this is this I don't know about anything else but I know this

355
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:12,180
is true because it's easy to be kind of swept into the uncertainty or the doubt and

356
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:19,020
the fear and it kind of pushing us around guiding us kind of kind of creating the whole mood that we're in

357
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:26,460
and and we don't but the idea in mind first practice is sometimes is take the attention 180 degrees around and look

358
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:31,740
something directly and maybe what needs to be seen is not the issue you have

359
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:38,940
like your health issue the first thing you need to really see is oh here's a lot of uncertainty of fear and doubt

360
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:44,880
if you see that carefully well then you can start and then sometimes

361
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,660
it's actually good to have some analysis of it they really think about this a little bit wait a minute I should think about this or talk to a friend here I

362
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:57,780
have uncertainty fear and doubt does it make sense that I have this or

363
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:05,520
do it does make sense that I say all three together in one breath maybe uncertainty is ordinary normal

364
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:12,359
part of human life doubt maybe that's is in some ways is

365
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:18,480
doubt appropriate how is it appropriate maybe sometimes it's appropriate to have doubt

366
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,420
fear that's appropriate sometimes but maybe but I don't have doubt maybe I have

367
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:31,200
anxiety maybe I can not maybe I can have uncertainty without fear

368
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:38,880
maybe I can have doubt without fear what would that be like it might be that fear is influencing

369
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,880
both the doubt and the uncertainty and so you're kind of like a little package and as long as you have that

370
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,300
package all neatly tied together there's no hope for you

371
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,980
and so you have to kind of tease it apart and uh and like one of the great many

372
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:01,500
spiritual teachers talk about the importance of being comfortable with uncertainty

373
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:07,079
being comfortable with insecurity and of course there's a lot of uncertainty in this life

374
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:12,359
and uh and so if you're always looking for certainty some people are neurotically looking for certainly all

375
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:19,320
the times I don't know if that's your case and the fear is very important too if there's a health issue it's appropriate

376
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:25,619
to have some fear and but then you distinguish the fear from the anxiety

377
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:31,859
which has to do with fantasy and projections into the future what's happening in you and really stop

378
00:40:31,859 --> 00:40:37,500
and look and and um and take a look to go to that 180

379
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:43,140
degree turn and really study that and um

380
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:49,079
and then um so that's the first facts to look at and

381
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:55,500
once you do their homework of doing that course do research

382
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:02,820
of course you know about the health condition and the situation and find out and try to be careful to use good

383
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,820
sources and try to be careful to be Discerning what you read

384
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:15,140
you know but there's a lot of claims a lot of people say this is how it is so you want to kind of always

385
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:22,680
on what basis what's the support for their claim and is this just an opinion to see the

386
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:28,740
difference between opinion and a well-supported claim is important I think so there's a way of critical

387
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:34,920
thinking and investigation research that is it I think a part of a healthy

388
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:42,000
appropriate life um and if a person if you just kind of some people don't never occur to them to

389
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,520
do the research themselves and you just want to trust the doctors but they have doubts about the doctors and and then

390
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,920
they just feel lost in the whole so please so that was a long answer was that

391
00:41:52,920 --> 00:42:01,520
appropriate holiday above thank you yeah one more and then we'll yeah here

392
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:09,420
we go hi Gail

393
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:16,260
um the way you explained writing the letter with the discursive thoughts

394
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:21,599
would that apply to discursive or repetitive

395
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:27,359
worry and thoughts of worry or concern that

396
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:33,599
they're never ending yeah I think if if there's a repetitive discursive worry it's repetitive worry

397
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,599
over and over again because it keeps coming back keeps coming back it's a sign that something uh that that

398
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:45,540
we're not understanding the full picture of what's happening with us and so you want to be able to stop and find it

399
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:51,180
figure out some way to look under the you know look under the hood of the car you know look underneath and see what's

400
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:57,060
really happening here for us what's driving it and and what am I avoiding what am I not seeing

401
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:04,560
and um and so there's different ways of doing that but one possibility is to write about it some people in writing

402
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,800
about it especially if it can be uninhibited it's just kind of like almost like a stream of Consciousness

403
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:14,819
thoughts about the worry and stuff like that that's we might be able to start

404
00:43:14,819 --> 00:43:20,700
seeing Oh that's what I'm feeling that's what's going on for me I didn't know that yeah

405
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:26,240
thank you so does that make sense yes great

406
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:33,420
and um you know and if that doesn't help you then

407
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:38,880
then you know after a while don't do it if it doesn't show it doesn't reveal

408
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:45,420
something or support something or and again also sometimes as Carla pointed out you know sometimes it's really

409
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:52,680
healthy to have these things expressed because otherwise if they're bottled up inside of us then it can be they can

410
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:58,140
fester in there but even just talking to a friend about something or talking out

411
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:04,440
loud in a car or writing about it it's kind of like getting it off the chest and then it can have a very different

412
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,480
life inside of us things can move again I mean I I do

413
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:15,599
think about it and I do discuss it um

414
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:21,300
but I thought maybe writing it is is another level of yes I think writing is

415
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:26,400
a good thing especially when I guess I keep saying try to do it as uninhibited as possible

416
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:33,900
just dream of conscious let it just flow don't worry if it's true don't worry if it's

417
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:39,260
you know if it's you're expressing ugly emotions or if I sound like a crazy

418
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:44,520
don't worry if I sound like a crazy lunatic yes don't don't cry yeah yeah

419
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:51,800
you're allowed to be a crazy lunatic when you're writing and also the grammar doesn't have to be very good

420
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:58,680
spelling too spelling spelling is you know the doesn't matter handwriting

421
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:03,020
doesn't matter yes

422
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:12,240
I didn't think of it as journaling but but that's I guess that's a big term like broad term I guess

423
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:17,880
I guess how I thought about it in my mind but there's a journaling technique that

424
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:23,280
um kind of foregoes what the intellectual enters in and then you just go more into what's unconscious

425
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,319
subconscious what's not accessible is if you just journal with no nothing in mind

426
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:33,900
in terms of grammar the way you're writing and you go fast it allows you to

427
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:39,720
go a little bit deeper nice nice oh so in terms of you know thinking and

428
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:46,079
access there's interesting things I find uh when I exercise

429
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:52,440
um uh I love to I just give freedom to my mind I think whatever it wants it's one of the few places where it's got

430
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:58,980
total freedom to just think because when I meditate I'm busy meditating so but I don't have I don't

431
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:04,020
my thinking mind doesn't have a free reign but uh it's exercise has a free

432
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:10,619
reign and then I discover things about what I'm concerned about or what's going on and it's got a very it's a very kind

433
00:46:10,619 --> 00:46:18,359
of an interesting place where to kind of discover because I it's kind of like just a just a free time to think

434
00:46:18,359 --> 00:46:24,119
and um otherwise you know you know my life is doing things and thinking about

435
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:30,599
talks I'm supposed to give or you know I'm doing things you know my mind but to have so I think it's a healthy thing to

436
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:37,740
occasionally have give to your mind complete freedom in a safe environment exercising is what I found is nice

437
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:44,339
but it might be other other times so thank you so it's 10 45 it's time to

438
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:50,040
end and I'll stay here for another probably 10-15 minutes if some of you want to come up to the front and

439
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:56,760
