1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:07,120
okay so uh so welcome welcome to you all

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,719
that's very sweet to uh see the uh

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,439
youtube sangha in the chat um

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,640
okay you know how this goes um

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,480
please uh please settle in

6
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,479
so sometimes we practice just

7
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,159
stopping all at once

8
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,720
sometimes we ease our way in and sometimes we stop all at once we just

9
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,079
open to everything now

10
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,120
and of course there's this kind of gravitational pull to nursing this wound

11
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,719
or planning that pleasure

12
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,760
mapping out these contingencies

13
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,840
so there's a certain kind of courage maybe even faith just in

14
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,159
stopping

15
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:06,159
meditation requires that we tolerate all the loose ends

16
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,080
of the human condition

17
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,280
we don't need to tie them up we just

18
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,440
stop

19
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,000
and we we treat all phenomena like

20
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,199
a gust of wind blowing through awareness

21
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,400
we're neither braced against that gust

22
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,880
nor are we trying to bottle it up

23
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,400
and hold on to it

24
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:45,440
it's often skillful to have

25
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:57,880
a line of definition around what is in the focus space and what is out of it

26
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:15,440
so maybe we draw a line around the sensations of the breathing

27
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,360
the nostrils the belly

28
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,519
or maybe the line includes all of the soundscape

29
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,519
while excluding everything else

30
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:47,560
maybe the line includes all of the body sensations

31
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,680
and leaves the rest of the world behind

32
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,720
or maybe the anchor [Music] is everything

33
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,560
the five sense gates the mind

34
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,880
but just know what's inside the circle and what's outside it

35
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:35,800
rest with a kind of balanced energy

36
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:58,120
either bracing against nor holding onto the wind

37
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,000
when we relinquish the agenda to

38
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,040
direct our life

39
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,959
when we just sit here

40
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,800
all phenomena become a kind of gateway

41
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,279
to wisdom love

42
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:22,800
it is not the case that only the preferred gusts of wind

43
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,839
or the gateway

44
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,399
everything is a door

45
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,839
we just keep walking through

46
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:26,039
when we actually open to our life

47
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,200
in this way when we put down some of the impulse to engineer it

48
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,519
just open

49
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:49,720
a kind of love for ourselves becomes almost self-evident

50
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,600
this love is not based on

51
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:09,840
our characteristics the pros and cons of me

52
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:23,840
but is a an appreciation of the condition of being sentient

53
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,840
feeling pleasure and pain longing to be safe

54
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,360
longing for peace amidst the intensity of samsara

55
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,960
and that kind of love dawns on us

56
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,440
and it's a love that can't really be contested

57
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,080
by our self-harshness and judgment

58
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,840
we rest in that

59
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:43,399
this takes us more deeply into the present

60
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,559
so it's good to good to see with you

61
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:20,240
this is the essential avaricious nature of loss

62
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:28,080
it encompasses without distinction the trivial and the consequential the abstract and the concrete

63
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:35,360
the merely misplaced and the permanently gone we often ignore the tr its true scope if

64
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:41,200
we can but for a while after my father died i could not see stop seeing the

65
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:48,880
world as it really is marked everywhere by the evidence of past losses and the

66
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:55,120
imminence of future ones this was not because his death was a

67
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:01,519
tragedy my father died peacefully at 74 attended

68
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:08,480
throughout his final weeks by those he loved most it was because his death was not a

69
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:17,519
tragedy what shocked me was that something so sad could be the normal necessary way of

70
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:25,600
things in its aftermath each individual life seemed to contain too much heartbreak

71
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:31,200
for its fleeting duration history which i had always loved even in

72
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:39,039
its silences and mysteries suddenly seemed like little more than a record of loss

73
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,840
on an epic scale especially

74
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:50,799
especially where it could offer no record at all the world itself seemed ephemeral

75
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:58,720
glaciers and species and ecosystems vanishing the pace of change as swift as in a time

76
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:05,679
lapse as if those of us alive today had been permitted to see it from the

77
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,840
harrowing perspective of eternity everything felt fragile

78
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:18,399
everything felt vulnerable the idea of loss pressed in around me

79
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:25,679
like a hidden order to existence that emerged only in the presence of

80
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,080
grief

81
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:38,840
it's catherine schultz from lost and found

82
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:48,000
i wasn't planning to uh to talk about this but here it goes

83
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:55,120
so when we

84
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,399
love in a world that changes a world that

85
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:08,480
trembles in all directions grief becomes a part of life

86
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:18,158
and we have to love something it's it's just what what mammals do

87
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:27,358
and so grief is is woven into the fabric of our biology

88
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,599
and um really when we we care about other

89
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:41,520
beings when we care about sentience itself grief becomes a feature of life

90
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,599
and so monday was helplessness how helplessness can

91
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:55,040
illuminate our power yesterday renunciation freeing us up to

92
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:01,520
enjoy pleasure more fully less compulsively

93
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:10,078
and today uh grief grief freeing us up to love more deeply

94
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:18,880
now when i use the word grief i'm not just talking about the loss of someone it's broader than that and

95
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,560
i'm not talking about the species of grief that debilitates us

96
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,640
it freezes us although that's a part of life too

97
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,079
but the way that the dharma interacts with the grieving heart such

98
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,520
that we are changed by it positively changed by it

99
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,839
our love is deepened by it

100
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:54,320
and spiritual practice is it's a form of growing up in a way it's

101
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:01,440
a form of growing up and growing up entails growing pains

102
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,200
you know sometimes like kids will get um like these diffuse pains in their legs

103
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:14,400
or something like okay no problem growing pains

104
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:22,640
and they're growing pains of spiritual maturation too for each of us

105
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:31,280
they're growing pains of evolving our sila evolving our ethical commitments

106
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,200
yeah of of actually growing up ethically

107
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,280
maya angelou said um do the best you can until you know better than when you know

108
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,640
better do better

109
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,838
we have to be willing to know

110
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,720
when you know better do better we have to be willing to know we have to be willing to come into a

111
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,839
deeper alignment with our existing values to

112
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:15,520
actually trace out those values what they mean for ourselves

113
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:23,838
in the world to come into a kind of alignment with the depth of our own heart

114
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:34,160
we're willing to be stretched to widen the circle of moral concern

115
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:40,800
and the movement of the heart in that that can feel a little like grief yeah

116
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,800
that circle widening you know

117
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,839
more and more of the world feels like

118
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,160
a worthy moral concern

119
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:06,560
and there are growing pains in associated with deepening compassion

120
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,760
yeah like when when love meets suffering there are kind of

121
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,040
two byproducts yeah grief

122
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:24,320
and compassion love meeting suffering

123
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:31,119
grief and compassion and the movement the movement of the the

124
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,400
kind of uh the clenched fist of grasping that gil often

125
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:42,880
speaks of the movement of the clenched fist of grasping to the open hand of

126
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,560
letting go that feels like something that movement feels like something

127
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,200
and it often feels like grief

128
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,119
not so long ago in teaching um

129
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:09,520
i sort of had this this insight arose and it was kind of like wow how did i not put this together before but

130
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:15,599
much of the fruit of practice unfolds through a process of grieving it feels

131
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,599
like something is being lost

132
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:28,200
and for sure something gained

133
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,480
now we don't have to make this some enormous

134
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:41,040
project my grieving project we're just willing to feel

135
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:47,040
willing to feel and i hold um

136
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:54,960
grief in a kind of reverential way you know it does not belong in the family of afflictive

137
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:02,560
emotion in my mind and i i can imagine a

138
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:11,839
a life that is free of agitation and anger and anxiety i could i don't

139
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:19,680
live it but i could imagine it i can imagine it i cannot imagine a life free of grieving

140
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:25,040
i don't even know exactly what that would be but it feels like it would be an

141
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:32,559
abdication of our love and care in some way

142
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:42,160
people are they're often grateful when they're given permission to grieve

143
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,760
to to know that this is part of the path this is the part of the path

144
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:54,000
amidst loss this is part of just the growing pains of the the evolution of

145
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:03,440
our compassion of our love the expansion of the scope of our moral concern

146
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,000
that the movements of letting go entails some

147
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,560
sense of grieving

148
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:21,280
now the the traditional phrase about the fruit of this practice is

149
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,560
um beyond you know

150
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:33,200
beyond grief sorrow lamentation and despair yeah we get beyond griefs our

151
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:38,640
lamentation and despair but

152
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:43,440
i want my buddha to grieve

153
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:53,280
maybe not maybe that is controversial but um

154
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,240
just for me i want my buddha to grieve

155
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,839
grief is um it's redeemed by different things we're certainly redeemed by art

156
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:13,599
but um but also by growing our love yeah

157
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:21,040
and a love that is uninformed by

158
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,960
grief is a naive love what we

159
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,560
what we find in a in in uh

160
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:40,079
grief is that um the ego is just all out of moves

161
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,520
do you know that feeling those moments where it's just like the

162
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:52,079
ego is all out of moves there's no energy for it to move in this way

163
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:59,119
or that way and there's some beauty and opportunity

164
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:06,319
in that itself and so we do this work um

165
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:12,100
for ourselves it's important for ourselves it's important for our society because the failure

166
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:18,000
[Music] to grieve the failure to let go

167
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,319
that spills out it spills out and

168
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:30,640
it the failure to grieve can distort our love you know

169
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:37,599
our love becomes too reticent or too controlling

170
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:44,240
and so yeah the courage to love is the willingness to grieve

171
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:50,880
and when we're willing the love deepens less reticent

172
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,359
less controlling

173
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:06,640
sometimes our hearts fully enlightened beings are described as being consummate in shame

174
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:12,160
consummate and shame and what's being alluded to is hiri and otapa and the

175
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:17,520
shame around moral transgression around causing horror consummate in shame i'm

176
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,520
always struck by that translation

177
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,720
i wonder maybe it's possible

178
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:35,960
to be consummate in grief too

179
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:49,760
um it's possible i am pushing through solid rock

180
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:56,240
flint-like layers as the or lies alone

181
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:03,119
i am such a long way in i see no way through and no space

182
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:11,680
everything is close to my face and everything close to my face is stone

183
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:19,838
i don't have much knowledge yet in grief so this massive darkness makes me small

184
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:27,280
you be the master make yourself fierce break in

185
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:35,119
then your great transforming will happen to me and my great grief cry

186
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:38,160
will happen to you

187
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:50,640
for this for consideration it's good to

188
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:58,680
be able to talk about these things together

189
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,720
you
