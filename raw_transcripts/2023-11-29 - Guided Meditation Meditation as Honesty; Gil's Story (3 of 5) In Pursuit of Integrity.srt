1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,120
hello everyone and

2
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,640
welcome when I think about mindfulness practice I often think about something I

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:28,720
consider a synonym to mindfulness and um or an very important

4
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:37,520
element of it and that is honesty that honesty is mindfulness out

5
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,520
loud and of course we don't necessarily say everything that's going on in us out

6
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,079
loud but uh this idea that mindfulness involves an honesty to

7
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:58,320
oneself it's sometimes said that um you know it's not always so clear how much honesty we should provide

8
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,400
the world if it things can it can be hurtful for people to say things that

9
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,799
what we really think the the bride at the wedding asks

10
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:16,119
you what you think of her address and it's better not to say exactly what you

11
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:21,240
think and um so the

12
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:28,880
um um but the in Buddhism it said it's never okay to lie to oneself never what

13
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:37,000
one should always be honest to oneself so the Mind mindfulness is a self honesty we sit down to and to be honest

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:44,040
about what's happening for ourselves here and now and

15
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:49,079
uh some people will practice what's called mental noting as part of

16
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,159
mindfulness practice and that's kind of saying to oneself what it is that's

17
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,840
happening in the moment but that's an opportunity for that Honesty oh I'm feel

18
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:07,119
feeling agitated that's what's happening or I'm troubled that's what's happening or you know that I'm spinning

19
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:13,200
out and whatever it might be

20
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,760
and and with that uh honesty with a moment of

21
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,160
mindfulness it isn't that that's the end of the story just note what's happening

22
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,720
and then go on to not the next thing there's the art of mindfulness or this kind of awareness practice

23
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,599
is to stay present after we clearly know

24
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:42,200
something we note something or we it doesn't have to be verbal or in thoughts

25
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:51,000
it could be a silent knowing but we clearly know something oh this is what's happening as if it's a a statement of

26
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,760
Truth it could be as simple as I'm I'm exhaling oh this is an

27
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:02,159
exhale and then after that clarity this is an

28
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:10,400
exhale then stay and like almost like the the that Clarity opens the door for

29
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,480
you to feel the breeze coming in from outside

30
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:21,720
or if the breeze arising out of the practice stay present and what happens

31
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,080
in the wake of that Clarity it's like you you're opening yourself up to feel

32
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:33,879
okay what's here now don't be a hurry so one way to do this in fact is with the

33
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:41,000
breathing is to recognize for example the exhale oh this is an

34
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:48,680
exhale and then be available to feel what arises in the wake of that and that

35
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:56,200
might be the inhale or it might be the inhale is little bit uh constricted so you

36
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:02,120
recognize oh constricted in breath now what happened in the wake of recognizing

37
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,480
that like Rec the recognition is a clearing of the space now to feel what

38
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:13,200
follows it might be the exhale but it might also be something

39
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,560
happens with the constriction it opens it softens it somehow is held in a

40
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:27,160
different way just by the honesty so to think of mindfulness practice as a practice of

41
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:34,880
honesty where we're being being with what is and in that recognition of what is

42
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,160
being a little bit more open to feel it more fully or be with the present more

43
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,960
in the wake of that Clarity and then we do it again and

44
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,479
again so again with the breathing it could be kind of oh this is an exhale

45
00:04:52,479 --> 00:05:00,240
this is how the exhale is and then open and you might feel the inh ale but

46
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:08,360
maybe it doesn't have the same qualitative knowing or recognition or

47
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,560
about the inhale it's just felt intimately in a different way in the

48
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:20,319
wake of that Clarity and then again with the exhale no oh this is an exhale this is how it

49
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:28,560
is it's smooth it's long it's it's a settling in and now what's next and the

50
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,880
next moment doesn't have to be known in the same way it can be

51
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,639
felt what happens in the wake of it and then a moment of knowing and feeling

52
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:47,319
knowing and feeling honesty and deeper

53
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,198
recognition so assuming a meditation

54
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:00,919
posture lowering your gaze and if it's comfortable closing

55
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:03,199
your

56
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:13,560
eyes and just as you are recognizing how you are now in the

57
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:21,080
most obvious way it doesn't matter so much for the

58
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:28,400
purpose of practice how you are now what matters is the honesty of recognizing

59
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:36,960
it recognizing and then being open to sense

60
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:44,240
and feel what follows for just a few moments and then

61
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,638
do it

62
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,639
again the clear recognition and then to feel or sense

63
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:08,919
what follows means that we're not caught up in the stories the

64
00:07:08,919 --> 00:07:16,319
ideas of what's happening but we're

65
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:23,039
here for a deeper intimacy with

66
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:36,000
oneself taking a few breaths to

67
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,840
relax settle

68
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
in

69
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
for

70
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:07,600
and then settling into your breathing feeling the inhale and

71
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
exhales

72
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:54,640
taking a moment to recognize how you are a truth

73
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:04,399
telling and letting that recognition being an opening to feel the body more fully in how you

74
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,720
are maybe feeling how breathing

75
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:17,480
is as you may have as you have just made a truth statement about

76
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
yourself

77
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959

for

93
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,679
practicing honesty of how you are right

94
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,880
now and then following that honest

95
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:59,640
recognition feel and sense what follows

96
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:07,760
how it is in your body as you return to

97
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
breathing

98
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

99
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880

for

104
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:03,039
for and then as we come to the end of this

105
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:11,480
sitting to [Music] consider how it's possible to Center

106
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:17,039
oneself in the middle of self

107
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,960
honesty if we clearly recognize how we are what's happening for

108
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:29,600
US settle into that or stand in the middle of it

109
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:39,520
and with that as a foundation being available to feel sense

110
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,039
know the world around us to have a

111
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:52,159
deeper sensitivity to the

112
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:59,840
world because honesty puts us in deeper touch with with

113
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:07,919
ourselves the more we're in touch with ourselves the more we can be in touch

114
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,278
with the

115
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:26,720
world staying centered in an honest connection to

116
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,640
oneself and then gazing out upon the people in

117
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:39,000
our lives people will encounter

118
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:47,960
today the world around us and gazing upon them

119
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,159
kindly with generosity with [Music]

120
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:59,519
care with good will

121
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,679
may all people realize the

122
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:10,480
potential for being at peace with

123
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,960
themselves may all beings realize their

124
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,158
potential for abiding in a peaceful

125
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:33,960
heart May all beings realize their

126
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:40,519
capacity to be safe to themselves for

127
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:51,518
themselves may all beings be [Music] free of the attachments the

128
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,840
and in doing so may they genuinely be

129
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:15,399
happy maybe may they have experience of safety that's inner and

130
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:24,840
outer may they experience peace in themselves and a peace around

131
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,320
them and may they be free

132
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
within and may they experience freedom in the world in which they

133
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:48,200
walk may all beings be touched by our well-wishing and our

134
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:04,200
friendship [Music]

135
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,359
thank [Music]

136
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
you

137
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,760
so hello and I continue now the third part of

138
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:10,440
my story with Buddhist practice and I had been introduced to

139
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:18,480
Zen practice and was very attracted to it and then I went uh back to Norway in

140
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:26,039
order to kind of kind of come to terms with what my

141
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:34,039
relationship was to my my home country I hadn't lived there for many years growing up but had gone back

142
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:40,720
frequently so I made it back and I had various Adventures I worked uh that fall

143
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:47,519
in um I think it was a fall of 74 uh on the docks in the town of city

144
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:53,039
of Bergen a dock worker mostly loading and unloading small cargo

145
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:58,480
boats and um and uh

146
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:05,960
I had a wonderful disc discover you know there were very little Buddhists that I in Norway but there was one famous I

147
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:12,440
don't know how famous he was my girlfriend at the time knew about him because he lived near where she grew up

148
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,559
uh a Buddhist hermit high up in the mountains in the snow in the coldest part of

149
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:25,480
Norway and um it was I went to visited him for two weeks in the middle of January and and kind of climbed the

150
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:33,480
mountain it's he would lived in a small cabin but it was uh probably the closest thing in my life of following

151
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:41,679
the the kind of U cartoon idea of going into the EMAs to find a high up in the

152
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:48,679
cave to find a wise person and um so I've SP two weeks with him and and that

153
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:55,679
was kind of fascinating um spent the morning skiing in the High Country by myself in the afternoons having long

154
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,159
conversations with him and then um but the important thing that

155
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:07,880
happened there in Norway was that I stayed for a year and um uh the

156
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:14,600
following six months I lived on a small farm in southern Norway with a wonderful

157
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:21,840
couple who um took me in and included me and their family like their family life

158
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,600
their their uh farming life and uh I love the life there I loved getting up

159
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:37,679
in the morning caring for the cows and the farm and it was just a lovely lifestyle for me and um so much so that

160
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:45,200
I kind of decided I wanted to be a farmer in Norway and but in the course of that

161
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,679
time my friends left for a week and U on vacation with me taking care of the farm

162
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:57,600
and the cows and it was the first time in my life that I had been alone uh for

163
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:03,960
that length of time I didn't the only person I saw for that week was the mail carrier who came walking up the road

164
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,000
kind of at a at a distance and I could see him down the road our the farm was

165
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,878
at the end of a kind of dirt road and and

166
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,040
um and otherwise I didn't see anyone and what happened in the course of that week

167
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:26,358
uh I wasn't meditating I don't think I was just kind of living the life alone but the daily life became kind of a

168
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:33,240
heightened meditation it kind of heightened awareness and without the social contact and just being alone I

169
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:38,440
became acutely aware of my surroundings everything started to Sparkle everything

170
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:44,520
seemed to be bright brighter than usual and I just kind of delight in how beautiful everything was and also I

171
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:50,398
became more acutely aware of even my thoughts that I ever have before and they had kind of a sparkle I don't know

172
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:57,400
if they were particularly good thoughts but it just everything had a Clarity the sense of awareness became very

173
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:03,200
present moment very clear and it felt so satisfying to be alive and to be

174
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,520
there it was kind of like I later I felt that was kind of like on a Meditation Retreat without

175
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,400
meditating and um and when my friends came back that sense of uh Clarity and

176
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:21,760
peace went away and and I felt the loss of that and

177
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,640
I didn't decide to become a Hermit myself but rather I then now had a quest

178
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:33,920
and the quest was uh I worded how can I be alone uh with others how can I have

179
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,920
this intimacy this peace this Clarity this kind of sense of being awake um

180
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,760
with other people um and so that became kind of the spiritual Quest the question

181
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:52,359
that I had that I started to explore and think about the other thing that happened on that farm was I did start at some point

182
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:58,599
meditating every day every morning before going to breakfast but it very quickly became clear that going to

183
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:05,640
breakfast kind of feeling very peaceful and calm not feeling needing to say anything and and just being present in a

184
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:12,440
relaxed Silent Way didn't work for the friendship with a couple the farmers um

185
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,480
that somehow it was awkward to be there this new way that I knew how to be uh

186
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:23,240
with um where they expected kind of the old Gil to be there to interact in a usual normal way at

187
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:29,560
breakfast and I decided that I either had to um stop meditating or I had to

188
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:35,160
lose my friends so I start decided to stop meditating until the duration of that

189
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:42,200
time living there I also decided that I wanted to become a small farmer in Norway but to do that in Norway you had

190
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:47,960
to um go to vacational school to be trained to be a farmer only then could you buy a

191
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:53,119
farm and I decided that um that uh I

192
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,640
only had two more years to get a a degree from the University of California

193
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,800
and if I went to the University of California at Davis which is one of the Premier agricultural schools in the

194
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:09,200
world I would fulfill the requirement for buying a farm in Norway and I would

195
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:15,119
also uh have such a good training wouldn't just be vocational school that if at some point in the future of my

196
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:21,000
life I wanted to do something else with that uh degree that I could do that also

197
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,119
I wanted to be back close to San Francisco zent Center and Davis was about I don't know an hour an hour and a

198
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:32,599
half Drive from San Francisco so I came back uh to go to uh

199
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:39,119
school at UC Davis to finish up there and uh to get a degree in

200
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,680
Agronomy and which is what I did but when I got there I began immediately to

201
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:51,440
get uh start meditating twice a day in the same schedule kind of that they did at the San Francisco Zen Center which

202
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:58,920
was two periods I think it was uh I think it was the same I did two periods of 40 minute Zen meditation one in the

203
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,200
morning one before going to bed but never on Sunday because at the San Francisco Zen Center they never

204
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:10,680
meditated on Sunday it was like their day off so I figured that was the way to do it and there was a small Cien group

205
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:15,880
in Davis and I went to them twice a week Tuesday and Thursday evenings and sat with

206
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:24,800
them and it was really clear that I started meditating that fall when I started col returned to college because

207
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:31,920
um I was uh uh um I was suffering part of it I was very lonely part of it were

208
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:39,079
other issues that I was dealing with and it uh the primary reason to start meditating regularly was I thought that

209
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:45,560
the meditation would help me deal with my suffering my anxiety my loneliness my

210
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:53,520
all kinds of things that I felt and um so I started meditating every day and um and then this very

211
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:59,640
strange thing happened after some months and for me and that was that uh the kind

212
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:05,680
of uh surface suffering that I was trying to address it kind of faded away maybe through the meditation maybe

213
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:13,400
because I got busy with school and I had some friends there but also um kind of faded away but I noticed that uh so the

214
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:19,640
reason for why I was meditating disappeared but I still meditated and I

215
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:25,880
found that really strange that I would do met continue this twice a day meditation without the reason I had

216
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:32,560
before and I had no other reasons to do it I could I could kind of come up with that I'm kind of a rational person and

217
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,000
so I wanted to have reasons for why I do things and I found it really strange

218
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,280
that I kept meditating with no reason like this is what I did and and so I

219
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:50,200
kept doing it and wondering why am I doing this and um and so then I came to

220
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:55,800
um at some point I came to a realization understanding that I was meditating for

221
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,880
the same reason reason that maybe a dancer dances or an artist paints or

222
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,680
musician plays the musical instrument for me uh the meditation was a way of

223
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:14,760
was a form of self-expression almost like an artistic expression and that um and that it was a

224
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:21,440
very deep way of expressing something that was I didn't even know was there something deep inside that I could

225
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:28,040
characterize by peace or calm or kind of a sense of aliveness that felt such such

226
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:34,720
goodness in it like I was more alive in meditation than in any other time in my life it just felt so

227
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:41,680
right and the the the word the key word that I used to characterize how I felt

228
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:47,079
was integrity and it I didn't have a sense that the word integrity was connected to

229
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:54,480
ethics so it wasn't ethical Integrity um maybe it was closer to a sense of wholeness so Integrity being

230
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:01,000
one being full like all of me was there and that integrity was real was then the

231
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,599
the the became then the purpose for meditation to experience that Integrity

232
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:13,119
so it wasn't some big goal for enlightenment in the future but it was really to sit down and be in that

233
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:20,280
integrity and that wholeness and that expressivity of of the meditation

234
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:27,480
itself and um and I didn't luckily I didn't have any sense to idea I didn't know much about meditation so I wasn't

235
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:34,040
burdened by the idea that I was supposed to stop thinking so my thinking Minds kind of continued but there was this

236
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:40,599
deeper Wellspring of something happening there and then um uh and then at some

237
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:46,440
point during those two years at Davis um I had this uh uh

238
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,640
idea uh why do I feel this Integrity only in my

239
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:58,520
meditation uh it's the same mind in meditation as outside of medit meditation why can't I have the same

240
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:06,079
Integrity outside and now my quest became um uh how can I extend this

241
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:13,400
Integrity or live with this Integrity in my daily life and outside of meditation I continued meditating but

242
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,440
now the meditation had a second purpose and that is it's set the stage it give

243
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:25,160
me the familiarity to some way of being I want to discover how do you be this way in daily life as

244
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:32,800
well so when I graduated from um Davis then um I didn't go back to Norway

245
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,359
to become a a farmer um by this time I'd been going to Zen Center throughout

246
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:44,839
those two years in Davis and going down there to practice there and do dayong Retreats and other

247
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:51,359
things and uh so then um when I finished I decided I would move closer to Zen Center to practice

248
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:58,559
there and um and uh but part of the reason I went there was that when I went

249
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:04,319
visiting to a Zen Center uh this remarkable thing happened was that um

250
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,119
when I would talk to this especially the more seniors and practitioners um they were mirrors for

251
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:16,040
myself I saw myself better I saw that I was playing social games like I was

252
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:22,960
trying to impress people I was trying to show them what a great person I was or I had had an image of myself I wanted to

253
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:29,079
replicate so they would see me through that idea I have who I should be all kinds of things kind of social games

254
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:34,440
that I I was kind of got got away with my my friends my friends actually did

255
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:40,839
the same we kind of expected it of each other maybe and we just kind of merrily went along but uh there at Zen Center

256
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:45,960
there was no response to that those games and and because there was no

257
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:52,800
response to the senior practitioners there and their uh I didn't feel like they were cold I just felt like of

258
00:43:52,800 --> 00:44:00,680
course they're not going to respond to something like that and so I saw myself much better and I said this is really

259
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:06,800
good this idea of trying to bring that Integrity into my daily life to live with people who are going to mirror me

260
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:14,079
this way will really be a big help so when I moved to Zen Center I moved first I lived in in the rental department near

261
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:21,000
the San Francisco Zen Center I um that was the motivation was not to meditate

262
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,280
more but to uh find it a better way to integrate what I was experiencing ing

263
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,559
meditation into my daily life as a consequence of that I meditated even

264
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:39,839
more because Zen Center you know go there and meditate more with them and um and so that was the

265
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:48,440
beginning of uh kind of being a a deeper end student I'll just mention one last thing

266
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:53,680
that I um I lived in the neighborhood of Zen

267
00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:01,079
Center for about six s s eight months and uh and then I uh went and did

268
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:08,160
a week-long retreat at their Farm the green g uh Z Center which I hadn't visited before I don't think and it

269
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:15,200
hadn't really been in my mind and I discovered a farm and I said wow this would allows me to bring

270
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:20,480
together the things I love my farming and Zen practice so I think in April of

271
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,160
uh 1989 1979 I moved to greul to live live

272
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:32,760
there and practice there and that was my beginning of the residential kind of monastic

273
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:39,599
life so um and they'll continue with that tomorrow thank

274
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,760
you
