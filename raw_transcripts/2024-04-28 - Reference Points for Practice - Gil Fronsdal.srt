1
00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:04,360
so

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,960
um so what I'd like to talk about today is a little bit of a expansion of what I

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:21,279
talked about Wednesday morning here uh the half day sitting we have and uh the simple way is that

4
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,519
simple kind of introduction is that it has to do with a as we practice we

5
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:33,160
develop a a growing set of reference points that guide us in our

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:40,719
practice and uh so we don't not no longer Guided by instructions from other people from the text but rather from

7
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:48,840
ourselves because we have developed these reference points of something really good really healthy and wholesome

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:55,480
that's is available to us we know for ourselves and so we know what's how to

9
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,039
go forward we know how to find our way and what is useful and healthy to do

10
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,680
and it's phenomenal to have that shift from you know taking Buddhism as an external reference point for your life

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:16,119
versus having internalized something that you know for yourself as a reference so that is the basic kind of

12
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:23,240
premise for this today's talk and in the course of it um maybe also it'll give

13
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,400
you a sense of why in mindfulness meditation we put a tremendous

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,119
importance on mindful of the present moment sometimes the present moment is I

15
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:41,759
I feel gets over idealized in our scene and um and

16
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,479
like it's all good just to be in the present moment but it's a uh the purpose of being in the present moment has a

17
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:52,600
particular purpose particular reason if you understand that it's a lot easier to

18
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,399
do this practice um and um I remember many years

19
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,079
ago there was a Calvin in Hobs cartoon kind of cartoon that uh had something

20
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:11,520
like um Calvin and Hobbs were climbing a tree looked like a glorious day like today and they were climbing a tree and

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,760
Calvin says oh something some paraphrase it something like oh it's so great just

22
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:23,879
to be in the present moment enjoying life this way sounds like perfect you know

23
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:29,319
mindfulness and hob says to Kelvin yes but you're supposed to be at school

24
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:31,840
right now

25
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:43,159
and um and that was kind of a little bit my problem taking my kids to school when they were in preschool in kindergarten

26
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:49,319
is I was in the present moment taking them to school but as we walked out of our front door to get to the car they

27
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:55,560
were really in the present moment with the flowers outside our house the little sticks that were there and like you know

28
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,840
they were really present and there was a conflict between two present moment

29
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,280
moments so the present

30
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,959
moment so um somehow I want to also do as

31
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:22,040
introduction to this idea of the references for practice that a really big um turning

32
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:28,720
point for me in my involvement with Buddhism was uh the day I decided to

33
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,799
devote my life to Buddhist practice in the form and that took the form back then being a Zen student to deciding I

34
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:42,720
wanted to be ordained as a Zen monastic and being a monastic for me was not being becoming a teacher but rather

35
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,360
dedicating my whole life to to uh to Buddhist practice and but the reason

36
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:58,040
that I had for it was that um um for this was that

37
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,360
um uh I wanted to be able to address the suffering of this

38
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,480
world and I wanted to be able to address it at its root and back then when I was younger

39
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:16,840
the root I felt was um the attachment we have to self and I knew in my limited

40
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:23,040
experience of life I knew of nothing else that touched that root than Buddhist

41
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:30,880
practice and uh I had already been wanting to address some of the suffering of the world I went to uh um you know

42
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,039
very different than what I'm doing now my undergraduate degree is in Agronomy

43
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:41,120
so agriculture I was going to be a farmer and but in the course of that

44
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:46,520
education uh I became familiar with uh the

45
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:52,479
growing potential catastrophe around the world of soil erosion and it seemed like

46
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:59,160
very few people knew about it back then it was the nuclear proliferation was the big thing that people were focusing on

47
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:07,000
uh trying to stop but uh my thing was I was so so aware soral erosion was a huge

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,520
issue and and um so at some point I decided I actually applied to go to

49
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:19,319
graduate school to study uh soil science so that I could go around the world and address the issues of soil

50
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:25,759
erosion and uh so that was kind of the contrast you know between deciding to become Buddhist and and then deciding

51
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,800
not to be a soil scientist and soil conservationist

52
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,039
and um and the rationale that I gave myself for that was that no matter how

53
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,759
successful I was at uh conserving soil protecting the world from soil erosion

54
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:49,800
which is a necessary thing to do I don't want to diminish the importance of it um I would all it would never really touch

55
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:55,000
the heart the depth of people's suffering the existential suffering of

56
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,960
people and I would feel like I would always have a dissatisfaction I always feel like like it's not quite enough and

57
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,639
I didn't know if I'd be effective as in being a Buddhist monastic and helping

58
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,800
the suffering of the world but I Le at least I felt like I'd had the satisfaction that I was trying to

59
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,919
address it at its roots and um and that seemed like a

60
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:25,360
big you know big task and I I didn't quite know what the roots were I had an

61
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,280
intuition this was more like an intuition that was operating based on a number of years of having

62
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:37,199
practiced and um I had some sense it had to do with attachment and as I said attachment to

63
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,960
self and those kind of uh to say that maybe it's kind of idealistic it's kind of like maybe recognized as being some

64
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,919
of the grand ideas of what Buddhism is about and um and um and maybe that's

65
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,280
good or maybe not um but now we get to this topic of

66
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:01,080
the reference and the references for practice maybe aren't so

67
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:07,680
Grand maybe are not so amazingly idealistic maybe they're very ordinary

68
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,160
in some ways and so they're not idealistic it doesn't look like wow you

69
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:18,240
know this is the end of suffering once in for all and end of attachment to self

70
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:27,680
wow that would be fantastic Enlightenment thank you and uh and and so you know maybe I

71
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,080
get criticized either way if I do the idealistic thing then the people who want to be practical say well

72
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,560
that's you know that does nothing to do with my life but the people who you know if I really ordinary with it and simple

73
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:48,159
then the people who say well that Buddhism is much more than that so um it's hard to be a Buddhist

74
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:56,319
teacher so um but they reference points so uh uh this has been in my mind

75
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:04,720
a little bit because uh in the last few weeks I had an occasion where I think on the same day I had

76
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:11,639
um I had a desire for a particular Buddha statue that I had seen number of

77
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:18,319
them about and and um and I you know I kind of wanted to

78
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:24,080
have one and not not for myself but I wanted to have one to get one and maybe give it to someplace when I came back to

79
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:29,199
United States I was in Japan and oddly enough that in the small little towns I

80
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:36,680
was in the only place that was liable to find this particular statue was at a

81
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:45,880
um um I think they were called bosi in Japanese um a gravestone

82
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:51,519
store so I had to try to go to the to the various people try to explain to

83
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,720
them grav stor St why would a Westerner in Japan want to go to grave

84
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,959
stores and I had a hard time getting them to understand stand and cuz my Japanese was pretty

85
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:08,279
poor but I finally finally found one and went there and so it was a bit of a

86
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:15,640
project right to get look to look for where I can buy this kind of thing and then uh later in the day there

87
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:22,959
was an occasion for an uh to consider it was evoked in me a feeling of generosity

88
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:28,720
of giving something to someone and um and then those two states

89
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,800
of mine contrasted each other and I saw that in some ways when my mind had the

90
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,959
desire for this Buddha statue my mind got narrower got smaller got a little

91
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:46,040
bit more contracted you know focusing on getting this thing but when the

92
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:52,519
generosity with was there my mind became more open more relaxed more at ease and

93
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:58,279
that difference uh is a reference point which of those mind States is more

94
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:03,399
useful which of the Mind States would I like to live in which of the Mind states do I

95
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:10,120
want to allow for what I do with my mind is a really important thing what I do with my heart

96
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:16,800
is a really important thing and which of those do I want to predominate and and and come become the predominant

97
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,839
characteristic of my mind and I know there are times in my life where the predominant characteristic of my mind

98
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:29,440
has been attachment clinging caught up in greed or desires for something there

99
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,320
are times prominant characteristic has been resentment or anger hostility and

100
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,639
that's what's caught up sometimes it's been fear or anxiety for things that

101
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:46,440
probably I didn't need to be afraid of but uh I was still kind of you know the

102
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:54,519
contraction of the Mind the narrowing of the Mind the tightening of the Mind the stress on the mind that certain states

103
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:59,880
have and there was a time in my life where I didn't know I was having this I didn't know there was any

104
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:06,399
you know it was just so ordinary to have a stressful mind a contracted mind a caught up mind churning away with its

105
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,399
concerns I just thought well that's this is mean I didn't even think about it I just this was human

106
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,560
life as I started to practice more and more uh an alternative became clearer

107
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:24,519
and clearer and the alternative was a mind which had no contraction a heart

108
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:30,959
that was not caught up in something and and uh and had the level of Peace in

109
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:37,079
it or calm or openness or Joy or Delight all these things are kind of

110
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:43,240
characteristics of an alternative kind of mind and they don't all happen at once but the different times you feel

111
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:48,720
different ones and they set up a contrast between something that in

112
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,839
Buddhism is considered unhelpful to have and something which is

113
00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:02,959
helpful something which is wholesome and versus something that's UNH wholesome and that becomes a personal reference

114
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,959
point that becomes the the uh sometimes it feels

115
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:15,160
sematic so it's really personal and direct and immediate sometimes it feels more

116
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,199
mental sometimes it feels more something of part of our emotional life we really

117
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:26,160
feel there's an alternative and um so even coming down here today I walked down here and I was

118
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,720
going to talk think about this talk a little bit and walk down and um and as I started thinking

119
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,880
about it um I could see that my mind was doing that stressful thing it was starting to get narrow and focused on it

120
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:46,680
and concerned about it and and maybe even like what are people going to think and how am I going to say it right so

121
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:54,240
that no one attacks me you know I mean you know something like that it just little bit like it was

122
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,279
happening and um and I knew better I know an alternative the alternative is

123
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:07,760
close at hand so for me there's a reference point that uh is uh kind of ever

124
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,079
presentes that is guiding me and so as I was have my mind my thinking mind was

125
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:19,360
going down that track I knew immediately this is not interesting I don't want to

126
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,760
live my life that way this is not the the world I want to live in that is

127
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,120
caught up in thoughts and concerns this way and fears or

128
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,399
preoccupations and uh so at you know in this context it was relatively easy just

129
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:41,199
to let it go and um and so it wasn't that I stop

130
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:46,480
thinking about the talk or what how to talk about what to talk about here but

131
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,759
rather now my thinking the quality of my thinking had changed and now it was like having a

132
00:13:52,759 --> 00:14:00,839
friend in my mind that was you know was it was a friendly mind there was this friendly light kind kind of nice way of

133
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:08,880
thinking about what was going on that um that uh you know it was you know was

134
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:15,880
just nice to have that friend there whereas before that mind was me I guess both are me but I wouldn't have

135
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,320
characterized it as my friend sometimes you know the

136
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:27,800
Taskmaster sometimes you all kinds of you know other characteristics so we have these

137
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:35,120
reference points and and in these in these that I've described today for myself I think they were more mental

138
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:42,399
though in mental they were also sematic because the ways in which the Mind contracts uh and gets tight and caught

139
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:49,120
up I feel a little bit as tension around my forehead around my eyes kind of behind my forehead in the area of the

140
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,320
front of the brain you know I don't know exactly what's going on there but that's what it feels like and I think of the

141
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:01,199
thinking muscle that I can relax other times it's clearly embodied

142
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:09,240
sometimes the reference point has been my belly and I have sometimes I have a soft belly and then oh it's all tight in

143
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:16,959
a knot it used to be when I before I started practicing it was always tight in a knot and then took years for that

144
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:23,040
knotted stomach to relax and relax and relax and luckily I was not in a hurry

145
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:30,240
because if I had been and thought that was a terrible person for having a tense stomach I it would have made more tense

146
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,079
and um so but it took years of of my practice to slowly relax that belly and

147
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,800
that made a world a difference and now I have this reference point that's kind of there oh there it is maybe I should take

148
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:48,240
a look I'm my belly tensed up what just happened as opposed to the Belly tensed

149
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:56,920
Up and this means there's something dangerous and I need to fight or flight you know uh I've

150
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:02,800
learned not to kind of let these these these changes in the body and mind

151
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:09,600
and heart Drive the ship I've learned to recognize them and

152
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,800
say is this what I want to do what's really going on here let's take a deeper look what's happening here and usually

153
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:21,759
the tense stomach is not useful there sometimes I have what could be considered a tense stomach when I'm

154
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,000
having fun and playing and that seems okay then I'll put up with

155
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,560
it then it's a fine thing to have but uh there are times when it's really an indication that something is off and so

156
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:40,680
I have that reference point I have had that reference point with my hands my hands will tighten up in certain C

157
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:47,279
circumstance or I start you of playing too much with my fingers you know because I'm afraid or something and

158
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:53,800
that's a reference point the shoulders are a reference point I've had a reference point in my

159
00:16:53,800 --> 00:17:00,079
chest where I I feel like my my heart is closed now it was a time in my life I

160
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:07,918
think I was about 15 where someone um teased me about something or or or

161
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:15,959
belittled me about something I just just said and um I immediately some I I uh

162
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:21,959
there was a decision like it wasn't even me it wasn't it was like something deeper somatic that you know something I

163
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:29,520
could feel something Clos in my heart and I said said I'm never going to show that to anyone again

164
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:37,240
and it took years for that to open up and relax and and and be willing to share a more vulnerable place of who I

165
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:44,440
was and so we have these uh things that we do that don't serve us very well and

166
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:50,640
as we practice they begin to relax begin to Open begin to soften and things quiet

167
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,120
down and the important thing that as this happens is to is to take that

168
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,760
seriously not as something get attached to but rather something that can help

169
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:08,840
you read yourself become a self Whisperer I love the this phrase you

170
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,880
know they used to be first to started by horse whis Whispers but now it's like now it's everything and this is the

171
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:18,919
first time I've ever heard someone say self- whisper but uh but I think it's

172
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:24,360
something profound this idea you know to have that kind of sensitivity to yourself that you really know yourself

173
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:31,039
deeply and well that a lot of people don't actually know themselves they might know very well what they're

174
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,159
thinking about what they believe and what they will fight for and but they

175
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:43,360
haven't really tuned into the deeper operating systems the deeper movements that's going on and and often people are

176
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:51,400
living uh you know one-dimensional life in a sense and as we practice there more dimensions of who we are reveal itself

177
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:58,360
and what I'm pointing to today is that uh that what reveals itself is that we have this place where the mind can be

178
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:04,360
relized and at ease the heart can be at ease the body can be at ease in some way

179
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:09,480
or other versus it can get stressed the

180
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:15,520
mind the body feels stressed and sometimes the stress is kind of kind of

181
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,400
comes from outside but sometimes it's clearly we're contributing it to it and

182
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:28,720
um and so we're kind of working with this what's stressful and not stressful in fact uh there's a one of the main

183
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,880
main translators of the Buddhist teachings to English is a monk in San Diego named Tanis raiku who comes here

184
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:41,080
sometimes teachers and um and uh the the

185
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:46,120
common English translation of the Buddhist word Dua is

186
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,400
suffering and suffering is such a big thing you know it's like what do we mean

187
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:58,200
even and but this monk Tanis he translates duka as as stress and

188
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:05,080
immediately I think it gives a kind of almost sematic reference point a clear reference point and uh and he's actually

189
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:10,120
said that um I think he's I think he's the one who said it that um getting

190
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:16,520
married is one of the most stressful things people do now you wouldn't say you know you

191
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:24,360
know getting married is is the biggest suffering people have I mean especially at the at the

192
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:30,200
wedding that doesn't that's not quite right but appreciate that it's stressful

193
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:36,760
that's understandable and so that word stress is really makes it much more applicable this teachings and this

194
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:43,120
practice that if we always like I do maybe too much emphasize suffering suffering suffering in the end of it

195
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,600
stress in the end of it and maybe this so this idea of stress and the absence

196
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:55,840
of it becomes a powerful reference point and so this is not idealistic idealistic

197
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,120
ideology it's not necessarily Buddhist you know we have to believe Buddhist

198
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:07,880
teachings this becomes uh a time when we learn to believe ourselves we believe and see for

199
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,039
ourselves what works and doesn't work and even if the Buddha came here today

200
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:20,840
and he walked in and he said hey but hey you should stop listening to this guy you know everything I said was wrong

201
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:27,080
you know you just you go find something else to do because I completely had it wrong and and uh you just forget all

202
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,640
this Buddhist stuff and you would say well that's maybe nice for you but uh I

203
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:40,320
know for myself I've discovered I have this personal reference point I know the difference between um getting stressed

204
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,960
and not stressed if you wanted to use the big word uh getting involved in

205
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:51,400
suffering and not getting entangled with it getting attached and not being

206
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:58,200
attached that is so clear and so obvious that that's going to guide my life because I know one is better than the

207
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:05,640
other one is healthier than the other one provides uh much more wisdom one

208
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:13,240
provides much more kindness and support one represents the world I want to live in

209
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:21,039
the other represents the world I don't want to live in and just imagine least some of you who are not

210
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,520
Saints and just imagine that at that situation a time when you were at your

211
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:33,279
worst you know caught up in anger and resentments and attach attachments and greed or

212
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:39,600
whatever it might have been your thing just imagine multiplying that by

213
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:46,400
the billions of people we have on this planet that that is what's that's the

214
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,480
illness that's spread across the land and everyone has it that's not the world

215
00:22:52,480 --> 00:23:01,440
we want to live in is there an alternative can we live in a world of Peace can we live in a world where uh uh

216
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,600
everyone comes from that possibility in the mind where the mind is free where

217
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:12,080
the mind is free of its clinging attachment hates resentful

218
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:18,279
resentments and I think that as we live our social life having these two references are

219
00:23:18,279 --> 00:23:24,000
invaluable because as we get more and more sensitive and that's part of the purpose of mindfulness is to be in the

220
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,039
present moment and then be sensitive to the

221
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:36,039
distinction between that stress and not stress being open or closed in unhealthy

222
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:41,159
ways and at some point we can feel

223
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:48,679
that towards people some people for whatever reason we feel some fear or some

224
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:54,400
judgments or some little bit hostility or some like negative

225
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:02,840
orientation but as we as we see the mind go that way we feel the impact it has on us and we

226
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:08,679
say this is not good for me am diminishing myself to have to to get

227
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:13,840
involved in that kind of idation and thoughts and judgments and ideas and

228
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:19,080
because we have this reference point in the alternative then we're much less likely

229
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,960
to get caught in our bias and our prejudice and our judgments and hostilities of

230
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,200
people and I've had an occasion recently where

231
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:36,320
um someone said something critical of me and um I could

232
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:43,679
feel kind of the Mind begin to Mo go in the direction of being defensive or critical back or how could you say

233
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,960
that just just but it was so brief because of this reference point that I

234
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:54,600
live with all the time in this these circumstances immediately I just dropped

235
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:00,320
it and turned to the person and said can you tell me

236
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:06,120
anymore what do you mean and um and then I just said

237
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:12,799
okay and that was enough you know in that circumstance and um and how

238
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:19,120
different would it been if I responded through the old way of you know defensive and criticalness and how could

239
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:25,240
you and let me tell you and you know and when you did

240
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:32,279
it and it wasn't a moralistic thing it it wasn't like the ethical thing is to be kind the ethical thing is to avoid

241
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:37,720
being judgmental it say deeper it goes down to the

242
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,919
roots it was is it stressful for me or not

243
00:25:42,919 --> 00:25:50,159
stressful is there a better way to engage the world and people and uh and this is what I kind of

244
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:56,840
mean by The Roots really get down to the roots of where things are where we can feel and sense and know for

245
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:02,559
ourselves and so so it can be very ordinary in ordinary circumstances this

246
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,840
reference point it doesn't seem Grand and religious and you know ultimately

247
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:14,320
spiritual but it's but to live this way and fill your life with this way is from

248
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:21,880
a Buddhist point of view a spiritual life and it changes the world we live in changes ourselves and it has a huge

249
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,200
impact uh on ourselves over time and um

250
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,679
and eventually Maybe does lead to Enlightenment wouldn't that be nice the

251
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:39,679
small little steps that lead all the way so those are my thoughts today and

252
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,320
um we have 15 minutes before the PTL uh what I'd like to

253
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:51,279
suggest is that um is partly to so that those of you who want to stay or not

254
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:57,880
stay uh you can just kind of be friendly with each other a little bit and maybe and so to go into groups of three or so

255
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:03,679
or four for and have a little conversation about uh What uh what was

256
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,039
useful about my talk what touched you in some

257
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,480
way so that was wonderful to sit here and

258
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,600
listen to you talk I both feel delightful to hear your

259
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:37,159
seeming enjoying enjoyment in talking about this whatever you talking about and um and I also stood out to me

260
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:43,760
that that was a lot of energy after sitting and meditating before and so maybe it's good to come back and be a

261
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,720
little bit quiet for a few minutes as we uh kind of to kind of settle things a little

262
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,399
bit and um but you know as I said I offer to if anyone has any questions it

263
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,960
doesn't have to be a question it could be a test monial or something that's important for you to say at this point

264
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:09,039
but if any questions about the talk or clarification or anything that anybody like to

265
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:24,480
say so um I have a question uh because you were talking about mind you said I

266
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,720
have two voices in my mind one of them is got so caught up with these um

267
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:35,159
thoughts that's um you know bringing uh a lot of pain and suffering the other

268
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:41,880
Mind Is Telling Me uh peace and joy and then a lot of um good things and you

269
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,159
said um they both are me but I prefer the other one um when you said that you

270
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:54,720
kind of hit me because um I read a lot of books I I know a lot of teachings um they are trying to teach us

271
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,880
I am not my body I am not my mind and I know when you said that I'm like oh no

272
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:08,640
so they both the both voice are actually me so I am actually my mind so so so I find

273
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:15,919
that's kind of you know there's a conflict there so can can you please explain that a little bit Yeah so the

274
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,480
first thing I'll say is not directly to your question so it isn't so much for

275
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:28,799
the way I didn't say this but it isn't is not so much that there's two sides of my mind you know but rather there's a

276
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:38,600
surface mind and a deeper mind it's that's more how I feel it and the surface mind is very much uh fueled by

277
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:44,799
uh attachments attachment to self attachment to outcomes all kinds of things that you have and For Better or

278
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:50,519
For Worse the analogy I have for this kind of mind is uh squeezing a

279
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:55,840
toothpaste uh uh tube if you take the lid off the t uh

280
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:01,880
the the off the the tube and then squeeze it uh it'll just keep coming out

281
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:09,279
and out and out for a long time you can brush it away as much as you want but it'll keep coming out and so the surface mind is a little

282
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:16,240
bit like that if we're always tense and squeezing it with our whatever attachments stress we have that thing

283
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:24,039
that surface mind is going to keep doing all kinds of nonsense this doesn't want to stop but

284
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:29,960
if that's if we stop squeezing it that allows the deeper mind to show itself

285
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:36,720
and that's the one that tends to be wiser or friendlier or more peaceful and and I think of it as being much more

286
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:43,519
holistic as long as the mind is Serv as mind is being squeezed by attachments by clinging by resistance and all of Might

287
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:50,240
me uh it doesn't have access to the full full wholeness of who we are and uh this

288
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,760
deeper mind is more full so that's the way of not answering your question

289
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:03,279
directly now I'll try to do it more directly um the um yes there's a very strong

290
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:10,639
teaching in Buddhism about you know the body is not self the mind is not self all things is not self and uh but it's

291
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:16,039
best to take those teachings in context as opposed to take them as being this is

292
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:23,279
like you can never say anything about you know this is not me um the in

293
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:28,559
ordinary language uh it's fine to say you know

294
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:34,000
you know these you know the the these are my shoes you know and um you know

295
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,760
it's it's okay you don't have to be attached to your shoes and someone has taking your shoes you say well those are my

296
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:44,919
shoes and and they say well I prefer them to

297
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:53,279
mine and then you might say okay please take them there's a story with um uh many

298
00:31:53,279 --> 00:32:00,559
years ago 20 years ago I don't know when it was um I knew I have a friend who's a Monk and and he had one of the first but

299
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:07,159
look like the pre smartphone smartphones it was like a really intelligent phone

300
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:15,120
maybe it wasn't a smartphone yet but it was like the the next best thing to it and before they came out and um and I

301
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,760
looked at him and I said what do you you you have vows of of

302
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:28,519
poverty you're a renunciant why do you have that this and he said um well it

303
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:34,240
was a gift and I felt it was okay to receive the gift if someone ever asked

304
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,799
me for it I would give it to them so I was

305
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,440
tempted so so the um so to say these are my

306
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:53,279
shoes or you know this is my hair you know you go to a you know someone's going to cut your hair I'm like my wife

307
00:32:53,279 --> 00:33:00,360
cuts my hair and I say will you cut my hair today it's my hair I don't say you know like cut someone's

308
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:06,679
here then should be cut someone's here today and or will

309
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:14,039
you cut this hair here and it's not me but it's you know the hair is growing here and life gets so complicated if you

310
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:19,480
tried to avoid the word my it can be done innocently and it actually points

311
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:25,760
to something essential something important and what Buddhism is about is not having

312
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:32,240
any fixed idea of self there's no fixed self no fixed identity

313
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,519
that's where the problem is the fixed idea so but it but it's actually

314
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:44,279
healthier to kind of have an ordinary simple idea so when I said there's two sides of me you know these two ways of

315
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:52,240
thinking uh I wasn't essentializing them I wasn't making the fixed idea this is who I am there's probably other sources

316
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:58,279
of thinking in me as well and um and I'm not assuming that it's you know and and

317
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:03,760
because it's in my own mind or in the mind that's in this body and

318
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,000
mind then this body and mind is the place for taking responsibility for it

319
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,800
especially when it's causing harm and sometimes it's really helpful to avoid

320
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:21,960
the these pronouns mine me I it's really helpful it frees something up and

321
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:28,720
sometimes it's actually more responsible to say it like if you're going to apologize to someone uh you don't say

322
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:35,039
you know well sorry you know or something or there is apology

323
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,320
here they would like to hear you say you know I'm sorry then it carries more

324
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,800
weight so we have to be fluid and how we use this so that was a long

325
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,040
answer did I address it well enough oh yeah I think so I think so what I

326
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:57,720
understanding what I'm understanding is it's kind of like saying okay these two

327
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:05,280
thoughts they are both in me they kind of in my mind you know but they are not like my mind or me you know but they are

328
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,720
both they are existing there in me uh that's what I'm understanding from what

329
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:17,800
you just exp yeah the these exist and something else that exists in here is now going to use it as a

330
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:27,720
reference and as practice goes deeper there are times when the Fe there's no feeling even that there is a self a

331
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:33,400
Central Locus or of self that's part of it it feels much more intuitive or

332
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:40,800
relaxed or and uh it's a whole different way of operating in the world that's radically different than how most people

333
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,119
operate when they have coagulated around sub notion of self there's a there's a

334
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:54,640
locust that our attachments some total of our attachments and clinging can give us a a very sometimes very powerful

335
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:01,160
sometimes very meaningful sense of some kind of kind of Center that this is who I am but if we

336
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:07,040
bring our attention to that Center we feel it's a little bit of tension a little bit of pressure and what's

337
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:13,960
fascinating to do when you're quiet and still enough in the mind to bring the mindfulness to that locus of tension

338
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:21,920
that we associate with this is who I am and see it dissolve like a like the

339
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:29,039
de on a hot day what what then

340
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:36,520
so okay so should we do one more and then it's time for the putl and I'll stay here if you want to ask questions

341
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,560
afterwards as we go

342
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:54,560
but okay hello um this is only my second time here so hi welcome um I have an

343
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:02,640
array of questions but I don't know the specific thing I'm trying to ask well hopefully your way of answering will

344
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:09,880
also go inside but um something I've been struggling with is like I feel like

345
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:17,000
I've been having an existential crisis for like a really really long time and

346
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,800
now in my I think something that you said today really resonated with me that

347
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,440
um was when you said it's really hard to be a Buddhist teacher

348
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:37,760
and when you were saying like should I be a soil scientist or dedicate my life

349
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:46,640
to this and that you were saying that the world billions of us they're suffering everywhere and I think now

350
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:52,880
that I'm older in my 30s I finally realized that I want to heal the

351
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,200
suffering somehow but I don't know how exactly

352
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,960
um and it feels like I'm alone in that like everyone around me doesn't care the

353
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,960
way that I care um yes so so long story short is like

354
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:16,560
I'm I'm wondering how did you decide to do

355
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:25,960
something The Road Less paved I guess and also how did you maintain your cool and

356
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:34,599
be like tell me more okay when I feel like within me it's just so much fire at

357
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:44,200
sometimes and then sometimes there's water like it's just so hard to maintain my cool yes and when I

358
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:49,599
just want to yeah I just want to make a

359
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:56,280
difference but it feels like it's impossible in this Society right now thank you for your question I love I

360
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:03,680
love do you understand what I'm saying I I love your question your concern and I I take it's very I I'm delighted that

361
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,839
you're struggling with this this is a really good thing to struggle with what you're doing this I wish more people

362
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:16,480
struggled this way so I know it's hard for you but this is to my in my heart this is really good

363
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,640
that you're questioning looking at this and so thank you for that so that's my

364
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:26,800
you know affirmation of you and what you're up up against please find your

365
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:33,599
way with it so that's my my heartfelt response um and now maybe a little bit

366
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,839
more direct to your question um when I said you know it's hard to be

367
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:44,000
a Buddhist teacher it's hard to be a human being you know so it's just it is

368
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,160
hard in finding our way that you want to that you care enough for the suffering

369
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:57,839
of the world to want to find some way to respond is fantastic and the response has to be right for who you are

370
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:03,800
and uh you know and so every different people respond different ways and some

371
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:11,480
people have certain gifts that they have that that's really the way they do it someone who plays music um might find

372
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,880
it's through music that I do this and I know some someone who was a hospital chaplain who went to visit people who

373
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,599
were suffering in the hospital actually visit children and he was a musician and he'd

374
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:30,119
go along with his guitar and and uh would sing to the kids and so he he was using his music to really help kids who

375
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:37,800
were in terrible states of distress so everyone has to find their own way and uh and and so you have to

376
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:43,960
know yourself well enough to know what your way is but or or you have to experiment go around and look at

377
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:50,720
different options and um and maybe try to find some people who share your

378
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:57,480
orientation so you said you don't have anybody around you who share what you're about so I would encourage you to try

379
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,839
find someone and um and then um and then

380
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:09,240
if you would like to talk to me at some point about you know exploring this territory more personally I could be

381
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:15,720
available for that awesome thank you okay great so

382
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:21,520
thank you all for being here and so I guess now the potluck is probably ready

383
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:27,640
and I don't know how it works out there but but uh it'll be there and it's a wonderful chance to continue your

384
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:34,160
conversations get to know each other and thank you all for being here
