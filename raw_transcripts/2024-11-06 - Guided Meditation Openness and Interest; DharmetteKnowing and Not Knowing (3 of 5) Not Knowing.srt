1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:07,838
to be with all of you again in in this virtual saana so welcome

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:14,400
everyone for many of us here it might be particularly prominent in our minds and

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:22,160
hearts that things in the world are not the way we want to be with all of you again in in this spiritual

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:29,039
saana I had to mute myself um that things in the world are

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,280
not the way we want today and it can be helpful to remember

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:40,879
the teaching that if we're only free when things are the way we want them they

7
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:47,640
we're not really free it can call in us to practice more

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:55,359
diligently to practice with even more care with more kindness and

9
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:01,480
compassion to not add any more suffering to this world

10
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:12,240
in my first few years of meditation you know I found that um it

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:20,439
would take me a while for my mind to settle especially if there's a lot going on in my life um days like

12
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:25,680
today uh so I accepted the idea that the first 15 minutes the mind would be

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:33,079
restless and that usually after about 15 minutes it would calm I relaxed about it but also what I

14
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:38,799
didn't realize is that I was ignoring those first 15 minutes as not worthy of

15
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,799
my careful attention I had a

16
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:52,840
preconception uh that there wasn't anything worthwhile to pay attention to in those first 15 minutes so why bother

17
00:01:52,840 --> 00:02:00,399
with the effort but I eventually came to realize the truth of the teaching that if we're

18
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,719
only free when things are the way we want them then we're not really

19
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:12,319
free so as my own practice continued to mature I realized that those same

20
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,120
hindrances that showed up in the first 15 minutes the restlessness the

21
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,920
aversion the monkey mind it would show up at other times but maybe it was

22
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,200
easier to see them when the mind was a little calmer so I started treating those 50 15

23
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,200
minutes those first 15 minutes with a lot of respect and with careful

24
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:43,879
attention and with care they eventually transformed into a valuable part of my

25
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:51,440
practice the first minute as valuable as the last even if it wasn't

26
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:58,200
pleasant even if it was filled with sorrow even with a heavy

27
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:05,319
heart that the moment moment of impatience are as valuable as the moments of

28
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:10,879
calm and that whatever suffering might arise now it's even more valuable to

29
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:18,159
recognize it to allow it to move to allow it to move through

30
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:24,840
us and then the heart's natural response to suffering is

31
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,760
compassion can we meet our own suffering with

32
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:44,159
compassion when we have a preconception an expectation we don't tend to look

33
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,879
carefully we see the moment through the filters of our preconceived

34
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:55,319
ideas of our projections we think we know and when we

35
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:02,439
think we know we miss a lot we close ourselves off as we're not

36
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:09,400
curious about what we already know and as we bring an attitude of not

37
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:15,120
knowing of openness we can see things

38
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,400
newly each breath is new each physical sensation is

39
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,960
new each thought or emotion is new

40
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,720
so let's

41
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,560
sit taking a comfortable and alert

42
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,800
posture and softly closing your eyes taking a little time to settle into

43
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,800
your meditation posture

44
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,280
allowing yourself to be centered on your

45
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:14,240
body contemplating the body

46
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,120
ENT clearly knowing

47
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:27,360
mindful free from desires and discontent in regard to the

48
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,960
world putting aide hi any ideas or concerns or

49
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:40,639
judgments not pushing them away just putting them aside for

50
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,440
now arriving here in this

51
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,919
body allowing yourself to experience the moment

52
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,400
newly not knowing what the next moment will

53
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
bring letting the sensations be simple as if you're experiencing them

54
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,520
for the first time every moment new

55
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,720
and from within this body you might become aware of your

56
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:51,319
breathing in the Simplicity of this moment this

57
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:58,520
inhale this exhale knowing you're breathing

58
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:08,000
in knowing you're breathing out you might take a few long slow deep

59
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,879
breaths connecting more fully with your

60
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:19,120
body with a full in breath you might feel the chest expand the shoulders

61
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,879
lift the rib cage open and exhaling it all settles back

62
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:32,400
in relaxing relaxing into

63
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,319
it relaxing deeper into the

64
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:45,039
exhales like a wave rising and falling back into the

65
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:51,440
ocean rising and

66
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:03,918
falling allowing your breath to return to your natural Rhythm however it may

67
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,919
be and as we breathe you can be aware that the air outside of

68
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:41,159
her body is the same air inside of her body there's no separation between

69
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:47,760
inside and outside the air extends out far beyond

70
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,880
our bodies and extends deep inside our bodies to every single

71
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:06,079
cell inside outside side flowing back and forth connected by

72
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
breathing e

73
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,120
resting in the moment recognizing ing whatever appears

74
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:38,519
and whatever goes away maybe it's the in breath and out

75
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:43,440
breath or Sensations arise and

76
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:51,000
disappear thoughts or emotions allow them to come and

77
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,279
go seeing them clearly allowing them to be however they

78
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:02,399
are seeing them

79
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,560
freshly not interpreting not

80
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:15,240
evaluating not assuming not adding anything to the

81
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,320
experience seeing them in

82
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240

opening your eyes

for

121
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:36,480
there's a DST parable about a poor Chinese

122
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,840
farmer a long time ago a poor Chinese farmer lost a

123
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,760
horse and all the neighbors came around and said what terrible

124
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:55,360
luck the farmer responded maybe shortly after the horse returned

125
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,919
but when it did it brought another horse with him and all the neighbors came around and said well isn't that

126
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:09,240
lucky to which the farmer replied maybe the next day the farmer's son was

127
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:16,840
trying to tame the new horse and fell breaking his leg and all the neighbors came around

128
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:24,320
and said oh well that's terrible you'll have no one to help you farm and the farmer

129
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:31,720
replied maybe the next day the conscription officers came

130
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:37,200
around uh to conscript people into the army and they rejected his son because

131
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,480
he had a broken leg again all the neighbors came around and said oh isn't that

132
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:50,039
lucky and again he said maybe in

133
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:55,360
China when something bad happens people will say remember the old man who lost

134
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:02,840
his horse the old man understood the not knowing

135
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:09,799
mind to not knowing can be seen as an attitude of being

136
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:16,600
open Suzuki roshi said in The Beginner's mind there are many

137
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:24,360
possibilities in the expert's mind there are few to learn a new skill

138
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:30,840
easily is to be okay with not knowing when we think we know something already

139
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:35,960
what's there to learn we don't allow new

140
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:43,120
information not knowing can be an attitude of not being limited by what we

141
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:49,559
know not making conclusions and opinions prematurely staying

142
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:55,360
open there's room to learn room for new

143
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:03,000
possibilities holding what we know lightly it can bring an intimacy with

144
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,559
what we don't know and it can balanced Balan The Knowing with the not

145
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:16,638
knowing into an open mind a mind that's open and

146
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,480
interested we can see people newly not based on the

147
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,519
past was one of the a gift the teacher gave me once you know I had a practice

148
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,840
discussion on Retreat and I felt I gave a bad impression of myself I didn't

149
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:40,159
communicate well I sounded confused and so I came in next time you know and

150
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:47,159
apologizing for myself and he said oh don't be concerned I I always see whoever comes in here

151
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:53,919
newly and it was it was such a gift to be seen that way and it was so

152
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:59,000
sincere and so can we see people newly not based on the past

153
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:06,000
path can we see situations newly not based on our

154
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,158
projections and not hindered by resistance that it shouldn't be this

155
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:21,360
way but it's important to appreciate that we're not always able to

156
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:26,760
meet the challenging things that might arise and what the future will hold with

157
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:32,399
openness not knowing un certainty can feel

158
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:38,679
stressful it can give rise to fear to anger to

159
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:46,679
grief the future is unknown the AR is to meet the unknown no

160
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:51,880
matter how challenging with sincerity and

161
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:57,279
kindness and if there's suffering present within us or around us to hold

162
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,600
it with compassion and

163
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,720
kindness if there's fear you can see it intimately not

164
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:16,760
braced against it but allowing it to course through the body not feeding with ideas and not

165
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:22,560
pushing it away staying close to the physical sensations of the

166
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:30,040
fear and allowing it to move through us these moments of

167
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:37,280
mindfulness bring wholesome quality to the fear the fear moves through us in a

168
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:45,280
larger caring space as I said the future is

169
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,520
unknown but the unknown can also give rise to

170
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:56,280
inspiration if we're open and not lost in

171
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:01,079
projections you ways to respond can

172
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:08,359
arise several years ago now um when we first had to shelter in place because of

173
00:35:08,359 --> 00:35:15,119
Co you know we saw that as did we see it as bad luck but at

174
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:21,880
IMC with the openness of not knowing inspiration arose to begin teaching

175
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:28,359
online to begin teaching these online Retreats these this morning Sana such

176
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:34,680
good fortune right we can also think of the not

177
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:40,280
knowing mind of the great Explorer or the traveler going into an unknown

178
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:46,560
territory and the excitement and wonder that inspires them what will they learn

179
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,560
who will they meet it doesn't mean that they don't get caught in the river or uh

180
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,920
their canoe capsize and uh and meet unfriendly strangers at times times or

181
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:06,920
get sick but what will they learn what's

182
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:15,040
new and we can have both at the same time we can have both fear and

183
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:23,319
excitement or fear and inspiration I saw an interview of um a

184
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:28,880
world renowned climber free climber you know a free climber to me is the

185
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:35,280
scariest SP I can imagine you know they climb without ropes in one moment

186
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:43,960
without paying attention can be uh uh fatal they asked him aren't you afraid

187
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:52,359
and he said of course I'm afraid the fear keeps me safe but the fear didn't stop him it

188
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:58,160
didn't overwhelm him the focus of the climb the steady of

189
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:04,319
Mind allowed the absorption the concentration in the climb the fear was

190
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:07,920
just a guide that kept him

191
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,839
save about 50 years ago I was having a conversation with a

192
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:27,000
relative and the subject of hummingbirds came up he was convinced that hummingbirds

193
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,359
never landed into in their entire lives of course for me having seen them

194
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:40,440
land I knew otherwise and I told them so but he was dead sent on his

195
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:48,000
opinion had no doubt they understood correctly I knew they're known for being almost constantly active and spending

196
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,839
most of their time in the air but they still rest on a purge or sleep on

197
00:37:53,839 --> 00:38:01,200
one I felt frustrated I couldn't get through to him my heart contracted in Judgment of him I

198
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,319
felt separate from him disconnected and hummingbirds were

199
00:38:07,319 --> 00:38:14,640
completely inconsequential in my life at the time and yet my heart contracted over

200
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:21,680
something so inconsequential that was just a point of

201
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:29,520
view so how do we not cause harm to ourselves and others through our views

202
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:37,520
and opinions can we meet a difference of view without Contracting our

203
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:43,319
hearts to not cause harm to others or to

204
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:50,480
ourselves especially when we hold our view as being very

205
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:57,440
consequential can we hold our own understanding of the situation with

206
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,800
without attachment attachment to views and

207
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:10,560
opinions is a source of divisiveness between people an attitude of not knowing can

208
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:17,359
help us keep our hearts open with other people's opinions other ways of seeing

209
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:23,960
things maybe allowing for a deeper understanding for something new to

210
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:30,319
arise that doesn't mean we don't have convictions and work towards them but we

211
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:36,240
can we allow someone to have a view that is distasteful to us to be there without

212
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,800
pushing the person out of our

213
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:51,359
hearts suuki roshi said not knowing does not mean you don't

214
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:57,640
know it means not being limited by what we know

215
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,280
and we hold what we know lightly lightly enough that it might

216
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:09,839
change that we don't contract around to try to protect

217
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:15,480
it can we understand what we know and not cling to

218
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,800
it not knowing can mean that there's something to learn in the

219
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:29,160
situation it can allow for disagreement without Contracting the heart

220
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:41,839
and we be at ease with not knowing what the future will be not adding suffering Now by

221
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:49,119
projecting what the future will be what it will hold maybe at this moment things are

222
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:54,280
okay it doesn't mean we don't take action but it means that any action we

223
00:40:54,280 --> 00:41:00,560
take needs to rise out of wisdom instead

224
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:08,640
reactivity and remembering that the future is Never As We imagine as we

225
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,720
project we might get many General aspects right but not the

226
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:21,599
experience the me of 20 never imagined this me half a century later it didn't

227
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:29,200
come close maybe got that gray hair right that's about it

228
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:40,760
and when we contemplate the much larger context of the universe so much larger than our Earthly

229
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:48,640
concerns the study of the universe can reveal that no matter how much science

230
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,920
discovers the reality of what's unknown is so much

231
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:00,880
greater now we might view that with frustration or it might deeply Inspire us in our

232
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,880
spiritual life there's a concept about the

233
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:13,800
universe expressed by the Sue Indians of what they call the great

234
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:22,800
mystery the great mystery expresses itself through the universe in every human

235
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,480
animal tree and grain of sand

236
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:35,680
to not only surrender to something that isn't understood intellectually but to actually rejoice

237
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:43,040
in it can we rejoice in the great mystery can we stand at ease in the

238
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,680
great mystery and not knowing

239
00:42:57,960 --> 00:43:01,920
I'm going to read a poem by John

240
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:12,960
Bram there's something to be said for having nothing to say but I don't know what that is or

241
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:21,599
isn't just as there's something to be known about not knowing which I would tell you if I

242
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:29,640
could there must be something to be gained by losing a seed of Victory buried in every

243
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:34,279
failure or else I would not be

244
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,359
here clearly there's something to be desired about being Beyond

245
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:45,680
Desire as the sages never Tire of telling

246
00:43:46,359 --> 00:43:52,400
us and there's nothing more fulfilling than emptying yourself

247
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:58,520
out no ground beneath your feet nothing to hold on

248
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:08,359
to no handrail no belief only this bright self- sustaining

249
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:14,559
air and the falling that feels like

250
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,880
floating and may the benefits of her PR practice bring peace and kindness to

251
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,119
each one of us and to everyone we come in contact

252
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:42,920
with whether in person or through our words and may Ripple

253
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:50,760
outwards spreading peace and kindness to all living beings in this

254
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,440
world so thank you
