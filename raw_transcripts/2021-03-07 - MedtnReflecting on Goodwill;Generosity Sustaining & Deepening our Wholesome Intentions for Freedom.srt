from south africa my name is nolita to be specific i'm joining you from

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,440
johannesburg and it is evening here

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:23,840
so good morning good day good evening wherever you're joining us from

5
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:31,119
i really appreciate your presence here gives me an opportunity to

6
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,160
reflect on this practice and these teachings

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,840
aimed for our liberation

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,879
so we're starting with a guided practice so you can find

9
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:58,000
the posture that best supports you

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,039
just taking your time to find that posture

11
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:13,840
the intention is to be a lot awake and yet relaxed

12
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:40,960
bringing the attention to the body noticing how the body is welcoming this

13
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,240
body as it is

14
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,479
noticing the solidity of the body on the chair the cushion

15
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:09,280
spine is straight neck is long

16
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:17,360
the head is balanced at the top of the neck it's helpful

17
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,319
to tilt your chin towards the chest

18
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,239
it allows for an opening where the top of the neck meets with the

19
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:39,920
skull that allows for easy flow of energy

20
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,720
the hands rest the left

21
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,159
if you move your lower back just a little bit towards the belly

22
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,319
you will notice the lifting of the upper body

23
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,640
opening of the chest area

24
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:24,159
and shoulders easily relax without movement of the lower back

25
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:33,840
moving towards the belly

26
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:42,480
softening the face dropping the jaw

27
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:51,840
allows for release of tension enhancing a sense of relaxation

28
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,920
aware of the whole body release the body weight into the chill

29
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:11,040
the cushion and noticing the pressure

30
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,799
where the butt meets with the chair of the cushion

31
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:27,360
if you are on a chair notice the sensations in the soles of your feet

32
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,599
where your feet meet with earth

33
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,840
noticing the movement of the breath

34
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:57,840
resting your attention with the breath

35
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,680
taking your time to find a good posture

36
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:25,840
a bright and yet relaxed a way can alert

37
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:39,840
can be helpful at the beginning of your seating to take a few long deep breaths in

38
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:06,560
we're allowing the breath to return to its normal rhythm

39
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:14,720
we will use the breath as a place of anchoring attention

40
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:23,600
whenever the mind goes away gets lost in thought

41
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:35,840
when we're not as that we bring back the attention to rest on the breathing

42
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:23,599
noticing where the breath is most felt

43
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:35,360
could be other nostrils as you breathe in the coolness of the air

44
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:44,479
as you breathe out warm air

45
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,840
is experienced

46
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,319
or it could be with the expansion of the chest

47
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,319
and the contraction of the chest as you breathe in

48
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:10,840
and breathing out oh it's the rise and the fall of the

49
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:18,000
belly just take your time and see

50
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,280
of those three places where is breath most experienced

51
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:41,839
then let your attention rest away

52
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,399
mind will go away or to the future

53
00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:00,320
we don't make a problem out of that this practice is about returning

54
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,839
bring back the attention to the body

55
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:19,839
resting their tension and the breathing

56
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,839
can be helpful to make a soft mental

57
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,880
note that goes breathing in

58
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:46,880
breathing out breathing in

59
00:10:46,880 --> 00:11:01,839
printing out

60
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:18,160
as the mind settles here with a breath you can release

61
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:29,839
the mental motive

62
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:38,000
we continue to up the rest of this setting to bring the mind

63
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:53,839
back allow the mind to rest the breathing

64
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,320
noticing how the breath is

65
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,839
maybe long maybe short

66
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:34,880
maybe smooth it is staggered

67
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:42,800
deep shadow whichever way it is

68
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,839
that's just fine

69
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,839
as the mind settles

70
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,360
we open our awareness

71
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:45,839
to any predominant experience that is there

72
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:59,839
sounds maybe sensations

73
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:15,440
quotes and notice

74
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,040
what is here

75
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:41,839
one can always return the attention to rest the breathing

76
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,839
in a moment i'm going to add another dimension

77
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:55,839
to this kind of practice

78
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,279
where we reflect on the theme of good will

79
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,839
generosity

80
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,120
aim is enhancement for evolving

81
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:27,680
when we cultivate goodwill cultivate generosity

82
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:40,160
so i invite you to remember how it has felt like

83
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:51,839
for someone to be generous to you

84
00:16:52,399 --> 00:17:01,279
someone may have supported you in a way that just clicks in a positive

85
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,839
way for you

86
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:19,760
i'm just allowing the mind to linger on the actual feelings

87
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:25,199
how it has felt

88
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:33,840
to receive generosity from another

89
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,840
taking your time to be with the thought experience

90
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,919
staying with how it shows

91
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,320
allowing the body to relax with these

92
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:36,559
feelings to support this experience i invite you to bring to mind

93
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:43,840
someone who gladdens your heart

94
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:01,600
someone you're grateful to maybe respect

95
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:11,840
but your sense of respect brings joy to the heart

96
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:29,200
getting the feel of that cut feeling

97
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:39,840
joyful glad because of this person

98
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:58,000
adding to this experience i invite you to bring an image

99
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:07,840
of a good friend or a beloved pet

100
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,880
imagine this person or this pet giving you

101
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,840
full attention

102
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:35,600
get a sense of how it falls to be in a space like that

103
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,158
maybe there's a feeling of warmth

104
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:49,280
welcoming space a friendly space

105
00:20:49,280 --> 00:21:03,840
carrying space

106
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,320
allowing yourself to be with these

107
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,840
feelings

108
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:36,640
now invite you to imagine opening up the space

109
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:45,840
and sharing it with other people

113
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:27,840
i'm just noticing how it feels to do this

114
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:37,760
now you can release the images and focus

115
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:55,840
by bringing attention on how the body is just now

116
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,840
attentive to the body

117
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:36,200

137
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:04,159
and where the power of generosity is greatly appreciated and being introduced to buddhism and

138
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:10,560
living in a place where there aren't many buddhists felt like coming home for her nolitha is

thank you kevin i'm delighted to be here

142
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:40,638
um so the theme i've chosen for reflection

143
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:48,800
is generosity so under the theme of generosity

144
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:54,560
i'm going to talk about giving sharing

145
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,960
a key practices and buddhism in all buddhist traditions

146
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:10,000
called dana that's the pali word for giving i'll also

147
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,760
talk about training in ethics would have referred

148
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:24,320
to training in precepts as the great donor

149
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:34,400
it's another form of giving [Music] i'll also speak about relinquishment

150
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:41,920
letting go poly word for relinquishment is kaga

151
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,400
letting go is also a form of giving and lastly

152
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:56,320
i will talk about forgiveness forgiveness is a form of giving

153
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:05,520
when we give each other fearlessness when we forgive

154
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:17,520
so the cultivation of generosity is really the foundation

155
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,160
for training of the mind

156
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:31,920
it is the foundation for mindfulness and wisdom for liberation

157
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:42,320
so i noticed the words i'm using

158
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:52,640
giving and sharing precepts relinquishment forgiveness

159
00:36:52,720 --> 00:37:01,200
these words can bring up interesting experiences in the heart

160
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,839
you can bring up discomfort

161
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:16,800
i know for a long time for me the world's precepts and relinquishment

162
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:23,760
would bring a sense of terror to my heart

163
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:31,280
i don't know how it is like for you these words maybe you're well ahead in

164
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:38,000
this path these words bring joy to your heart

165
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,839
that's what they are aimed for actually to bring joy

166
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:53,760
so i'm going to start off with a story that for me highlights

167
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,839
the beauty and the grace of generosity

168
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:09,200
a friend of mine i teach with here in south africa moira shares a story about being in zambia

169
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:18,160
zambia in south africa share border so she says here she is in some village

170
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,920
in zambia driving on a ditcher road

171
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,200
the car starts to give her problems

172
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,320
she drives on and suddenly notices that there's this homestead

173
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:43,680
near the roadside and there are scrap cars

174
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,720
old cars in the yard and she decides to stop here

175
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:55,200
thinking this would be the kind of place that can give her help

176
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,839
in fixing her car at the homestead

177
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,960
she's welcomed by an old man

178
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,920
she notices children playing in the sand

179
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:21,280
and also notices signs of great poverty in this household

180
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:29,839
she mentions seeing a few chickens without any feathers

181
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:37,760
so she explains hannah hanid and the old man organizes all the boys

182
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:44,320
they look at the car kai is fixed and then about to leave moira offers

183
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:50,000
this old man some money he says no

184
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:58,880
he then offers some fruits in the car he says no and she says but it's for the

185
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,520
children he says no and then he says

186
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:12,240
if we can't help each other that would be really sad if we just cannot

187
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,200
just give how

188
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:25,838
for moira this was a new experience

189
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:33,599
and receiving this experience foreign is white person old man is black

190
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,839
and i'm mentioning the race here because i'm joining you from south africa

191
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:46,720
and uh issues of race are still a big issue

192
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:55,680
moira shares that from this experience she felt deeply connected

193
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:02,400
and she also mentions that she felt like she didn't deserve that connection

194
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:11,920
so acts of generosity allows for these benevolent connections

195
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,720
with each other

196
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:21,839
hmm

197
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:34,319
generosity acts of kindness giving sharing this is what the buddha

198
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:39,440
has to say about sharing

199
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:44,880
if beings knew as i know the results of giving and sharing

200
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,680
they would not eat without having given nor would the stain of selfishness

201
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:58,640
overcome their minds even if it were their last bites

202
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:05,680
their last mouth full they would not eat without having shared

203
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,640
if there was someone to receive their

204
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:17,839
gift hmm

205
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:26,560
so when growing up practice of generosity was truly a way of life

206
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:31,599
i remember that growing up in a more rural

207
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,000
countryside parts of south africa

208
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:44,720
always there would be an extra plate of food set aside in case

209
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:52,079
there's a visitor or someone passing by

210
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:55,520
who can be offered a meal

211
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:04,319
i also remember that there was no time that we ever were a nuclear family

212
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:12,880
only our home was always a home to many cousins aunts uncles

213
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:19,440
sometimes i didn't i wouldn't even know how we are related to that person who was there to share our home

214
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:26,960
for as much time as she needed or he needed to be there

215
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:33,920
my parents were doing what their own parents did so i don't know a lot about this kind of

216
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,119
giving i must admit though moving to the city

217
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:46,400
getting ebonized plus less and less of this kind of generosity

218
00:43:52,160 --> 00:44:00,559
so i know generosity personally but i also know generosity at a country level

219
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:09,110
the world often wonders how did south africa manage a bloodless transition

220
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:14,400
[Music] from apartheid south africa to

221
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:21,200
a black led government many think it was because of nelson

222
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:30,960
mandela [Music] rightly so he did play a critical role

223
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:39,040
in what the world thought of as the miracle

224
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:48,000
a miracle that gave hope to the whole world

225
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:55,760
to us it wasn't a miracle to what to us it was this was

226
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,400
so because the african culture is underpinned by the principle

227
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,359
of ubuntu i am because we are

228
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:14,880
if i cause you harm i'm causing harm to

229
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:23,839
myself steve biko who is the leader was the

230
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:32,160
leader of black consciousness movement a hero a struggle hero who died in the hands

231
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:36,078
of apartheid south africa

232
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:44,160
is speaking to this principle when he says our contribution to the world would not

233
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:50,800
be in technology our contribution is africa to the world

234
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,079
will be to give the world a humane face

235
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,119
the face of humanness

236
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:15,839
so to be fully human is about being generous giving sharing and forgiving

237
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:23,280
so in the country i also noticed that we're really great at coming together at times of crisis

238
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:31,119
and this has been the case during this crisis of covet 19.

239
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:43,680
i have a few stories to share with you about these acts of kindness shown

240
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:50,079
by people not only here but really everywhere this is what people have done they've

241
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:56,319
remembered what it is to be fully human by giving support in any way that they

242
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:02,160
can we know medical care and related

243
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:10,400
professions would even risk their lives to save lives so i have a friend who's

244
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,920
an academic so she had a task of collating these

245
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:21,200
stories local stories of kindness during this period of covet

246
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:27,920
and she's actually in the process of compiling a book titled archives of

247
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,359
kindness so i am going to read to you two of these stories

248
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:40,240
actually what she did was to ask a number of us to choose your five

249
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:46,480
top stories so this is this is the two of the five

250
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:53,280
that i'm going to read to you

251
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,640
candace in cape town in french mooc rights

252
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:05,599
i've been living in friendship now for 12 years we are a small village but as with most

253
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:11,119
places in south africa we have a polarized society

254
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:16,800
of the wealthy and the poor some of whom live in the township

255
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:23,200
setting for a small village we also have a hugely successful

256
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:28,960
and vibrant hospitality sector which means we have many hardworking people in

257
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:36,720
all levels of an industry that with some of the hardest hits during this lockdown

258
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:42,240
over the years i've been amazed at how many people have done extraordinary things in their private

259
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:49,200
capacity because it's the right thing to do like building schools and sports centers

260
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:56,079
for poorer communities but during this crisis we reached a whole new level so many

261
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:03,200
people contributed and did awesome things coordinating relief turning restaurants

262
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:09,440
into food kitchens checking it out that everyone was okay in all different parts

263
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,160
of the town

264
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,520
a lady from um the township diploma in johannesburg

265
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:26,319
writes my landlady is an angel she has given us a free stay for

266
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:31,440
two months all five of her tenants she's unemployed

267
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,720
and depends on her rant but she's seen how we're all struggling

268
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:42,319
in the yard she says we will share whatever food we find

269
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:49,760
she is now trying to find someone to donate nephews for my son i'm embarrassed she's an old lady

270
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:57,359
during this time she has the strength i'm lurking she is my hero and a mom to all of us

271
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:04,160
may god give me strength to pay it forward one day these are joyful stories this is what

272
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:10,318
happens to the heart when there is generosity

273
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:18,000
so the buddha in teaching when teaching to new people to the

274
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:27,119
practices he would always or mostly start off by teaching about generosity

275
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:33,440
he would then proceed and teach about precepts

276
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:43,359
only then when he has the sense that these teachings of generosity and training in ethics

277
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:50,000
have landed will he then introduce meditation

278
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:59,280
ajahn chah my teachers the thai forest master

279
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:06,160
when this theme says with virtue as a basis for everything you do your mind will

280
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:13,040
become kind clear and quiet meditation will grow easily

281
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:19,920
in this environment so through the practice of generosity

282
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:26,559
virtue we can recover the connection with ourselves with each other

283
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:34,720
and with mother nature through generosity we recover the

284
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:40,800
hearts potential for sensitivity

285
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:45,839
the parts potential for opening

286
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:58,640
who lives in zimbabwe also zimbabwe shares a border with south africa

287
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:07,760
baba is known as an international peacemaker he is a guardian to our center here

288
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:12,880
founded by kitsaran tamizara zamagiri

289
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:21,280
when they speak about baba kitty talk of him as a contemporary of agent

290
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:27,920
chair baba says

291
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:34,319
we have been disconnected to ourselves disconnected from each other because we

292
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:38,319
are disconnected from nature

293
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:46,480
and because we are disconnected from nature

294
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:51,520
we take whatever

295
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,400
we want from nature without giving back

296
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:03,680
as the world we are in an ecological crisis because we do not see ourselves as part

297
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:10,480
of nature we abuse nature for our greed

298
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:17,440
and our great is endless through this we lose this heart

299
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:24,400
sensitivity the intuitive intelligence

300
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:32,319
it is said that we are the only species that destroys its own habitat

301
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:43,838
with lost connection with the goodness of the heart

302
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:56,720
and i think we're paying a price for this

303
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:03,280
from each other disconnects it from ourselves we feel separate

304
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:11,520
we create us and them in mutton bubba's language

305
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:18,480
we create i it relationships it is through the cultivation of these

306
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:26,880
practices of generosity that we can recover what

307
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:35,520
matumbruba calls the i and thou relationship the i and we

308
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:44,079
relationship with the we identity we can remember the

309
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:49,440
truth that we all suffer and we all want happiness

310
00:54:49,440 --> 00:55:07,839
our sense of conscience and concern can be reawakened

311
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:14,400
i'm going to talk about generosity as relinquishment

312
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:23,920
relinquishment is a form of letting go in letting go

313
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:34,319
we let go of greed craving which the buddha

314
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:42,079
has identified as the cause of our suffering the second noble truth that we suffer

315
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:51,519
because of craving and the task in this path of freedom for liberation

316
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:59,839
is to let go of the craving as practices of giving

317
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:17,838
can support us help us to let go

318
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:24,720
craving has no end it feeds itself

319
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:31,359
it is true understanding it is through these practices

320
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:36,318
that we can release craving

321
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:41,760
what underpins cravings is ignorance

322
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:48,079
confusion see how we can look for what

323
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:53,520
is this heart's longing in wrong places

324
00:56:55,359 --> 00:57:02,240
when we follow sense objects to satisfy our craving that has no

325
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:12,559
end desire feeds itself we look for fulfillment incense

326
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:21,599
experience since experience changes what is pleasant becomes unpleasant

327
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:32,319
there's a story i um delight at in buddhism about this

328
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:37,839
confusion of looking for fulfillment in the wrong places

329
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:44,559
it's the story of nasruddin nasruddin is a sufi mystic

330
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:53,920
he's sitting outside in a ruby and spice shop and he's eating these hot chilies

331
00:57:53,920 --> 00:58:02,480
his his wife has a watering a friend comes by and says what are you doing

332
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:11,200
eating these hotels with your eyes watering and you're sweating

333
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,400
astrudin says i'm looking for the sweet one

334
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:22,160
this is what we do you and i right we

335
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:28,880
look for the freedom which is the longing of the heart

336
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:37,838
heart lungs

337
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:51,838
freedom freedom from creates hatred and delusion

338
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:00,720
lastly i'm going to talk about

339
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,838
forgiveness as a form of giving

340
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:14,160
how is forgiveness a form of giving when we forgive we

341
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:19,838
give fearlessness

342
00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:30,640
when people know that we hold no grudges we hold no ill will when we have been

343
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:37,920
their victims it gives relief it gives happiness

344
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:51,119
i know personally about this kind of relief that comes from

345
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:59,200
one who i have harmed holds no ill will

346
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,240
towards me

347
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:14,400
i can't remember what here it was but it was the year that nelson mandela died i'm not sure whether

348
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,838
that was 2011

349
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:29,839
i leave home and i notice the feeling of anxiety

350
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:35,920
and between leaving home and

351
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:43,680
maybe it kind of mean even 10 minutes after i left home

352
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:50,240
my phone rings i'm driving and i answer the phone within no time

353
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:56,240
between that moment of answering the phone while striving

354
01:00:56,240 --> 01:01:00,480
i drove into a biker

355
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:10,480
get out of the car in shock

356
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:16,880
and this man is on the floor

357
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,359
is on the ground

358
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:28,079
i can tell he's in great pain

359
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:36,079
i go near him he is screaming at me

360
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:41,760
you wear it on your phone

361
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:48,720
and then in no time your other people

362
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:55,040
who stopped to check what was going on

363
01:01:55,119 --> 01:02:01,520
and i remember just at one point i had a feeling that was running across

364
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:08,319
my heart of fear in that moment i was thinking oh this is

365
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:16,720
going to become ratio i look around people here are black it's

366
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:25,119
me in the security guard i offer to take the man to the hospital

367
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:30,000
he refuses he still screaming at me

368
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:39,038
an older white couple decides to take him to the nearest hospital

369
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,359
i wait for the police

370
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:53,359
wait and wait then i'll be so i decide to go to the

371
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:58,799
hospital i get to casualty

372
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:03,839
he is with medical staff

373
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:12,720
i sit across him he's laying down on a bed i take a chain and sit right across him

374
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:18,640
when i maintain eye contact but ignores me

375
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:24,319
and then at some point he says you don't need to be here

376
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:32,079
you can go where you need to go my response to him is i want to be here

377
01:03:32,079 --> 01:03:35,839
and i'm really sorry

378
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:45,839
um so i continue to just sit here

379
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:54,799
and then at some point i decide i have to go and report this to the police

380
01:03:54,799 --> 01:04:02,079
as i'm about to leave he says to me tell them that you own a cell phone

381
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:08,799
i'm thinking oh interesting i go and report the case i come back to

382
01:04:08,799 --> 01:04:16,000
the hospital and he has been discharged

383
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:27,839
and apparently he suffered really serious injuries a broken collar bone and a crushed ankle

384
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:35,599
now what do i do i decide to go to a grocery store

385
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:43,440
i buy food i buy flowers i buy bottle of red wine

386
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:50,799
i organize a script for strong pain killers go to the pharmacy i

387
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:58,160
get the medication oh only at that point that i realized oh

388
01:04:58,160 --> 01:05:05,839
i must have decided that i'm going to visit him at his house he had given me an idea

389
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:13,599
where he lives so i drive there and then i get to the boom gates

390
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,200
and

391
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:25,440
they call him lolita is here

392
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:32,559
allows me in and as i'm parking my car he comes out one of

393
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:41,440
his arms is on a sling and with his free um he hugs me

394
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:46,880
and places a kiss on my cheek and then i smile at lena and say

395
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:52,160
are we good he smiles

396
01:05:52,960 --> 01:06:00,079
people come and visit and he introduces me as the one who drove into him people are not sure how

397
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:06,640
to respond to this cut lord long story short

398
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:14,079
uh about two weeks after that incident it was mr mandela's funeral

399
01:06:14,079 --> 01:06:19,280
so i i invited him i've been checking on him daily just to find out how he

400
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:25,280
is most of that first week he was in terrible pain

401
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:33,838
couldn't even work and this is a man who works for himself

402
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:40,480
so with mr mandela's funeral and uh we're watching it um i'm watching

403
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:45,680
it with him from my home over a meal we talk about south africa

404
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:49,200
we talk about racism

405
01:06:54,799 --> 01:07:00,400
and from that experience i

406
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:07,440
had an experience of what is it to

407
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:18,078
be forgiven i know what it is to be offered

408
01:07:26,839 --> 01:07:34,240
fearlessness at a country level we know the power of

409
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:40,839
forgiveness through the truth and reconciliation

410
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:47,359
commission where

411
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:56,320
people would committed serious atrocities of harm

412
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:02,078
[Music] police soldiers

413
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:09,760
the law enforcement officials had during the

414
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:24,480
period just before the first elections in south africa 1994

415
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:31,758
post the elections trc was instituted and

416
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:38,960
those perpetrators were brought together

417
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,000
with their victims

418
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:49,359
had to tell the victims

419
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:57,920
all they had done under the apartheid government

420
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:06,238
intense intense experience where the

421
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:14,080
victim and the perpetrator are given an opportunity to find

422
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:21,838
each other through forgiveness

423
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:34,960
i think that particular practices gave hope not only

424
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:39,278
to us as south africans but to the world

425
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:50,080
i mean our problems are not over as a country by any long short much as we are led by

426
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:58,640
black government we are stuck in material structures

427
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:03,840
of white supremacy

428
01:10:04,719 --> 01:10:09,600
the poor in south africa has a black face

429
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:19,920
and there is corruption ongoing corruption

430
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:28,840
but i know my south africans we do come together during times of

431
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:31,840
crisis

432
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:47,600
so generosity is a foundation for practice of mindfulness and wisdom

433
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:54,719
for liberation i think we all have opportunities

434
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:01,840
especially in these times the world is on fire

435
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:13,840
in many ways we have opportunity to cultivate generosity

436
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:25,280
i'm going to end this reflection with words from arjun shah

437
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:32,880
on virtue and morality virtue and morality morality are the

438
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:41,520
mother and father of the dharma growing within us

439
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:46,719
they provided with the proper nourishment

440
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:55,840
and guidance

441
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:05,679
so sustaining deepening our cultivation of generosity

442
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:13,520
is the way that we can support ourselves each other

443
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:19,760
in this quest for freedom freeing the heart

444
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:23,840
from hate creed credent delusion

445
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:36,159
thank you grateful for this opportunity

446
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:51,840
to see these beautiful teachings of the buddha

447
01:12:52,800 --> 01:13:01,760
so uh kevin and mark i am happy to take some questions

448
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:06,800
based on this reflection on generosity

449
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:12,960
so if anyone has anything that they'd like to ask novita you can either raise your

450
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:19,280
hand in zoom or post your question in chat and um

451
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:25,440
nolita maybe about 10 minutes of q a okay okay jerry you can go ahead and

452
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:28,960
unmute yourself

453
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:36,400
um hi um jerry quigan in toronto uh a bit away

454
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:43,840
from south africa but uh a country i do want to visit so thank you very much and i guess uh i

455
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:50,080
was interested in your last words about virtue and morality

456
01:13:50,080 --> 01:13:57,520
and the interrelationship with that with generosity so recently

457
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:05,760
i um was in a situation where uh i'm a physician here and the group

458
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:12,320
that was negotiating a lease with the landlord some of them had their income had gone down and they

459
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:17,520
wanna and another problem was uh one of the people were leaving and of course there's a

460
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:24,239
covet epidemic uh going on here as there is in the world and they're uh it's difficult to find

461
01:14:24,239 --> 01:14:32,880
replacements so they proceeded to write a letter to the landlord initially in a general way wanting to

462
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:38,800
get a reduction in the rent and um asking the landlord you know out of

463
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:46,080
generosity and the landlord wrote back uh saying that well because they had said that the

464
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:53,760
one person isn't renewing and they're going to find it difficult to find a replacement for them and that the

465
01:14:53,760 --> 01:15:00,000
people were working at home albeit at a reduced capacity well some it applied to but it really didn't apply

466
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,840
to others and it resented because i was signing the letter that i didn't speak out that it didn't apply to

467
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:11,040
everyone so i felt that misrepresented to some degree what had been said and then the

468
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:17,440
landlord wrote back and said well tell me how bad it is and give me a global estimate so the letter never got to be written

469
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:22,640
but i was then pressured to uh indicate that uh

470
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:29,040
uh you know they said well we'll put the specific numbers in about how much people had increases or decreases

471
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:35,360
and they then proposed a letter which was not uh accurate and i said look i can't

472
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:40,400
participate in this letter go ahead and send the letter on your own and um then

473
01:15:40,400 --> 01:15:48,239
they will they called me said listen uh you know and i was uh disgusted that they hadn't

474
01:15:48,239 --> 01:15:55,679
uh indicated the specific amounts having said that they would about how incomes went up and down in the letter

475
01:15:55,679 --> 01:16:01,679
and so uh i had just listened to a dharma talk here in fact

476
01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:07,840
at redwood city and california via the wonders of the of the internet and

477
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:13,840
um the person had said you know sometimes why do we do mindfulness we do mindfulness

478
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:21,360
to uh uh develop an ethic so that uh we will speak the truth and

479
01:16:21,360 --> 01:16:28,880
avoid the defilements of greed um and uh uh delusion

480
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:34,880
and hate and uh so anyway they wanted to speak with me

481
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:40,800
and they started to the conversation after some niceties saying look uh

482
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:46,560
you know about the letter and i i said look i said i didn't want to participate

483
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:52,480
and then they said come on you don't we can put the specific amounts but you actually have to put this amount and then i said

484
01:16:52,480 --> 01:17:00,320
listen you've uh lost your moral compass this is disgust me and it uh

485
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:06,800
is uh um the letter as originally composed was uh

486
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:13,600
dissembling and uh so this of course i was speaking the truth but i guess in

487
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:19,679
retrospect uh the letter never did get written and the group disbanded and were moving

488
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:26,400
apart to uh with the peoples that uh where uh there's a group of six and

489
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:31,600
now there's four and two which is fine but i guess i wondered whether i should have

490
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:38,560
related it more toward in a generous way look i feel uh that it's um

491
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:44,560
uh i would be immoral to sign the letter i feel that this is dissembling instead i

492
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:51,040
projected it on to the other person and i just wondered whether or not that is uh would have been a more generous

493
01:17:51,040 --> 01:17:56,480
approach so i realize it's very specific and detailed but it's the issue about

494
01:17:56,480 --> 01:18:02,000
um in trying to be generous and also at the same time trying to be moral

495
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:07,920
getting caught in the approach that one might take to try to be generous

496
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:14,400
kind but also hardened and courageous when you feel that

497
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,840
a group is going awry

498
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:28,080
sorry for the launch what's the actual question summarize it for me make it specific

499
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:34,320
so the specific question would be would you just speak to yourself and not sell someone else that you've lost your

500
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:41,840
moral compass even though you feel that they did

501
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:51,360
are you saying is the feeling that you acted in ways that were not ethical

502
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:56,480
i felt that they did oh they did

503
01:18:56,480 --> 01:19:02,640
by not representing what they said they would by putting the specific amounts in the letter and then calling me to now

504
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:09,920
ask me to sign the letter which i said i wouldn't and then i i basically very specifically

505
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:16,400
named them i said this you've lost your moral compass this letter is dissembling and uh

506
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:22,159
i'm disgusted with you sorry another way that can help me to understand your

507
01:19:22,159 --> 01:19:27,679
question how does it relate to this buddhist teachings

508
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:34,000
on training in morality well in the sense that the mindfulness

509
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:40,320
helps you identify not getting caught up in greed

510
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:46,320
and so i did it i felt that this was greed

511
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:55,440
misrepresenting results that would of course not be helpful for them to say that well one person's income went up

512
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:02,400
i don't have a wise response to this

513
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:09,360
because it is not necessarily about your own experience of

514
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:15,600
acting uh unethically so i'm not sure i'm a bit lost i i

515
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:20,639
really don't have a wise wise answer to you because i'm not even

516
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:25,760
sure that i'm understanding the question well i guess the question i'm trying to

517
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:30,800
ask is should you just direct it to yourself or when you see unethical behavior in a group

518
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:37,040
should you identify that unethical behavior and not and and name it or just say listen for

519
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:43,120
me to participate in this it's unethical rather than tell them that they are unethical to proceed with

520
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:48,560
this approach even if you believe it socially do you appreciate

521
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:55,119
that in the buddhist teachings this is training

522
01:20:56,159 --> 01:21:01,360
so it is it is not about

523
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:09,520
shoots or shouldn't sin that way it's not very helpful

524
01:21:10,719 --> 01:21:17,440
so if it's training it means all of us are going to fail

525
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:25,280
and we do fail to act ethically and yes you are right the practice of

526
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:30,480
mindfulness allows you to see that it's hard to

527
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:36,560
not see with a trained mind when you act in ways that are not

528
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:42,239
ethical and also in this

529
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:49,040
practice you can only start again it's not about punishment

530
01:21:49,040 --> 01:21:54,159
it is about developing it is about

531
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,840
training

532
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:05,360
so let's leave it there let's leave it to their jewelry thank you very much it's helpful thank

533
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:13,040
you thank you okay okay so i guess we have time for one more so i think miriam is next so miriam if you want to

534
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:19,840

535
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:26,320

536
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:32,159
yes okay well um so nolita i want to thank you for your

537
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:38,320
generosity for sharing all that um i'm from the congo and i live in california

538
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:43,360
but i'm really emotional because this is the first time for me to hear someone

539
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:49,520
from africa doing buddhist teaching so i don't feel like alone

540
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:55,520
but um and for me my struggle about generosity sometimes i

541
01:22:55,520 --> 01:23:03,199
feel like i'm not kind to myself when i'm not generous to other person like when i'm

542
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:08,239
specifically like i'm um like i know some people like who are gay

543
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:15,199
in my community but i know in african culture that's not acceptable and i really feel

544
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:20,639
um sometimes not generous when other people have strong idea

545
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:27,679
like against that but i don't accept them not being open-minded and that's the

546
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:33,280
struggle that i have um yeah and i don't know how to deal

547
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:40,320
with that what is great miriam is that you

548
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:49,280
see what is going on that you are struggling so the encouragement would be

549
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:59,440
to turn towards that experience of pain with kindness

550
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:06,639
with an attitude of openness and allowing

551
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:12,960
because this practice of mindfulness is exactly about that it is also about opening the heart

552
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:17,840
towards ourselves and what we struggle with

553
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:24,000
that is what i would encourage you to do

554
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:32,400
because rightly so we are products of our cultures

555
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:41,920
some of these beliefs are part of our psychology

556
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:48,560
what mindfulness can help us is to see which of these beliefs

557
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:54,880
are beneficial and wholesome and which are of these

558
01:24:54,880 --> 01:25:01,600
that are harmful not only to others but also to ourselves

559
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:12,000
i would encourage you to really be gentle and kind to yourself in meeting

560
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:19,679
with that pain okay next

561
01:25:19,679 --> 01:25:27,840
is jill uh joe you can go ahead and unmute yourself

562
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:35,360
um thank you very much for taking the question um i i need to share that

563
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:42,320
that for a very long time uh the concept of forgiveness uh

564
01:25:42,320 --> 01:25:47,840
there seems to be a very strong divine element to it something

565
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:54,400
something outside of just myself and that if i had the power to forgive someone for

566
01:25:54,400 --> 01:26:01,440
a great harm that it seems very very bold and outside of my own entity

567
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:07,360
so my question is can am i misunderstanding the definition

568
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:14,560
of this word forgiveness or what do you think might be coming from my sense that it's

569
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:19,280
the ability to forgive is outside of my

570
01:26:20,840 --> 01:26:23,840
power

571
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:34,159
jill when you say it's outside of your power what does that mean that

572
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:41,120
it when true harm is done i i i would not understand the

573
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:50,880
motivation of that other person or the deep reasons that it it is beyond my um

574
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:55,920
not capacity but that and perhaps this is just because it's it's a leftover

575
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:02,560
from training of another religion which was very rooted in the concepts of guilt and only

576
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:10,159
god has power to do things so maybe that's a part of it but even in my best of buddhist

577
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:16,560
moments and my best efforts to feel generosity i know i can change my feelings in my

578
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:23,360
heart about this person who has caused great harm but i feel that the the

579
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:28,560
the true washing away or something so maybe it is a leftover religious

580
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:34,480
thing belongs to a power greater than mine so it sounds like

581
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:42,400
you've answered your question then so i'd encourage you to notice the

582
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:51,199
experience of unforgiveness and open to that

583
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:54,239
allow that

584
01:27:56,560 --> 01:28:03,679
be with the actual experience of unforgiveness [Music]

585
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:09,039
not making it right or wrong but just meeting it

586
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:15,840
with openness

587
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:25,840
stay with the sensations of the experience not so much the thoughts the stories

588
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:33,120
stay with the false sense of unforgiveness

589
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:41,199
so that's what i would advise as a practice and really being gentle with yourself with

590
01:28:41,199 --> 01:28:48,800
that as well very helpful thank you okay okay

591
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:54,320
thank you thank you no letha there's a question in chat i don't know if you have time for one more

592
01:28:54,320 --> 01:29:00,880
oh okay yeah let me take it kevin yeah so uh cindy asks nolitha how do you practice generosity

593
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:06,560
in an environment of racism white supremacy it has been present in this country the

594
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:25,840
u.s since its beginning and it is very difficult and is a very difficult thing to forgive and understand

595
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:29,678
just notice that

596
01:29:32,639 --> 01:29:39,840
in a moment isn't um

597
01:29:40,480 --> 01:29:47,280
wisdom that's present for me in responding to that

598
01:29:49,440 --> 01:29:56,159
but the fact that this person is is thinking about forgiveness and

599
01:29:56,159 --> 01:30:04,320
just not knowing how is already a generous place

600
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:11,840
to be that there is

601
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:20,400
a desire or a curiosity to what forgiveness might look like in that

602
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:23,360
situation

603
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:38,960
hmm stay with the idea of

604
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:46,639
being with the desire to forgive
