00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:31,840
up so so we have been exploring this week today is day five out of five

139
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:41,639
exploring the teachings on sadada translated uh as trust as

140
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:50,399
um as um confidence sadada the word in poly maybe I'll put it in chat again

141
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:55,600
I've been doing that so here is

142
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:02,200
the yeah whoops the word s here we go

143
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:09,720
impal there um and and just a quick review of what

144
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:17,039
the aspects we have covered this week so we started by uh discussing the necessity

145
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:23,000
of having trust and confidence in the practice otherwise we wouldn't start

146
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,679
there has to be some borrowed trust oh yeah this seems to work for others um

147
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:35,080
um or verify trust to continue to practice when when we verify yeah I seem

148
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:42,000
calm or Kinder um not as reactive something is happening here so ver

149
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:50,639
borrow trust verify trust needed to start to continue then we talked about the uh the

150
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:57,880
trust or confidence in the triple jewels in this classical language which essentially is trusting that I I can

151
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:03,200
wake up it's possible for me yes I can wake up I can be kinder I can have more

152
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:09,358
freedom a little more freedom I can um it's possible for me I know it's possible so that sense of trust that

153
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,919
keeps us going trust in the teachings that these practices are verified they

154
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:21,398
worked for so many people it's um so these teachings are available trust in

155
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:29,520
that trust in the community that I'm not doing this alone of support of both practitioners

156
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:38,599
others externally and historically then we uh talked about the

157
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:44,200
um uh then we talked about what supports yes what supports Sada what supports

158
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:51,320
Sada what supports confidence and trust and and practicing actually

159
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:58,280
practicing is the strongest support for S when we practice and both in in minute

160
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:06,560
ways and moment to moment way we see that oh yeah this is Shifting changing I feel more calmer more more peaceful than

161
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,920
30 minutes ago and also in the longer term when we see when we really bring we

162
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:18,040
reflect active reflect on how we're shifting and changing very important that

163
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:26,480
reflection and also ethical conduct um uh is supports supports our trust and

164
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,560
the lack of ethical conduct it erodes our trust in ourselves and in the

165
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:38,880
practice we kind of waver and fall off the track so and then uh yesterday the

166
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:47,240
fourth day we talked about the role of sadada in overcoming doubt doubt um uh

167
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:55,079
which is one of the five hindrances and doubt showing up in so many different ways doubt either doubt in ourselves I

168
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:02,040
can't do this doubt in practice doubt in community Etc but also doubt can show up in more subtle ways and I invited you to

169
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:07,839
really consider that when in our practice we kind of waver and we're here and there and everywhere we're not

170
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:17,520
really trusting that here in this sweet moment of here and now this is the most nourishing place to be or when we uh uh

171
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,680
fall off the path and oh yeah I'll sit I'll sit I'll practice oh yeah I'll listen to a Dharma talk and a month goes

172
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:30,640
by a couple months yeah it's kind of a lack of trust that this really works so in way so that's a review quick review

173
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:38,640
just to bring us so today I want to talk about um how um what are the fruits what

174
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,800
are the fruits of s um and

175
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:50,800
so in the guided meditation also so a couple of things one fruits of s and also a little more about what supports

176
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,520
Sada confidence so um in the guided

177
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:03,640
meditation if you noticed I asked you to to uh bring a drop a drop of drop a

178
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:10,560
droplet of of gratitude appreciation uh for yourself for this

179
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:17,920
practice uh for the community just a sense of appreciation gratitude yay this is good just tasting tasting

180
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,720
appreciating the goodness and that appreciation

181
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:30,160
gratitude can bring up a sense of can support sense of sadak and sense of

182
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:37,319
trust and confidence that um it it feeds into it so um it's another way it

183
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:43,599
Fe Sada support it and then but what I really want to focus on is the fruits of

184
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:50,240
SATA so the fruits of confidence basically the ultimate fruit of it is is

185
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:58,359
freedom Liberation nibana that's what the sutas talk about that um that

186
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:05,720
and and examples of and I'll unpack this in a moment but maybe a a sweet story is

187
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:13,599
uh from Ananda who was uh the cousin of the Buddha and Ananda was his attendant

188
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:20,720
was he attended to him attended to the Buddha loved the Buddha and uh heard

189
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:26,119
heard most of if not all the teachings because he was always with the Buddha attending to

190
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:31,160
him and fully trusted had had confidence

191
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:38,280
in the teachings just a sense of sweetness actually talking about the about Ananda there many sweet passages

192
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,960
about him the sense of yeah this um this human being who's who's dedicated to

193
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:52,720
service and really trusts in in in these teachings in the Buddha and the S and

194
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:59,119
when the Buddha died Ananda still hadn't become fully awakened um so it was a store point for

195
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:06,680
him that you know so many people had become awakened and he hadn't and and yet he had full full

196
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:12,640
trust in the teachings and it is said that right before the first Council uh

197
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:20,720
of of Elders Buddhist Elders came together Ananda uh became awakened and and

198
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:26,599
through his trust through his his Sada for the for the practice for the Buddha

199
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:34,560
and also in the cap capacity of himself to wake up it's a sweet story um to me

200
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:41,400
um I wanted to share that with you and and in the teachings um there is in the

201
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:47,880
upan suta it's a beautiful suta Opa suta there's a sequence that the Buddha lays

202
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:53,640
out that you might have heard about them here before that this leads to that this

203
00:39:53,640 --> 00:40:00,720
leads to that this leads to this and in this particular outline of what

204
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:07,240
leads to what um sad confidence leads to

205
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:14,599
Pala leads to uh Delight leads to um uh

206
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:22,920
this and and gladness Poma translated as gladness or delight and and then there

207
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:30,000
are other things that it leads to up I'll talk about in a moment but pausing here in the guided meditation I invited

208
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,880
you um to notice to really reflect with this sense of confidence this feels

209
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:44,920
right this feels right this practice feels right being here right now it feels right and how recognizing

210
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,079
that connecting to that it brings a sense of gladness as I was leading you I

211
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:57,680
was practicing myself and there was this sense of brightness in my heart and in my body yeah there's this gladness this

212
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:05,000
feels good this feels yummy it might show up in different ways but there's this gladness this joy that that uh

213
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:11,040
comes up from recognizing our sense of trust connection

214
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:16,560
confidence and um and and it's not just an emotional

215
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:23,520
high but it's a deep sense of contentment and well-being that comes from knowing that one is on the right

216
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:30,920
path and just to share the rest of this Con

217
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:41,880
this sequence with you I'll put it in chat and I'll I'll name it um I I'll read it out loud too so um h s s leads

218
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:48,520
to Joy leads to Rapture um sorry the translation here is

219
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:54,359
different actually so I like to translate Poma as um gladness or delight

220
00:41:54,359 --> 00:42:00,760
and PT as either Rapture or joy Joy PADI as calmness Tranquility samadi

221
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:06,440
concentration PA wisdom and nibana Liberation so in this

222
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:14,839
suta these are laid out so s is really um the foundation of all these cascading

223
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:19,880
cascading um steps that um just happen

224
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:27,520
on their own happen on their own it's not like we make it happen when you have full trust the rest the rest unfold on

225
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:37,760
their own I also want to briefly talk about how um trust so so just really the punch

226
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,720
line is the ultimate fruit of sadada confidence trust is nibana is freedom

227
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:50,359
and that's there's such a joy in that of delight that that this path leads leads

228
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:58,720
with confidence and path it leads to more freedom more ease more wisdom kindness for ourselves for others

229
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:05,760
and the other thing to consider is um confidence is needed trust is needed to

230
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:12,160
overcome adversity to overcome challenges in our lives um and Trust in

231
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:17,880
the practice I know that for me uh there there's been trusts in the insights that

232
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:24,640
I had through this practice that have been that have um supported me through difficulties and challenges and it's not

233
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,559
like challenges and life go away and one of them is the full trust in

234
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:37,599
impermanence in impermanence it is impermanent um and and that's the Trust

235
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:42,760
In in the Dharma right in the way things are in the teachings yeah so you might

236
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:50,319
have uh heard this saying this twoo shall pass this two Shall Pass there's a sense of yeah it's it's going to pass no

237
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:57,160
matter how challenge seems right now maybe their emotions or difficult this is It's arising it's going to pass away

238
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:02,920
it's okay just hang in there hang in there um hang in there it's okay this T

239
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:10,319
sh pass um other insights that that um confidence in in other

240
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:16,760
ways um that have supported me there's this confidence this that yeah it's it's

241
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:22,880
um again I I keep coming back to to impermanence um and and also in

242
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,800
personality that it's not personal you especially when they're interactive challenges with with other people that

243
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:35,440
it's not personal and that's the insight into anata in personality that they're doing the best they can I'm doing the

244
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:41,720
best we I can we've been in you know in um maybe some who' have bumped against

245
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:47,040
ourselves because of the causes and conditions and seeing that ah that gives

246
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:52,880
my heart ease release because I have confidence in that I have confidence I

247
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,319
have trust in that and so many other aspects of trust so I want to invite you

248
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:04,800
uh to to reflect to reflect on on the aspects of your confidence confidence

249
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:12,119
that you have in the teachings in the insights that you've had that support you when challenging situations have

250
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:20,760
come up and continue to come up and also to to have trust that trust in the

251
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:27,000
practice leads to to to nibana to freedom to all the the steps that I

252
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,960
named to delight and you can feel the Delight in the practice yes I'm on the right path I found the right path for me

253
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,280
there's a sense of joy and Delight in that which let invites the heart to

254
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:47,000
settle into peace tranquility PADI uh to have more concentration Stillness samadi

255
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:53,119
ha wisdom grows from the combination of those and nibana

256
00:45:53,119 --> 00:46:00,000
Liberation so it's been a delight to uh to share these teachings with you um
