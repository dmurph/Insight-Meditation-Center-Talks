1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:09,200
so good morning everyone and welcome to IMC and um what's on my mind this last

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,160
few days is the topic of patience so that'll be the subject of this

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:22,480
talk and as a way of kind of maybe opening the door to patients

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,840
and maybe why it should be interesting can be interesting there's a teaching of

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:37,040
the Buddha that goes some something like this of all the goals accomplished of

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,120
all the things accomplished you'll find nothing more

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,960
beautiful than patience and how many of you associate

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:57,760
patience with beauty but uh can patience be

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,920
beautiful and uh and that's the call that's the possibility and how is it

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,400
beautiful is um maybe the what this talk will kind of point

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,400
to the part of the reason why I'm focusing on patience is that I'm also

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,960
focusing on a larger list called the 10 parames where 10 Perfections where

13
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,880
patients precedes TR truth the Perfection of Truth the ability to be

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,600
present and see the truth clearly and um and so there's something

15
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:41,320
about patience that allows us to do one of the most important tasks of Buddhism

16
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:46,719
which is to see things as they are to see the truth and the truth is not often

17
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:51,920
easy to see sometimes it's difficult to see it in ourselves and some people even

18
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:59,600
don't even want to admit some of the things they see in themselves it takes a long time to finally say okay well I guess it's true that I'm selfish or it's

19
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,759
true that I'm angry or it's true that something in my life is not working and I was trying to pretend it

20
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:14,319
was it uh it is uh sometimes it has to do with the the world that we live in

21
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,040
and I've heard a lot of people now who uh in the last few months for whatever

22
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,640
the reasons are who

23
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,879
knows uh have decided not to uh read the news as as much as they used

24
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:37,160
to and um because it's too difficult or too

25
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,599
something and uh but maybe being able to see the world as it is is really

26
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:50,000
important for Buddhists to stay informed to not turn away because it's difficult

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,879
um uh not that not turn away because it's difficult is maybe not the reason

28
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:01,920
and there's good there's good reason I think why people are turning away because uh the impact the news can have

29
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,239
on them is so difficult they don't want to have this difficulty but uh that's why patience is

30
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:17,640
needed this thing that's called patience in English so um the it's possible that uh

31
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,720
patience is not the best word uh to translate the ancient Buddhist word

32
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:30,560
canti in Sanskrit it's aanti and

33
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,879
um and know I've seen repeatedly that there are very important words in

34
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:43,840
Buddhism that where the indic word the word as it's came was used in India has

35
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,879
very strong associations with something that's very special something sacred with something spiritual or something

36
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:57,560
kind of really kind of uh wonderful in human life that when you translate these

37
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:03,159
words into English we lose that and and the way that kti I think in the

38
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:09,239
original context of Indian Buddhism and maybe India in general uh it was one of

39
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,680
those words that had very strong kind of uh um welcoming

40
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,440
associations that it was really this is really a good thing and inspiring thing

41
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:27,400
whereas patients you know in English uh sometimes it's often associated with

42
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:34,080
enduring and um and uh it might see a little bit that in the very atmology of

43
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,919
the word patience in English where it comes from the Latin root Pati which means a

44
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:46,840
suffer so sometimes patients is understood to be suffering with something you well patient that is going

45
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:52,280
to suffer with it that's that's the that's what life is going

46
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,919
along and um but the but the um the Indian Buddhist word canti has very

47
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:04,160
different Association ations to it besides being kind of a sacred word uh

48
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,039
it also has the uh the one of the the one of the close associations to what it

49
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:16,520
is is it's often taught together with or mentioned together with the word meta

50
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,400
which means kindness or loving kindness and there's a famous I it's not

51
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,280
famous but at least locally in me

52
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:38,360
uh teaching of the the it's called the acrobat suta and in there there's um um

53
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:49,199
uh there's four things listed there's listed patience non-harming loving kindness and uh um

54
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,000
and empathic care and uh these four things are kind

55
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,919
of a little family so to put patience together with non-harming which is

56
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,880
wonderfully powerful inspiring kind of Topic in India uh Central to some

57
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:13,400
religions of India and with loving kindness friendliness and with this

58
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:19,759
empathic care for others uh puts patience in a very good family the tribe

59
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:26,400
is really a good tribe to be part of and um and we get little bit of sense

60
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:33,080
maybe a very different Association what patience can mean when you realize that the Sanskrit you

61
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:39,319
see it more clearly in Sanskrit that the there the eological root of the word

62
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:46,360
Isam which means Earth so rather than the root coming from the idea of suffering it comes from

63
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,960
the idea of Earth and Earth is something that um is stable or can hold or has

64
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:00,080
certain kind of equinity or space can hold all kinds of things and there's this teaching the Buddha gave that's um

65
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:07,759
that kind of speaks to this where when he was giving u meditation instructions to his

66
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,560
son um the Buddha said this to

67
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:25,800
him cultivate your practice like the Earth by cultivating a practice like the

68
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Earth pleasing and unpleasing context pleasing and unpleasing experiences will

69
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,919
not take hold of your mind and remain there suppose a clean suppose clean and

70
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:47,080
unclean things are thrown on the earth so I don't know which of these is clean which of these is unclean but like

71
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,919
feces urine spit pus and blood the Earth isn't troubled worried

72
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:00,039
or repelled because of this in the same way meditate like the Earth when you

73
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:07,680
cultivate a practice like the Earth pleasing and unpleasing contexts will not take hold of your mind and

74
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,240
remain so this idea of knowing how to be

75
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:20,440
present for things which are Pleasant and unpleasant pleasing and unpleasing um and have the mind have

76
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:28,440
this SP spaciousness or stability or largess that um that we're not triggered

77
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,640
easily we're not upset we don't get uh we don't get caught up in it and lost in

78
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:40,560
the reactivity to it is part of what patience is about this CTI so maybe

79
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,720
there's another word in English besides patience that would capture this better I don't know what that would

80
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,320
be but or we have to kind of learn the Buddhist word for meaning of patience

81
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,560
but in the context of of uh wider Buddhism um PTI and especially these

82
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,640
thing called the perfe sections um we have to also understand

83
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:11,680
what gives rise to patience what gives rise to this earthlike ability to to hold in a beautiful way the life that we

84
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,200
have to hold in a beautiful way what is unpleasing what is difficult and that is

85
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:24,440
that to understand something about what the Buddhist notion of wholesomeness and um and the idea is

86
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,560
that so I like to translate patience as not by a single different single

87
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:36,160
different word than patience kti but um but rather to call it wholesome patience

88
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,240
and then maybe you get a sense of that maybe it could be beautiful if it's

89
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:49,240
wholesome and um so one of the functions of wisdom in Buddhism and Buddhism is

90
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,399
often seen as a wisdom tradition is uh not to read an

91
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:00,959
encyclopedia about Buddhist philosophy and then become wise but rather for you

92
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:07,760
to take a deep look in yourself to really not be present for yourself to be

93
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,680
able to see feel observe within you yourself what feels healthy for you and

94
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,800
what is unhealthy what feels um like it

95
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,360
diminishes you and what kind of opens you you know inspires you to feel what

96
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:33,920
nourishes you versus what uh Den nourishes you to feel what uh gives you good energy

97
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,120
and what drains it away and uh and all those ideas are some

98
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,639
are kind of held within this Co concept of wholesomeness and UNH wholesomeness which uh I kind of like

99
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:52,760
because it u means uh part of part of the whole or not part of the whole the

100
00:10:52,760 --> 00:11:00,600
UNH wholesome is what takes us away from the whole what hole I don't know the whole of who you

101
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,720
are the whole of what this world is like that we want to be be in it in the whole

102
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:15,760
as as it is not partial not selective not with blinders on him and um and there's something about

103
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,560
uh uh clinging resisting assertiveness

104
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,760
conceit something about even anxiety and fear sometimes that become kind of like

105
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:36,360
blinders it's kind of like we diminish ourselves we we're we're cutting we're it's a selectivity process that takes us

106
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:41,839
out of the hole and so to return to the whole to

107
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:49,000
the whole experience of the present moment the Buddha often talked about the whole body being mindful of the whole

108
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,680
body as we meditate uh being mindful of the whole mind not the divided mind but the Mind

109
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:04,120
as a unified whole phenomenon that as we do that what we start having

110
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:10,920
is in a clear and clearer sense of what feels healthy for us and what

111
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,199
doesn't and um and one of the areas of of feeling that and really getting to

112
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:22,519
know for ourselves is how we use our awareness how we use attention the very

113
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:30,279
thing that we have to that is's a the means by which we navigate through our world the very medium it's kind of like

114
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:35,519
the if the medium for fish to get through their world is water the medium

115
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,800
for humans to get through our world is our awareness our attention everything

116
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,079
that we experience in the world goes through that filter and so how are you

117
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:53,399
aware how are you attending to the world how are you observing how are you seeing

118
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:59,440
it and is that wholesome or UNH wholesome

119
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:07,959
is it beautiful or is it not so beautiful how you see it and um and so awareness itself

120
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:13,639
sometimes are why we attend to the world can be full of greed can be full of

121
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:19,120
hatred can be full of delusion it could be full of anxiety

122
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,360
restlessness it can be filled with preoccupations and doubt it can be

123
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:32,519
filled with interpretations and bias through which we see the experience of the the world and so this focus on what

124
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:38,480
is healthy and not healthy um is not to interpret these things but to feel what

125
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,199
we're doing and feel oh when I'm seeing the world through my hatred this this is

126
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,639
unhealthy for me this doesn't feel good it's there's tension here there's stress

127
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,160
here when I have seeing the world through my greed there's tension here it

128
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:04,440
diminishes me it takes me out of that the hole when I caught up in my anxiety you know

129
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:11,759
if I really you know it's hard with anxiety because anxiety is so concerned with

130
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:18,759
what it's anxious about that we don't see the effect anxiety has on us it just seems like

131
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:24,759
it's true but if we turn all these ways we turn the attention around

132
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:30,360
180° to really look at the effect that our Behavior has has the effect of how

133
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:36,759
we're relating to things we can feel wow this is actually no wonder I'm exhausted

134
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:43,440
by the end to day I'm just constantly reacting against everything I'm constantly afraid of everything and

135
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:52,800
trying to you know establish my place or I'm constantly wanting something and um constantly disappointed

136
00:14:52,800 --> 00:15:01,000
constantly world's not living up to where I wanted to be and so and so we see that and say is

137
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,560
there another way is there a way that's not stressful that's not what's the opposite

138
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:14,480
of stress not just the absence of stress but it's some kind of wonderful Vitality

139
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:22,079
wonderful relaxed open Vitality in which we live our life so the wisdom factor in Buddhism

140
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:27,600
the mindfulness practice in Buddhism is here partly for us to be able to become

141
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,920
to read ourselves well that's the encyclopedia we want to study don't get

142
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:40,480
to book the book you want to read is your own heart you wanted have have a very

143
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,000
acute sensitivity to what goes on in your heart in your mind in your body in your

144
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,720
speech so that it stops being un wholesome it stops being starts being

145
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,560
wholesome it stops being I don't know if I want to say ugly

146
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:05,480
but I just did um and uh instead we wanted to be

147
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:14,959
beautiful can we make it beautiful what we do and how we live is that wise is that

148
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,880
useful well if what you want to do is get wealthy really

149
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:29,079
fast maybe not so don't bother you can go you can go now

150
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,759
but what if you want if you want freedom if you want to find not just be

151
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:40,519
distressed and be calm but to find this higher capacity for living a life that's

152
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:47,720
beautiful the qualities of heart and mind that come forth in you are satisfying deeply deeply satisfying for

153
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:55,560
you you feel like ah I'm home because I know inside of me now this feels good we

154
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,720
become our own friend our inner life is our friend ah this is beautiful this is

155
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,079
nice so wisdom begins helping us discern the difference between what's healthy

156
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:15,160
and not healthy for us wholesome and not wholesome and one of the things that teaches us then is where to put our

157
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:22,480
energy how to apply our energy and uh and so we have to make

158
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,640
choices and so as we have better better sense of what is wholesome and UNH

159
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,000
wholesome we canit wise or choices about where we take this wonderful human

160
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:41,240
capacity of Vitality that we have energy we have and use it to uh to awake awaken

161
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:46,360
a healthy kind of energy and and kind of stop doing things

162
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:54,880
which are kind of energy that is exhausting that's agitating that's stressful that's that's um you know

163
00:17:54,880 --> 00:18:01,880
exhausting for us and it's one of the Great lights Delights of Buddhist practice to start

164
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:08,320
feeling this wonderful engagement with the world and things that we do engagement with

165
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,559
practice that feels like it has a vitality and a and aliveness to it that

166
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:21,400
feels good and healthy it brings us brings us joy uh when I was before I was a

167
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:28,280
Buddhist practitioner if someone had told me you know you know we have to go do some gardening or we have to do some

168
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:34,000
work soon as they say work it's like oh no I mean work is like a four-letter

169
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,360
word it used to be for me and and now if someone says Gil we have this work to

170
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:48,200
do I'm just delighted the first first thing okay what is it I'm ready it isn't because of

171
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,480
the activity but because I've learned something about how to offer myself to

172
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:58,840
the activity which is healthy and wholesome that I feel feels really nice

173
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:06,640
and one of the big things I had to learn to do in this process when I was in the Buddhist monasteries and we had to work and was

174
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,360
um when I still had this resistance to it I didn't know I had resistance I had

175
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:17,840
to be able to start looking at the resistance I had how I held myself back

176
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,480
how I collapsed how I um became so

177
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:29,159
tired oh work but but I'm exhausted you know I'm

178
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:34,480
kind of tired today and that wasn't real exhaustion and tiredness that was a

179
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,360
strategy to get out of the work that was you know expression of disappointment and and you know had

180
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,559
better things to do and and um and so in the monastery I got

181
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:53,520
the the monastery was set up to keep coming back study the book of yourself

182
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:00,080
and I got to see that uh how I applied energy how I in got I got to did what I

183
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,360
did could be healthy and unhealthy and I learned something about healthy

184
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:11,720
engagement and that made a world of difference and what that can do is then

185
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,880
the healthy engagement the healthy application of energy doing healthy

186
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:23,720
things for us that uh increases what's healthy it increases the

187
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:30,760
holesome as that happens the ability of wisdom to distinguish what is wholesome

188
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:37,960
and UNH wholesome increases the more we learn about this the more we apply and develop ourselves

189
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:44,360
the more sensitive we become to more and more uh refined versions of health and

190
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:50,400
healthy and unhealthy the more we discover the more subtle we become

191
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:58,600
meditation subtle we become in our life the more at ease the more peaceful we are that gives us a better vantage point

192
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,799
to notice when we when we are doing something unhealthy something that's

193
00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:09,880
stressful I saw in myself that still see it sometimes if I get in a flurry of

194
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:15,840
activity doing a lot of different things I have a long to-do list I'm rushing around to do things

195
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:22,039
um uh I'm too scattered or too busy or too engaged

196
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:28,840
too involved to notice that the next thing I do is I'm

197
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:34,120
doing in a stressful way I'm so stress stressed out already it's like you know

198
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:40,919
it's like a they say in Buddhism it's like a if you have a a very clean cloth

199
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:48,640
maybe a white cloth that where any stain is highlighted and um but if it's if it's

200
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:55,640
only stained just like full of you use it for cleaning your car and changing the oil and it just you know and you

201
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:01,240
just never clean it and it's just full of stains and one more stain is not going to be

202
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:06,880
noticed but if you bleach it and it's completely clean and white uh the

203
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,039
slightest little drop in it is going to be oh no it was clean and now it's not

204
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:19,400
so it turns out the more we get settled the more we get at ease the more we find this more healthy way of

205
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:25,520
being the the the sooner we'll notice the slightest little way that's

206
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,520
stressful that is not Catches Us

207
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:40,720
so the application of energy supports this whole process of deeper sensitivity and now we come to

208
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:47,919
patience something happens and you leave IMC

209
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:55,880
today and if you drove here you have a flat tire maybe two tires are

210
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,640
flat so your spare tire is not really going to do that much good for you and

211
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,799
you have important places to go so you stand there looking at it and

212
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:13,720
because of the nature of this talk which I'm sure will penetrate deeply in and you'll remember when you go out

213
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:20,320
there to see your flat tire you'll say now what's the beautiful thing to do

214
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,880
here what's the healthy thing to do now should I get real then you'll think

215
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:32,400
about it you'll reflect you know should I really now get really angry

216
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:39,159
at the world for flat tires is that the best use of my energy and time should I

217
00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:46,760
now get despair should I now get really get worked up and desperately try to fix

218
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:53,559
this problem as fast as I can and get myself all tense maybe you'll say

219
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:59,278
yes because the lawyers of the Mind are very convincing

220
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,159
maybe but is that really necessary is that really the best way to live your

221
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:11,640
life is that really do you want to do the healthy thing if what you want to do

222
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:18,400
is apply Buddhist practice integrate they call people ask often how do I integrate my practice into daily

223
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:25,000
life this is an example you would stand there looking at your two your two flat

224
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:33,000
tires and you would not just get right involved with the issue with the tires you would be tracking how you are You'

225
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
use your wisdom how am I right now how am I taking this in what has been

226
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:46,000
triggered what is the healthy thing to do now I think the healthy thing to do right now is to walk around the block

227
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,880
and cool down let's let's see maybe the healthy thing to do is to call the people I'm

228
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:58,720
supposed to go see and explained what's happened and saying I have two flat tires I'll come as soon as I can but

229
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:06,799
just let me it might take a while then you walk around the block to cool down and then you come back and you look

230
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:12,399
at that and you say to yourself now the tires are on top of the

231
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:19,399
Earth make your mind like the Earth that Earth doesn't seem to mind flat tires

232
00:25:19,399 --> 00:25:24,720
the Earth can make space for that can I make space for that so I can be so then

233
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:31,559
when I address the flat tires I do it with spaciousness I do it with

234
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:38,720
ease you know do do it with patience patience am I supposed to endure this

235
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:44,159
too no you're supposed to turn this into something

236
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:50,240
beautiful CTI is beautiful how do you make this beautiful

237
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,960
how do you make this nourishing how do you make this so that by the time you're done with this

238
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,520
you feel like you're a better person maybe if you have a AAA card you

239
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:09,799
call AA a and you're always so worked up about it and so the per time the person comes

240
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:15,799
they're like five minutes late and you're ready to yell at them and be all upset and going to you know you know

241
00:26:15,799 --> 00:26:21,480
hang over them like do it fast that's one way the other way is say

242
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,760
thank you for coming and the person says yeah I came

243
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:33,360
as soon as I could and here's my tires oh let me help and in the process of

244
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:39,679
helping and maybe you learn something from this person maybe the person's phenomenally friendly and kind and

245
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,000
compassionate maybe they're generous who knows how they are because youve made

246
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,320
space for it because you were beautiful and how you were there with this difficult

247
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:55,840
challenge Something Beautiful could come out of the person who came to take care

248
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:02,880
of your tires that could not not have come out of that person if you were in your whole

249
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,840
kind of worked up mode and you're better person because if

250
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:15,120
you the better part of that person was shared with you who knows what'll

251
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:21,720
happen so the um so the the beautiful thing so the Buddha gave talked about

252
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,480
the tradition talks about three different areas uh to practice kti this

253
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:34,960
wholesome patience this beautiful patience uh one is in in the efforts we

254
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:41,679
make and it's and sometimes it's called gentle perseverance sometimes it's hard to

255
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:48,720
persevere when there's challenges hard to keep going if there's a lot of things that are offering resistance or

256
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:55,519
obstacles sometimes it's hard to do it when in practicing to practice meditation for example when there's so

257
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:02,200
many things to see on Netflix and so to persist no matter what's going

258
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:08,679
on but a gentle persistence a beautiful persistence and uh this is one of the

259
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:14,320
real keys of doing Buddhist practice like like meditation practice keep doing

260
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:20,360
it steadily in all the ups and downs of your life if you only do it when you

261
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:27,480
feel good you see only part of your life if you only do it when things are difficult you only see part of your life

262
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:33,919
the idea is to have have the practice address your whole life so you want to keep it going a thread through your life

263
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,600
so it provides a vantage point a reference point for all of who you are

264
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,480
and so this gentle persistence no matter what just keep going that's a form of kti

265
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:53,159
patience the next one that's emphasized is patience under

266
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:59,519
insult and patience when things are offensive when and that is that uh the

267
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:04,840
world you know there was a kind of an insult that those tires should be flat

268
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:10,880
you know I'm supposed to be a good driver or I don't know what but uh but

269
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:18,519
more seriously I think sometimes we live in a world of a lot of conflict and people do offend each other people do uh

270
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:23,760
insult each other people do kind of take advantage of each other people do

271
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,360
terrible things and um and the idea is not to

272
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:39,200
condone it not to accept it that's not what patience is but uh but to uh to

273
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,159
maintain this beautiful patience this beautiful CTI this Wholesome Way of

274
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:52,080
being as we try to address it as we meet it and what it explicitly what it means

275
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:58,039
don't succumb to hostility whatever is happening don't

276
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:06,360
don't succumb to hostility that's a core meaning of patient patience under

277
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:15,360
insult the and the third one is um is um acceptance of

278
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,559
Truth and kind of what I started this this topic with and that is that uh

279
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:28,320
seeing the truth can be quite difficult so as I said earlier seeing the truth of oneself is quite hard and many people

280
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:34,679
are trying to avoid it or some people are even using uh spiritual practice as a means of avoiding

281
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:39,760
it and uh and Buddhist practice is all about like especially if you do

282
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:45,440
mindfulness sooner or later you have to be honest oh this is how it is in me and

283
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:53,279
so the ability to be honest the ability to see clearly uh in Buddhist practice uh as

284
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:58,960
mindfulness practice gets strong and especially on Retreat the comes a time

285
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:07,799
when the usual references points by how we make ourselves feel ourselves safe in the world begin falling away so there

286
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:15,600
comes a time when uh in meditation not before and after but in meditation

287
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:22,240
uh um holding on to Identity holding on to clear definitions of who I am holding

288
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:27,679
on to clear senses of who I am and it just feels too stressful it's

289
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:33,000
too too much work to keep it up and so that begins to drop but that can be very

290
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,320
frightening because the very way that people have made themselves safe is to become and be a certain kind of

291
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:46,880
person uh we start seeing uh suffering unsatisfactoriness how many our Pursuits

292
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:53,120
are not really that wholesome and healthy and when our whole life is kind of based on these

293
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:59,399
Pursuits then um it can be frightening and disorienting

294
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:07,279
sometimes um uh the the fact that the world is uh the desire for some people

295
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:13,000
uh really want things to be stable have a constancy to it so that things can be

296
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:20,480
reliable and there that's reasonable in many ways but in deep meditation uh the world becomes

297
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:27,919
inconstant our experience of everything is constantly shifting and changing like we've entered into the stream of life

298
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:34,200
the River of Life where everything's always flowing everything's changing and so there's nothing there in that stream

299
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:40,519
in that River that's constant that's solid that's stable and they get stable enough when

300
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:45,600
you come out of meditation so it's not like you know that um is but for some

301
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:53,360
people that gets disorienting and difficult and so this is a one of the functions of patients kti is to give us

302
00:32:53,360 --> 00:33:00,679
that wholesome quality of attention that beautiful quality of attention that something can hold all this something

303
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:08,639
has this has the generosity to be with this willingness to be with his Tom and

304
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:16,039
I've seen that the people have the most challenges with deep Buddhist Meditation practice are people who've gone too

305
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:22,760
quickly into concentrated deep states without having built up and developed

306
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:28,360
this wholesome um repertoire this Wholesome Way of being in the world

307
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,679
who've learned how to develop joy and happiness who've learned how to um be

308
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:38,840
generous and kind who've learned metha who who kind of developed this kind of

309
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:47,039
their inner life is a friendly Place their inner life is a happy place then when when things are when

310
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,159
there's no self to be found where the everything is changing where everything

311
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,320
is um somehow unsatisfactory it's more okay because

312
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:05,559
the very awareness that knows that has become beautiful has become wholesome so then it's easier to have

313
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:13,720
this wholesome patience patience with truth so in this

314
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:19,200
way maybe kti either we choose a different word

315
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:26,118
for kti than patience or we redefine

316
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:32,760
it and make it into a new meaning it's not suffering and uh

317
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,919
enduring it's not stiffening up

318
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:44,878
and and just kind of you know tough toughing ourself through something it's

319
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:51,919
the opposite it's the opposite kind of toughing you know stealing ourself or

320
00:34:51,919 --> 00:35:01,760
something it's softening ourselves as we go through it so that's my idea of CTI

321
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,760
patience so what are your thoughts now do you have thoughts or questions or

322
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:16,960
maybe you want to offer a different word than patience for kti after this presentation

323
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:45,960
um is that now can you hear me okay um so this is not um this is

324
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:52,280
when you talk about reality um I have been going and this may not be very

325
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:59,520
Buddha of me but I've been going to protests at protests

326
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:08,119
[Laughter] prot um and uh you know I've been trying

327
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:13,400
to come up with um uh because I I don't know what else to do so I go to these

328
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:21,400
protest because I you know I'm I um have aversion to the what's going on I guess

329
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,520
and um you know there are signs that you hold up and some of them are not very

330
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:32,440
Buddha I mean some of them are very so can you is first of all is that

331
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:38,319
a skillful thing to do or is there another way and how would you what what

332
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:41,560
protest sign would you

333
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:54,079
have I think with anything at all uh it's the

334
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:00,920
consequence of what you're doing that's measures whether it's wholesome or non wholesome the consequence can be in

335
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:07,680
yourself as you do it so if you do it with hate that's unhealthy for you if

336
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,319
you do it with uh animosity and hostility for someone or anyone that's

337
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:20,079
unhealthy for you if you're doing it out of greed if you're doing it out of um

338
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:26,800
you know if you do it doing something out of fear might be healthy and appropriate but to do something out of

339
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:33,560
anxiety is a very different animal very different phenomena and then what is the impact

340
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,760
you're having are you doing something and then doing it you feel justified in

341
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:44,079
doing it but the consequence is is that there's more divisiveness more hostility

342
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,680
in the world or you're doing it in a way that actually heals the divisiveness in

343
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:55,640
the world is there a way of not creating more hostility but to create goodwi

344
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:01,720
across all kinds of uh divisions that we have so the the Buddhist question is how

345
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:07,040
do we do this is there a wholesome way to do it and what is the Wholesome Way

346
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,520
and so in this regard um I kind of almost prefer that Buddhists don't do

347
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,560
protests they demonstrate because that because that

348
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:25,640
gives us a chance to demonstrate a different way we might go we might be in the same place we might be this doing

349
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:31,920
the same you know for this trying to do the same impact on the world but we're there to demonstrate an alternative

350
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,800
we're there to make it show a different way in how we do it and so the signs

351
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:46,440
that are there maybe are very important what they write and um and uh so that's my take is

352
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,720
so the answer to the question is not for me but rather uh your way of reading

353
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:57,560
yourself what is wholesome what is healthy for you and what's health and what comes out of you is healthy for for

354
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:05,240
the world around you and uh and I don't want to be in the position to answer that question for

355
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:21,760
you my question Gil is uh re uh around reactivity I can find

356
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:28,839
myself sometimes being very reactive and coming out with hostility or or huge

357
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:34,480
disappointment whatever so can you give some thoughts around how to relate to

358
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:41,880
that and how to respond to my own reactivity for myself how do I respond to this so you you know it's happening

359
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:48,640
while it's happening uh I sometimes I do but uh oftentimes I

360
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:54,680
don't think I do know it's just boom you know so what do you need so that's so

361
00:39:54,680 --> 00:40:01,520
first thing you need to do is to catch it so what what has to

362
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,640
change what what what has to change for you how do you how do you change your

363
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:14,160
behavior in such a way you'll catch your activity when it happens well before I respond to that

364
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:20,920
can you say what you mean by catch it notice it recognize it that it's

365
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:30,599
happening well if I've already if I'm already reacting and saying something

366
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:37,480
or excuse me or you know um looking disgusted or something to the other

367
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:43,359
person it's already happened so I I guess what I'm asking

368
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,800
is if if it's already happened I can then I can be aware of it but how do I

369
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:55,800
be aware of it before it happens yeah that's that's what I'm asking oh also but what what I'm what I'm offering to

370
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:02,040
you is uh you know you you've been tracking this for a long time you're

371
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:08,240
aware of this for a long time and you have a lot of data and or you can maybe you need to

372
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,839
start collecting the data and then answer you have to answer the

373
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:21,200
question how do you physically behaviorally change how you live your

374
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:28,279
life so you can catch it earlier is that all

375
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:34,280
it's a joke and because if if if you expect that you can just Barrel a barrel

376
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:41,800
ahead in the life that you're living and somehow those magic formulas is going to be there to help you see this is not

377
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:47,400
going to work you have to actually reflect on your

378
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:53,960
life and and see what what do you have to change about your life in such a way

379
00:41:53,960 --> 00:42:02,119
that you you're you're there and present for what you do as you go through the day that you catch it earlier uh so

380
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:10,359
early that it doesn't come out of your mouth or maybe it doesn't come out of your your Grimace or something and um

381
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:16,800
and so what does that take so I don't know your life well enough some people find it makes a world of difference to

382
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,119
meditate every day maybe maybe what really needs to happen for someone like

383
00:42:22,119 --> 00:42:28,640
you is maybe it needs to be an at least an at least an hour a day

384
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:34,160
I don't know how long you meditate but uh but you know if uh if you've been

385
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:41,160
coming to IMC for a long time that tells me that this practice is important for you and maybe this is a time to do more

386
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:48,240
of it and and maybe it's temporary maybe for it's three months that you meditate for an hour two hours a

387
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,520
day you know an hour in the morning around in the afternoon it's it's crazy in the life people live here right

388
00:42:53,520 --> 00:43:00,680
that's so filled with doing doing doing but if this is is important enough for you if the question is being asked

389
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:06,599
because this is really important for you then maybe you have to do something that really allows you

390
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:12,960
to and maybe meditating more maybe it's doing less another neurotic thing that

391
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,319
goes on in our culture there are so many opportunities so many things to do that

392
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:25,680
more here more in the modern world than probably anywhere in life certainly more than time of the Buddha uh you know

393
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:31,680
there's so much available to to us so there's a way in which people are trying to have to do so much and catch every

394
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:37,920
stay up on everything and get all the movies get all the books get all the recreational activities get you know do

395
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:43,520
do do do and um and some of it's because they have to work and people are working

396
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,800
long hours and that's where it all at but um

397
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,079
uh if you want to answer that question for yourself maybe you need to look at

398
00:43:54,079 --> 00:44:01,440
what you spend your time doing every day maybe need to create more space in the day maybe everything that everything you

399
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,599
do that takes um uh it takes maybe 45

400
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:14,240
minutes to do uh whatever how long something it takes you always add 10% more time to it

401
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:20,920
so there's space between things you don't kind of out of breath and then you off to do the next thing so you have to

402
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:29,040
decide what kind of change you want to do in your life and otherwise I don't see any way to answer your

403
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:38,000
question thank you I see a hand here oh that's

404
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:46,720
say hello um I just want to share something can if you hold it uh

405
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:53,240
horizontal like like this yeah uh I just want to share something that might be

406
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:58,960
helpful uh helpful for me um um like

407
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:05,000
when I come home I will park in a garage and meditate for 10 minutes before I

408
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,160
enter the house and that has really been helpful fantastic for my interaction

409
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:19,599
yeah uh with my family and same thing when I go to work I will also sit in the

410
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:26,160
car and meditate for 10 minutes before I go to the office and that really also

411
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:31,839
has been very helpful fall fantastic I love it I used to do that uh Park about

412
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:38,280
300 yards from my house uh before I went home into my house because we had these

413
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:46,200
little babies at home and I and I had to get ready for was coming it was it was often like I'd

414
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:54,119
open the door it's your turn and so those those those few

415
00:45:54,119 --> 00:46:02,280
minutes of set getting settled from the day got ready for the my last

416
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:11,160
one um thank you Gil you know um I really appreciate your love of language

417
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:18,240
because using the way you're using patience in this talk um is kind of

418
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:24,400
really opened a new dimension uh for me and um

419
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:31,119
I was reflecting on it in the context of what happened to me in the

420
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:36,920
past 12 hours um I I had a

421
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:47,040
beautiful dinner uh last night and um I got home Angry Angry yes and it was like

422
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:54,160
out of nowhere and I remember looking at the mirror and seeing my anger and I was

423
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,960
just too tired I just went to bed in the middle of the night I wake up and I'm still

424
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:07,680
angry and um I meditated and I fell asleep and then

425
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:18,400
when I woke up I just started to feel the anger in my body and I felt oh is there a better

426
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:24,559
way to react to this and um to this

427
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:31,079
situation and it just open up you know a whole new uh thing

428
00:47:31,079 --> 00:47:38,480
for me but I would have not described this experience as patients but it makes

429
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:47,040
a lot of sense the way you're bringing patience because I had to be patient

430
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:53,800
with my not being able to see my negative contribution to the

431
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:58,839
situation um and it's only

432
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:08,000
um giving me that that chance instead of staying in in in the reactivity in a way

433
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,480
I love hearing that very nice so the patients gave you the chance than to ask

434
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:19,720
the question is there a better way yes and I couldn't I couldn't have asked that question before because I was just

435
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:26,599
focused on I need to tell this person this is not a good way to behave

436
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:35,200
uh and yeah so I I really appreciated um this angle in finding

437
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:41,559
Beauty and patient instead of enduring something I didn't

438
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:47,599
like very nice thank you so maybe just

439
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:53,920
maybe there might be some little occasion over the next few days to have

440
00:48:53,920 --> 00:49:02,040
some patience just maybe and so maybe you'll be better

441
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:09,680
prepared and um so thank you and if you want to say hello to someone who's next to you and wish them well and the

442
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:15,440
adventure their adventure with patience that that might be nice and then thank
