1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:09,160
so warm greetings from Insight Meditation Center in Redwood

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:17,480
City and um I'm very grateful for Matthew who

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,400
came and filled in for me yesterday and I was under the weather a a little bit I had a little bit of fever on Wednesday

4
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:30,480
evening and little bit upset stomach I woke up in the morning and fever was gone and very quickly in the course of

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,239
the morning I after sleeping 12 hours I started feeling pretty

6
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,680
good so I think it's pasted and I'm happy to be here with you

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:45,680
all

8
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:52,399
um

9
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,920
so when things are when we're treated in an impersonal way

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:11,159
with then it can be kind of cold and we can take it personally and feel like it's offensive almost like somehow we've

11
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:18,320
been ignored or overlooked or not respected sometimes when things

12
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,680
are personal we get offended easily and we're holding on to some

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,880
idea or we're threatened easily some times when things are

14
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:38,320
personal it feels really Co cozy and comfortable and safe and then there's a third step which

15
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:47,040
there's no English word that I know of maybe make up a word something like underp personal or prepersonal or postp

16
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,960
personal and that's when things have become so personal so centered so

17
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:01,840
connected here that we stop thinking about ourselves we stop

18
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,879
assigning person to anything person personalness to

19
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:15,640
anything and things are just can be as they are in the coziness in the comfort and

20
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,120
the safety the of the present moment and in fact to really be in this underp

21
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,680
personal way is um it can feel that

22
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:34,200
taking things personally assigning personal value on the and what it means for me myself and I can feel like using

23
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,200
Co coarse sandpaper on very smooth wood it feels like it's a little bit too

24
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:48,239
much and what's nice is just to appreciate the Comfort the ease the

25
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,040
subtleness of our experience without the overlay of whatever it means to be to

26
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,560
assume or feel that it's personal this extra evaluation that sometimes is quite

27
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:05,239
wonderful wonderful so as meditation

28
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:12,120
deepens we start getting a feeling for how to meditate without taking it

29
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:19,560
personally it doesn't mean that it becomes impersonal in some cold kind of way it be it means that we go deeper

30
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,959
than what's personal the underp personal and um and we can just be

31
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:31,760
present uh in the Simplicity of the moment content

32
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,360
um and if we're not content then probably there's something

33
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,319
that we're taking personally something we're concerned with For Me Myself and mine some something that uh bothers us

34
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,480
something that we want something we don't want and so we're get using the cors or

35
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,519
sandpaper but if we quiet down then

36
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:04,079
um and let go of this content of all forms and just content to be here

37
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:09,920
there's this underp personal state where things just be in meditation

38
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:17,160
in a very very simple way that's very satisfying

39
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:25,560
so uh assuming a meditation posture and it's useful to take one that

40
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,560
personally for you supports your meditation

41
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:38,039
each person's going to have a different posture that's the right posture for them to meditate

42
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:43,520
in sometimes the variations are very small

43
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,400
and to gently close your

44
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,960
eyes and to feel at first how personal it is with the eyes closed to feel

45
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:28,000
yourself feel the sensations of the body to feel and recognize the thoughts

46
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,319
you're having

47
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:43,520
to feel what's happening in your heart the emotions that are

48
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,280
present and rather than judging them or reacting to

49
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,560
them feel how with the eyes closed how close they are to

50
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:04,080
you they are not someone else's in Sensations and feelings they're yours they're quite personal

51
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,919
and others might have similar feelings but yours are your

52
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:22,919
own and then to take a few long slow deep

53
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:31,440
breaths breathing in and inhabiting this person experience of

54
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,639
yourself Here and

55
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:47,039
Now exhaling and relaxing it relaxing everything in your

56
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,960
body exhaling and

57
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,560
releasing for

58
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:37,720
breathing in and breathing out letting breathing return to

59
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:54,039
normal you might say that breathing is personal you might say that it's

60
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:59,599
something different than personal it's shared by all mammals

61
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:07,199
all humans are doing the same movements it's something

62
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,960
Universal to breathe in breathe

63
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:33,200
out and as you're sitting here become aware of the temperature of your

64
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,240
body places where your body feels warm places where it feels

65
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,880
cool places in

66
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,519
between and feel feel the temperature of your body as something that's deeper

67
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:09,680
than personal it's nature the natural

68
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,160
movements of how the Body Works in the presence of certain

69
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:23,800
conditions the warmth the coolness the play of warmth and coolness

70
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:33,200
in the body and how breathing interacts with it

71
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:09,079
maybe in some more foundational way below the temperature there's the

72
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:15,000
solidity of the body the hardness the firmness against

73
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:20,399
your seat or the

74
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:27,079
floor the weight of your

75
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
body e

76
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:30,680
and out of that firmness and groundedness there's also movement in the body

77
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,720
the movement of the associated with

78
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,839
breathing small little movements of the body

79
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:20,000
and in Buddhist Meditation practice being aware of these properties

80
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,199
of temperature and solidity movement are three of the four

81
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:33,480
properties that to tune

82
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:39,279
into that are prepersonal under

83
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,399
personal it's a way of having our experiences without the

84
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:55,199
overlay of attributing a self or me myself to

85
00:12:55,199 --> 00:13:00,480
it so intimate so cozy and content

86
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,360
to stay close to the these basic prop

87
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:13,399
Sensations properties that are at play in the

88
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:20,639
body sitting here

89
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:29,680
movement temperature softness and hardness

90
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,880
solidity the water element property is

91
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:51,560
cohesion anything that feels like it's stretching or being held together is considered to

92
00:13:51,560 --> 00:14:00,199
be the property of stickiness or lubrication

93
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:06,440
stay close to these fundamental

94
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:17,399
Sensations as a way of being underp personal less personal than

95
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,399
personal or if you can't do that having a heightened

96
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:30,720
awareness of how you do overlay the per an idea of the personal

97
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,519
on top of your

98
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
experience

for for

115
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:04,760
gently taking de breath or two two deeper and on the exhale settling

116
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:12,520
in letting go letting go of the impersonal and the

117
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:19,520
personal to just being here in the body in the sensations of the

118
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,760
body so intimate with the body

119
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:35,320
that there's no room for judgments or ideas or attribute

120
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,559
attributing them to anything they're underp

121
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:48,799
personal just here the natural self the natural world

122
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
nature

123
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
for e

124
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:24,799
and as we come to the end of this sitting what if

125
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,080
love good will

126
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:40,639
is something deeper than personal something that resides within

127
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:49,440
us in a natural way that we don't have to

128
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:56,520
personally evaluate or it's not a personal reason to

129
00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:02,840
love to be kind mind it's just the nature of the heart

130
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:10,880
nature of our inner tenderness kindness is deeper than

131
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,440
personal underp personal maybe kindness this kind of

132
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:26,039
kindness doesn't need a reason loving without a

133
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:33,600
reason loving without needing anything in

134
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:48,759
return loving without fear without

135
00:27:55,640 --> 00:28:02,880
resistance the heart's good will may all beings be

136
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,240
happy may all beings be

137
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,960
safe may all beings be

138
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:20,120
peaceful and may all beings be free

[Music]

140
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,519
thank

141
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,080
you e

142
00:29:52,919 --> 00:30:00,320
so hello so in the Buddha's teachings on the the four foundations of mindfulness

143
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,720
on the section of mindfulness of the body he has an exercise on what's

144
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:11,279
generally called the four elements and the four elements are

145
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:17,880
usually uh called uh earth water fire and

146
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:26,360
air and one of the reason in this exercise is to become aware of our sensations of our body in

147
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,880
their Elemental uh properties Elemental

148
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:39,679
manifestations and one of the classic reasons for this meditation is to uh be able to

149
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:46,320
experience our our um our present moment experience

150
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,480
without the filter of self-identification without all that

151
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:59,120
comes along with taking it personally and making it mine or it's happening to me or this is my

152
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:05,559
experience and um to be able to kind of uh experience it directly without any

153
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:11,600
overlay of self to do so impersonally in a sense not not but impersonally sounds

154
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:18,480
cold so I kind of made up the term uh prepersonal or underp personal something

155
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,639
that's so intimate that uh it's so close in it's so intimate so settled here so

156
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:31,519
connected here that it we stay so at the the foundational level before the mind

157
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,639
starts uh bringing in ideas of Me Myself and

158
00:31:36,639 --> 00:31:43,279
mine so um one of the so this exercise in the four in the four elements is

159
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:51,320
meant to be a element to freeze us from self self concerns

160
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:58,880
preoccupation now the elements um earth water air and Fire I don't know if it's

161
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:06,679
appropriate to call it elements because the elements kind of like it's the elemental table it kind of implies Some

162
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:13,200
solid like atoms some things molecules that's some fundamental things that uh

163
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,279
exist and um but rather that uh probably

164
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:24,039
the better translation of datu the the PO word is

165
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:32,080
properties and um because there's many things that are datus which are clearly not Elemental in terms of things they're

166
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:39,720
Elemental in terms of being fundamental like the building blocks of something but they're not things they're processes

167
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:46,320
they're activities they're uh things that are appearing and

168
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:52,880
disappearing and so uh so these have to do with our Sensations so it's not our

169
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,279
thoughts it's not our feelings about it but rather the sensations that might be

170
00:32:58,279 --> 00:33:05,399
there uh providing information that helps us understand oh this is an emotion the sensations that tell us the

171
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:10,639
impact that thinking might have so the sensations to stay

172
00:33:10,639 --> 00:33:16,039
there in the in the realm of Sensations the idea of the four

173
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:21,960
properties earth water fire and air is to give us a little bit of an

174
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:28,080
orientation of how to stay close in to these these different things so they uh

175
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:34,679
the Earth element is solidity hardness softness

176
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:42,039
firmness um uh maybe tightness sometimes so anything that kind of feels solid uh

177
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:47,880
or the opposite to kind of soft that range is considered the Earth element uh

178
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,600
uh granite rock is really hard soft soil the Earth is quite soft you put your

179
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,480
hand in it water uh the Water element is one of

180
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,760
the harder ones to experience but the way that the tradition holds it up is

181
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:10,679
that uh it's fluidity and with the kind of fluid fluidity where the the fluid

182
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:17,760
kind of holds together that's what fluid is it's kind of water has a very little of uh force that keeps the molecules

183
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,878
connected to each other um the spit in your mouth has more stickiness to it to

184
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:29,878
itself and um and you know so so things that hold things together keep things

185
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:35,560
kind of coales um so um it's a little bit hard

186
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:42,878
to feel and experience but maybe you get the idea and then um there's uh fire which

187
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:48,638
is a temperature hot and cold and um and

188
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:55,040
then then then uh there's the air element the literal word in poly is not

189
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,240
air we say air but it's wind and then it's easier to understand that

190
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,960
the elemental is level here is has to do with movement so any Movement we have in

191
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:13,680
the body um as we're sitting still for example and there's some kind of movement that's the the wind element

192
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:20,280
moving through us and um the

193
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:28,280
um so the um and it can be a delight to be able to

194
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:34,920
put to rest our self- preoccupations put to rest all these kinds of concerns about me myself and

195
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,320
mine and become so deeply personal with

196
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:49,000
our experience that the the idea of Personality personalist personalness Falls away and um so I tried the underp

197
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:58,040
personal pre-personal I see in the chat someone suggesting subpersonal maybe Underneath It All um

198
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:04,000
and um but this is where the the idea of it's so personal the idea of personal

199
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,079
personal uh Falls away it's kind of like some people may maybe have the experience of being in your home or in

200
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,400
your bedroom no one's around and maybe in your pajamas and you're cozy with a

201
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:21,040
cup of tea and there's no self-c concern about me myself and

202
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:27,079
mine and you know thinking about yourself you're just kind of cozy and settled and there's no other person to

203
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:33,400
bounce off of to compare ourselves to or be in interaction with and where you feel like it's just okay to be

204
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:40,200
ourselves so in meditation it can be this way where it's so okay to be ourselves that this is the maybe the one

205
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:46,880
place where we can drop the social world we can drop um the responsibilities we

206
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:52,079
have to do temporarily uh so that we can get

207
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:59,240
underneath to a deeper level of um of well-being of safety of of

208
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:05,599
comfort um where where we can be just be absorbed in the Simplicity of the moment

209
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,960
in the sensations of the experience There's No Agenda not trying

210
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:17,119
we're doing it for a purpose not trying to get concentrated or something but just kind of uh floating in the

211
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:22,160
sensations they come and go kind of diving into them sinking into

212
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:30,440
them and to have a a fairly good experience of this becomes a

213
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:38,359
wonderful uh um personal experience of an alternative to all the Me Myself and

214
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:45,520
mind mining that we go through the day with it can be exhausting how much uh

215
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:52,119
our self-c concern is part and parcel of so many of things we're doing all day long our preferences what we're trying

216
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:58,440
to avoid what we want what we don't want how we feel about things our opinions my

217
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,359
opinions um how we we are in relationship to other people it's uh

218
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:11,480
many people can get exhausted from all the ways in which we're navigating ourselves in relationship to

219
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:17,400
other people and with challenges that we have in our lives uh challenges tend to

220
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:24,280
evoke a strong sense of self because the challenges often has some personal quality I have to figure out I have to

221
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:29,560
it's happening to me or I'm responsible I have to figure some out and so this

222
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:35,880
emphasis on ourselves as the agent or as the victim or as something kind of

223
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:44,240
elicits more self some of that's okay but it's really nice to know an

224
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,319
alternative it's really nice to know that there's another way where we don't

225
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:56,240
take things personally but it doesn't feel cold we just are present for things

226
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,480
without measuring it against our idea of self or measuring Against Me Myself and

227
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:08,640
mine and what it means for me to to do this Four Element meditation

228
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:16,920
drop down into the Sensation that this deeper than personal is um gives us a feeling for

229
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:23,480
going about the challenges of our life without taking them so personally maybe they involve something

230
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:31,319
that has to be done but then we do it without the way of why me I shouldn't have to do it or

231
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:37,359
this is too difficult for me it there's a simpler way of engaging where the Me

232
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:43,240
Myself and mine doesn't interfere it might be there in the

233
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:50,599
background guiding a little bit but it doesn't interfere so some people uh find the

234
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:56,839
Four Element meditation very meaningful and in fact uh for this

235
00:39:56,839 --> 00:40:04,599
insight meditation practice that I I learned in Asia um uh it kind of with

236
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:10,280
the heart of it was uh the Four Element meditation in that the heart of it was

237
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:16,240
to really drop down into the sensations of the experience not the thoughts of

238
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:23,680
the experience the stories about the experience not the idea we take how we take it personally the experience but

239
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:31,839
actually dropping down and really staying intimately present for the sensations and this gets really helpful

240
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:39,800
like within emotion uh what are the sensations of the emotion and to course and travel and

241
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:46,280
feel the sensations of the emotion what are the sensations connected to thinking

242
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:53,319
what are the sensations involved in activity and movement that we're doing and to spend some quality time in

243
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:59,680
this subpersonal realm of just the sensation patience is quite

244
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,599
freeing and the freedom of self that it provides then becomes a reference point

245
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:14,520
to much better understand how much extra self we bring along as we go about our

246
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:22,240
life including with our challenges so

247
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:29,680
um so you might if you feel

248
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:36,440
inclined uh see if you could find a way to settle in and some nice way at home

249
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:44,760
or somewhere for a few minutes here and there to see if you can be so at

250
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:52,000
ease that you stop taking anything personally it's just nature operating

251
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:59,560
through you just nature operating in this body that's here and in not taking it personally not

252
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:05,720
being aloof for cold but rather diving in to the

253
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:11,119
sensations diving into the the basic fundamental building blocks of

254
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:18,079
Sensations from which we build our interpretation of life and

255
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:24,960
um and see what that see if that teaches you something about a a less

256
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:32,800
self-concerned way of being in the world it's invaluable to do when we have

257
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:39,680
challenges because the challenges that um that we have

258
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:47,240
that um get mixed up with self

259
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:54,599
preoccupation those challenges become much more difficult but the less self there can be

260
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:02,079
self um the agitation of self uh the easier it is to take care of challenges

261
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:08,160
in a responsible way so thank

262
