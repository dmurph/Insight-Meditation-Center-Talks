1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,859
so I would like to talk about compassion today

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:14,400
and it is one of the great ideals of Buddhism some people associate Buddhism

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:22,760
with compassion and wisdom and um and I could

4
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:31,140
I can confidently say that I I would not be sitting here

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:38,520
today if it wasn't for people who had compassion for me or I experienced

6
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,460
their compassion and if compassion experience of it struggles with it we're

7
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:50,940
not at the center of my own life it's been a very important part of shaping me as an adult as a practitioner

8
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,420
as even a teacher but having said that

9
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,500
I also would like to say because it's kind of an ideal ideals are

10
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:08,520
dangerous and um and people will often come to Buddhism for answers

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,299
and like answers to Life's big questions or answers to the personal challenges and whatever

12
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:20,460
and you know it depends on the perspective you know maybe you could say yes Buddhism has all kinds of answers

13
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:27,420
but for today I'd like to say that Buddhism doesn't provide answers

14
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:35,100
what Buddhism provides is a very clear mirror in which we can see

15
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,860
ourselves so we can find the answers here within ourselves

16
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:47,159
not because you thought it out you know the reason they're all out to the answers but there's something deeper

17
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:54,540
some deep seeing of ourselves that we do through Buddhist practice and so that's a very significant

18
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,060
statement that the answers are not in Buddhism but they're in ourselves because that's an encouragement to turn

19
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,399
the attention out of trying to get a PhD in Buddha studies or

20
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,340
the equivalent and which some people do and uh and

21
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,520
instead to turn the attention deeply in and and uh and and see what we discover

22
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:26,340
there so in relationship to compassion then uh compassion is not a singular thing a

23
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:33,840
singular state and uh and so but many people will think it's the singular state it just is what

24
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,620
they think it is it is how they've experienced it for themselves and and then when they're being compassionate

25
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:45,780
they just have one option of how to be compassionate

26
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,540
and but that one option might not be the best option it might not be the range of

27
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:57,360
options of what compassion can be many years ago here in this room uh when

28
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,480
Monday night I asked the people that um how do you know you're aware

29
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,700
and I it wasn't a leading it wasn't a rhetorical question I was just curious what people would say

30
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:14,280
but I was surprised by the answers and what surprised me was how wide-ranging

31
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,599
the answers were and I realized that I had been naive as a teacher which is or

32
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:28,620
you know somehow I also it was operating idea that I you know whatever I thought awareness was and I teach about

33
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:34,620
awareness that I assumed everyone else had the same idea and when I heard when I heard all the

34
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,140
different answers I was so in awe and so appreciative and so wow there's a lot of

35
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,599
things when I say awareness people are receiving it in different ways and maybe

36
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:53,640
each of the different ways is a good maybe because their idea is good also it works fine okay but um but so the same

37
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:59,879
thing with compassion I think there's many many ways in which people hear the word compassion have what they have in

38
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:05,459
mind uh Sharon Salzburg tells the story of um

39
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:11,400
of going to Russia and teaching in English uh with a translator

40
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,459
and she would use the word compassion in a talk the kind of talk maybe she would give in the United States a talk that

41
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:22,740
usually had people kind of inspired when they heard the word compassion you could you could tell by the audience

42
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:29,759
expression and when the translator translated into Russian everyone got sunk and depressed

43
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,220
looking [Music] and and so finally she asked you know

44
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:41,280
you know what what's this word you're translating as compassion and it I don't know what it was exactly her book that

45
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,060
she wrote about it and it says it but it was like maybe misery

46
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:55,380
and so the reference point for what compassion is is different and in fact the same thing is true in Buddhist

47
00:04:55,380 --> 00:05:00,900
languages the word karuna or the way the words these words are translated or

48
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,660
understood are very different than some of these other Asian languages in the

49
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:12,600
English word compassion and if it was translated more like how people understand it I think some of us would

50
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,300
maybe not be so you know it wouldn't quite click for us in English speakers

51
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:23,699
so um that's a way of saying that maybe many

52
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:29,520
things are compassion but the emphasis of the talk today is uh you're welcome

53
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,979
to have compassion as you think it is Maybe

54
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:40,680
but uh but rather with them there's what I want to stress today is not what

55
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,960
compassion is but what compassion is accompanied with

56
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,000
so maybe the maybe there's an Ecology of our hearts our minds

57
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,400
and that ecology comes along with all kinds of different species or you know you know and so and maybe

58
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:06,360
compassion just one of those species and how that species operates in a particular ecology depends on the other

59
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,699
species are there there might be a lot of invasive species invasive species which are causing a problem

60
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:17,220
and or there might be other species that gone extinct and that causes a problem

61
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:23,220
so there's all kinds of things that might accompany compassion so what accompanies your compassion

62
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:30,120
what accompanies your care your love for for other people or for yourself and

63
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:37,500
that I think part of the kind of the opening up what is this and the other thing is um

64
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,800
what are some of the uh intermental activities qualities

65
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,160
States that contribute that's at this that are the foundation for you to be

66
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,940
compassionate and as I've talked I've taught recently on YouTube in 7 A.M there are different

67
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:02,340
kinds of awareness that people have just like I pointed out to the beginning that different people say different things

68
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:08,639
there's awareness but we actually have many things that could be awareness many ways in which we attend many ways in

69
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:14,220
which we have attention for different things and so if we only have one idea of what

70
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:19,800
com what awareness is then as we are aware of suffering in the

71
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,960
world or in ourselves that's one way of being aware might not be the best one

72
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,960
for the circumstance it uh maybe if you're a feeling person

73
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,000
only feeling compassion and identifying with compassion of

74
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,160
someone else might actually be harmful for you might not be actually a good thing

75
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:47,340
but if you have this idea I'm supposed to be compassionate and and this is what I think compassion is and then you get

76
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:54,180
completely disparited by it or exhausted by it the problem might not be with compassion the

77
00:07:54,180 --> 00:08:00,060
problem might not be about with other people suffering is too much it might be the way in which you receive it the way

78
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,099
how you're aware of it so rather than emphasizing the feeling

79
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:10,800
of it you emphasize the knowing of it a little bit more cognitive that might actually create a more

80
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,680
balance and healthy kind of connection to suffering so the how we're compassionate what

81
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:22,500
accompanies it is part of it but before I kind of go into that more I

82
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:29,520
want to uh a wonderful I think it's a wonderful kind of etymology etymology game the root of

83
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,759
words

84
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:43,560
Indian word for compassion is usually uh in our scene is karuna

85
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,959
and that comes from the root Cur which means to make or to do

86
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:57,120
and um and so some people will see that karuna is sacred action

87
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,660
it's a very special kind of form of acting in the world and what I like about this is that it

88
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:10,680
involves an activity it's a creative aspect of what we do it's not it doesn't it's not about being

89
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:17,760
a victim is not what the world does to us but rather what arises emerges from us

90
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:23,040
as we meet the world so it's a kind of action of sorts of

91
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,140
mental action action of the heart and to see it as something that emerges

92
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:34,500
rather than something that reacts to something that we contribute rather than

93
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:41,640
something that as I said before maybe the victim of we're passively experiencing uh you know we've passively

94
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:48,060
experiencing suffering in some way and we have compassion just so it might it might arrived intuitively

95
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:54,300
it might arrive without something we make happen but still it's something that emerges in

96
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,459
response which might change the kind of orientation we have

97
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:05,399
about what compassion is that often too often people I think who

98
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:12,140
are troubled by Compassion or get exhausted they're allowing themselves a little bit to be the victim of it

99
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:19,019
it's happening to them rather than being centered in the place where we kind of

100
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:24,899
are the the Agents of our life or the the source of our life I like remember the agent

101
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:30,360
maybe the source of our life and as we sit in meditation

102
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:36,240
there also we're not supposed to end up becoming passive people who just kind of passively aware

103
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,339
it's a whole process of discovery the mirror feeling here

104
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:48,320
to let go of to shed all the unhealthy ways in which we're attached clinging

105
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:55,500
hateful unhealthy ways of being afraid and let let all that fall away

106
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,540
to discover that we have a capacity a wonderful Source Within

107
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,820
that animates us a wonderful Source within that is a source of the Sacred

108
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:12,720
action sacred kind of place of where life can our inner life how we live in the world can come from

109
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,980
and that the more free we are in Buddhism the more that inner source that emerges

110
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:26,279
replaces the controlling mind the figuring out mind the reactive mind and

111
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:33,000
there's something beautiful here for us to come from so compassion is this this interaction

112
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,360
that emerges as a response but not as a reaction

113
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:47,220
so one of the meanings of compassion is uh is to be in the presence of suffering

114
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:54,540
and I say it that way carefully so I'm not saying uh feeling suffering

115
00:11:54,540 --> 00:12:01,320
empathy as wonderful as it might be also has many meanings

116
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,440
and sometimes empathy people interpret it I have to feel what other people are feeling

117
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:14,399
and if we're straight out equally feeling their suffering in the same way their suffering we're feeling they're

118
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:21,000
suffering the same way they're feeling it we're in trouble you know it just you know if if it's you

119
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,720
know it's so you know are we supposed to feel as bad as they are um no that's not the point

120
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:35,279
so for some people to feel someone else is suffering how do we ex how do we be present for it

121
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,100
to be attuned to it not to ignore it not to be a distance not not to kind of hold

122
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:48,480
it at Bay but to be attuned to be in harmony with it to be present for it is a very different

123
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:54,120
kind of language and experience than to feel other people

124
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:00,839
suffering now some of you might find this troubling I'm saying this and maybe your

125
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:06,779
way of feeling it just works really wonderful because I meant again there's many ways in which people feel the word

126
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:13,160
right you have to feel sorry for Dharma teachers I hope

127
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:20,040
because we have to use words and that's why you should feel sorry for

128
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:27,300
us because you know when words have definitions and definitions are

129
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:33,480
different people have different definitions for words and so we might miss you or we might be partial we can't

130
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:40,440
say it all or something so so um so you might have a wonderful way of

131
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:47,820
feeling that works fine and keeps you in Balance but it but in terms of this mirror that Buddhism is what I'm

132
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:54,839
teaching here about maybe this is a mirror for you to look the way that I feel other people suffering is that

133
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:01,620
really the best way is that being attuned to myself and others that being in

134
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:08,880
harmony with it what is it what does Gill mean by harmony with suffering so that's a good mirror to consider like

135
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,880
a harm I guess they're rather than just feeling what would it mean to be in harmony with it or attuned to it

136
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,279
and one of the things I'd like it to mean is you're not a victim of the suffering

137
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:27,420
that you're not taking on it as a burden you're not caught up in taking responsibility for

138
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:33,660
it which was has been maybe still is a little bit my Achilles heel to feel responsible I have to do

139
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:39,480
something here and it's up to me and and um and if that's what comes along

140
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:45,420
with the feeling of suffering you know feeling it at that time is not really

141
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:52,139
in the law in the big picture so healthy so to be sorry to be so part of the

142
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:58,940
definition I'd like to offer for compassion is to be in the presence of suffering

143
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:07,040
ourselves and the suffering of others and to have the aspiration

144
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:13,380
for it to end the aspiration for it to come to an end and

145
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:19,500
kind of limited that simply what's lacking in that definition of

146
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:25,560
compassion is doing anything about it the action part

147
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,440
so I would like to bracket that for now and and first the word compassion and

148
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,320
its simplest forms I would propose is to be present for suffering in some

149
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:43,620
way and have within us the aspiration for that suffering to come to an end

150
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,079
or to be a weekend or a lesson in some way and I use the word aspiration very

151
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:54,540
carefully as well because I'm inspired by the word aspiration more that I'm

152
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,760
inspired by the word the desire or even the wish rather than desire that

153
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:07,320
suffering not be there or the wish that not be there aspiration for me is part of this emergent deeper quality

154
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:14,279
I think because it's related to the word breathing and so to Aspire like respire to Aspire

155
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:20,100
comes from some place deep inside that is not reactive doesn't come from Fear

156
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:27,300
doesn't come from this kind of heady idea of responsibility doesn't come from shoulds that we've

157
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,639
learned from society it comes from something deep inside that

158
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:40,620
can only come when our breathing is easy and ease full breath a relaxed breath

159
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:48,120
and the um the Buddha has a there's a word in Pali that's translated as uh

160
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,279
Assurance to feel like to feel assured and the literal meaning of the word is

161
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:58,500
to breathe easily and meditation practice and Buddhist

162
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:04,319
practice one of the goals is to live a life where you can breathe easily

163
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:10,260
someone asks you what is meditation breathing with ease doesn't that wouldn't be that nice nice

164
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:15,780
definition so so the aspiration what comes we breathe with ease

165
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:21,540
so when you're in the presence of suffering what happens to your breathing

166
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:28,558
that's part of the ecology that's part of what accompanies compassion how you're breathing

167
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:34,380
as you breathing as you're breathing tightened up as you're breathing getting short and shallow

168
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:39,720
are you hyperventilating what what's happening with your breathing and

169
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:46,440
somehow have you lost touch with an easeful breath and you might then argue well I'm not

170
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:53,100
supposed to have an easeful breath now this is a serious thing this person's having a I'm supposed to be tense

171
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:59,640
that be careful with that assumption the reason why is be careful with the safety that you have to be tense

172
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:07,160
uh one of the reasons is so the other people think is because then other person can see that I care

173
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:14,700
one of the most significant early experiences of compassion I had was uh when someone was very close to

174
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:23,280
was almost looked like the person was going to die and there was a zen teacher who I was

175
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,380
standing in a courtyard a little bit and so I was explaining my situation

176
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:36,179
and this person was so relaxed and at ease hearing all this and the way I wasn't

177
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:41,580
and had the most level of compassion and understanding of what I was going

178
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:49,140
through of anybody else that I've ever ever you know talked to about it and that combination of clearly he's

179
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:57,600
understood clearly care deeply and clearly there was a kind of love present

180
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,000
and the person was at ease was it calm that was I'd never seen that

181
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:09,720
combination and that was one of those things that changed my life to be in the presence of that

182
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:16,380
so to um to breathe easily so aspiration where does the wish for someone not suffer

183
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:23,640
come from in you it can come from Fear it can come more for your from your own

184
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:30,840
discomfort than the discomfort of the other person this is I can't stand this you know this

185
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:37,020
is too much for me let's get you know the aspirin let's get whatever let's get

186
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:43,860
this to stop you know so I have to do something here we have to fix it you know so and that's my compassion

187
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:48,960
I can guarantee that if you're too overtly acting that way you're probably

188
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:54,240
not helping the person you're helping trying to do if you're it's mostly about yourself

189
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,820
so this breathing easily is the aspiration

190
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:05,580
and then then what else does it come with this being present for others what else

191
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:11,640
is there in that presence that attention the aspiration what else is there

192
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:17,220
it's not uncommon that it can come with a lot of conceit

193
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:24,360
maybe not the kind of conceit that we talk about that person's conceited but a lot of self-concern how we look to other

194
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,700
people you know how we appear to them and how they judge us and what they'll think of us and what I'm supposed to do

195
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:36,900
and what kind of person I'm supposed to be and you know I'm supposed to be compassionate like I don't know someone

196
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:42,240
and uh and you know so there's all this selfing all the self-identity all the

197
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,720
self kind of Concepts that are coming into play that are making the whole that's kind of

198
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,419
muddying the water agitating it all it makes it hard for the easy breathing

199
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:59,580
making it hard for it to kind of just flow into some natural way

200
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:05,160
so I think for many people this idea of self and me experiencing it me doing

201
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:11,340
something is complicated because of it's a magnet for ideas we have about what is supposed

202
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:16,679
to be a good person what it's supposed what it's like to be a bad person I'm not supposed to be

203
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:22,799
and all those things can they be shed can they be let go of

204
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:28,559
maybe not easily but if you keep doing a regular practice a meditation you'll

205
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:36,900
learn how to drop some of the all this extra baggage that we carry around so much often extra baggage around self

206
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:44,820
and so if you really want to be compassionate in this world meditate be mindful so you'll learn how

207
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:51,120
to shed concepts of self that complicate your

208
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:56,179
capacity to breathe easily in the presence of suffering

209
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:04,140
it is is does aversion arise some people are so so chronically or so

210
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:11,840
consistently have aversion in their life they don't even know they have it and so their idea of compassion is

211
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:20,280
inseparable from having some aversion it might be aversion to the suffering not the person but it's still it's there

212
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:26,520
some people's operate where it's uh with a kind of chronic or Perpetual forms of

213
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:31,559
wanting something needing something and so when there's compassion that

214
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:38,400
sense of neediness is also kind of entangled with the compassion but it's not even we don't see it because we have

215
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:45,240
no experience it's invisible to us how much we're always operating with desires all the time

216
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:52,500
and this again is why mindfulness of meditation is so helpful as we see get quieter and Stiller and and more stable

217
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:59,400
meditation what we start seeing better and better um the inner drives of aversion of

218
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,100
hostility of anger the inner drives of desire and neediness that might be there

219
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:10,500
and when and we see it better it's uh that's good news

220
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:16,380
most people think it's bad news it's good news because if you see it

221
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,960
clearly then you start becoming free of it might still be there but is that DACA

222
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:30,380
doesn't have to influence what goes on so so even just what I've said so far

223
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:36,240
is is uh explaining that a different way of being

224
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:42,419
with compassion than maybe you've ever thought about it's practicing with it is taking a

225
00:23:42,419 --> 00:23:48,539
second look it's stopping with it it's something not just to assume is one thing and you have to do that one thing

226
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:55,380
and be that way but it's actually something to uh to stop and take a good look on

227
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:01,559
have him have the mirror of mindfulness really what is this what's going on when I'm compassionate

228
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:06,659
what definitions of self are complicating it what's happening with my breathing

229
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:12,539
what are the desires and aversions that are operating what are the fears that are operating with it and how do they

230
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:20,760
influence the compassion what is my confusion and doubts are there confusion and doubts in it

231
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:25,860
and um and so you know to look at this and then

232
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:31,679
on the more kind of healthy side of it which is what I talked about this last

233
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:40,020
week and at 7 A.M is um uh you know is there some

234
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:48,059
is there wisdom operating together with the compassion and the wisdom is to really look at how

235
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:53,700
we're aware look and how we're engaging to can we to recognize

236
00:24:53,700 --> 00:25:01,140
oh what what are we what direction are we moving

237
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:07,980
not what's happening to me but what direction am I going here

238
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:14,039
I think there's a lot of people who over emphasize what's happening to them

239
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:20,400
as if that they have to understand it and be with it and struggle with it but in Buddhism we're often looking

240
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,620
where is this going in the next Second and the next minute

241
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:31,740
so if I if I really hate how if I really feel

242
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:40,158
like a aversion to my confusion around the suffering I'm experiencing

243
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:46,980
if I kind of get caught up in that aversion I have to fix things there I have to change things I better you know

244
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:53,460
whatever I can immediately with with wisdom you can immediately sense oh this is going

245
00:25:53,460 --> 00:26:01,879
in a bad Direction this is going to make me more tense this is feeding aversion

246
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:08,700
If instead you see that yes I'm full of confusion but if I bring mindfulness to the

247
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:15,539
confusion yeah that's going in a better direction for the next few seconds

248
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:20,900
look at that so to bring wisdom to bear

249
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:26,640
on our compassion and the shorthand of what I thought for the last five days

250
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:33,000
is is is to have these questions where is this going right now what momentum

251
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,039
what how is this leaning and then by seeing clearly that we

252
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:43,860
always have one of two options we have the options to make it worse the

253
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:49,200
situation or make the situation better in some way or the other

254
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:56,720
at the minimum mindfulness makes all situations better just to be mindful of it

255
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:05,100
um distractedness not being distracted and not mindful generally makes things worse

256
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:11,460
being self-critical makes it worse being self-accepting self-loving makes it a

257
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:17,100
little bit better so that path so

258
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:24,840
is there Joy with a Compassion or is a compassion Suite I like the word sweet

259
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,900
again what I mean by sweet and you mean by sweet might be very different

260
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:37,620
what I mean by joy and you meet me by Joy will be different but is there something that feels really

261
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:45,179
right something that you value how you feel when you have the compassion

262
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:50,460
if you don't something is probably needs to be

263
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:57,419
fine-tuned the Attunement is not quite right the harmony is not found

264
00:27:57,419 --> 00:28:04,520
it's not easy to find the sweetness of compassion

265
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:10,860
that it is possible and so if you start kind of looking at

266
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:16,740
there's more to compassion than just a singular idea compassion has these things accompanying it

267
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:23,400
and those accompaniments make a big difference so is there sweetness

268
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:29,159
is there some degree of Tranquility is there some calm with your if your

269
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:37,200
tense probably affects your breathing if you're tense probably that compassion

270
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,039
can't be so attuned and in harmony with the situation you're in

271
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:51,480
is there some equanimity in Equanimity here I Define as non-reactivity

272
00:28:51,480 --> 00:29:00,480
doesn't mean non-responsiveness but reactivity is this kind of you know is the um is is in Buddhism reactivity

273
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:06,179
is not healthy this emergent responsiveness is a whole different animal

274
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:11,340
that we're looking for that can only really happen well when the breathing is

275
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:18,179
easy imagine that breathing in an easy way is like one of

276
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:24,720
the great keys to a good life it's a key to wisdom it's a key to

277
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,419
finding our way in this life but you know it's it's you know it's to

278
00:29:30,419 --> 00:29:36,600
say it is so simple but to do it breathing is one of those great mirrors

279
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:42,299
we're always looking for mirrors in Buddhism to really understand because the answers are here in ourselves

280
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:49,399
and breathing is one of those mirrors so um

281
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:55,020
so all this that I'm saying today is before you act

282
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:01,380
so that was a big list of things to do Gill someone might say

283
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:06,960
that's you know you're telling me to go spend the next you know two hours going through a

284
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:15,559
checklist before I help my neighbor who's you know you know needs groceries

285
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:22,620
um I think is too but to start doing the

286
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:30,480
practices looking at using this The Compassion mirror to understand yourself better and over the days weeks months

287
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,419
and years you do it this will become second nature some months you'll be focusing more on

288
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:41,760
your breathing some once more in the sweetness so you know you begin finding your way with it and this is a practice

289
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:48,600
that will develop and mature your compassion over the years that you do it

290
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:54,779
and it'll become second nature and um if the person needs to go to the

291
00:30:54,779 --> 00:31:01,980
emergency room don't go through the checklist of all these things don't worry about if your compassion is

292
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:07,140
off just take them to the ER and then deal with it later yourself

293
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:13,919
but um but the idea is to become wise really wise about what compassion is

294
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:20,159
so when the when the aspiration for the suffering to end

295
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,440
is in a time and place where you connect

296
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:32,880
you can act from a really good foundation and so maybe you become for someone else

297
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:39,000
what that zen teacher was for me turns out that what you do for the

298
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:44,760
person will change their life less than the fact that you're able to be

299
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:51,179
there in a caring loving way really present understanding

300
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:57,419
and have a deep sense of ease palpable sense of ease and that those all came together in such

301
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:03,899
a way that wow is this possible in this life and maybe you'll turn change someone

302
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:09,360
else's life maybe you managed to get them their

303
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:14,778
groceries or to the ER but how you did it

304
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:20,220
was what changed their life not that the fact that they went they had more food to eat or

305
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:25,340
the doctors you know help them out in something

306
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:32,520
so I think it's a sacred work this work of looking deeply and

307
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:38,820
practicing with our response to and our presence to suffering in the world

308
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:44,220
and our compassion our care our kindness our friendliness it's sacred work

309
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:49,620
because it's the kind of it's sacred because it has a lot to do with our

310
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:57,179
connectivity with other people how we live in the presence of others and that that bridge that those

311
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:03,480
relationships that we have you know if if that's not sacred

312
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:08,820
I'd like to know what you think is and maybe we're both right

313
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:15,000
but uh it's um it's a sacred work to uh to

314
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,059
find an Attunement and harmony and

315
00:33:20,059 --> 00:33:26,580
aspiration in the world of compassion and suffering

316
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:32,880
may you find it for yours towards yourself may you find it towards others

317
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,700
and may all of us be nourished

318
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:44,899
by the sweetness of compassion thank you

319
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:52,440
so we have about five minutes before we you know scheduled ending and then I'm going to go up to pretty

320
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:58,559
quickly after that to set up for this community meeting we have but if any of you would like to have a

321
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:06,860
comment or a question about any of this especially if you feel like you'd feel unsettled without asking it

322
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:14,299
oh you have a testimonial about compassion

323
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:27,019
hey um could you provide the poly word for Assurance and breathing easy again

324
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:36,658
it's the poly word you know it's it's I don't think I have it accurately anymore but I think

325
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:41,839
it's asada I think

326
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:56,158
foreign actually reminded me of something that

327
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,380
just happened in the last year my father-in-law had a heart attack and my

328
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:06,900
husband of course was distraught over it and

329
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:12,480
he lives in India so of course you can't do anything right away like you can't

330
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:18,960
hop in a car and go see your father-in-law to make sure things are taken care of

331
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,500
but that's of course what my husband wanted to do was like find the flight and like let's go as quickly as possible

332
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,960
and I said wait just take a deep breath even if we get a flight right now it

333
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:38,280
won't leave till tomorrow so just take a deep breath let's assess the situation let's just take a moment

334
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:45,599
to you know figure out one do we need to go right now maybe we can if he's stable

335
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,760
we can leave in a week and we'll go see him and it'll be okay you know

336
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:59,700
um anyway a lot of things ended up happening we didn't end up going to India but uh the point was just being

337
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:06,300
able to just take a moment to calm before rushing to do this that and the other

338
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:13,440
thing really helped ensure that we didn't just react out of

339
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,720
you know compassion instead we and you had and you had enough come to offer him

340
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:26,660
a different perspective so he could kind of relax yes yes I wish you'd been around me sometimes in my life

341
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:35,820
I mean I've had times in my life you know I remember it's been a good I think good number of years ago now but where I

342
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:42,660
reacted you know and acted quickly and the Recently I was reminded that um

343
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:48,020
of this I I once called the fire department and they came

344
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:53,339
because I didn't take a second look I just that paused long enough to take a

345
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:58,338
second and look but I would have realized it was when nothing was needed

346
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:04,280
so um so last one and if you can take the mic

347
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:13,440
pushing this lady raise is a very important one to me uh I wonder if the

348
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:20,579
kind of situation they were facing was it Compassion or was it programmed response that you were supposed to do a

349
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:26,579
certain thing you certain way because we all face that it was a little bit slower so the programmed response yeah as

350
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:31,680
opposed to compassion a program a program response I suppose is acting on

351
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:37,740
habit or on on policy that we have that we see from our

352
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:44,400
society this is what you're supposed to do exactly yeah yeah so I think that uh you know if we keep

353
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:51,119
using this mirror of mindfulness to look at ourselves hopefully we'll recognize what's driving our

354
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,400
and if it's a program if it's a should um then I I put I would put that in the

355
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:04,079
category of reactivity because it's a kind of a surface response that comes from the the concepts ideas of what we

356
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:11,760
have and um and I would take the time then and really delve settled more deeply in

357
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,859
and see if there's a deeper source for for the compassion what could be either

358
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:22,079
or it could be combination of it too yeah thank you thank you okay so so

359
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,119
again so one of the things that I did in this talk I think is to

360
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,820
I distinguished or separated out um the aspiration

361
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:38,520
that someone to wish that someone suffering ends from our acting on it

362
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:46,400
it doesn't have to be so separate but by distinguishing them and separating them it's an encouragement to pause and

363
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,500
settle back and wait and see where the where the action might come from

364
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:57,720
and and in that looking more deeply it's a whole Ecology of what what is

365
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:05,579
accompanying what you call compassion and you might discover there's a lot there that's worth taking into account

366
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:12,359
and practicing with and before you act so thank you very much

367
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:15,440
and um
