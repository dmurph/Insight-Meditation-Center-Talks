1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:08,879
good evening good evening warm welcome a really warm welcome

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,559
wherever you might be and whenever you're listening to this

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,960
so we'll begin with a guided meditation

4
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,840
just a simple bringing the awareness to the sensations

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,640
of the body in a global way

6
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,399
sensing into what does it feel like right now

7
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,320
to have a body to be embodied

8
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:24,159
we might notice some general feelings of

9
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,360
energy restlessness or maybe the opposite of restlessness some

10
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:38,880
weariness maybe the mind is busy

11
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,880
can't quite connect with the body whatever is happening can we

12
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,320
welcome it in after all it is happening

13
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,960
so instead of trying to get rid of it can we just acknowledge it

14
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,759
and sometimes that's sufficient to

15
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,239
create the conditions for a different unfolding

16
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,879
but it's different if we acknowledge our experience

17
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,040
with an agenda that we're acknowledging it in order for it to go away or to be

18
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,040
different

19
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:46,599
can we acknowledge it simply because that's what's happening right now

20
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,760
been noticing the breathing the body is breathing

21
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:38,159
in a simple uncomplicated way noticing the inhales

22
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,560
and the exhales

23
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:03,560
letting the mind settle on the sensations of breathing

24
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:26,918
when we find ourselves lost in thought just very simply begin again

25
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,120
part of meditation practice

26
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,360
is to align ourselves with the truth of the moment

27
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:42,400
it's one way we could frame it that is to see clearly what is actually

28
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:49,400
happening what is our actual experience in this moment

29
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:23,199
in some ways we might say that so much of buddhist practice

30
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:31,599
is about seeing the truth of the moment if we can use that word truth

31
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:40,240
how is it now without all the extra story making

32
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,680
that we often add on top

33
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,039
we might gently inquire

34
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:57,640
what's actually happening right now

35
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,960
not in a way that we have to dig and find it

36
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:09,000
but in a way in which we open to it

37
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:23,960
what are the experiences that are being experienced right now

38
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:02,640
sometimes this word truth can feel

39
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:10,559
weighty but what if we just consider that

40
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:17,240
it's what's actually happening it's the reality of the moment

41
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,840
and with our meditation practice we can

42
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:31,279
become attuned to sensitive to aware of what's actually

43
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:37,120
happening as opposed to our ideas our fears our

44
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:44,399
concerns and this way

45
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:51,200
we can bring a certain amount of ease that happens when we are aligned

46
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,399
with what's actually happening and not lost in our thoughts

47
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:03,360
or stories even if what's happening is doesn't match our preferences it's very

48
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:10,000
difficult there can be some

49
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,960
delight in like well at least i'm facing it at least i'm turning towards it

50
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:27,080
and can see what how things really are and have a sense of perhaps what to do next

51
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:34,559
so so much about our benetation of practice is to help us see

52
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:41,840
what's actually happening the truth of the moment we might say

53
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,398
and we do this not only for ourselves but for others

54
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:56,799
so that we don't get swept along and the stories

55
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:03,679
the untruths perhaps so that we can have some steadiness some

56
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:09,520
groundedness for ourselves

57
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:18,600
and for others so that we might support them just as the truth supports us

58
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,919
you

59
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,080
so good evening good evening welcome welcome

60
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:22,159
so today i'd like to continue on my i don't know if we could say the word

61
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,679
journey but uh i'm talking about the pyramids these list of ten

62
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:33,200
perfections sometimes they're translated these ten qualities

63
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,120
that help a person in this movement towards greater and greater freedom

64
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:46,840
and one thing that's noteworthy about these is that they're not entirely about meditation

65
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,399
so much of the practice that in this tradition that we emphasize is about meditation but the

66
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:58,840
pyramids are about what we might do outside of meditation in our daily

67
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:05,480
lives so this list of 10 is generosity ethical behavior

68
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:11,519
renunciation wisdom energy patience

69
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:18,559
truth which is what we're going to talk about tonight resolve love and kindness and equanimity it's a

70
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:24,240
long list of ten run number seven truth

71
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:31,919
we can say that truth is you know to not lie it's the opposite of lying and

72
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:37,120
we might as well how do we define line and a kind of a modern day a

73
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,640
contemporary definition that i like is

74
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:51,279
that to lie is to intentionally mislead others when they expect honest communication

75
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,600
and that is to lie so that others will form beliefs that aren't true

76
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:06,559
so that they won't be aligned with reality but in fact they will be having some untruths in their minds

77
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,880
and sometimes we might have this idea that the truth is or you know to not lie or to speak the

78
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,080
truth is somehow like quaint or some charming

79
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:24,080
uh moral or ethical uh behavior or

80
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:30,240
something like this i know that um when i've given talks on the truth in the past there's a lot of protests a lot of

81
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:37,360
people yeah but what about this and what about that and they like to think about them all the exceptions what if the

82
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:45,039
nazis come to the door and they're asking for the jews shouldn't we lie then this is often something that we

83
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:50,559
hear the short answer is yes i think we should lie then

84
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:56,080
right to protect others there's different um

85
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:02,080
uh maybe degrees of harm until i in that case uh i would say that

86
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:09,358
degree of harm is much less than what might happen but one thing to think about what lying

87
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:17,040
is i like to think about like do these thought experiments and to think about the opposite

88
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:24,720
what would our world be like if there were no lying

89
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:34,079
imagine what if all the politicians told the truth all the time how things might be different would be

90
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:40,320
different imagine if manufacturers advertisers told the absolute truth about their

91
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:49,838
products at all times or what if we imagine the opposite

92
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,079
that is sometimes we just assume that the uh excuse me

93
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,480
that's the i'm gonna take a drink of water

94
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:26,560
okay so to return to this imagine if politicians always told the truth or if

95
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:31,838
manufacturers and advertisers always told the truth

96
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,520
it's almost mind-boggling to think about this right to think about how much we have structured our society in this way

97
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,960
because people don't tell the truth but not all the time

98
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,560
because we could do these thought experiments in the other in the opposite direction

99
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:56,320
that is that when there is a prescription when our doctor writes us a

100
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:04,000
prescription we believe the pharmacist when they say yes we put 30 tablets of

101
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,280
whatever it was that uh your doctor with a prescription for

102
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:14,960
and if the medication doesn't work in the way that you and your doctor were anticipating

103
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,079
you probably never wonder well maybe you didn't actually take the drug that was

104
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:27,760
prescribed can you imagine what would it be like if in fact we didn't trust pharmacists

105
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:34,320
we thought pharmacists lie and put different things in our pill bottles

106
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,800
what if we have this idea that the buddha lied

107
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:46,079
and then we would have to figure out which is true and which is a lie and

108
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,599
so sometimes we it's helpful to like take things to their extremes

109
00:36:53,599 --> 00:37:01,040
to help us to appreciate them at least that's the case for me so this idea of

110
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:08,240
lying or this to not lie to really take this to heart like if we

111
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,000
want the world to be a little bit different then how might we behave what is the

112
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,200
role that lying has in some of the problems in our lives or

113
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:26,160
in the world and maybe not lying is a direction a movement in that

114
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:33,200
direction towards a better life a better world we don't want to naively think that

115
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:39,680
telling the truth is going to solve all the problems but we could say

116
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,960
that addictions that we have

117
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,800
really the addictions can't blow up and to be the biggest problems often that they are

118
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,240
unless there is some lying involved often some of the our vices

119
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:03,359
go hand in hand with lying what if betrayals and fraud and

120
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:08,960
corruption these things also go with lying

121
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:16,160
you can't do them without lying so just this movement towards the direction

122
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:21,440
of a a better world and a better life

123
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:27,920
but why do we lie besides maybe because we want to do betrayal or fraud or corruption

124
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,359
or because we have an addiction but really people lie for a number of

125
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:38,880
reasons but one of the primary reasons is to

126
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:45,359
project a false image of themselves that is to avoid embarrassment

127
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:50,880
or to exaggerate their accomplishments they want people to think something about themselves

128
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:58,160
which isn't entirely accurate so it's about the the liar or the one who's lying having a

129
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,920
view of themselves that they want others to have even if they themselves don't believe it

130
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,680
but they want to convince others maybe or

131
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:16,000
let them not know the truth so because the liar has a sense of self

132
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:24,079
that they are trying to protect or maybe they're trying to defend they have this sense of self i'm the one who

133
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:30,480
always meditates and when you ask me i'm going to say yeah yeah i meditate daily

134
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,240
during that guided meditation i didn't get up and go to the refrigerator or

135
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:43,760
any of these other things we might do when we are refrig when we are meditating from home

136
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:51,200
so to defend oneself is another reason why we might lie to disguise a wrongdoing or

137
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,400
to conceal something that might have been harmful

138
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:03,119
to others or but to lie is um mostly about protecting

139
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,800
a strong sense of self as much as maybe a product also is uh related to a sense

140
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:16,720
of self you want to have some benefit or something i think the buddha recognizes he doesn't say so explicitly but

141
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,160
he recognized that the harmfulness of lying can do

142
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:29,520
many of you will know that um it's the one of the precepts it's the fourth precept is to refrain from false speech

143
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:35,359
so the buddha made it to a precept which is not the exact same

144
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:40,880
thing as a rule that everyone is compelled to follow otherwise there'll be some

145
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:47,119
terrible outcome instead these precepts are commitments that people make

146
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:53,280
when they have chosen to follow the buddhist path and the buddha

147
00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:00,000
said for all practitioners to have at least five of these precepts and the fourth one is to refrain from false

148
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,520
speech so if we want to move along the buddhist

149
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:13,040
path which includes this movement towards uprooting greed hatred and delusion this

150
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:19,040
movement towards seeing clearly less delusion

151
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:24,720
not being obfuscated by a greed and hatred

152
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,319
whereas we might say that lying is intentionally either

153
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:36,720
making so others can't see clearly or if we lie to ourselves making it so that we can't see clearly

154
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,760
and it's lying is has a root of greed hatred or delusion probably greed

155
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,640
or hatred underneath it this kind of is fueling it

156
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,160
so that in this way the buddha made a connection between truthfulness and

157
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:01,200
personal integrity this recognition that speaking the truth

158
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,240
comes from a practice of truthfulness comes from a commitment to truthfulness

159
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,359
and a commitment to one's spiritual practice this movement towards greater

160
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:18,720
and greater clarity we might say and we see this uh this buddha making

161
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:23,839
this connection between our personal integrity and whether we're teaching

162
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:29,599
truthfulness or speaking truthfulness in a teaching that he gave to his young son

163
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:36,560
rahula the tradition holds that rahula was seven years old at this time

164
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:43,440
and and he um and rahula had just um ordained so he was a novice of his

165
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:50,319
monastic and shortly after he had ordained the buddha

166
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:55,359
called rahula to his presence and when the buddha was speaking there

167
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,480
was a pot of water nearby we just had a little bit of water in it

168
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:09,520
and the buddha picked it up and showed it to rahula and said just so little is the spiritual worth of

169
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:15,279
a person who is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie

170
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:20,560
so little is this spiritual worth i'm using this language spiritual worth um i

171
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:26,480
heard to be kabody when he was describing the suta passage use this expression

172
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,960
and the suta it's now i don't remember the exact poly

173
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:40,480
but we could also translate it as you know the monks uh

174
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:47,520
practice or they're we'll just use that word the monks practice so spiritual worth

175
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:52,640
so the buddha shows see how there's just this little bit of water

176
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:58,000
in this pot here just in the same way the person that

177
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,280
would tell um who is not ashamed to tell a dipper deliberate lie so little is their spiritual worth but

178
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,720
then the buddha goes on he throws out the water

179
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:18,160
and he says so a person who is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie throws away whatever

180
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:24,000
little spiritual virtue they have been cultivating so if you've been

181
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,040
cultivating and you've been developing along the buddhist path whether it's

182
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,319
your meditation practice or wisdom or sila

183
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:41,040
ethical behavior when you lie you throw it out pretty strong statement

184
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,400
but the buddha continues he takes the pot and he turns it over

185
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,760
now that it's empty he turns it over and he says so a person who is not

186
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:58,880
ashamed to tell a deliberate lie turns their whole inner being upside down

187
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,400
right if we have this movement towards non-greed on hatred on delusion

188
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,440
this movement towards the truth seeing things clearly

189
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:17,359
when we start lying is we're going the opposite direction and it's a discordant with this movement

190
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:22,960
of wanting to have a greater and greater clarity

191
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,640
and then the buddha goes even further he says he

192
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:35,119
turns that pot right back upside and shows it to his son and he says see how

193
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:43,119
this pot is vacant and hollow and rahula responds yes

194
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:52,240
that's how vacant and hollow the spiritual value is in one who is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie

195
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:59,839
then he ends the discourse by saying when one is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie

196
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:07,440
there's no evil that one would not do thus rahula you should train yourself

197
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,680
i will not tell a deliberate lie even in jest

198
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:20,079
are pretty strong words i appreciate very much that the buddha is teaching a young person and he's

199
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:26,079
using something tangible you know this pot of water throwing it out it's like throwing out

200
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:32,880
your whatever you've been cultivating looking inside and seeing that it's hollow

201
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:41,119
strong words so as i mentioned earlier often people protest but you know maybe we should

202
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:47,280
there's like a little white lies and to address this i'm inspired by this

203
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:53,440
little book it's called lying that addresses this very topic it's

204
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:58,720
written by sam harris and

205
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:04,960
sam harris writes that when we say white lies to our friends presumably because we

206
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:10,000
want to not hurt their feelings

207
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,240
when we say white lies it compromises our connection to them

208
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,599
it compromises our relationship with them for a number of

209
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,800
reasons a number of ways and he says that well one is that we

210
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:34,400
deny them access to reality we deny them access to the truth

211
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:42,078
so their resulting ignorance often harms them in ways that we don't anticipate

212
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:48,880
do i look okay in this dress you know maybe

213
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,920
the dress is a little bit too revealing and they're going to

214
00:47:53,920 --> 00:48:00,160
something and they don't realize it for whatever reason

215
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:06,720
yes yes that dress looks great you're going to do fine but maybe as it happens they're seeing a

216
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:12,720
future employer or maybe they're going to a job interview or something like this

217
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:17,920
so maybe they're not knowing that their address is a little bit too revealing or maybe they're going to a monastery where

218
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:23,839
there's some monastics where there's an encouragement to for women to

219
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:29,200
cover their shoulders and their chest areas in a way that is supportive

220
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,960
for these monastics so

221
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:42,400
if we don't let them know what they don't know maybe we're doing them a disservice

222
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:49,760
but rather than saying a truth that may be hurtful

223
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:55,920
can we say to the septext if it's appropriate what is the subtext

224
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:01,119
does this dress look okay on me honey

225
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:07,200
i love you no matter what you wear honey i think you're beautiful

226
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,880
even when you're in your pjs whatever it might be so

227
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:20,000
maybe the way to answer the question is to address what's the question underneath that's being

228
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:27,119
asked which requires us to be sensitive and to be on our toes

229
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:35,359
and then sam harris continues and he says that somehow if we are telling white lies to our friends or family

230
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:42,760
members or partners it somehow seems a failure of friendship

231
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:52,720
that in some circumstances some circumstances false encouragement can be costly to another person

232
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:58,240
yeah that was great when in fact it maybe it was good but there were some

233
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:05,839
ways in which they could do better and maybe they're not encouraged to

234
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:12,559
do a little bit better because they think that they did great but if they had some feedback it would

235
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:17,839
make a difference yeah and this art of giving feedback is

236
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:23,280
so it's a real skill and it's sometimes uncomfortable to

237
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,800
receive it it's uncomfortable to give it but if we're a friend we will find the

238
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:34,240
right time and in the right way

239
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:40,400
time might be one of the key components here maybe when they're

240
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:46,800
specifically asking for feedback or maybe in the context of

241
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,920
something else and maybe it could be said maybe they gave a talk that didn't

242
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:58,800
go so well we can you know start the conversation i i don't know exactly how to do this but it could be well what do

243
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:05,359
you think went well or i really appreciated this but i admit that i got a little lost when

244
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:11,760
you were doing that or i i i felt um it was a

245
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,760
different uh feeling a different mood the mood shifted when you did this or i don't know

246
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:26,559
i'm just making this up but this idea that not telling the truth is a failure of friendship

247
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:33,599
so that also might be a way in which we can understand that to

248
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:39,680
receive feedback can be a way in which friends are taking care of us even if it does sting a

249
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:46,000
little bit and this goes to something else that if

250
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,640
we don't say something to our friend and instead we are offering

251
00:51:52,640 --> 00:52:00,400
insincere praise sam harris states that it's more like to treat others like children

252
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:06,720
it's to treat them in such that they can't handle it or that they

253
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:12,720
won't be able to make some adjustments or won't be able to

254
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:21,520
understand and see like oh okay yeah that that's a good point actually i didn't realize that

255
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:26,318
and wouldn't we rather hear this things that are

256
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:35,039
maybe could use a little polishing or some little

257
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:43,520
tweaking why don't i use this word wouldn't we rather hear that from our friends

258
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:50,960
when we know that it comes from because they care about us and that they want the best for us

259
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:58,800
so this idea of not telling the truth sometimes is a

260
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:05,839
failure of friendship and then just this recognition also that trust is eroded when we don't tell the

261
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:13,119
truth if others find out then these tiny erosions of trust they

262
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:19,760
add up and they can be insidious because they often are never remedied they are

263
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:27,640
just a little and that chips away at the relationship

264
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:34,880
and so when there's these failures of integrity people remember that

265
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:41,599
and even if we never talk about it they remember it so this the importance

266
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:47,440
of truthfulness in our relationships so the buddha was pointing to

267
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,559
the importance of it for our integrity

268
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:57,920
but in addition we know that it's important for relationships and we know that the buddha often is

269
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:06,160
talking about the importance of kaliana mitta so is there a way

270
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:11,440
that we can speak the truth that is kind

271
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:19,599
beneficial and timely not the truth just for the truth's sake

272
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:25,760
but can we say it in such a way that is supportive

273
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:33,200
we can see where this is a par me this is a practice in our daily life that is that's

274
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:39,599
it's in our interactions with others and as well as with ourselves when we're on

275
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:45,839
the cushion are we seeing things clearly are we seeing things

276
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:50,760
are we telling the the truth to ourselves

277
00:54:52,240 --> 00:55:00,318
are we seeing the way that greed hatred or delusion might be showing up maybe not

278
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:10,319
so some of the benefits of course maybe it's obvious but

279
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:15,599
if we have this commitment to truthful speech it also has this has a sense of

280
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:22,319
responsibility this commitment to this truthful representation of what we know

281
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:30,319
and this emphasis on a truthful representation of what we know supports our own quest

282
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:38,720
our own journey our own path for truth for seeing things clearly

283
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:45,280
and one way that we can preserve the truth is the buddha

284
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:52,720
is in another suta there's a story where a brahmana which is the priest of the

285
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:58,559
dominant religious tradition of the time he says to the buddha this priest says to the buddha

286
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:04,480
with regard to the ancient brahmanic hymns so those are their sacred scriptures

287
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:10,559
with regard to the ancient brahmanic hymns that have come down through oral transmission that is they've been

288
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:16,400
memorized through the years this was happening even before buddhism

289
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:24,079
that have come down through oral transmission preserved in the collections the brahmins have come to the definite conclusion

290
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:31,838
only this is true anything else is wrong

291
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:38,240
and then the buddha responds by asking him well do you know this to be true have you

292
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:45,599
seen this to be true no as your teacher no one didn't seen this to be true no

293
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:51,359
as your teacher's teacher as your teacher's teacher has the people who created the hymns

294
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:56,960
do they know this to be true and the answer is no so then the buddha

295
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:04,319
says well you are saying this out of faith and then the buddha says

296
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:11,359
there are five things that can turn out to be turn out in two ways true or false

297
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:17,760
and these five things are things that are held out of faith things that are held out of preference

298
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:23,839
things that are held because of an oral tradition this is what we've always done for example

299
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:29,040
or for reasoned contemplation considering often philosophers are doing

300
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:36,079
this or acceptance of a view after consideration maybe you've heard something and you thought

301
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:44,240
well okay yeah i believe that to be true so all five of these may be true

302
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:50,160
but they may not be true also the buddha points out that even though

303
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:55,680
you have full faith in something it may be false just in the same way even if

304
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:01,200
you don't have full face faith in something it may be true

305
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:08,960
even though we have a strong preference for something it may be false and if we don't have a preference it may

306
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:18,079
be true and he goes through this with the other five so then he says we preserve the truth

307
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:26,559
when we say that under these conditions a wise person to preserve the truth

308
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:33,200
would not come to the definite conclusion just saying only this is true anything else is wrong but they would

309
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:40,079
preserve the truth by saying my faith is thus

310
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:45,119
and then say whatever they want to say my preference is thus

311
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:50,799
and say whatever they want to say i believe this because the tradition has

312
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:57,359
it or i believe this reasoned contemplation i've thought about this and this is my

313
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:02,799
current thinking so this idea of to preserve the truth to

314
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:09,040
maybe let people know our authority or why we believe it or what's underneath

315
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:14,160
supporting those so then we can let people know

316
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:20,720
yes i believe this because i read it in this newspaper i heard it from this person i'm not sure but this sounds true

317
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:29,359
to me and this way this we can in our speech we can really

318
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:34,799
emphasize this commitment to truth and not trying to mislead people or but

319
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:39,920
instead to let them know what our current thinking is

320
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:45,040
let them know what we're imagining to be true or let them know

321
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:51,359
what our hypotheses are or what we have faith in as opposed to saying

322
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:56,400
only this is true and anything else is wrong

323
00:59:58,839 --> 01:00:06,160
truthfulness the seventh parame this shows up in so many different ways

324
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:11,839
in our lives i've talked about a few of them truthfulness and speech

325
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:17,359
i like wanting to see clearly in our meditation practice

326
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:23,760
helping our friends what are some other ways

327
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:30,720
which you might have see how truth or the commitment to truth might show up in our lives and might support not only

328
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:38,640
our lives but the lives of others in which we can be part of this movement towards

329
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:44,160
truth and greater peace and greater freedom

330
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:49,599
for the benefit of all beings everywhere

331
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:52,839
thank you
