1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:08,278
hello everyone and

2
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:16,040
welcome and um hello

3
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:22,400
everyone a few words for introduction to this

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,400
meditation

5
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:33,600
where for these last uh few months now we've been doing

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:42,039
satiana the practices for establishing awareness and uh the Buddha calls these

7
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:50,640
practices the practices of cultivating awareness to be a heap a

8
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,960
mountain of wholesomeness of

9
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:02,760
skillfulness he says that um the five hindrances which are one of the things

10
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:11,680
we've looked at in this these weeks is a heap of unh wholesomeness

11
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,759
unskillfulness and this idea that mindfulness and what we're cultivating here is what's skillful what's wholesome

12
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,759
what's nourishing what's healthy serves as a very useful guide

13
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,840
for how to practice mindfulness how to evoke and bring

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,240
forth uh a clear and clear awareness of the present

15
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:46,000
moment we do it in a way that is uh skillful wholesome it feels healthy

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,280
feels like welcoming for us to do to chase after meditation out of

17
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,560
greed to use meditation to try to get rid of something we don't like

18
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,880
that's that's using mindfulness that according to the five hindrances we just

19
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,920
brings unskillfulness it brings uh poor

20
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,760
results so as you practice this practice of mindfulness one of the things to be

21
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,040
attentive to is the quality of your practice the

22
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,640
way in which you practice is it open-handed is it

23
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,800
openhearted is it open-minded to what is here open-handed

24
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,640
meaning uh you're just here to experience what is here in a generous

25
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,000
way openhearted means that uh your your

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,159
care your kindness is available you're caring for yourself in

27
00:02:53,159 --> 00:03:00,920
this approach and open-minded means you're available for whatever the experience is

28
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:09,879
you're willing to be present for things without expectation without agendas just

29
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:15,400
present and um maybe we take it on faith initially that this is for the Buddha

30
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:23,440
this is one of the most healthy skillful things psychologically spiritually healthy things a person can do is to be

31
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,400
bringing forth this Clarity of awareness to the present moment and I think part of the reason it's considered so healthy

32
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,519
so skillful is that it's a magnet for so

33
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:43,319
many other good qualities it's almost as if um awareness

34
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:49,680
clear awareness of the present is making open space

35
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:56,000
for uh in which uh other skillful States other wholesome ways of being can

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,239
Surface and come into it and that open space face holds that bay or doesn't

37
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:09,200
make room for doesn't really help th help the hindrances Thrive the

38
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:17,959
hindrances Thrive when we're not paying attention when we're not creating that open space where we don't have clear

39
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:25,440
awareness so in these all these ways of talking the word

40
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:33,160
open is emphasized open-handed open hearted open-minded open

41
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,840
space so may as you sit today you be attentive and

42
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,199
careful that the way in which you practice how you bring forth present

43
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:51,439
moment awareness feels has a good feeling for

44
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:58,639
you and it's a kind of way of being a friend to yourself perhaps or just that

45
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:06,400
other people would be attracted to you in the goodness and the clarity Simplicity of being of how you are with

46
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,479
your experience so other things

47
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:18,680
come so to begin maybe caring for yourself

48
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,720
by your posture you

49
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:31,240
take maybe taking the time so your body feels that you're attending to it and

50
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,319
caring for it a posture that the best of your

51
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:44,240
ability seems like a good posture for meditation for your body to be

52
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:55,919
in and gently closing your eyes and maybe with the eyes

53
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:03,759
closed before meditating just to let your attention roam around your

54
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:13,520
body with an open awareness of this is how it is this is how it's feeling

55
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,039
now being careful with how how your attend how your

56
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:39,039
awareness can just be with yourself for a few moments here maybe just to

57
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:47,240
discover to be receptive to recognize how your body

58
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:54,080
is and maybe how you are in an open-handed

59
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,918
openhearted open-minded way

60
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,360
and gently gently a little deeper breathing

61
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:16,680
than usual so that when you exhale maybe you exhale with a little

62
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:25,599
bit of relief relaxation here now

63
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:46,319
a gentle little deeper breath than usual maybe with the

64
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,800
inhale infusing awareness with more clarity more

65
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:01,440
openness awareness becomes a little more expansive or receptive

66
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:18,080
and on the exhale the awareness rides along with the exhale

67
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:40,080
letting your breathing return to normal and anytime your mind wonders off

68
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,600
and it's time to begin again with your breathing in the present

69
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:54,720
moment see if you can make the beginning be enjoyable or Pleasant

70
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,560
friendly and as you stay with the breathing or stay with your

71
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:10,880
experience stay with it in a in some manner simple relaxed

72
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,600
manner that is friendly or feels

73
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,959
healthy so that it feel you you have the feeling oh this is good to hang out with

74
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:31,360
this kind of this kind of awareness here and

75
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:49,480
now and whatever you're aware of body feelings mind

76
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,600
States thoughts

77
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,320

remember to be aware in an open

way where awareness is an

104
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,799
opening awareness opens

105
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
itself

106
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440

107
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360

for

110
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,240
e e

111
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:48,320
as we come to the end of this sitting to

112
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:54,480
consider what you know about being aware being

113
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:02,480
attentive in an open way without expectations or demands

114
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,760
without pulling away

115
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:16,440
or wanting something just aware open handed open-minded

116
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:23,720
openhearted almost like as you're aware you're making

117
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:29,679
space making a room and to

118
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:35,240
think about doing this for other people that you

119
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:41,760
encounter how I'm being aware of them a little bit not too much a little

120
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:48,080
bit it's like you're making room for them

121
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:57,158
space you're with them in open handed openhearted open-minded way

122
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:06,440
and if you're not can you be aware of

123
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:22,880
that and in being aware of it can you try to open up a little bit open clear

124
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:30,039
awareness of others what would it be like to be with others that

125
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:46,600
way and it is healthy wholesome to apply what we learn about

126
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:52,120
attention in meditation to how we can attend kindly

127
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:58,240
to others to be aware of others without the

128
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,559
hindrances getting in the

129
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:12,080
way may through this practice that we do may we support the

130
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:21,919
possibility for all beings to be happy for all beings to be

131
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,640
safe for all beings to be peaceful

132
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,760
for all beings to be

133
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:53,109
[Music]

134
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,919
free

135
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,919
e e

136
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:23,039
so so we've gone through for these last four months the four foundations for

137
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,080
awareness for awakening awareness

138
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:34,480
and um these four awarenesses four areas of

139
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:41,360
developing awareness and can work together cooperatively support each

140
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:49,600
other and um they make a very interesting um uh perspective very useful

141
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,919
perspective for us to um bring to our

142
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:02,200
lives so often when when we uh pay attention give attention take

143
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,519
in perceive the world around us or the world inside of us it's all too easy to

144
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:13,279
do it with uh preconceived ideas uh preconceived

145
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:19,760
agendas um being oriented to certain areas certain things that we think are

146
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:26,039
important and not to automatically dismiss those even if it's a useful way

147
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:31,120
to look at things the way you look at things um sometimes it's it can be useful to

148
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:38,799
find a new way for a a fresh perspective for our uh for perspective uh for our

149
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:47,480
perception of the world ourselves and um so these four foundations four areas are kind of

150
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:55,720
interesting to keep them in mind use these perspectives when looking at our life so if for

151
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,919
example uh some people might be oriented towards uh what's in it for me what is

152
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:08,800
it what what am I going to get out of this experience in satiana we wouldn't do

153
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,878
that instead we would say what is the physical experience here what's the

154
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:18,960
feeling tone that's here what's the Mind State that's present and what are what's

155
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:26,398
the Damas what are these processes of being caught or being free that are playing out as I practice

156
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:31,679
here it could could be that uh when we look at the world we look at the world

157
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:37,800
through what we don't like what uh what frightens us or what's unpleasant for us

158
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:44,280
and um and we we react to that from that point of view and um but instead of that we can

159
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:49,560
ask this you know how does it physically how is it feeling tone how is it mind

160
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:56,040
States how is it with the Damas it could be we um there's a lot of

161
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:03,160
uh uh self orientation going on instead of that we do the four

162
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:08,400
foundations so these are like going through the scales we can ask ourselves

163
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:15,359
given what's happening now maybe let's look at them from these Vantage Point these are the these are

164
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:21,400
the four Vantage points that the Buddha offers uh for the path to Awakening to

165
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:26,680
Freedom a path to everything that's wholesome or skillful a heap of

166
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:33,880
skillfulness heap of wholesomeness for the Buddha this is phenomenally healthy and beneficial to

167
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,280
cultivate this kind of awareness and so so and the vehicle he

168
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:46,520
does this or the medium is not through orientations that are about me myself

169
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:53,160
and mine of course it's about you in a certain way but that's not the orientation which with which we're

170
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:58,440
looking and analyzing understanding the situation rather he's saying for the

171
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:06,079
purposes of cultivating this open awareness that's liberating that's freeing healthy and

172
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:11,200
wonderful um notice how it is in your body notice your

173
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:17,920
body notice uh the feeling tones of How It's taken in and registered as pleasant

174
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:24,160
unpleasant or neither notice the qualities of the Mind the state of the mind is it contracted

175
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:33,119
is it expansive is it filled with the um uh intense desire or intense aversion

176
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:38,400
or is it not is it does a mind feel caught does a mind feel

177
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,560
free and those categories have no self in them it's not

178
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:49,280
like saying am I caught am I filled with greed am I aversive am I

179
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,960
contracted um there's there none of the instructions in the saatana involve the

180
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:02,760
perspective of me s and ey it can be such a relief it can be a

181
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:09,319
challenge because of the how common it is to have that perspective but to uh

182
00:37:09,319 --> 00:37:15,359
put it aside or evoke a different perspective the advantage of that is the

183
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:20,720
perspective of looking at things from the point of view of me and myself in mind what's in it for me and how am I

184
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:27,000
being seen and what's good for me and how I am is that that's a magnet for all

185
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:34,160
kinds of of um unskillful unhealthy attitude states of Mind situations it

186
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:41,040
tends to one where the other it tends to close the space inside of us around us

187
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:47,400
uh it tends to uh reduce the open-handedness the open-heartedness the open

188
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,000
mindedness and so instead of going that direction like you know what's what's

189
00:37:53,000 --> 00:38:00,599
happening to me how am I doing how are people treating me what's going on here for for me and um how am I improving am

190
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:06,720
I'm getting better uh am I getting worse I'm a meditation failure all these

191
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:15,640
things you can say with the word I or me um uh see if you can put them aside

192
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:22,119
and bring into play a different perspective the four foundations and so what you've learned

193
00:38:22,119 --> 00:38:29,400
about mindfulness of the body um you know there's all these we talked about

194
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,839
um you know go back and read some of the exercises so or listen to some of these

195
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:43,000
talks about mindfulness of the body and cultivate this greater connection to the body it is you but you don't have to

196
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,359
think about it being you of course this is who you're paying attention to you're paying attention to

197
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:54,560
your body it's you're paying attention to yourself but um it's uh extra to put

198
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:01,319
that idea to operate to to analyze to react to the situation from the study of

199
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:09,119
Me Myself and mind especially when we're meditating so just the body the Simplicity of it the feeling tones the

200
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:19,720
Mind States the dhas and um and then the orientation also is not

201
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:27,400
to get anything of it or understand or analyze situation but to begin tuning in

202
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:35,720
waking up to that uh the changing nature of experience the flow of present moment

203
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:41,760
experience the River of Life that goes through and things are always changing always moving and to do it from the

204
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:48,400
perspective of these four foundations and um so there's also a different perspective the perspective of

205
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,560
change things coming and going and um and to do that with an

206
00:39:53,560 --> 00:40:01,920
openhearted open-minded way and this is another this is a um a very helpful way

207
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,599
to loosen the grip of attachments to just rest or float or or just keep

208
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:17,359
opening to um the flow of change the flow of experience that's only

209
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:23,520
available or best available when we're centered in Awareness in these direct

210
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,800
experience of body feelings mind States and the Dumas let it all just

211
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:37,680
flow teaching us how not to cling not to grasp the five hindrances are forms of

212
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:44,560
grasping forms of clinging that diminish the freedom that diminish the clarity in which we can see

213
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,839
things and for the Buddha diminish our wisdom when you're caught in the five

214
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:56,440
hindrances bring forth the the U the four foundations when you're caught in a

215
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:03,599
hindrance how is set in the body what's the feeling tone of it what are the Mind states that are there and then just be

216
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,160
really present for each hindrance in and of itself as it comes and goes letting

217
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:14,880
go of it and this uh this referencing back

218
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,920
then through the four foundations applies also to the way in which we

219
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:28,400
practice the way that we meditate and from time to time it's good to go through the

220
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,720
these steps the scales the four Foundation scales and to

221
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:41,119
see uh in relationship to how you're practicing how you're being mindful how you're meditating how does it feel in

222
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:47,800
your body how you're doing it are you straining is it tightening up are you

223
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:54,040
resisting uh are you sluggish are you collapsing are you um are you kind of

224
00:41:54,040 --> 00:42:00,240
draining in your body because you're not really in it how what's happening in your body what's

225
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,680
happening with uh feeling tones is what's the feeling tone of how you're

226
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:11,280
practicing of how you're doing mindful um is it Pleasant or

227
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,440
unpleasant is it is it something it feels good to do or not what is the Mind state with which

228
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,240
you're doing mindfulness is the mindful is the mindate with greed or aversion or

229
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:31,960
delusion is the mindset expansive or or is it liberating or is it settled what's

230
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:39,319
the Mind State and then in the way that you practice the five areas of the fourth

231
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:45,920
Foundation are the hindrances that play even subtly are we entangled knotted up

232
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:54,599
in anything uh are we caught in identity Me Myself and mine around the five

233
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:01,640
Aggregates or are the seven factors of Awakening kind of peing their head up as we're

234
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:08,200
practicing are they kind of nearby or potentially nearby are they creating the space where those wonderful

235
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:15,200
factors can begin to grow and in the how we're paying attention is it we seeing in a way

236
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,480
that's allows us to see the four noble truths which is another way of saying

237
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:27,400
seeing the changing nature of things so um how so to bring bringing

238
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:33,000
these together these four foundations and when we sit down to meditate uh

239
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,160
different times we might choose one of the foundations more than another Foundation because that seems to be a

240
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:44,480
Salient one it seems like the good one with which to develop awareness I find it's really useful to come back to

241
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:50,000
breathing over and over again the first very first exercise uh stay in the body I find be

242
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,960
really useful and then the other ones as needed as is helpful and sometimes I'll

243
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:01,920
go through the four just okay what how's it this area how's it here in relationship to whatever is happening in

244
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,160
the moment so this is a way of bringing the four foundations together and and

245
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:14,920
cooperating them and how they are mutually supportive of each other and how this works as a whole the unified ho

246
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:23,559
there's a unified way bringing together all these practices um for the purposes

247
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:29,640
of open awareness openhearted open-minded

248
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:38,280
open-handed attention to ourselves and the world so thank you
