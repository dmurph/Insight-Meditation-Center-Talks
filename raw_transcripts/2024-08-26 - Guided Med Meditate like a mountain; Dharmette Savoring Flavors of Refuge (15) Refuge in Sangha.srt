1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:08,480
yeah good morning good day everyone uh from all around the world and here we

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,559
are gathering again uh in this uh 7 a.m.

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,640
Pacific time meditation and

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:27,279
Dad I just kind of feel a sense of warmth coming in so uh maybe you feel

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,840
that way too kind of sense of

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:40,120
a so I want to orient ourselves on a little bit for our meditation uh for

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:46,280
this days for this week I'd like to evoke a nature-based

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,640
metaphor uh as we meditate and it builds up and uh you

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:01,000
know from one day to another it doesn't have to be that way so if you're join in between it's not a problem um but I like

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:09,280
to to to start today with this metaphor or a simile of sitting like a

11
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,320
mountain maybe that evokes some kind of a stability or have uh some different

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,520
associations you may have and so I'll drop that in for meditation today and

13
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:33,479
then in the next uh few days and I will build up uh this this metaphor and so

14
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,640
here we go and I'm going to ring bell and we'll

15
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,189
[Music]

16
00:01:52,280 --> 00:02:01,840
start taking a few long deep breath as you breathe out

17
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,360
arriving arriving here and

18
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:21,879
now maybe there is a kind of a familiarity a sense of a coming

19
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:28,760
home coming home to ourselves

20
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:38,080
this moment

21
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,680
here face this place where we

22
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:53,000
sit or stand or lie down

23
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:19,400
being patient to arrive so we're not jerking our

24
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,799
minds simple presence

25
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,760
mindfulness front and a

26
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,159
center mindfulness all around

27
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:24,639
mindfulness receiving meeting what's

28
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,000
here to be known

29
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:41,600
maybe the overall sense of the body

30
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:04,840
sitting or sense of the contact of the body with the Earth

31
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:34,080
underneath gentle turn your attention to the

32
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:40,400
contact between the body and the Earth

33
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:54,280
underneath maybe you feel the weight settling down

34
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,919
hardness of the sit

35
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,400
bones stability of the pelvic floor

36
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:57,120
softening and releasing the body towards the Earth

37
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:09,879
there is a natural relational pull of gravity

38
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:37,199
allow this earthy body resting on Earth

39
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,639
sitting like a

mountain quiet Mountain

41
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:52,040
allow your attention to rest here if you

42
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,560
like steady

43
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:11,240
still connected with the Earth

e e

80
00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:56,320
in this last few minutes of the meditation

81
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,398
together allow yourself to

82
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:10,640
feel feel and sense the community practicing

83
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,600
together like walking into a mountain

84
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,720
range maybe you can feel the

85
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:33,519
potency of the vast Stillness and

86
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,840
quiet maybe the Stillness can

87
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,039
expand to become back

88
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,080
fast the silence can

89
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,279
expand that become

90
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:25,640
vast and a silence that includes the sounds all around

91
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:35,000
and the Stillness that can include

92
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:04,200
movements feeling and sensing the good goodness of a practicing in community

93
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,480
together so as if we're offering blessings and

94
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:21,278
gifts to ourselves and to each other

95
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:38,740
[Music]

96
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:54,639
maybe this bowing is a expression of gratitude to practice in

97
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:03,039
s gratitude yourself to show up here in this

98
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:18,639
way so with that and I'm going to

99
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:24,720
transition um for this week's

100
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:31,760
topic I'd like to share some Reflections about this uh word

101
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:39,919
refuge and refuge is a prominent Buddhist concept since the days of the

102
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:49,440
Buddha and The Refuge itself um you know may evoke different um feelings for

103
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,679
people and I want to offer some different words that are also associated

104
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:02,080
with this notion of ref refuge and so I'm going to drop in some

105
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:07,679
of those words so

106
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:14,760
protection shelter sanctu our

107
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:22,039
safety a refuge being a place to rest in or a safe

108
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:30,440
container a sense of a home or a ground to rest

109
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:40,039
on and so all those words for me kind of evoke a sense of Refuge uh in some

110
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:47,840
way and um the Resonance of Refuge has grown more and more uh multi-dimensional

111
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:53,840
and came alive over the years of a practice and learning and so I like to

112
00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:00,440
make attempt to share some of this different Di Dimensions uh different

113
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:09,320
aspects and I'm also calling it uh kind of different flavors of or textures of

114
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:18,360
Refuge uh for this week and so touching in this into this uh sense of Refuge in

115
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:23,720
different ways and today I kind of hinted in uh

116
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:30,799
towards the end of our meditation together I like to start with refuge in

117
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:36,559
s s this PO term means a community that

118
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:41,639
practices and learns together learns together the

119
00:33:41,639 --> 00:33:49,600
Dharma and so like uh how we've been doing and this is 7 a.m. um

120
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:56,880
Gatherings we're forming a sa uh even though it's in a virtual field and uh

121
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:03,000
we're practicing together and I like to speak about Sana

122
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:11,000
first because for many people uh Sana is where we began to find a sense of a

123
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:20,599
refuge a spiritual home a shelter a protection or a safe container a

124
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:28,480
sanctuary and that's how I began so my first exposure to Buddhism and Buddhist

125
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:36,520
practices were not based on a books or doctrines or teachings and there was no

126
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:42,118
YouTube back then and there was you know I didn't know about the recordings

127
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:49,480
and and uh so some of this didn't even even existed uh didn't didn't even exist

128
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:56,200
um back then so for me and it began when I first

129
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:02,280
encountered a group of Buddhist uh in my uh College

130
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:09,240
time uh when I met this group of people I distinctly noticed something

131
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:17,079
very different and this is a group people that expressed qualities of a generosity

132
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:25,720
kindness and Care in so many different ways uh that um was quite intriguing for

133
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:33,400
me and I was drawn towards it immediately and so that was the

134
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,760
beginning of my Dharma journey and

135
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:45,920
um reflecting forward you know all the way to this day throughout my Dharma

136
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:54,200
Journey Sana has been a refuge um for me as a potent force uh to

137
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:02,000
this state uh in the realm of Buddha Dharma s

138
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,599
specifically refers to the community that uh learns and practices a Dharma

139
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:14,240
and so it's not just any social Community which has its own

140
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:21,839
function um but the SAA has a specific function and specific

141
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:27,800
purpose as a Dharma practitioners each person in the s

142
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:34,160
learns to cultivate wholesome qualities of a heart and mind and the body uh in

143
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:41,280
the way that the supports a well-being a deeper care of ourselves and for each

144
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,520
other and for the whole world and that is so for the generations

145
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:54,839
of aanga that um came from ancient times all the way

146
00:36:54,839 --> 00:37:00,640
till now and for me uh kind of reflecting and

147
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:06,000
observing this 7 a.m. sa uh over the

148
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:15,040
past few years since the beginning of the pandemic I'm feeling this growing sense

149
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:21,079
of care connectedness and

150
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:29,319
warmth and the deeper kind of resonance with each other in some way

151
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:36,960
and this kind of a collective Force inspires and sustains us and support us

152
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,359
uh in our in our own Dharma journey and support each

153
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:50,480
other maybe what has been uh surprising for some of us uh

154
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:57,720
is that somehow this virtual world would have this kind

155
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:05,960
of palpable sense for us that I don't think I had imagined

156
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:15,040
this no one probably could have imagined this um some decades ago and how how is

157
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:21,560
this possible you know in our meditation the last few minutes of a meditation I

158
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:27,560
invited for us to kind of tune in to some of this

159
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:34,440
Collective sense a kind of a field we're in the field of a practice together even

160
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:40,720
though we're not physically together we're quite geographically dispersed all

161
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:49,960
over on this planet and yet we can have a sense maybe a hint of

162
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:54,640
it wow we're together here

163
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,440
practicing that's truly something

164
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:10,839
and for AA to be a refuge a sanctuary a home for each of us I also wanted to say

165
00:39:10,839 --> 00:39:18,520
that uh it also had to go beyond being an external entity that we go to whether

166
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:23,960
it's virtual or not one of the most important function

167
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:31,960
of a refuge in Sanaa is that it helps each of us to turn

168
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:38,480
inward to look within and so there is this outside in

169
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:47,800
kind of effect here when we're affected by the S people who practice Dharma we

170
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:54,319
are changed by it and so it invites us to touch in

171
00:39:54,319 --> 00:40:00,079
inside for us to feel and sense what is being

172
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:06,280
affected and how does it shape and enchange us from

173
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:12,880
within the Buddha said to his disciples that when you're when you're with good

174
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:21,680
com companions when they practice the Noble eight-fold Path then you will do so

175
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:30,480
too and so that's that outside in kind of effect that I'm speaking

176
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:37,000
about and at the same time there is

177
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,760
also uh a kind of inside out

178
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:50,640
effect when we are changed by The Refuge in

179
00:40:50,640 --> 00:41:01,680
Sana our Behavior our heart and mind learn to stay with what we aspire to

180
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:08,000
cultivate and more and more this have effect on the broader

181
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:16,800
world we live in maybe start with the environment we're in maybe it has effect for the

182
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:25,920
people around you and so in this way um practicing the Refuge or savoring

183
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:35,759
in The Refuge of a s it has this kind of outside in and inside out kind of

184
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:43,640
movements so Refuge inanga is not static and it's Dynamic

185
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:49,240
alive and kind of um like a living

186
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:55,680

187
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:02,920
2,600 years ago all the way to present within and

188
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:12,079

189
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:19,240
living Dynamic um such that whatever goodness

190
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:29,040
