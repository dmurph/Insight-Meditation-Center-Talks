00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,799
greetings friends greetings from wherever in the world you're joining

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:14,880
so today we come to the fifth and final day of our exploration of the sati

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,640
patana suttas refrain together and

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,960
the refrain the part that we have come to today is

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,800
really the last part the last sentence the last couple of sentences

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,920
and um i'll i'll review the entire uh

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:48,320
refrain at the end uh in the darmet but maybe what i will read is just the refrain uh the last

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,760
part we're exploring today which is

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:06,960
one um one abides independent not clinging to anything in the world

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,480
that is how in regard to the body one contemplates the body but really the sentence here

11
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:19,040
[Music] is one abides independent not clinging

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,040
to anything in the world two aspects here abiding independently

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,280
and not clinging to anything in the world so the different aspects that we have

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,840
practiced uh and mentioned culminate to this

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,159
internal external contemplating the body internally

16
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:51,200
externally both internally and externally as well as

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,240
contemplating the nature of arising and passing away

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,560
knowing that there is a body this this lexical

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:11,599
use the skillful use of lexical noting there is a body there is a body

20
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,560
all culminating to [Music] abiding independently independently

21
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,160
not clinging to anything in the world

22
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:31,200
so so without further ado let's practice

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,080
in meditation together because life can be practiced or a practice can be practicing right now

24
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,480
listening and sitting with kindness and awareness so not to make

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,920
practice only limited to closing our eyes and meditating but let's meditate together let's meditate

26
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,920
together so ah

27
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,000
arriving arriving in our seat

28
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,159
arriving here

29
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:29,360
letting go letting go [Music] not clinging to anything in the world

30
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,840
letting go in this moment in time

31
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,400
not clinging not clinging to thoughts

32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,840
not clinging to memories of the past

33
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,760
our preoccupations with the future

34
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,760
not even clinging to the present

35
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:36,840
as the sutta says not clinging to anything in the world

36
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:39,080
not clinging as thoughts arise

37
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,240
as entanglements perhaps arise not clinging releasing

38
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,319
abiding abiding independently abiding

39
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,960
can there be a moment of spaciousness

40
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:55,440
not needing not needing anything not lusting after this or that or

41
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,039
wanting any particular experience

42
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,919
abiding abiding independently

as you drop it into your body not thinking about it don't try to analyze

47
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,160
but drop it in

48
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,600

not clinging not clinging to greed once

62
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,440
ruminations

63
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,799
in the mind

64
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,480
not clinging

65
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:58,320

independent of greed hatred

67
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,960
abiding independently

68
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:40,240
of the usual habit patterns of the mind and heart can we abide independently

69
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:47,320
independent of of those

70
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:15,279
and as we bring this practice period together giving thanks giving thanks for

71
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:23,120
this opportunity this privilege to come together

72
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:30,720
if not in space but in time to cultivate to cultivate our hearts our

73
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:40,200
minds in kindness in good will

74
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:48,320
in wisdom in non-reactivity and letting go in non-clinging

75
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:54,480
to greed and hatred to give thanks for this opportunity that

76
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:03,919
we have come together even if for a moment there was a sense of independence from the typical patterns

77
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:12,799
there was a moment of freedom a moment of letting go peace ease

78
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,880
celebrating that moment and even if it wasn't that moment whether there was a lot of

79
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,320
delusion confusion

80
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,440
trusting we have planted seeds that were flower in the future

81
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:38,240
if we align our intention with goodness and offering this

82
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:45,440
this collective cultivation no matter how shoddy we

83
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:52,320
deem it to be offering the goodness of ourselves

84
00:30:52,320 --> 00:31:00,000
together with the community offering it to the world to others as a gift

85
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,600
here i've done my best

86
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:13,840
if i could have done any better or differently i would have it's the best offering i have in this

87
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:21,360
limited time on earth my best offering

88
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,480
and sharing sharing giving generously

89
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:37,120
this gift for the benefit of all beings everywhere especially those

90
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,600
in war zones

91
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,518
holding witness wishing safety and ease

92
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:02,320
for all beings everywhere may all beings be happy

93
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:08,200
may all beings be free

94
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,760
thank you all thank you for your practice

95
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:51,120
so [Music] hello hello greetings welcome dear friends

96
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,159
wherever in the world you are wonderful to be with you in this moment in time

97
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:01,519
whatever the weather inside or outside

98
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,039
so today day five

99
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:16,960
of exploring the refrain of the sati patana sutta

100
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:25,399
sati patana sutta itself the four foundations of mindfulness of awareness

101
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,320
how [Music] how beautiful the teachings are how

102
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:39,600
beautiful the teachings are in the satipatana sutta and especially the refrain the refrain itself is so

103
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,679
significant and we've been building up we've been building up this entire week with the

104
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,880
different parts of the refrain building up one by one by

105
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:58,720
one and this last sentence really is an accumulation of the practices of the

106
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,080
previous days that really colton cultivates to this and i'd like to

107
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:10,720
put it all together and um and

108
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:17,520
this statement actually this last sentence that i was offering just to drop it in not try to think about it not

109
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:24,720
try to analyze it but as a cohen to sit with it and let it flower

110
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,040
it's it's as relica says to live the questions themselves to live the

111
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:38,480
questions not trying so hard to to answer or open locked rooms that

112
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,520
sometimes answers are not available to you yet

113
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:49,679
so instead of leading into frustration of oh just doesn't make sense but just drop it

114
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,679
dropping the question in living the question with patience trusting that the practice builds up and

115
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:02,640
it it will make sense so in the way of review

116
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:09,440
in the way of the way of review of where we are um i'd like to

117
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:19,680
uh let's see let me first put up the sati patana sutta um

118
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,280
see if i have that here there we go the structure of the satipatana sutta

119
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:32,320
especially if you have been just joined today and you're not quite sure where we are so

120
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,920
so the sati patana sutta sections the four sections on body

121
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,520
feelings mind and damage and after every teaching the refrain shows up the

122
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:48,960
refrain is so important that it repeats 13 times in the sadi

123
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,599
patana sutta so

124
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,079
so the refrain the refrain um

125
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:08,800
and maybe what i'll also do i'll re i'll share the entire refrain let's see if uh

126
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,839
it will allow me to share the entire text

127
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:21,599
here in chat oh it's too long oh

128
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:29,920
gosh okay so not possible to share it in chat oh well the limitations of

129
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,359
of uh of youtube only 200 characters this is

130
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:40,640
almost 700 characters the refrain oh well maybe what i'll do is i will um i

131
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:47,119
will read the entire refrain and um and and really really try to relate

132
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:53,040
what this teaching this part try to decode it for you a little bit which i

133
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,079
have to say i have fallen in love with the entire refrain

134
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:06,240
um and years ago when i was sitting a retreat actually on the sati patana sutta

135
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:12,079
with bhikkhu anago who was the author of the book i've been mentioning he did his

136
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,200
dissertation phd dissertation on the sati patana

137
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:24,079
[Music] i fell in love with this instruction

138
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,839
with this one sentence it was so opening it was so freeing

139
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:35,920
um this abiding independent not clinging into

140
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:42,560
the world and anything in the world there's sense of freedom and ease that can be created in the heart and

141
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,160
mind so there is peace and ease to actually engage in the world to engage

142
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,640
and be of service this sentence this this phrase doesn't mean that you're

143
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,839
aloof and you just go sit in the cave and you don't it doesn't say

144
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:06,320
um not engage but the world says not clinging there's not a sense of clinging

145
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:13,520
um and wanting so i'm actually doing this a little losing a little bit uh as uh

146
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:18,800
speaking a little out of order let me read the entire [Music]

147
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,480
phrase the entire refrain so in this way in regard to the body

148
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,240
one abides contemplating the body internally or one abides contemplating the body

149
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:36,960
externally or one divides contemplating the body internally and externally so so what we

150
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,160
did here in this t in this teaching and what we explored

151
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,520
is expanding the dimensions not just being internal not just concerned with

152
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,960
this self internal it's all internal but also

153
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,520
doing the contemplations externally for other beings so already this refrain is

154
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:05,040
building up the internal external if you just landed in the refrain with the last sentence

155
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:11,200
maybe you're confused like what does that mean but be patient be patient

156
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:17,520
so already the refrain is setting the frame of internal and external

157
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:24,800
and internal and external self and others and the world this contemplation is already actually

158
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:31,359
in the first sentence of it is opening us up opening us up so much to internal

159
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:36,960
external the second sentence and also to mention what it

160
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,400
also what it helped us bring bring up uh to to really get a sense of

161
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:49,599
objectivity because we are so stuck in our narrative we are often so stuck in

162
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:55,520
the way we see the world me me me my my mind the way i see is right this is good

163
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:02,960
this is bad so being stuck uh in turn with the internal this is

164
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:09,520
already opening us up to internal external and also that shift in the frame shift in the

165
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:16,640
perspective of both internal and external allows an objectivity of impersonality

166
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:23,119
to pop up it's it's suffering it's challenge it's beauty it's goodness it's not me there's

167
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,480
it's it's the sense of openness of heart and perspective that already comes from

168
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:35,280
this first sentence of the the refrain now the second sentence

169
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:41,119
you see how these build up together build up the second that we worked with a couple

170
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,960
days ago with contemplating the nature of arising

171
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:52,960
and passing away so with arising and passing away

172
00:40:52,960 --> 00:41:01,040
impermanence really getting an understanding a deep understanding of

173
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:07,520
all things all things whether or not we want them to be or not arise and pass

174
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:14,880
away are impermanent and there's a sense of the heart doesn't cling doesn't let go

175
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:20,319
it does let go it doesn't cling already that observation that practice is

176
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:26,800
opening us up for this statement here that we've been sitting with today seeing the arising and

177
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:32,640
passing away of all things the heart the mind doesn't cling there's

178
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:38,560
a sense of freedom that arises that one can actually engage or be in the world

179
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:45,599
in a different way in a different way it frees up both insights into emptiness into

180
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:52,960
wisdom of openness and wisdom of compassion so as talked about a couple days ago

181
00:41:52,960 --> 00:42:00,560
insight into impermanence uh really leads the way opens up one for

182
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,560
awakening it's required it's required for awakening one cannot

183
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:12,000
um access or or or uh enter the stream the first stage of

184
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,880
awakening without a thorough and pure insight into everything arising and passing away not

185
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:26,560
just one thing not just one moment not just one inside but the thorough thorough insight into impermanence

186
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:33,040
so that second line of the refrain is already opening up to a sense of ah

187
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:39,520
it's it's our it's all passing it's a passing show this life this body everything is a

188
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:45,040
passing show and brings up a sense of okay how to engage and the answer that

189
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:51,359
comes up is with wisdom and compassion already it's not it doesn't make sense to cling it

190
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:57,200
doesn't make sense to to be hateful it just doesn't make sense after

191
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,240
you've had these insights it just does not make sense anymore

192
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:08,000
the next phrase we worked with uh mindfulness that there is a body is

193
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,400
uh or let me read it mindfulness that there is a body is established in one to the

194
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:21,680
extent necessary for bear knowledge and continuous mindfulness we did this yesterday

195
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,760
and um the the the idea that the support the

196
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:34,480
support of bringing in a lexical note there is a body there is a body can be

197
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:41,119
so helpful to to support this this bare knowledge but but

198
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:46,480
just enough just enough to have this reminder lexical reminder

199
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:54,720
uh lexical note so that there's continuous mindfulness continuous mindfulness so all of these

200
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:01,599
practices together and now we have continuous mindfulness leading to this last sentence here one

201
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:07,599
abides independent there's a sense of independence from

202
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:13,839
uh all the things that we hang on to all the things that we are preoccupied not

203
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:19,119
in a helpful way and not to cling to anything and again

204
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,720
it's not for the entity it's not that you don't cling anything after you know

205
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:31,920
of course you can have your breakfast and lunch and and but there's a sense of clinging it doesn't again

206
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:38,079
listen carefully read carefully it's doesn't mean not engaging it it says not

207
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:45,119
clinging there is a different it's clinging there's a different energy of clinging to the things in the world

208
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,800
there's a sense of um clinging that word um

209
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:56,720
is is you know you can actually feel it in your body when you're clinging to something there is just this tightness

210
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:03,359
or greed hatred and delusion really shorthand for that it's

211
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:09,040
not regarding engagement so just a couple more things to say and

212
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,160
then to wrap up um it is said that the um

213
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:21,359
abiding independently according to the suttas and and bukunalia's analysis

214
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:27,359
that this abiding independently is really the absence of dependency through

215
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:34,319
craving as i've mentioned and speculative views and the not clinging to anything in the

216
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:40,000
world is not identifying not identifying to

217
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,240
um and not identifying with the five aggregates of existence and the five aggregates

218
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:52,240
will come up in a few weeks you study them with um with gil this in this

219
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:58,640
morning is coming up as part of the fourth satipattana so i'll just leave that as a way for you for your in

220
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:05,040
interest to be peaked uh like a preview of what is coming up

221
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:10,640
so all of these practices lead especially the refrain

222
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:19,359
lead to a sense of um equipoise equanimity and freedom not eye making

223
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:27,040
and my making where freedom can arise from fixed views

224
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:33,839
and it deep deeps wisdom and compassion to engage with the world to engage with

225
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:40,240
the world from true true compassion and love not from hatred not

226
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:45,839
from self views not from um [Music]

227
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:50,880
the ways that are actually create a war and create discontent

228
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:57,760
so these are really really deep teachings and beautiful teachings

229
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:04,240
so i i only hope it is my hope that this five days that we spent together

230
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:09,839
exploring the uh the beauty really the beauty of the

231
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:15,280
refrain it's it's hard to say you know every part of the surtozairi become my

232
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,640
favorite but the refrain i am i'm in love with the refrain is so

233
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:28,000
beautiful and so sublime and i hope that i've managed to share a little bit of of

234
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,000
the significance of the refrain and how this practice practices can be

235
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,839
awakening and bringing freedom for you in your life so

236
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:47,280
that you can serve and relate and be engaged in the world but not clinging not clinging

237
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,480
um so anyway it's been a delight to to serve
