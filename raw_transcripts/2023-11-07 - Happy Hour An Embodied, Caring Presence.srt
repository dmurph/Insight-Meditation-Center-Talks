intimate

83
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:44,959
if thoughts are arising it's okay it's not a

84
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:53,279
sin our minds think it's okay so not Bering ourselves beating

85
00:12:53,279 --> 00:13:00,800
ourselves up noticing what the thought is in this moment s thank

86
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:07,620

87
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:17,000
[Music] shame smilingly I release this bird of

88
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,440
thought taking Refuge the Simplicity of this

89
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:34,120
moment with the breath with the body the Sens of care tending tending to this heart to

90
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,639
this body being

91
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,160
simple the nourishment of

92
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
stability

93
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,600
and now consider

94
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:09,000
same way that we can touch we can

95
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,160
feel a surface say a desk a chair the hardness

96
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:22,319
of it same way that we can

97
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:30,519
feel water can touch we can feel

98
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,040
so any way we can feel the air by its warmth its

99
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,160
coolness by the pressure atmosphere the

100
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,839
atmosphere put in our

101
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:02,560
bodies imagine what it feels like to feel to touch a

102
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,199
sense of

103
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,559
presence let it be a c not to be f out but as you ask this

104
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:37,320
question as you tune into it can I feel into can I touch my sense

105
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:45,039
of presence in this moment not tightening around it but with

106
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:52,919
curiosity dropping in the question with curiosity and relaxing notice if the sense of presence

107
00:17:52,919 --> 00:18:00,399
becomes more palpable in an unexplainable way

108
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:03,000
don't

109
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:32,120
struggle tching into the sense of each breath and might take some time

110
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:37,880
after a few breaths being with a few breaths with the sense of presence

111
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,840
too become more into

112
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,480
Focus be more palpable presence in this

113
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,320
moment right now right

114
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,400
here my might be a feeling of uprightness sitting

115
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:10,960
more dignified inhabiting your body see what it feels like for

116
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:17,320
you to feel to touch sense of presence right here right

117
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:30,240
now embodied presence

118
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:48,559
and now however the sense of presence is showing up for you in this moment

119
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:56,919
however much it can be sensed in this body with this

120
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:04,240
breath now tuning into dropping in the question

121
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:13,360
can I become aware a sense of kind presence embodying a caring

122
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:23,279
presence and it might help if you perhaps conjure up someone you care about could be a child a

123
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:28,840
pet and feel into your sense of kind mind presence

124
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:36,480
for them maybe you're just sitting at their

125
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:43,919
bedside maybe they're not feeling well you're just holding silent kind

126
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,080
presence no words

127
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
needed

128
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:10,200
just sitting keeping watch

129
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:33,720
caringly or maybe you have a memory of having

130
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,640
held caring presence for

131
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:44,279
someone at their bedside if they were

132
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:49,480
hurt without words just holding

133
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,640
presence caring presence compassionate loving

134
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
presence

135
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,120
and now whatever you're Conjuring up whoever you're Conjuring up holding

136
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:31,799
presence for put a younger version of

137
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:38,640
yourself and perhaps this younger version of yourself not feeling so well

138
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,960
maybe sick or sad or

139
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,120
injured just holding patient caring loving presence for

140
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,760
yourself really feeling this

141
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:05,679
palpability of the stability groundedness of caring

142
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
presence

143
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:59,080
and now in this last step expanding expanding the holding of

144
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:07,159
this kind caring compassionate presence for the

145
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,760
world as if you're keeping vigil for the

146
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:29,039
world just as you and people you care about

147
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:36,760
out are deserving of your care your compassion so are all

148
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:44,840
beings so not turning away but holding

149
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:54,600
witness holding compassionate presence especially for beings who are suffering

150
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,600
right now

151
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:06,559
in areas of the world where there is

152
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:19,240
war famine hatred so many

153
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:23,080
challenges our fellow

154
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
humans

155
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,440
as if you're sitting by the bedside of humanity Humanity

156
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,360
hurting the bedside of

157
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:59,519
humanity pcking Humanity in

158
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,679

159
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:15,720

presence for all of

163
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
us

164
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:56,320
as we turn to bring this meditation to a close offering caring presence for

165
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,519
yourself kindness acceptance for whatever this

166
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:07,519
period was like without judgment

167
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,679
without wishing it to have been any different than it

168
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:18,360
was with gratitude with appreciation or having showed up as well as you were

169
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:24,840
able to and

170
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:31,480
offering goodness of our practice TR trusting there is goodness trusting there is co-created goodness here that

171
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:37,279
we've planted seeds of care kindness stability

172
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:44,200
presence embodied caring presence offering the goodness to all

173
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:51,120
beings everywhere may all beings be free from sorrow from suffering may all

174
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,240
beings be well including [Music]

175
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,440
ourselves [Music]

176
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:10,679
everyone so much for your practice so

177
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:17,840
we began with a sense of stability groundedness with the breath with the

178
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:24,399
body and then I invited you to tune into the idea of presence as if it were

179
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:29,840
palpable this palpable like water or or touching a

180
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:36,399
surface or touching the air palpability and I was hoping that by dropping this

181
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:41,600
 in that there would be a sense of presence perhaps becoming more palpable

182
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:49,159
this embodied presence and I invited us to feel into caring embodied

183
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:54,519
presence the way you might have experienced it for a say a child or a

184
00:31:54,519 --> 00:32:00,880
parent or a friend sitting at their bad side with care this of presence and then

185
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,080
substituting yourself on that bed so a way of

186
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,799
invoking kindness and compassion for ourselves and then bringing humanity and all of

187
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:19,480
humanity and tucking them in on the bed with care with with embodied presence

188
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:26,039
for Humanity not turning away crumbling away but a sense of embodied care so

189
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:31,760
that was the invitation and some of it might have worked for you some of it may not have it's all okay these are

190
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:37,799
experimentations for us to find our way into what works for us what works for us

191
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:45,559
so don't judge yourself what that didn't work for me I didn't get that not a problem it's all part of

192
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:54,000
exploration so so um I'd like to invite us to engage in

193
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,120
small groups and the invitation for the groups is this tonight for you to

194
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,240
um really show up with a sense of embodied presence what does it feel like

195
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,600
to to show up in a small group with really the sense of embodied presence

196
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:17,039
not hiding not really with a sense of embodied care embodied presence for

197
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,279
yourself and for others there may not be many words that need to be said that's

198
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:27,559
perfectly fine but see if you can feel it into that palpability ofay presence

199
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:33,919
with others sort of thinking about what you're going to say or what they're going to say just sense of embodied

200
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,039
presence this is this is supreme practice that you can take into your daily life

201
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:44,960
just not being overwhelmed by thoughts and emotions so showing up in small

202
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:51,679
groups and when your turn comes you're welcome to explore for your own good for

203
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:58,279
your own sake how this practice was for you um and again this is for your own sake it's not not to educate it's not to

204
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:03,440
impress you're just exploring for yourself and other people are holding you with witness they're not asking

205
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:10,800
questions they're not giving advice uh they're just two human mirrors reflecting holding with embodied

206
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:16,679
presence embodied care what you are exploring and if you want to say past

207
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:22,679
that's perfectly fine and the next person will offer a nugget the next person will come back to you if you want

208
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:31,320
to offer something again or not you go around and round a few times until the time the six seven

209
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,760
minutes is over so so take your time and silence is perfectly time maybe you want

210
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:44,760
to say actually I'm losing my sense of presence I'm getting in my head so I'm going to be silent take 30 seconds feel

211
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:52,079
my presence feel your presence ah sense of care I care for this being who's me I

214
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:11,280
time so feel free to explore out loud the process not just the content of

215
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:18,359
what's happening but the process oh yeah this is how I'm relating to this right now you can do mindfulness out loud

216
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:23,720
speaking from that state of trying to tune into embod caring presence as you

217
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:30,480
are with talking with other people it's like writing a icle and I don't know tapping your head and you're rubbing

218

your belly at the same time can take a little bit of uh oh yeah how do I do this so so enjoy exploring don't just go

219
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:47,359
into your your habit pattern of just starting to talk blah blah blah please don't do that just take some time to to

220

242
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:23,119
emotional and I was afraid I was going to start crying or something embarrassing but it was I felt very warm

243
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:31,319
towards the people in the room and uh the idea thinking about um tucking in a child

244
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:37,359
that was sick really really helped become more embodied me to feel it

245
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:46,200
rather than you know intellectually like conjure that up but that you just would sit there and and just be caring and

concerned and there's nothing to say just loving presence so that that really helped thank you thank you Maran thank
