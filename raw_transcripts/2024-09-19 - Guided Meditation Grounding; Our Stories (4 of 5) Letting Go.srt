1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,799
we'll uh get our practice period

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,920
started so feeling

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,439
into the bodily experience bringing an

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,960
aliveness to the physical experience bringing in a sense of presence

5
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,200
and into what it's like to be sitting

6
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,200
here

7
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,800
now feeling connect Ed and

8
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:19,400
grounded I'm often starting with the obvious sensations of pressure

9
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,000
against the

10
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,000
body the feet

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,399
if you're sitting cross-legged maybe it's the sides of the feet that are touching the

12
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:46,880
ground if you're in a chair it's the bottom of the

13
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:55,479
feet if you're lying down maybe it's the back of the heels whatever it is chances are your

14
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:03,479
feet are resting on something and feeling the pressure the contact against

15
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:05,679
the

16
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,160
body back of the legs

17
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:39,040
the Vex feeling the contact the

18
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,000
pressure from the sitting

19
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:56,000
surface we can use these three areas feet back of the legs

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,800
buttocks as grounding we're

21
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:09,959
here connected as a foundation

22
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,640
be above this Foundation we feel the

23
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:43,400
belly can there be some [Music] ease some

24
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,799
relaxation in the

25
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,760
belly softness

26
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:11,239
and the chest sometimes we can

27
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:19,000
armor ourselves by having some type of stiffness in the

28
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:26,880
chest there a way to protect ourselves brace

29
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:35,758
ourselves just for this small period this morning can we let that soften

30
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:12,320
tuning into Sensations in the lower backing some care and maybe some

31
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,840
tenderness to this area which often gives

32
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,840
humans difficulties

33
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,080
in the upper

34
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:02,120
back between the shoulder

35
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,880
blades can we rest our attention there

36
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,039
with some kindness some warmth

37
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,360
shoulder blades slide down the back

38
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:07,840
we discover there's tension it might be that resting

39
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:17,039
awareness deviates softens the tension but it might not be

40
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,080
also and you be okay with that

41
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:44,560
can you be okay with however the body is showing up this

42
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:52,159
moment as best you can as best you can

43
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:19,280
and then bringing awareness to the face and the

44
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:30,440
head not uncommon to have tension around the mouth and jaw the eyes

45
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:37,719
maybe there's a band around the head that feels

46
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,279
tight is there a way that they can be loosened

47
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:31,360
and then lastly for this body scan bringing awareness to our hands

48
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,760
the sensations of what they're touching

49
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,680
and the sensations of having hands

50
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,399
do hands feel like on the

51
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,600
inside maybe a little bit a

52
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:26,760
tingly maybe nothing in particular it's perfectly

53
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,320
fine whatever you find e

54
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:35,440
and then the attention to tune into become sensitive to the

55
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,920
experiences of

56
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,240
breathing e

57
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,600
just noticing how the body moves as it

58
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
breathes

59
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,120
e e

60
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,199
nothing in particular needs to be

61
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,639
happening just tuning into the sensations of breathing

62
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,839
that be

63
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
enough

64
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

65
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920

[Music]

92
00:28:53,560 --> 00:29:01,200
[Music]

93
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:21,279
welcome welcome readings everybody to this is

94
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:28,840
the fourth day in this uh series that I'm doing on stories

95
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:36,240
and I'd like to share a short little story that comes uh from the

96
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,840
sutas and many of you might be familiar with this but I like to look at it from

97
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:48,279
a little bit different way than we often do and maybe there's a way in which uh

98
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:54,480
it can be a support for our practice in a I mean in a bigger way than uh when we

99
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,720
often think about this story so the story is a simile that's given by

100
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:07,960
the Buddha and he's talking about teachings so uh so this is the simile

101
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:14,679
that the Buddha is saying imagine a person in the course of a

102
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:21,200
journey arrives at a great expanse of water and the Nearshore is dangerous and

103
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:28,519
the farshore offers safety but there's no fairy booat or bridge to take across

104
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:35,799
the water so the person thinks well what if I collected grass Twigs branches and

105
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:42,159
leaves and bound them together as a raft and then supported by the raft and

106
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,399
by paddling with hands and feet I should then be able to reach the far

107
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:53,880
Shore so the person does this and they succeed and they get across to the far

108
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,120
Shore and then arriving at the far Shore it might occur to them wow

109
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,519
wow that's Diana's little injection there that's not in the suit does wow

110
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:11,399
this WFT has been very helpful indeed what if I were to hoist it on my head or

111
00:31:11,399 --> 00:31:18,200
load it on my shoulders and then proceed on my journey and then the Buddha is uh

112
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:24,200
turning to the people that he's speaking to and he says now what do you think by carrying the raft with them

113
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:30,799
would that person be doing what should be done with a raft and then the people listening to him say

114
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:38,159
no venerable sir and the Buddha asks so what should a person do with the raft

115
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:44,960
and then the uh people there in the audience respond having arrived at the far Shore

116
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,519
the person might think yes this raft has been very useful but now I should just

117
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:58,399
hold it on to Dryland or release it and set it a drift in the water and then

118
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:05,000
go wherever I want in this way the person would be

119
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:11,240
doing what should be done with the raft so often when we hear this story

120
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:17,880
it's h associated with you know this is what we should be doing with the teachings the doctrine uh the Dharma but

121
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:24,720
what if it's just referring to or we consider it to be referring to just stories in

122
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,039
general like stories have a role they can carry us to a different place but

123
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:37,320
then there's a time to let go of them they can be a support in some

124
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:42,639
contexts but not in other contexts and we might recognize that so

125
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:47,679
much of a some of the maybe even Psychotherapy we might say is to help us

126
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:55,639
uh determine or acknowledge or discover some of the stories that we have from our youth from our childhood that was

127
00:32:55,639 --> 00:33:04,039
helpful but that then they turn into to patterns of behavior that we carry with us into our adulthood and no longer are

128
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:09,600
helpful and part of the maybe maturity both in just the

129
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:17,279
conventional um maturing into an adult as well as spiritual maturity is to recognize oh yeah some of these patterns

130
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:22,559
some of these stories that I have from uh when I was young are no longer so

131
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:31,360
appropriate now as an adult and so this question of whether to

132
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,200
carry the raft or to leave it behind I appreciate so much that uh in

133
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:44,080
this assimile uh the Buddha is saying on arriving at the far Shore so this place

134
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,639
where there's safety it might occur to them this raft has been very helpful

135
00:33:49,639 --> 00:33:55,760
what if I were to waste it on my head or load it onto my

136
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:02,159
shoulders this is like maybe the definition of something that's burdensome right carry this burden put

137
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,599
something on our head and walk around with it and maybe we don't recognize the

138
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:14,679
burdensome nature of it or we don't maybe recognize the weight of

139
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:20,040
it but then the uh Buddha says that um

140
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:26,440
an alternative is to just maybe we carried it on to dry land or maybe we

141
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:35,520
let it uh go a DFT in the water and then the person is allowed to go wherever I

142
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:44,200
want so carrying this raft is burdensome and limits what is available to us if we

143
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:50,599
bring it onto try land or let it a drift into the water it allows us to go wherever I

144
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:58,160
want it allows us to no longer be pushed around by the circumstances of Our Lives

145
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,880
no longer to be pushed around by some of the stories that we're carrying instead

146
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:10,880
we have a certain amount of Freedom so how is it that uh we can even

147
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,560
recognize that we're carrying these stories and that they are burdensome and for this I'll tell a

148
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:22,079
little story about myself something that happened many years ago this is uh when

149
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,880
I was working in uh Corporate America and I was upset about something and know

150
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:33,680
funny that now I don't remember the details I have no memory at all what these details were but I remember kind

151
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:40,000
of like this interaction that I had that um had a big uh impact on me and on my

152
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,760
life so I was complaining about uh somebody in another department this is

153
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:52,079
uh what I remember and so I remember I was telling this long complicated story

154
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,640
to my friend and like well this person said this and then because so and so was

155
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:03,520
was upset that they said this and they sent an email to a whole bunch of people including me and then I felt upset about

156
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:10,119
the email because it was so clear that this person really doesn't care about other people and this person only wants

157
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:15,960
to look good and you know like this big long complicated story as I said I don't

158
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:23,560
remember the details I just remember kind of like you know the this gist of it and then after the my long story that

159
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:29,040
was full of details my friend said I'm sorry that that

160
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,480
happened let's see if there are at least two other stories we can create using

161
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:42,319
the same facts and I was like what and she said no no no so and so said

162
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:47,599
something you were there for that and later you received an email these were two

163
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,880
facts what are some other stories that we could do with this and I was like I I

164
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:59,760
don't understand what you're asking me in fact I even felt offended like what do you mean this is a story no they said

165
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:07,000
this because of blah blah blah and then they this other person sent this email because of blah blah blah even look

166
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,280
right now when I'm telling the story I'm like feeling a little bit agitated

167
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:22,640
so uh I did was able to calm down and recognize oh yeah I was making meaning I

168
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:29,040
was trying to say well they said this because of x y and and

169
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:36,800
z and then this email that sent reading between the lines was a b and

170
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:43,000
c and not recognizing that this was fabricated in my mind it's not actually

171
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:49,319
the truth I don't actually know why that person said what they said I don't

172
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:54,440
actually know precisely what's between the lines in an

173
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:01,280
emo so this how can we recognize if if we don't

174
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:08,200
have a friend that's saying to us okay using the same amount of facts what are some other stories and I for the record

175
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:13,240
I did end up coming making all kinds of stories just outlandish stories

176
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:18,960
practical stories it always it became kind of fun to say okay well maybe Mars

177
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,520
came down and embodied this person and then some that were completely ridiculous and then some that started to

178
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,040
be like oh yeah maybe uh has nothing to do with me or maybe

179
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:37,760
has only to do with maybe they have a child that's sick at home and that's and they're worried

180
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:45,280
about this child and that's why they were said something with this kind of a tone or something like this so if we

181
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:51,200
don't have somebody to just remind us okay are there other ways that we could

182
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:57,760
interpret or and gain meaning from these things what could we what could

183
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:05,040
highlight to us that we're making stories and this little simile points to

184
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:11,480
this I would say in the simil the the person who's making the raft says what

185
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:18,560
if I collected grass Twigs branches and leaves and bound them together as a raft

186
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:25,839
and supported by the raft and by paddling with my hands and feet I should then be able to reach the far

187
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:34,480
Shore so this is pointing to like direct experiences like what is here and now

188
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,720
branches twigs and leaves is what the person was experiencing while they were on the

189
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:46,880
shore and paddling with my hands and feet is what they're actually doing with

190
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:55,000
the body how the body is moving so it's being present for our

191
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:02,760
direct experience feeling the hands uh using the hands and

192
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:09,560
feet is like feeling what is the experience that the body is having what's present right there twigs and

193
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:18,480
leaves and branches the story is what the mind is

194
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,680
doing what's not the story is what the body is

195
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:31,240
doing and then the story story what the mind is doing is often very different than what's being experienced by the

196
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:41,480
body right we often have you know the body is in one place here with leaves and branches and the mind is somewhere

197
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:48,680
else so there's often a sense of um so that's maybe one distinction we

198
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:54,040
can make between the story and what's actually happening so the story is not

199
00:40:54,040 --> 00:41:01,319
in the same place as the mind but it also has this sense of this very quiet

200
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:06,680
uh sense of I don't want or I

201
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:12,560
should these kind of like two flavors the story has a feeling of like I don't

202
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,359
want or I should so this is often what the mind is

203
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:24,960
adding on top of our direct experience so then the question arrives

204
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:30,119
well this the simil of the raft this story is about letting go of stories so

205
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:35,160
one we have to recognize what is a story and that is to make the

206
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:40,560
distinction between what's happening in the mind and what's happening in the body and then the question is how do we

207
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:46,480
let go of the stories and that is about being

208
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:53,280
embodied it's like being with the fill experience what are the Liv leaves Twigs

209
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,359
branches of this moment what is what is the body feeling

210
00:41:58,359 --> 00:42:07,640
like in this moment feeling grounded feeling our feet on the ground feeling connected to the

211
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:13,160
whatever surface we're sitting or standing on that's how we let go is is

212
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:20,680
not that we have to push away the thoughts or we don't have to um negate them or say that they don't matter we're

213
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:26,760
just bringing attention towards the felt experience of this moment that's how we

214
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:32,520
come go of the stories when we're embodied from that perspective we can

215
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:39,480
start to see the sense of I don't want or I should that's uh very often just

216
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:47,000
quietly like spewing up like um all these thoughts that maybe might be so familiar that we don't recognize like oh

217
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,839
yeah this is part of the story The sometimes it's a story of me

218
00:42:52,839 --> 00:43:00,559
or the story of whatever happened or something like that so I offer this as uh take what's

219
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:05,720
helpful and leave behind what isn't helpful but as a way for us to feel some

220
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:11,319
of the stories are burdensome we're trying to carry them on

221
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:16,800
our heads and shoulders and they weigh us down prevent us from going where we

222
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:25,920
want to go preventing us from having the freedom and part of it is to recognize well what are stories what are the

223
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:33,359
narratives that we are carrying around that are extra that we don't need to and

224
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:41,880
so much about that is just being embodied so thank you thank you and I'll

225
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:49,558
see you tomorrow for our last installment of this idea of stories thank you

226
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:27,319
thank you all it's lovely lovely to be part of

227
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:30,480

228

232
00:45:59,319 --> 00:46:03,280
the ones that are not so helpful
