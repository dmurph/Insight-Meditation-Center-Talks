welcome yeah thank you thank you for being here

5
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:25,740
we're making the journey really lovely to be with you in person and thank you for folks out on YouTube for

6
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:32,759
joining us as well so this is the third of five week series on

7
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:40,020
introduction to mindfulness meditation myself Tanya Weiser and my friend and

8
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:45,659
co-teacher Don Neal she doesn't have her mic on so I'll

9
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:52,500
speak for her yeah and um so the way that this thought this class

10
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,840
is taught is consistently taught no matter who you come learn it by and this

11
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:05,840
kind of concentric Circle way the first week of the class is focused on breath

12
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,000
the second week is body and the third week which is this week is emotions

13
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,040
and it's sort of like you know the breath is this kind of core experience

14
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,379
sort of more focused and we expand to include all of the body the second week

15
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:27,720
and now we're going to expand further to incorporate emotions mindfulness of

16
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,060
emotions and then each week we invite you to

17
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:39,360
preference the theme of the week and your meditations

18
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,860
preference being aware this week of emotions to practice learning like a study you're

19
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:54,060
studying them more when do they come up how do they come up how do they impact you that kind of thing

20
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,700
not that we expect you won't keep breathing or having a body right and we

21
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:06,300
haven't talked yet about thinking and it's not that we're expecting your thoughts to have gone away so

22
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,519
um so just as a refresher in week one with the breathing

23
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,640
we talked about establishing an anchor or a tether for our awareness a

24
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,879
reference point or something to help ground us and stay aware of the present moment

25
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:32,519
experience and breath is often a chosen anchor for people it's um Dynamic meaning it's kind

26
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:39,300
of constantly moving shifting it can be felt in a lot of different places in our body

27
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,519
for many people it's a very neutral thing to pay attention to if it's not a

28
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,180
neutral if it's triggering for you in some ways then shift to mindfulness of body or or sound those are the two

29
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,879
easiest other objects and so that's just a basic summary of

30
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,060
week one week two was mindfulness of the body and some of the things that we talked

31
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:08,099
about were kind of that the you know the body has Intelligence in it

32
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:15,120
there's more and more science neuroscience and other science to talk about like the gut brain literally some

33
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,680
intelligence in the brain that communicates directly with the the brain brain things like butterflies in your stomach

34
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,720
are part of that communication pattern there's a ventral vagus nerve that

35
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:34,400
travels wanders around the body but all the way into the gut up to the brain it goes kind of

36
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,740
zigzaggy heart you know chest

37
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:47,040
um and that this is a pathway of communication between the body and the organs and the Brain

38
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,560
and so if there's intelligence in this body and it's trying to communicate with us

39
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:59,699
and it's not using words I like to say the sensations are the way

40
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:06,060
the body is talking to us it's communicating through sensation

41
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,759
that's the language of the body and and receiving those Sensations receiving

42
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,340
those feelings recognizing them is how we listen to the body how the

43
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,600
body feels listened to

44
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,639
we have the lights the way they are sorry they're a little dark because there's some flickering happening so but

45
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:36,539
please feel free to sit closer or back wherever you want but you're happy you know we're happy to have you here

46
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,580
um so what else about the body um

47
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:48,539
another beautiful thing about the body which is true for the breath too but the body-based experiences

48
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:55,440
are always in the present moment we have Sensations here right now so I like to

49
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,780
think about it as a Gateway a way for us to access connection to the present

50
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:06,000
moment so not in the mental ideas and stories

51
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,020
the imagining we do but the direct connection with the present moment experience

52
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:19,919
so it's a very helpful very helpful and important part of mindfulness practice and I think there's a quote from the

53
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,020
Buddha that goes something like that like if if you want if you want to reach

54
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:32,060
liberation develop mindfulness of the body it's incredibly important

55
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:39,240
so another part of kind of Shifting and that we worked on last week was how to

56
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:49,039
experience these Sensations how to experience the body without a commentary without a like evaluation comments like

57
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,360
you know bad good

58
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:00,360
um you know like judging right good and bad are judgments it's more like this

59
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,300
neutral kind of just recognizing the pure more pure sensation like oh it's

60
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:13,919
not a good or bad sensation it's a strong sensation it's a pulsing sensation it's cold or it's warm right

61
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:21,300
so as much as possible that's a very supportive part of practice is to kind of be moving out away from that

62
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:28,580
judgmental or evaluating mind into more of a pure kind of simple way of directly

63
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:34,460
knowing and naming in a real simple way or experience

64
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,800
Dawn also talked last week about pain and how to work with pain and one of the

65
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,680
things that she mentioned was it's a dynamic and changing experience and so

66
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:54,479
if we can start to pay attention to how it's changing and bringing that more neutral kind of way of recognizing the

67
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,419
sensations instead of kind of maybe we it's almost like um

68
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:05,580
uh or amplifying the pain in the way that we

69
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,560
talk to ourselves about the pain

70
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,620
and then finally we were kind of we've been doing this each week but kind of

71
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,720
Don brought in this idea of the inner posture so there's the physical posture

72
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:28,560
in your body but there's also an inner posture and this this is referencing our relationship to our experience

73
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:35,580
how are we relating to our inner world this week

74
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:42,060
will expand to talk about emotions and I would love to hear a few words

75
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:47,700
from you all what do you think about how what words

76
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:53,279
come to mind when I bring up the word emotions what

77
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:59,160
are emotions how are they meaningful to you are they problematic to you

78
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:06,000
would anybody willing to say a few words there's two mics on the floor maybe you guys could just pick them up

79
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,459
um turn them on those are close to them how long you mind yeah thank you guys

80
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:17,160
for helping each other and um so just this very simple word or

81
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,500
two nothing no like just just a few little words like what do you think

82
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,839
about what comes up when you think about emotions

83
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:33,200
unified unified okay great

84
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:40,100
I see them as interpretations of the current circumstances

85
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:46,640
interpretations great stories stories

86
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,300
anybody else

87
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,640
reactions

88
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,600
feeling I think you said feeling feeling great

89
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:22,640
so the we all have kind of complex relationships with our emotions right

90
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,860
some emotions maybe we really like some emotions we don't like

91
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:36,540
um emotions can be both Sublime and extra excruciating yeah there's this whole

92
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:44,519
range I I like to think about them as a way of

93
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:50,100
I like these words interpreting or responding reacting kind of like our

94
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,320
it's the way our minds and bodies have synthesized

95
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,420
and created associations to what's happening emotion is about our response

96
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:07,200
our reaction to what's going on sometimes actually it's not about what's going on now but something that reminds

97
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,959
us of what has happened in the past so they're not so present-centered based they're just triggered

98
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:19,560
which makes them tricky right and sometimes if we you know have a

99
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:26,040
reaction to something um that has grown our response our

100
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:33,600
associated experience to something even as simple as the way a piece of you know glass of

101
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,860
water is put on a counter something like that can generate very strong emotions

102
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:47,660
or fear of flying or speaking is something that we start to grow this intense more and more intensity

103
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:53,880
that has very little to do feel free to come in yeah

104
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:01,740
so one other thing I'll say about um emotions is that another thing I like to

105
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:07,560
think about is that um they're a communication system they're

106
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:14,279
trying to motivate us to get us to do something like there's if you think about emotions

107
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:22,500
like sadness they tend to inspire or result in a body that is heavier leaning

108
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:28,860
forward more quiet not moving right whereas anger would have the opposite

109
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:34,560
with a lot of energy a lot of uprightness perhaps you know

110
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:42,060
running or attacking energy right um so in a way it's like if we're tuning

111
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:47,160
in really carefully and we notice early on we don't have to go maybe as far with

112
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:54,180
the emotion in terms of the intensity of it if we notice it sooner so

113
00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:00,240
that's a little mini intro do emotions and we'll be talking about it more and

114
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:07,500
um so we want to open up now to see if you have some questions about your practice

115
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:13,800
this last week any stories that you'd be willing to share about things that you're noticing

116
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:20,639
ways your practices is changing um or you know anything that I brought up

117
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,920
that you want more clarification around so again if you don't mind picking up

118
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:32,700
the mic if it's by you and just turning it on and being ready to help get it to anyone who

119
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:39,740
might be interested in Sharing or asking a question

120
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,320
if you could please give your name for the benefit of the whole group as you ask your question that would be

121
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:54,500
wonderful okay so where's my hand last week you mentioned about

122
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:02,880
listening to the sounds while meditating and I'm very sensitive to sounds so like

123
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:09,240
for years I've suffered from all these noises around me and my residence has

124
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:18,120
this Square end up path of airplane so that has been really bothering me but after we we talked

125
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:23,820
about just paying attention to sounds and maybe embrace it and letting go

126
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:29,760
that helped me kind of oh good so you felt yeah go ahead Don I'd like to hear

127
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:34,800
your voice so I tried to sleep with that earplugs for last few days and just kind

128
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:42,540
of embrace the sound and not concentrate on the airplane noise but other noises like a car or just little noises around

129
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,699
it and that helped me go to sleep without the earplugs

130
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:54,000
that's wonderful wonderful to share that thank you so did I hear you correctly that you

131
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,139
also said it didn't bother you as much when you were just focused on the sounds

132
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:08,220
right before just focusing on airplane noise oh so you opened up the your um

133
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:13,380
hearing kind of sentences to all sounds not just the one that was annoying you

134
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:20,160
right so I was just concentrating on the car noise maybe my neighbor you know making noise

135
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,699
or just anything and sound of the wind the rain and just other things and they

136
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:33,660
were all kind of pleasing sound all together wonderful was a little more peaceful more peaceful

137
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:40,079
that's great it's a great observation interested to hear how it progresses as

138
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,600
time goes on I would say one thing Grace um about

139
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:52,560
what you're sharing is an example of how when odd something starts to become

140
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,779
automatically preferenced in our awareness like there's a been a

141
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:05,279
preference in your mind because of the aversion to hearing the airplane sounds and now you're actually choosing

142
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:12,899
and preferencing to open up to other sounds that's like you are choosing where

143
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:19,920
you're giving your awareness that is amazing yeah yeah your World opened up a little bit

144
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,459
that's wonderful world the sound beautiful world of sound

145
00:16:25,459 --> 00:16:32,160
and to say that the same exact way of opening up your attention does wonders

146
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,259
and working with pain too this is a similarity this preference thing that

147
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:42,839
Tanya is talking about if it's aversive preferencing it can

148
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:48,300
really lock us into a feedback loop whether it's with the annoying sound or with the annoying sensation or whatnot

149
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:55,199
and this really powerful move you did of opening attention more broadly

150
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,240
can work in any of the senses oh okay I didn't think about it that way but I

151
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:07,938
sure could use it wonderful anybody else

152
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,140
yes please

153
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:20,280
it's on yeah it's about the first can you turn the mic this way toward

154
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:27,839
yeah and somebody will eat it yes yes

155
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:34,200
except you don't really have to the you talked about the first week

156
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,660
about breath the second week about body

157
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:45,120
so when we talk about the body

158
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,840
um and you talked about experiencing it

159
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:57,020
um there is dancing like for example that

160
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:04,080
in like what comes to mind is not like the body pain or whatever but the

161
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,360
mathematics of it like or the science where that is people involved in that is

162
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:15,840
part of the you know the beat and the even the

163
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:23,700
uh the physiology of the various muscles that are moving like 14 000

164
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:30,360
limbs you know there is a um in

165
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:37,919
the there is a book which is Turtle dance of Shiva where he talks about

166
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:44,580
Unison earlier I used the word Unified where the dance

167
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:50,400
is referred to as something which is unifying the entire universe

168
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,400
um by that experience of of for the body

169
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:03,020
and there is mathematics and there is science I mean like for example in classical dancing there is

170
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:11,220
we can make a circle in four steps or a diagonal or you know the

171
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:19,799
um so that rhythm with the exercise that the body is able to get by

172
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:26,760
virtue of this you know the scientific methods is what I wanted to say how we

173
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:34,440
experience how we can experience body yeah so in our our scene here in

174
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:40,080
the terravata scene the mindfulness meditation

175
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,780
we try and um kind of keep our experience

176
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:53,100
our attention focused on our direct experience not the concepts but the direct experience so one thing

177
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:59,640
you're pointing to is there's you know like the muscles so sometimes in our practice like we might tune in to a

178
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:07,200
muscle in the body but we might also tune into the whole body but again it's like how do we just experience it not so

179
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,419
much how we think about it but how do we experience the heartbeat

180
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:20,220
in the body or these other things that you're referencing so direct connection direct experiencing

181
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:25,320
thank you yeah go ahead I have a quick question I

182
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:32,100
I have experienced that when I meditate my my dream world is more relaxed like

183
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:38,580
if I skip one day I don't meditate um I have more like a vivid or kind of

184
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:44,700
like anxious dreams like a little bit into the nightmare but it doesn't happen when

185
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,980
I meditate it just has any relationship or it's just a

186
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:56,940
is my observation great great I think it's a great observation very

187
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:03,179
good noticing of cause and effect potentially or at least some kind of correlation

188
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:09,720
I would encourage you to stay curious stay interested in the effects both on

189
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,820
your dream world but also on your Waking Life on the days you meditate versus the

190
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:21,000
days you don't many people do report sleeping better the days they meditate it seems there's

191
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,039
something that processes through mentally and physically

192
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:32,360
um that makes sleep a little bit easier but I'd be hesitant to draw a one-to-one

193
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:38,880
this is always going to be this way it's going to change constantly perhaps

194
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,900
or maybe for you it doesn't but to just stay interested stay curious Tanya do you want to add anything to

195
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:53,280
that I love what you're noticing I really do you know and

196
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,640
I think it is good to be really curious about it the I think what Dawn is also pointing

197
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:05,760
to is to remember we like to figure things out

198
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,400
you know we like to kind of X Plus y equals this

199
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,620
but then we start to relate to experience as a rule

200
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:22,559
does that make sense it's this is that but experience is so much more Dynamic

201
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:30,059
and there's so many things that are influencing what happens you know it's it's and we're changing

202
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:35,580
all the time so what we want to be careful of is making like these fixed

203
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:42,720
ideas about you know this is going to lead to that well it probably will but we always need

204
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,760
to stay connected to and open to what's really happening or

205
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:55,400
we start to relate to experience from our expectations instead of what what's actually happening

206
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:06,980
Monique did you have something

207
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:20,400
so I read in this science book that um when a stimulus comes and it generates

208
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:26,220
an emotion then you know whatever chemical process arises in the

209
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:32,820
body if you just observe it and allow it to

210
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:38,760
pass through it should flush in I think there is a finite amount of seconds 90

211
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:44,400
seconds you're actually taking an anecdote right from the top I'm about to go no that's great I will stop then

212
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,760
great so yes good good anecdote that that'll lead me right in then

213
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:57,960
the scientists that I'm familiar with you may have read a different citation is a woman named Jill bolte Taylor she

214
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:06,480
is a neuroscientist at Harvard and she talks about how emotions from an

215
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,440
embodied perspective we're not reducing emotions just to this but from an embodied perspective they're kind of a

216
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:20,400
chemical hormonal physical process and if left alone as Monique said

217
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,700
they tend to flush through our body in about a minute and a half 90 seconds

218
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:32,460
now most of us don't just let them move through most of

219
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:39,179
the time right we have extra layers of reaction another

220
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:45,780
emotion about the emotion are based on an assumption about the emotion or there's a thought that comes in

221
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:53,220
so all of those extra layers perpetuate the loop of the emotion

222
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:58,320
in in the Buddhist framework the Buddhist

223
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:05,880
framework this is called adding a second Arrow piercing ourselves with a second Arrow

224
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:12,720
the Buddha tells this story of just an unnamed man

225
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:19,559
who is hit by an Archer one Arrow let's just say in the arm it's not a mortal wound but it's very painful

226
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:25,200
that's the first Arrow that's what life throws at us right

227
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,840
or it's a mistake or whatnot the second arrow and the third and the

228
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:37,620
tenth and the 15th those are what we add on top

229
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:43,200
so if I'm walking through my house and I stubbed

230
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:51,360
my toe out that's the first Arrow if I then start to have a lot of

231
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:59,279
self-recrimination ah stupid clumsy what were you thinking second Arrow

232
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:05,460
what am I doing teaching mindfulness I wasn't mindful at all whack hit my toe

233
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:10,860
people are going to discover I'm a klutz and not a teacher oh no third Arrow

234
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:18,120
fourth arrow and it can build from there and there and there and just get bigger and more complicated and more convoluted

235
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:24,539
even with this silly little example right so

236
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:30,539
mindfulness helps us not to get over involved

237
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:38,220
and not to believe the second Arrow third Arrow tenth arrow and eventually

238
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:45,299
not even to pick it up or not so that the arrow doesn't have as much pointiness as much pain associated with

239
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:50,580
it so

240
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:57,960
there's a kind of a beautiful quality of mindful awareness when it comes to

241
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:04,260
emotions and into thinking but especially to emotions

242
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:11,820
and that is if mindfulness is able to really hold

243
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:21,240
an emotion the afflictive the difficult emotions those tend to wane and wither over time

244
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:27,480
through this careful mindful attention

245
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,960
The Beneficial emotions those that come from a kind of deeper Wellspring in US

246
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,520
altruistic love peace calm

247
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,679
generosity those when seen with mindfulness and

248
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,919
this kind of discernment those tend to grow

249
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:55,020
so there's a real power in stepping back and being open

250
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:01,340
and allowing our emotion space to respect them

251
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:10,320
this is an opportunity on the cushion and many of us aren't necessarily used to feeling the full range of our

252
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:16,200
emotions because we live in society and we're in relationships and we have jobs

253
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,539
or commitments or whatnot and it's not always wise or even safe to express

254
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:29,039
every emotion happening so the habit can be to kind of shut out the ones that aren't convenient

255
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:37,679
right mindfulness is a kind of pause of presence a sacred pause that allows all

256
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:43,260
of the emotions to flow through and happen and get metabolized

257
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:49,080
get metabolized so

258
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:55,860
it can be a really powerful experience to allow this to happen it's

259
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:02,659
not always an easy one but the key is to let an emotion Express

260
00:29:02,659 --> 00:29:07,740
and not get over involved not pushing away

261
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:15,539
not repress it not deny it and not fuel it not add fuel to the fire

262
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:21,179
right so let's just try a little three breath

263
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:26,240
Journey here it's really simple

264
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:36,440
taking a breath and settling into your body settling into your heart

265
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:43,980
and allow whatever prominent emotion

266
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:53,179
opening right now just to emerge into your heart your body your mind

267
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:04,500
breathing second breaths feeling the sensations

268
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:11,640
of the emotion emotions happen in the body

269
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:19,500
does it feel like and then with the third breath

270
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:25,399
notice your relationship to the emotion

271
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:32,120
whatever that is like dislike board

272
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,000
whatever

273
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:44,580
so just that little three breath Journey gives a sense of how emotions

274
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:51,860
kind of live in the body and are also inextricably

275
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:57,480
interwoven with the mind and the Heart Right

276
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,860
in the Buddhist framework of how the mind works

277
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:11,460
emotions and thoughts are two different species of mental activity in this big

278
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:16,740
overall ecosystem and we'll talk more about thinking and

279
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:22,320
thoughts next week but now for now just to acknowledge as Tanya said it's not

280
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,140
like just because we're teaching emotions you can't think your minds are going to think

281
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:35,580
but to just notice it and for this week this session to privilege the emotions and the Body

282
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:39,440
Sensations related to them

283
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:48,659
and notice notice how mindfulness might just help

284
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:55,440
emotions come and go flow through without as many complications of

285
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,960
judgment or aversion or resistance or stories or

286
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,720
preferences and if those things come up

287
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:13,559
to just notice those don't need to do anything to them and you certainly don't need to start adding

288
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:19,740
another arrow because this natural process comes up

289
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:25,620
that too Withers over time in most circumstances through this process of

290
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,580
mindful awareness

291
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:39,000
the alternative that mindful awareness cultivates is a kind of letting be

292
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,820
kind of letting be not even the self-recrimination about

293
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:50,600
adding the arrows right even letting that be if necessary

294
00:32:54,419 --> 00:33:03,360
so to notice the looping the amplification

295
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:10,860
that this neuroscientist Joe Bolton Taylor talks about to notice it

296
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:16,860
when it happens and for now we're going to provide you with some Alternatives I'll provide you with some in this

297
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:21,960
guided meditation and Tanya will teach a great technique for investigation later

298
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:28,980
on which is another alternative to kind of get in there and and fillet

299
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:35,100
things apart but meanwhile it's really helpful to

300
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:42,200
notice whatever emotion is happening while it's happening in the body

301
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:51,480
if you see the second arrows tenth arrows extra layers just internally notice them as such and

302
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:59,539
for now return to the body return to the breath let them be in the background

303
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:06,840
like Tanya said our bodies they're always here they're always here now right

304
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:13,080
they're not there and then and most emotions not necessarily that first

305
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,720
arising the 90 seconds but the loop is often about it there and then

306
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,158
or a set of assumptions

307
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:31,280
it's really helpful to notice Sensations and posture

308
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:37,858
extra reactions can include neural tension muscular tension even physical

309
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:43,378
pain so just notice that if it happens

310
00:34:43,379 --> 00:34:48,658
and most of all to notice that internal inner posture

311
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:54,080
inner relationship too okay

312
00:34:54,080 --> 00:35:00,599
so we'll do a longer guided meditation now um

313
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:07,680
I'm starting us off here some of you are already meditating but

314
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,380
if you aren't just take a moment to notice how your

315
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:19,380
body is and notice how the feelings are just having heard all

316
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:28,280
that all this talking neat ideas the great comments the great questions

317
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:37,160
and take a moment to relax and soften

318
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:47,240
maybe taking a slightly more relaxed longer breath or two at the beginning

319
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:51,079
into your belly your diaphragm

320
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:09,960
and now sleeping your attention scanning through

321
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:17,160
your body noticing the places that might be

322
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,180
inclined to relax

323
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:29,040
start with some of the places that are most helpful

324
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,119
to tune into the details of the meditation posture

325
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:44,160
noticing the balance of your head over your

326
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:51,619
shoulders softening the eyes

327
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:57,380
if they're not closed and it feels okay to do so closing them

328
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,820
training from staring forward into the future

329
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:13,200
perhaps allowing the eyes to be Softly downcast behind the closed lids

330
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:19,160
or even slightly looking back towards the body and the Heart

331
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:30,078
allowing your face and neck to soften

332
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:41,599
inviting the shoulders to soften and maybe roll back a little bit

333
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:48,380
giving just a little more space in the rib cage for the breath

334
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:59,099
noticing the shifting changing position of your

335
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:07,220
ribs and your chest as the breath Moves In and Out

336
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:16,880
noticing how the breath might soften your back

337
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:23,780
middle back lower back upper back

338
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:33,060
and allowing your belly to hang Softly

339
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:35,660
gently

340
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:48,440
softening the buttocks and the thighs

341
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,000
allowing any excess tension

342
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:03,960
to drain out of your calves and ankles and feet

343
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:10,820
as well as out of your forearms upper arms hands

344
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,859
just inviting may this body relax

345
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:39,320
allowing the attention to be in your whole body

346
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:45,859
noticing the movement of breath

347
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:55,220
noticing any Sensations in your chest around your heart

348
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:08,420
and inviting allowing

349
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,740
any emotion that might be present

350
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:34,578
can be helpful perhaps to softly name it inside with a label

351
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:42,078
gratitude or sadness or

352
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:47,660
calm whatever it is

353
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:01,578
noticing any Sensations in your body

354
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,619
your heart your belly

355
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:16,099
with the naming the acknowledging

356
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:45,380
that starts to shift and change noticing that

357
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:54,839
and if no emotion is obvious it's okay just to rest

358
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:59,480
your attention on the breath and the body

359
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:13,859
from noticing then what replaces that emotion what comes

360
00:42:13,859 --> 00:42:16,099
next

361
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:42,180
letting be with

362
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
allowing

363
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:08,220
and as you explore this noticing too any extra

364
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:14,940
layers second arrows of reaction

365
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:18,660
judgment story

366
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,300
oh okay the reaction

367
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,300
bye-bye

368
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:42,740
charging or allowing

369
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:46,700
whatever it is

370
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:55,578
noticing the relationship between any commentary

371
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:03,380
and the feelings emotions emerging

372
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:11,359
if you find yourself pulled into an emotion or a story about an emotion

373
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:19,760
returning to the body returning to the breath

374
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:27,200
your anchor of attention homebabes here

375
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:38,119
and when the mind the attention has studied a little bit

376
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:47,400
perhaps with part of the attention on the breath noticing again if any emotions

377
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,539
are arising

378
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:17,780
returning again to this moment

379
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:27,920
noticing as gently and kindly as possible what's present

380
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:37,200
what's the inner relationship the inner posture

381
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,020
to what's happening right now

382
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:47,000
and in the last moment or two of this meditation

383
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:53,060
returning the full attention

384
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:02,220
this body and the breath feeling the effects

385
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:11,300
of these moments of mindfulness on any tension or relaxation

386
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:16,099
sensation

387
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:36,920
noticing acknowledging whatever emotions or moods are present

388
00:50:38,599 --> 00:50:44,579
noticing too the internal response all the way

389
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:47,900
through the bell ringing

390
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,670
[Music]

391
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,640
foreign

392
00:51:16,950 --> 00:51:21,180
[Music]

393
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:41,040
thank you for your practice you're going along on that little trip

394
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:46,680
and I both of us would love to hear any

395
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:54,079
comments or questions how that was for you anything you want to share

396
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:59,300
there's no wrong comment or wrong question

397
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:07,380
and if there's a microphone within your reach if you could grab it and turn it on and just have it ready there's one

398
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:15,619
there and one right there do mine just helping um move them around as needed

399
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:24,780
hi um thank you for the meditation in the session

400
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:29,819
um I guess I had a question um because I feel like I'm having a hard

401
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:35,880
time with noticing emotion um I feel like the past two sessions like

402
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:42,180
noticing your breath noticing like Sensations in your body your pain and things like that feel very tangible and

403
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:47,400
like doable for me uh and I guess in this session I noticed

404
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:52,859
that um I start with thinking to notice emotion

405
00:52:52,859 --> 00:52:58,559
like I'm like because when you were like oh like notice what emotions are present for you and then I'm like okay let me

406
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:05,640
think of all the stuff in the back of my head and then I start to label like okay these are the emotions I'm feeling

407
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:12,599
and then I guess my brain doesn't know what to do so it goes back to thinking and it's like okay let's think about everything related to these emotions and

408
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:17,819
how I'm gonna fix it what I'm gonna do um so yeah I just feel like I don't know

409
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:23,640
how to like find the space or I don't know if I know what it means to notice emotion and I feel like I

410
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:28,859
get caught between like I can do the breath and body part

411
00:53:28,859 --> 00:53:33,960
and maybe that feels like I'm not focusing on the emotion when I'm

412
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:40,680
doing that or I'm not feeling the emotion but then to feel the emotion I end up going straight to thinking so

413
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:47,280
um yeah that was my question there's Ancient Ancient Habit in all

414
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:54,839
humans tangling those two things together so good noticing very good noticing of

415
00:53:54,839 --> 00:54:00,960
that that you're getting pulled in it's sticky as what we call it in our scene sticky right there's like a

416
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:07,500
gravitational pull into the thought world so um

417
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:16,440
one thing that's really helpful is to slow it down and to when you do feel an emotion maybe

418
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:22,020
instead of I hear the natural sort of ticking off you know there's all these because there's all this stuff in the

419
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:28,740
back of the head if it's possible to slow it down and pick one and then like really

420
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:33,839
feel in your body if you feel anything associated with it or not

421
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:39,240
and kind of take it one bird at a time so to speak right

422
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:45,119
one one at a time so that's one thought Tanya do you have

423
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:51,720
anything you'd like to add to that yeah what happens if I ask you right now

424
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:57,240
how are you feeling I think it's the same thing like I go

425
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:02,460
straight to like oh I I guess I'm feeling all these things because of

426
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:08,520
all the thinking that's happened in the back of my head so if you were gonna answer me with a feeling word how are

427
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:13,800
you feeling a little anxious

428
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:19,220
it's okay right there just stay with a little anxious

429
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:24,900
where do I feel at my body how do I know I feel anxious or a little

430
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:33,000
anxious and the next practice we'll do will help you also with essentially a lot of what

431
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:38,339
you're asking but um you know I think Donna's right that in

432
00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:43,920
your right you know emotions get very the relationship between emotions and

433
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:52,440
thoughts right like it's a big one big one so it does take some refinement

434
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:59,700
but it's so powerful when you can start to pull them apart so incredibly helpful that's what starts

435
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:06,359
to get us out of that reciprocal kind of reigniting an emotion over and over

436
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:12,119
again is once we stop the the thinking process and we turn more to the raw

437
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:19,619
Direct oh okay all right we'll set on I know I feel lots of things anxious so how do I

438
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:25,260
know I feel anxious right now what what's happening in my body that tells me there's anxiety

439
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:31,140
where do what does that feel like so it's a lot of focusing on those

440
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:39,740
tangible things related to the emotion yes okay that's helpful thank you

441
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:57,180
hi Tanya hi Don good evening thank you um this this session I I felt uh was

442
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:03,660
released and because of the lights at first I was like wow this is new but I I

443
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:08,940
don't know maybe this it being so subdued contributed to I think for the

444
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:15,420
first time in my sitting I was just kind of aware of my breath and the noises

445
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:22,020
from the outside so that was nice and um the attempts at wanting to clear my

446
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:27,619
mind there was no attempt it was just

447
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:34,079
there and it was nice and then I kind of noticed when Don had

448
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:40,920
said let's I'm gonna ring the bell and notice how that feels

449
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:46,319
but then I was also noticing well when's the second one coming

450
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:52,800
um but then I'm like it's just I'm noticing things more rather than attaching

451
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:59,099
things to it which is really nice so this the meditations from this from last

452
00:57:59,099 --> 00:58:06,720
Thursday to now I've been able to just note oh okay right now I'm feeling blank

453
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:12,240
and just being with that so it's just it's just very it's just very

454
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:18,599
helpful I don't think I'm trying so much as I'm just doing it without the trying I don't know how to

455
00:58:18,599 --> 00:58:26,400
explain it sometimes it just sometimes it happens and no as Tanya said no two sittings are the same so

456
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:29,480
thank you okay

457
00:58:32,819 --> 00:58:36,140
thank you great report

458
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:46,619
anybody else please

459
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:51,240
you have a question about emotion

460
00:58:53,400 --> 00:59:00,119
yeah yeah I meanwhile please

461
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:09,319
how come can you write it down in Jared and bring it over because we gotta

462
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:18,059
one comment you made earlier about the arrow and the second Arrow the third

463
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:25,920
Arrow um while reflecting it's like

464
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:31,440
if we want to feel the pain it's like one way another way is

465
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:36,540
like um let's say it's a there is a curved mirror

466
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:42,599
and the ray comes at an angle versus like right in

467
00:59:42,599 --> 00:59:48,480
the center of the you know the um mirror

468
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:54,319
so when we have the if it is coming at an angle then

469
00:59:54,319 --> 01:00:00,059
it will never hurt it's it will be grazing um

470
01:00:00,059 --> 01:00:08,520
if we that is how we feel that feel those arrows versus if we

471
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:15,480
really say that okay this is really coming right in the middle then that's like the

472
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:21,180
um I don't know if I'm so I'm just interpreting your comments

473
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:28,079
so how we alleviate pain or how we let go of that pain even despite that you

474
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:34,500
know it's one two three several arrows still but they are all

475
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:39,900
okay you didn't know am I so I'm not sure I'm understanding everything you're

476
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:45,240
saying but it sounds like you're saying there's something Less Direct about the

477
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:51,900
second third fourth tenth arrows is that right we we are aware

478
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:57,240
we are aware that those arrows are there but

479
01:00:57,240 --> 01:01:04,220
um even if like the first one has made us alert and aware but

480
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:09,720
even if there are several of them but they just keep grazing

481
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:16,440
now it is up to us how we interpret um so whether

482
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:21,980
it is like a soft um

483
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:28,619
tenderness or whatever we would I don't know what we will call it but it's

484
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:37,520
it is um arousing the tenderness but it is

485
01:01:37,859 --> 01:01:44,700
not um significant enough that it is

486
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:50,779
causing any harm it is it is just making us aware

487
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:57,180
one by one I mean or even if there is just one Arrow that's that's fine too

488
01:01:57,180 --> 01:02:04,700
I'm just making trying to interpret those comments about the

489
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:12,540
um when you um talk about arrows and you know the being

490
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:19,640
aware or being pres I don't know if you I can say being present with respect to

491
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:25,920
pain or whatever so what I hear you saying is that the

492
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:34,859
interpretation of what happens next is very important and there's a lot of wisdom to that

493
01:02:34,859 --> 01:02:41,040
and it's helpful to notice the interpretations our minds are

494
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:47,520
making that are increasing pain and the interpretations are increasing the tenderness you're talking about that

495
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:53,760
make them less that make subsequent judgments because we were the the analogy here to the

496
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:59,579
second and third and fourth arrow is in our own minds right our own interpretations there's a beautiful

497
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:08,400
story of the Buddha's Awakening where the forces of delusion are sending

498
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:15,059
arrows at him and he turns them into flowers so a very

499
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:23,880
um attuned mind can take anything a wake mind can take anything as information in

500
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:29,280
order to increase wisdom understanding even Awakening so

501
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:34,520
thank you for your comment great

502
01:03:34,859 --> 01:03:41,520
so let me introduce another part another way to work with emotions a little more

503
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:47,400
structured it's based on an acronym that essentially spells the word raft

504
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:54,119
but with two T's and before I describe the raft in terms

505
01:03:54,119 --> 01:04:00,420
of what the acronym is I want to just say what the place of the simile of a raft is in the

506
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:08,460
Buddhist teaching which is essentially the Buddha taught a story about how the

507
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:15,839
tools that you learn the practices that we're learning will act like a raft that can help you

508
01:04:15,839 --> 01:04:22,559
cross a river to the shore of Freedom away from the

509
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:28,859
shore of suffering suffering and that we use those tools

510
01:04:28,859 --> 01:04:35,640
we have to actually actively paddle with our arms and legs on that raft

511
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:42,119
to get from one side to the other and once we get to that side we don't

512
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:47,640
need to keep using the raft right we can leave the raft on the shore

513
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:55,380
but it's a very this idea of a tool or a way or a practice that can help us stay

514
01:04:55,380 --> 01:05:01,200
afloat in the current of life the flow of thoughts and emotions and

515
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:07,859
experiences and arrows so this simile of a raft is a very

516
01:05:07,859 --> 01:05:13,520
profound one in the teachings um

517
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:20,520
the other thing I'll say about the simile is that it is essentially

518
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:27,240
a way to relate a guide for relationship to our experience

519
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:32,940
a step-by-step process to help us find our way

520
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:38,040
with emotions in particular

521
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:45,299
and you know we're really trying to emphasize awareness and attention so

522
01:05:45,299 --> 01:05:50,880
being aware of and what we're attending to and then the relationship

523
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:58,920
we're having with our experience so what is our you know inner

524
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:05,280
relationship with tenderness or harshness right

525
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:11,280
or many other adjectives you can choose and

526
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:16,799
you know or in our ordinary life when we're not practicing mindfulness

527
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:22,740
you could say that our minds act like a boat or a raft

528
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:29,880
that's adrift in the currents we're not paddling we're just getting tossed about we're

529
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:38,059
going to and fro based on whatever is thrown our way internally or externally does that make sense

530
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:44,160
so you could describe the ordinary mind or the unmindful Mind as a mind that is

531
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:50,339
unrelated unconnected ungrounded disconnected right to a process to being

532
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:56,579
aware to we're not really relating to it we're reacting or going

533
01:06:56,579 --> 01:07:01,740
in this flow and that when we're when we get carried

534
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:07,799
away by it like that we lose perspective we can't see the

535
01:07:07,799 --> 01:07:14,700
shore right so we can't Orient we don't have a um kind of anyone we can

536
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:21,299
turn to there's no relationship there there's no reference point

537
01:07:21,299 --> 01:07:28,500
so as we grow our awareness as we grow our mindfulness our self-awareness

538
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:35,160
right we start to grow a self-relationship a

539
01:07:35,160 --> 01:07:38,838
meditation relationship

540
01:07:41,220 --> 01:07:48,299
and a lot of um awareness itself that just knowing

541
01:07:48,299 --> 01:07:55,579
is this actual simple ability very pure simple knowing

542
01:07:55,579 --> 01:08:05,000
very very simple and pure knowing kind of almost even a neutral attention

543
01:08:07,079 --> 01:08:16,020
but it takes some time to get there to that neutral space so we use

544
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:23,160
kind of our capacity to grow our ability to relate to ourselves with

545
01:08:23,160 --> 01:08:30,120
this more open more fluid more responsive way of being

546
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:37,798
there's a quote from Victor Frankl and man search for meaning and it's

547
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:44,100
between the stimulus let's see between a stimulus and a

548
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:50,040
response is the place for potential Freedom that

549
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:56,278
pause between something happening and are reacting to it the pause

550
01:08:56,279 --> 01:09:05,359
is where our freedom is found and the more pause the more freedom more choice we have

551
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:12,719
so that creating the capacity for that pause requires a neutrality

552
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:19,679
if we are immediately reactive to what's coming at up it feeds the intensity right the more

553
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:24,198
likely we are to react quickly to something

554
01:09:27,239 --> 01:09:34,080
so this you know kind of attention this awareness it is possible to become aware

555
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:39,480
of being aware we can start to notice that oh I'm aware and there's a way that

556
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:44,640
when we see that oh I I look I'm not I'm aware oh now I'm aware I'm anxious

557
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:50,278
there's a little bit of a sitting back that can happen into that oh just pure

558
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:56,760
knowing so that'll happen from time to time you'll move in and out of it but when

559
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:01,920
you notice it try and when you feel like oh yeah I'm aware that I'm aware ah feel

560
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:10,159
into that space that that's there's something there that can be very supportive and helpful

561
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:20,460
so now we'll come back to the acronym raft I'll tell you what each letter stands

562
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:25,620
for and then I'll move into a guided practice for you

563
01:10:25,620 --> 01:10:33,719
so R is a simple recognition like oh hi Corey I see you you're

564
01:10:33,719 --> 01:10:41,280
sitting here like just this oh hello right I see you you know so the naming

565
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:46,860
is part of that like the wrecking you know naming is a way that we get into

566
01:10:46,860 --> 01:10:52,679
Clarity with something right like that's where the naming of an emotion becomes

567
01:10:52,679 --> 01:10:58,739
helpful because we get oh now I know what I'm focusing on okay there's a lot going on in here but

568
01:10:58,739 --> 01:11:04,739
oh let me name that emotion and if it's hard to name you could

569
01:11:04,739 --> 01:11:13,620
choose to say describe it in a simple word like painful or Intense or hot you know so

570
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:18,840
don't worry about getting the exact right name but something that feels like

571
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:25,140
enough right um so recognize

572
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:32,340
The Next Step the a is to have a relationship with what

573
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:39,800
you're recognizing that allows it to be there allows it space

574
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:47,159
a lot of times we don't want what we're feeling or we want more of what we're feeling

575
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:52,820
and either way we're not really allowing space for that emotion

576
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:59,100
for what's going on so recognize then allow see if I can't

577
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:05,880
kind of accept as another optional word but sometimes people have a hard time I

578
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:11,460
can't accept that I'm feeling this way or that this is going on but can you

579
01:12:11,460 --> 01:12:16,679
allow that it is already happening that's the thing it's already here

580
01:12:16,679 --> 01:12:25,020
so allowing that reality to be acknowledged the F and the raft is to feel it to find

581
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:33,300
and fill it in the body so that's when we start to really turn into it in more intimate way like okay

582
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:40,679
I named this as anxiety this is such a good one so common what does that feel like where

583
01:12:40,679 --> 01:12:47,460
do I fill up my solar plexus oh no it's more in my stomach kind of spreads up or

584
01:12:47,460 --> 01:12:53,400
oh it's like in my chest I can't breathe feels like pressure

585
01:12:53,400 --> 01:13:00,960
you know um it feels like you know squeezing it feels like

586
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:07,880
pounding so whatever words work but to describe the sense sensation of it the

587
01:13:07,880 --> 01:13:16,560
feeling and part of what we're doing is disconnecting from the thinking Story right which allows us to stop that kind

588
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:22,080
of circular pattern of reigniting the emotion and sometimes it's so simple and

589
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:27,239
fast it's almost like oh I named it and it disappears literally it can really

590
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:34,199
move just instantly through us other times emotions are longer lasting even

591
01:13:34,199 --> 01:13:40,679
if we're we think we're trying to shift toward the sensation because there's something stronger in the mind some

592
01:13:40,679 --> 01:13:46,340
image or idea that that kind of permeates

593
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:52,739
the next part in the raft is to tease it apart like to literally help yourself oh

594
01:13:52,739 --> 01:13:58,679
here's the memory of that back then that's not happening here and now but

595
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:05,159
this memory is part of it oh here's the story I'm telling myself about having this feeling like aren't I done with

596
01:14:05,159 --> 01:14:11,159
this yet aren't I better yet that's my story so I like to imagine a

597
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:16,440
big round table with a lot of chairs and a lot of space

598
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:21,960
and so as I tease apart what's happening in the in the emotion if I get this far

599
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:27,900
because it may have dissolved already I'd like to give each little part that I

600
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:33,659
become aware of a seat at this table I don't have to do anything else but

601
01:14:33,659 --> 01:14:40,140
name them and give it a little space sometimes they need recliners

602
01:14:40,140 --> 01:14:45,300
you know you can play with your mind and what helps you let it sit what you what

603
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:52,199
helps it allow it to be there and kind of let it it's like pulling apart something so you can see it better you

604
01:14:52,199 --> 01:14:58,140
got a better view oh my God look at this I'm anxious right now partly because of

605
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:05,040
what happened to me in kindergarten oh oh and and there's the friend that I had

606
01:15:05,040 --> 01:15:13,100
at that time sitting over here too and I don't even know who she is anymore right so it starts to help us kind of

607
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:19,320
disentangle the the big tangle inside our minds

608
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:25,920
the last T and the Double T is to end with a sense of trust

609
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:31,739
can we trust the nature of Life can we trust that these emotions

610
01:15:31,739 --> 01:15:39,080
come and go what can you trust because what does trust do when we feel into trust what happens

611
01:15:39,239 --> 01:15:44,400
Ah that's not letting go we're relaxing

612
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:49,440
and that's really important because we've just done a lot of work trying to figure these things out and now we just

613
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:55,440
don't need to do anything else we can trust what we know we can trust that there's a process just like the body

614
01:15:55,440 --> 01:16:02,340
knows how to digest food when you eat it your body knows how to synthesize an

615
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:07,739
emotion if we feel it we don't have to like tell it step by

616
01:16:07,739 --> 01:16:13,739
step what to do it knows how the system knows how

617
01:16:13,739 --> 01:16:18,960
so if we can get out of the way if we can stop at shooting the arrows

618
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:24,659
can we trust the system can we trust nature can we trust awareness

619
01:16:24,659 --> 01:16:29,760
can we trust that things change come and go and that this is going to change on

620
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:36,060
its own in some point some way all right

621
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:41,640
so now let's practice so first of all I want you to orient

622
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:46,800
we're going to do this fairly quickly but anytime we're going to practice it's

623
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:55,620
always good Orient okay where am I right now what day is this what time is this how is my body what is my posture

624
01:16:55,620 --> 01:17:01,980
take a minute to yep Rock back and forth sit up okay I want to bring an upright

625
01:17:01,980 --> 01:17:07,199
attention to my practice I want to be awake I want to see

626
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:13,980
I want to connect and then finding you know the body

627
01:17:13,980 --> 01:17:18,380
finding yourself settling into the body

628
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:24,659
set your attention to be aware I want to work on being aware and

629
01:17:24,659 --> 01:17:30,300
mindful and present for my experience Here and Now

630
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:37,580
as directly as I can be not the story the experience

631
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:43,760
and then let's take three deep breaths just three longer breaths

632
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:50,340
with the exhale inviting and letting go to relax into an upright posture but

633
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:54,440
letting the muscles soften

634
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:18,600
okay and then just like if we're

635
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:24,480
coming into contact with another human you might ask

636
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:32,719
what are you feeling what am I feeling right now

637
01:18:33,060 --> 01:18:40,020
and you might feel many things so just just choosing and naming

638
01:18:40,020 --> 01:18:44,719
one emotion one feeling

639
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:57,239
kind of like oh I'm I'm mostly relaxed but I can feel a

640
01:18:57,239 --> 01:19:03,420
little Edge a little anxiety little sadness

641
01:19:03,420 --> 01:19:10,440
a little frustration whatever it is just okay let me tune into this

642
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:13,460
I see you

643
01:19:17,159 --> 01:19:22,440
so choose one part of your emotional experience that you're willing to relate

644
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:26,178
to right now in this moment

645
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:37,620
and then notice with the a am I able to allow this emotion this

646
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:42,780
feeling to be acknowledged right now

647
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:47,000
allowing it to be known

648
01:19:50,699 --> 01:19:56,820
there can be a feeling of rightness that happens in this moment a feeling of

649
01:19:56,820 --> 01:20:00,198
okay yes

650
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:09,300
and when you feel that sense of okay I can allow this

651
01:20:09,300 --> 01:20:16,980
move to the F the find and fill it if you can't find that feeling of allowing

652
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:26,460
what you can then name is resistance not wanting and an emotion in that

653
01:20:26,460 --> 01:20:33,420
that might be what you end up then recognizing oh yeah I can allow myself to recognize

654
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:38,640
I'm resisting I'm not wanting I don't like okay

655
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:47,040
and then we move to the f can you find it and feel it in your sensation body

656
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:56,120
key places to check are the belly and the chest

657
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:00,560
the shoulders and neck

658
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:09,140
the jaw eyebrow Temple area

659
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:17,219
eyes but even the hands you might notice or

660
01:21:17,219 --> 01:21:21,800
the feet and legs can be bracing

661
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:33,000
seeing if you can't gently recognize the sensations and where you feel them in

662
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:41,120
your body just that acknowledging awareness just as it is

663
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:47,699
and rather than resisting it or succumbing to it

664
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:52,580
kind of standing with it in Witness

665
01:21:54,420 --> 01:22:00,000
if you find any of the feelings or sensation become overwhelming

666
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:07,440
it's okay to back up shift your focus or just tune into one part that feels

667
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:13,920
manageable we don't need to try and do too much or

668
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:20,960
work with something that doesn't feel like we can be with it

669
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:29,820
when you're ready if there's something there that still would be worked with

670
01:22:29,820 --> 01:22:35,580
we move to the teasing apart this is that idea of the table

671
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:41,820
the chairs where we might acknowledge

672
01:22:41,820 --> 01:22:48,920
oh here's the story I tell myself about this feeling and give it a seat

673
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:55,640
oh here's an image of myself give it a seat

674
01:22:56,820 --> 01:23:03,320
oh here's liking or not liking this feeling and give it a seat

675
01:23:08,699 --> 01:23:15,900
so there's ideas about things there's stories beliefs

676
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:21,239
memories images

677
01:23:21,239 --> 01:23:27,360
preferences these are all parts that could be teased

678
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:33,239
apart maybe if you can figure out two pieces of it and just set it at the table

679
01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:35,840
that's enough

680
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:54,739
and as you allow this some space you might just drop in the question

681
01:23:54,960 --> 01:24:02,840
hmm what's hard for me about being with us

682
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:07,280
or where do I feel stuck

683
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:19,820
what what do I want to get rid of

684
01:24:25,739 --> 01:24:30,860
in what way do I not want this experience

685
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:42,960
and then moving to the last t because you just because we're

686
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:48,780
practicing quickly with this right now you can always come back

687
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:56,219
if you were going to shift to the last T what can I trust about what I'm seeing about my

688
01:24:56,219 --> 01:25:00,920
experience about mindfulness

689
01:25:02,159 --> 01:25:08,040
like emotions won't kill me for example might be something you can

690
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:14,460
trust maybe breathing helps me

691
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:17,659
can you trust that

692
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:27,060
maybe it's helpful to know it's impermanent and that it will change can

693
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:29,840
you trust that

694
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:47,219
and giving yourself another 20 seconds to find what you trust

695
01:25:47,219 --> 01:25:53,100
something simple inviting that trust to come more fully

696
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:55,940
into your being

697
01:26:13,680 --> 01:26:21,890
[Music]

698
01:26:27,960 --> 01:26:34,340
so we have time for one or two questions or comments

699
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:41,719
um how was that for you how was the raft process for you

700
01:26:42,540 --> 01:26:45,920
great grab the mic

701
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:58,020
I think this one was kind of intense only because I was recognizing that I oh

702
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:04,860
all the stressors that I've allowed in my life and and how it's just been I've allowed myself to be dominated by the

703
01:27:04,860 --> 01:27:10,679
stresses of work and I'm like oh I have more to cultivate outside of that and

704
01:27:10,679 --> 01:27:16,739
then then I was allowing myself to uh allowing myself with that kind of

705
01:27:16,739 --> 01:27:23,880
recognition that my life is not my job and then feeling I

706
01:27:23,880 --> 01:27:30,000
was feeling all the the things and focusing but then I was also just recollecting

707
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:36,000
all the things that happened today at work and but then I noticed that it was all positive stuff and so I think

708
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:42,120
towards the end I've I just was trying to trust myself in

709
01:27:42,120 --> 01:27:50,340
that I can I can just be like put the practice and just whatever happens it's

710
01:27:50,340 --> 01:27:56,880
okay I can just know what I'm

711
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:01,980
at least be more aware of what I'm thinking what happened and Rose when you

712
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:07,280
got to that point what did you notice uh

713
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:15,239
it was a bit free a bit frame just a little bit a little bit is a lot

714
01:28:15,239 --> 01:28:20,639
I but there was also the part though that you had mentioned about

715
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:27,300
the space between the thought yes and I just I don't know if is it because I don't

716
01:28:27,300 --> 01:28:33,239
have the emotional maturity yet to to not respond you know or just

717
01:28:33,239 --> 01:28:38,960
I'm like I want to have that emotional intelligence to not react in a way where

718
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:46,500
I I will regret what I'm doing or saying I just can I can I say something

719
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:51,440
about that emotional intelligence piece is that

720
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:57,840
um it is wisdom we grow

721
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:04,440
but it's it's wisdom that's like a muscle not like IQ

722
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:10,440
it's a muscle that grows the wisdom that grows from direct experience direct knowing

723
01:29:10,440 --> 01:29:17,159
directly having that little moment of a little bit of freedom

724
01:29:17,159 --> 01:29:23,159
every time we have that experience with awareness we're growing and strengthening that

725
01:29:23,159 --> 01:29:28,260
wisdom so it's a combination of a a muscle that

726
01:29:28,260 --> 01:29:33,600
we grow the capacity but also the taking in of the wisdom

727
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:39,360
does that make sense so it's a process it takes practice

728
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:44,699
we don't go from no Gap to a huge gap

729
01:29:44,699 --> 01:29:50,040
usually so thank you thank you

730
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:56,940
and that was wonderful illustration and I'll be here after we need to shift to

731
01:29:56,940 --> 01:30:02,040
closing so if anyone has other comments or questions afterwards please don't

732
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:09,920
hesitate to approach Don or I yeah we'll both stay after meanwhile I just want to

733
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:16,080
offer on behalf of both of us are deeply sincere appreciation for all of you and

734
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:21,420
for coming here and for cultivating this in your practice and

735
01:30:21,420 --> 01:30:28,080
to invite you to um consider some homework assignment to

736
01:30:28,080 --> 01:30:34,800
Mission should you choose to accept it there's four components this this week

737
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:39,900
and they're all on the handout but I'm just going to briefly mention them now

738
01:30:39,900 --> 01:30:46,139
the first is to up your meditation time to 25 minutes a day if you're not

739
01:30:46,139 --> 01:30:51,540
already practicing that much when you can with all the caveats that we know

740
01:30:51,540 --> 01:30:58,920
that life happens so whether it's five times a week or seven times a week or three times a week

741
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:05,580
to do the best you can the second is to really at some point in

742
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:11,520
the week you can do it more than once if you want notice an emotion coming up

743
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:18,420
and just ride it out just dried it out rather than

744
01:31:18,420 --> 01:31:24,179
Building stories about it or getting into commentary about it see how

745
01:31:24,179 --> 01:31:29,400
what best you can ride it out and use the tools the raft tools that Tanya just

746
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:36,540
gave they are also on the handout so you don't have to remember everything she said

747
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:43,380
the third thing is to really take time to notice and Savor any feelings of

748
01:31:43,380 --> 01:31:51,120
Happiness contentment Joy anything in the positive beneficial Realm

749
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:58,320
and the last is um notice which feelings which emotions

750
01:31:58,320 --> 01:32:03,620
pull you into preoccupation

751
01:32:03,719 --> 01:32:09,239
many of us have sort of a Greatest Hits list right and to just start to notice

752
01:32:09,239 --> 01:32:16,560
what your pattern is we've all got them so those are all written down

753
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:21,600
should you choose to accept it that's what we're asking you to do and

754
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:28,980
also just to mention that there are other resources here at IMC there is a book of Gil franstal our

755
01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:35,880
guiding teacher one of our guiding teachers essays called the issue at hand and I believe that stack of books is in

756
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:43,139
the front on the little counter the Donna box as you exit and there's also on that same area a

757
01:32:43,139 --> 01:32:49,320
newsletter so both of those contain resources of different kinds essays or

758
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:54,719
entries about other classes other groups that kind of thing

759
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:59,940
so thank you again so much for your practice for being here together in

760
01:32:59,940 --> 01:33:05,100
community and with us and if you all have other questions or

761
01:33:05,100 --> 01:33:11,280
comments please feel free to come up and chat with us thank you guys we're going to dedicate

762
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:17,719
the Merit very briefly sorry may all beings everywhere

763
01:33:17,719 --> 01:33:24,780
including and especially ourselves and those Our Lives touch benefit from this practice
