1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:09,599
so good day greetings and here we are beginning of our

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:18,560
meditation session and there are two things i want to

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:26,400
bring forth at the beginning of this meditation where the overall context is

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,160
or focus now on this practice of mindfulness of breathing

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,280
is samadhi the unification of mind the

6
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:48,000
serenity of mind the concentration of mind and um a very strong association with

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,600
the deeper concentration in buddhism in the early buddhism is the idea of

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,680
assurance some people some translators translated self-assurance or

9
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,240
confidence and so that uh we're kind of looking for or we're

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:14,080
evoking or we're resting on some where we're um beginning to prioritize or

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,200
recognize in us and providing in us

12
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,960
is a deep sense of internal assurance

13
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:34,400
internal confidence that comes along with somebody with this unification

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,520
but also supports it so certainly for many of us something

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,759
deep inside in our hearts probably it could use a lot of assurance

16
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,960
the world is in big change and a lot of challenges and

17
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,759
and to be able to discover a place of deep assurance so that

18
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:09,200
we can let go of our thoughts our concerns our everyday preoccupations really let go

19
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,680
and discover us the tremendous goodness that resides within us and have that

20
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:23,599
goodness be a resource for how we live our life so that's one thing assurance the other

21
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,959
is that one of the primary one of the great analogies or similes buddha uses for a particular state of

22
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:38,400
concentration is that of a of a mountain lake

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,800
that is not being fed by any water any rain or any rivers feeding into it

24
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,239
but the only feeding of the lake the nourishment of the lake replenishment of the lake is an

25
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,480
underwater spring maybe right in smack in the middle of a lake underwater spring with an underwater

26
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:04,080
fountain of water that gets sprayed up and out and fills the lake with a new water

27
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:12,000
fresh water clean water and so the idea of there being a found

28
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,599
a source within us a spring within us that really is a little bit is

29
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,800
peacefully wonderfully uh flowing moving dynamic

30
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,599
this sense of flow a vibration of aliveness of vitality of

31
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:37,920
of joy of assurance that we are opening to allow for

32
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,879
and so these two things assurance and this inner flow of goodness of warmth of of energy

33
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,920
of vitality requires something of us requires of us to

34
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,680
create the conditions for to allow it to fill us to allow it to

35
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,000
live in us and one of the requirements is not being preoccupied by things not being off run

36
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:08,640
running off to the races and thinking about things and worried about things certainly it's

37
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,640
difficult not to put down it's difficult to put down our everyday concerns and emotions and feelings

38
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,600
so i acknowledge that but it's also possible to begin orienting

39
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,639
oneself in in the kind of level of receptivity

40
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:34,320
and softness and kindness that generosity inner generosity

41
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:41,680
that begins making it possible to invite or to sense or feel or receive

42
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,160
a kind of assurance and a kind of vitality and aliveness that samadhi

43
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,160
is so not samadhi is not this narrow laser focus that we all get tight and

44
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,280
contracted but rather it's an opening and letting go

45
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:06,160
into the bottom of the bowl into really being centered here

46
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,520
in that center maybe somewhere there you feel more alive and vital this flow

47
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,400
of goodness maybe very subtle so assurance and receptivity

48
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:28,240
a willingness to receive and be here a willingness to be here to allow all to

49
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:35,520
invite all things to come in and be unified be gathered collected here

50
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,840
so taking a meditation posture

51
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:53,840
that maybe for you will somehow some simple way

52
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,880
in some simple way that will

53
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:10,479
invite goodness invite nourishment invite

54
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,520
what's that what's really good in you reassuring in you to be here

55
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:23,120
a posture of assurance and to gently close your eyes

56
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,400
and allow yourself to relax in your body

57
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,280
so that with some assurance your inhale begins

58
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,520
and the exhale is allowed

59
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:56,960
the inhale has characteristics of this inner

60
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:04,560
this the inner the spring and in her leg something that arises and flows

61
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,880
and moves and expands through the body

62
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,840
and to allow the beginning of the in-breath

63
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,680
to allow the all the sensations of breathing in

64
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,840
to be received and felt

65
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:45,759
and then to as you exhale allow yourself to relax the body

66
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:54,639
relaxing the face the shoulders the belly a kind of relaxation that becomes

67
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:02,720
an invitation for your body to self-organize

68
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:13,840
the body to become whole

69
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,400
and as you exhale allowing the mind the thinking mind to relax

70
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,840
and soften

71
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,080
adjusting the mind a little bit so the attitude the way of thinking the way you are in

72
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:40,719
the mind is

73
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:48,000
is kind enough for pleasant enough friendly enough soft enough

74
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:09,839
that the mind gathers together everything in the mind is welcomed to come into a hole

75
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:20,720
and as you exhale again to settle in

76
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:26,560
let go with the exhale deep inside of you

77
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,839
to a place maybe where there's some assurance confidence

78
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:51,839
some place of peace or tranquility

79
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,440
allowing the body whole body to be receptive

80
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,920
to the vitality of itself the physical vitality of life

81
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,760
flowing and moving through you

82
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,839
relaxing into that opening

83
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:36,480
and then at the center of it all steady yourself on your breathing

84
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:48,480
breathing in breathing out a gentle steadiness

85
00:10:48,800 --> 00:11:01,839
with a mind that's softening quieting

86
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,920
breathing with inner

87
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
assurance

88
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,880
breathing with whatever inner wholesomeness there is or maybe in some people's language

89
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:50,639
whatever inner goodness that's here not that you're thinking about it

90
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,399
but a felt sense

91
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,519
a vitality aliveness of goodness

92
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:11,839
of which the movements of breathing are part of

93
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:33,279
and then instead of counting the breaths today maybe at every exhale

94
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:39,519
there's some there's a similar thing you can do a single word

95
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:46,480
to place you into the experience in a receptive soft assured way

96
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,600
and maybe you don't say the word with your inner mind your inner voice

97
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,639
but you do it so quietly that it's you imagine you're saying it

98
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:07,839
and every time you exhale imagine saying yes

99
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,320
just yes to your experience to being here to breathing

100
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,920
to steadying yourself quieting yourself

101
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,959
on the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

102
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:39,680
the breathing that occurs within the vitality aliveness

103
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,480
of your lake

104
00:13:44,959 --> 00:14:03,839
yes on the exhale

105
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:55,839
yes and letting go of your thoughts

106
00:18:51,679 --> 00:19:01,520
hey yes that comes with a small subtle smile

107
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:11,840
barely perceptible turning up the corners of your lips

108
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:25,840
yes of delight

109
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,840
and as we come to the end of this

110
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:38,080
sitting to find within you

111
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,880
a place of assurance

112
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,840
confidence

113
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:59,520
even if it's quite small find the place where there is

114
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,720
located within you embodied expression of

115
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:12,240
confidence assurance and breathe with that

116
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:20,320
maybe as you exhale letting go into that assurance that confidence

117
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:28,840
a confidence and assurance which the buddhist tradition associates with a

118
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,840
peacefulness

119
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,919
and as you're sitting here meditating

120
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,159
maybe with some assurance and peacefulness confidence

121
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:03,840
and without needing to say or do anything for anyone here in the privacy of your own

122
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:12,480
meditation open your heart and mind

123
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:19,760
to the people around you in the town you live county

124
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,960
province you live in the people maybe you'll interact with on

125
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,600
through technology or people you're likely to think about

126
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:45,039
and just settle back in your assurance and gaze upon these people kindly

127
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:52,720
relax back safely in your place of assurance

128
00:29:53,120 --> 00:30:02,080
and gaze out imagine everyone engaging upon them with good will

129
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,880
maybe even imagining what some of their faces would look like

130
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,399
if they were happy smiles they would have

131
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,880
maybe a little sparkle in their eyes

132
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:37,840
and imagine how good it would be if they could be happy this way

133
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:46,240
and let there be inside of you if you'd like an attitude and thoughts of goodwill and

134
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:55,039
well-wishing for these people may they be happy

135
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:05,840
may they be safe

136
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,000
may they be peaceful

137
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,840
and may they be free

138
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:32,720
and may you carry with you through the day this private place within

139
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:40,640
whether you have enough assurance and confidence that privately you can gaze

140
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:48,240
upon others consider think about others with good will and well-wishing

141
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,760
for their happiness and whether you act on it or not is a

142
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,799
secondary thing

143
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:07,039
to allow to bring at least your inner life

144
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,880
to have love or care or goodwill for the people around you they don't

145
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,840
have to know

146
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,760
[Music]

147
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:36,049
[Music]

148
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:47,919
so breathing in one

149
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:54,720
concentrates breathing out one concentrates the mind

150
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:02,640
breathing in one steadies the mind breathing out one steadies the mind

151
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:10,240
breathing in one unifies the mind breathing out one unifies the mind

152
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:17,120
so all these words concentrate steady unify are all kind of

153
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:23,840
uh facets of the same thing developing and deepening

154
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,840
meditation practice and it can be helpful in the deepening of practice

155
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:36,559
to have some landmarks so have some signposts some some kind of sense of

156
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:43,840
where we're going or what we're looking for what we're valuing as we develop meditation practice

157
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:51,200
because the you know subconsciously unconsciously

158
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:58,399
the mind is valuing all kinds of things and and that's why the mind the thoughts go

159
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:06,000
off thinking about the past future fantasy what we're worrying about what we want because we

160
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:13,358
value we have we we prioritize or we put value into those concerns

161
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:19,440
but if we have value in the process of meditation and the signposts the experiences of

162
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,720
meditation and enough to recognize them then we make space for them to grow

163
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:31,280
we they we make space for them to nourish us and support us and provide more confidence more reassurance

164
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:38,398
oh this is good this is the right thing to do so it's easier to put down our preoccupations

165
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:44,638
and so with this deepening of the practice there's uh things like the mind becomes

166
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,760
stiller quieter the mind the body becomes softer

167
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,720
more malleable there becomes a sense of well-being of different kinds joy and

168
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:04,800
happiness subtleness the the um there can be a

169
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,880
sense of joy and happiness there can be equanimity uh there can be a sense of being really

170
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,160
embodied i could not really feel the vitality of our life coursing through us and

171
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:22,880
really feeling present and whole or settled ah it feels so good to be at home in this body

172
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,000
and the same thing with the mind the mind can feel have assurance to it be peaceful

173
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,560
the mind can start feeling expansive as if the mind has a room for all the little details all the

174
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,599
dramas of our life all the concerns we have all the little experiences

175
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:45,200
the details anything that's a detail can be held now in your mind that's

176
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:51,200
really broad and wide like a very large large room that can hold all the

177
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:58,000
everyone everything everybody inside in a peaceful spacious way so this expansive mind

178
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,880
open mind there can be for some people a sense of brightness even light that comes on that

179
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:11,200
feels really good but i wanted to provide you with the three similes

180
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:17,359
analogies that the buddha uses for this deepening of meditation practice and

181
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:24,320
the advantage of similes or analogies is that each person kind of interpret it

182
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:29,920
or find themselves in it more easily than with a clear kind of technical description of

183
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:35,440
what might supposed to be happening in meditation similarly analogies are a little black

184
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:43,200
poetry they're evocative they touch our kind of imagination maybe even our emotions a little bit

185
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:52,240
these things also have get a little bit kinesthetic or somatic sometimes the these images so that our somatic

186
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:59,440
involvement with associations come into play as well and um and uh and there's a lot of room

187
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,480
for personal uniqueness so our own way of finding ourselves

188
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,680
in these analogies so i want to offer three of them and they they're kind of

189
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:16,240
three progressive and now uh deepening stages of meditation and the first uh and they all have to

190
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:22,960
use the they all have they all use water in the analogies and

191
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,240
it's never been explained to me why water keeps being used in these similes

192
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,800
analogies what it represents but i take it to represent the mind or awareness itself

193
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:41,359
and that's the medium in which we're operating right now or the mind the awareness and and so this

194
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:46,560
awareness begins um takes different shapes different

195
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:55,280
forms as it practice deepens so the first simile is water

196
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:02,560
being sprinkled into in our modern equivalent into flower and as the water gets

197
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:08,079
sprinkled in the water gets folded in kneaded in

198
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:15,839
stirred into the flour until the flour becomes dough you know to make bread and so what's

199
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:22,720
important is that all the all the water that's being sprinkled in gets kneaded in and spread out evenly throughout the

200
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:30,000
dough and so part of the kneading of the bread eating of the flour the dough is to get

201
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,839
that spread out the the you know equally around so that the dough kind of could hold the

202
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:43,359
flour can hold together into one hole so that's the analogy and uh

203
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:49,920
and um in a sense the the flower is the body and the

204
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,160
and the water is the awareness or the mind and we want to bring these together so the awareness

205
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:02,880
is um immersed in or penetrates throughout the body so the body and mind are to be

206
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:08,560
in the same place at the same time if the mind is thinking about other times in other places

207
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:14,000
then the body and mind are separated but if the mind starts focusing

208
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,640
awareness starts entering into the bodiness present for the body like for the breathing then the mind is kind of in the same

209
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:26,079
place in the same time as the body and uh and

210
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:33,280
by doing that uh what we're looking for is the body and mind to end up in in a kind of harmony with each other um

211
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,480
a kind of unification and harmonious working together where there can be real

212
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:45,440
experience feelings of health and healthfulness healthiness and wholesomeness that can't be felt

213
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:53,359
if there's a real dichotomy real separation between these two parts of ourselves and um

214
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:59,040
and so we take awareness and uh we bring it into our breathing

215
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,720
and and work it's kind of nice the breathing itself is kind of a massage a kind of a kneading

216
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,880
but we bring our awareness and we place it we sprinkle it into something like our breathing

217
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,920
and then we want to knead it we want to stay there with the breathing and those are two different movements

218
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:22,160
that i talked about yesterday the contact the placing of attention somewhere like with the breathing

219
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:29,280
and then keeping it there and keeping it there is not holding it necessarily steady but a gentle kind of working it

220
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,640
and staying there staying there be there and then we have to do it again because the mind wanders

221
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:41,839
off we come back and connect and stay there and stay there and and that's a sprinkling of awareness

222
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:48,960
into our breathing into our body and we're kneading it in we're kneading it in and so there's a massage there's a

223
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:56,240
rhythm of coming back and applying yourself staying there reconnecting and so for every beginning

224
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,280
of the inhale and begin the exhale there's a kind of gentle reconnecting that goes on there

225
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:08,319
and then it's staying there stay there be there so the massage and so slowly

226
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:14,560
um we're beginning to uh penetrate awareness into the whole experience of breathing

227
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:21,359
so it's continuous and and fills the experience of breathing wherever that might be in the body

228
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:27,520
and then and then there's a kind of uh as we get a hang and we're doing this hang of doing this and

229
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:33,599
feel like this is going well there can be a rise a kind of gladness certainly the gladness

230
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,440
and happiness of relief of not being lost and preoccupied in some of these thoughts

231
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:48,319
that thinking that we have that maybe not for some of you but for many of us you know is not so much fun

232
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:54,079
it's not a great thing sometimes to spend a lot of time caught up in thoughts and ruminations

233
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:02,000
and stuff and what a relief it is to have the thoughts received enough and not be pulled into their orbit and be

234
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,480
settled in here so there's work involved there's this kneading the sprinkling in

235
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,760
coming here the next analogy is that what i used in meditation

236
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,359
is that now the is the mountain's mountain lake with the underwater spring that flows

237
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:25,119
through it and now in a sense uh awareness has become very stable

238
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:32,240
and expansive and big and kind of penetrates or is resting or is maybe coterminous with

239
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:38,160
the body that somehow now awareness in the body are not so distinct

240
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,400
but we really feel the fullness the vitality the aliveness of the body

241
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,480
where the sensing the sensory apparatus of the body's sense endings of the body are part of the

242
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,160
awareness system and so awareness is not just cognitive

243
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:02,319
mental observing or knowing but there's a broader feeling of sensing and aliveness

244
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:09,520
that's part of awareness and so the body and mind now are are there together as partners and then

245
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,880
uh within that the the concentration the steadiness the

246
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:23,359
real kind of intimacy with just breathing is um if he has this inner goodness and

247
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:29,920
nourishment to it that there's a welding up of a kind of joy or well-being or delight

248
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:36,880
that's not evaluative it's not like we have to think ourselves into being happy it's almost like some people say that

249
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:42,640
there are joy hormones or serotonin and endorphins they get released

250
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:49,040
in this steady massaging staying with a focus of concentration a sense of

251
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:55,920
well-being wells up and there's a flow of vitality that feels like it comes from the inside out the joy that comes from

252
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,480
the inside like a spring going forth the last analogy is now

253
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:09,119
the deeper meditation the sense of flow and vitality and joy settles away

254
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,839
into a very deep satisfying peacefulness and the analogy is that of a of uh

255
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:22,800
the lake has now become or lake has become really still unmoving and there's lotus is growing in

256
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:29,440
it meaning it's not a cold mountain lake or something but now it's a very nice temperature lake that's very

257
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:36,000
comfortable to be in and there's beautiful lotus many different colored lotus flowers

258
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,000
submerged in the lake floating on the lake and and this sense of everything's very

259
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,319
peaceful everything is calm very still and everything that's known within that

260
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:53,680
calmness even though conventionally it might be something that's not

261
00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:00,000
maybe a little bit of i don't know something not not so nice maybe but everything that is touched by

262
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,560
awareness now touched by the water is like beautiful lotus flowers floating there peacefully in space in the in the

263
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:11,920
water so additionally there's work

264
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:17,359
in the with the kneading of the dough and then there's no more work and it's just a flow that's happening

265
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:22,800
we're being carried by the flow and then the flow comes down

266
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,319
and we're just kind of in this very peaceful place very still place where everything just

267
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:33,920
feels beautiful and there's and it's in that uh and in these states

268
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:41,280
where there's a lot of reassurance a lot of confidence a lot of equanimity um and it's a beautiful thing to tap

269
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:47,839
into this capacity for deep confidence deep serenity deep reassurance it does the heart a

270
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:53,920
tremendous amount of good to have it and it does not depend

271
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:00,640
on the things in the world around us being just right being fixed

272
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:07,599
it's uh this very private inner place inside that uh becomes a resource for which we

273
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:12,960
can kind of enter into the world in a in a wonderful way

274
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:19,760
so maybe those analogies are interesting for you to play with and work with and

275
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:27,520
maybe this topic of inner reassurance assurance and confidence is something that you can

276
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:35,599
explore how that lives in you as you go through the next day and i look forward to seeing you tomorrow thank you

277
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:44,079
and then to mention again that um monday we'll have a community meeting

278
