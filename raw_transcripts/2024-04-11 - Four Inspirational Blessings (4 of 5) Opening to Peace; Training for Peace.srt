1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:07,799
all right so let's get started

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:15,279
together today I would like to invite you to start with your eyes

3
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,320
open for the meditation and just take a moment to

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:27,599
orient to the space that you're in so you can look around just briefly

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,230
but we're not looking at any particular object it's just feeling the space that you're

6
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,840
[Music] in and have a sense generally that there is

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,039
space and then there are some things in it in the room including

8
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:51,960
you and just let the Mind feel into that

9
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:02,079
space and now I'll invite you to close your eyes and

10
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,600
begin to find the meditation

11
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,080
posture maybe there's still a vague sense of the space around you that you're sitting

12
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,520
[Music] in but you're also aware now of the

13
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,640
Inner Space and how the body feels from the

14
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,840
inside sense of whatever posture you're in perhaps you're sitting up

15
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,890
perhaps you're lying down perhaps even [Music]

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,240
standing so having a general sense of this

17
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,920
orientation you can notice that the space in the mind is somewhat like the space in the

18
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:02,640
room I'm tuning in more specifically to your

19
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,599
posture finding a balanced posture so sometimes I even Rock back

20
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:15,440
and forth slightly or forward and back just a little bit to really find that

21
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,040
Center Point that's

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,599
balanced and when the body is balanced in an upright posture it takes really

23
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:32,800
almost no muscular effort to be

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,959
upright or if you're lying down you can sense into the straightness of the

25
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:47,720
spine and I know there are variations for different bodies so we're doing this

26
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,480
within what works for our

27
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:01,840
body but finding balance ease

28
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:11,599
it can help to sense into the places where the body is in contact so the seat

29
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:19,680
against the chair or the cushion or the bench or the body against the

30
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,560
bed really being aware of that contact point and softening at that

31
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,640
place not not holding yourself rigidly against it or somehow holding yourself

32
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,959
up but just letting yourself be

33
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:49,120
supported you can seem detailed

34
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:56,120
to focus in that way but I've been amazed to find small

35
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:01,640
places in my mind where there was resistance

36
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:08,360
or holding or pushing just in the Physical

37
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:17,120
Realm softening the eyes in the eye

38
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,720
sockets releasing any tension in the jaw

39
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:36,160
throat letting the shoulder blades slide down

40
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,919
the back so the shoulders

41
00:04:44,759 --> 00:04:49,360
drop the drop without rounding

42
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:01,639
forward softening down through the belly area

43
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:05,840
a place where we tend to hold

44
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,919
tension and then tuning into the arms and

45
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,638
legs and letting them be EAS

46
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,800
ful

47
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,319
balanced for today we'll be inviting an opening

48
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,919
to many different aspects of

49
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:15,120
experience so opening the mind to the

50
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:23,840
sound sound in the room sound of my voice just the world of sound including

51
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:30,520
that the outside sounds are coming in from that space that you oriented to

52
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,079
first space in the [Music]

53
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:51,639
womb and each thing that we include is something that just we allow

54
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:58,520
to come into the foreground and everything else to be more in the background so it's not that

55
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,080
we're adding on more and more and more and you have to pay attention to so many

56
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,479
different things just let each

57
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:17,280
thing come forward and have its moment so we're with the sounds

58
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:35,319
generally now opening to the s stions of the breath letting those come into the

59
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:41,720
foreground we're not eliminating sound but it just Fades a bit so that we can

60
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,280
sense the sensations of the

61
00:07:53,720 --> 00:08:00,479
breath the breath is a series of simple Sensations

62
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,000
of touch of heat and

63
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:13,319
coolness there are internal Sensations as the lungs fill and

64
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,879
empty and then also Sensations on the surface usually the clothing shifting

65
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,479
against the

66
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:31,440
skin there can be an energetic sense throughout the body

67
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:42,919
so opening to the Kaleidoscope of Sensations that is the

68
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
breath

69
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:34,600
e and it can be quite natural to just open

70
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,399
to all Body Sensations the breath is some of the

71
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,959
Body Sensations there may be others so we less focus on the breath

72
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,240
itself and more on the totality of Body

73
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,320
Sensations wherever they are some are Pleasant some are

74
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,279
unpleasant we're just noticing how it is to be in our body at this

75
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
moment

76
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

77
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:14,040
[Music] the awareness to include also the

78
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,399
emotions feelings

79
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:25,079
present we let the body be more in the background but many emotions have a

80
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:31,240
bodily component but also a mental one

81
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,240
so we open what is there is there some feeling

82
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:44,600
of Joy or sadness

83
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,040
grief

84
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:58,240
ease appreciation

85
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
impatience

86
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:12,690
we just open gently to that [Music]

87
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:35,120
Realm as the mind gets broader we can begin

88
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,360
to imagine it like a giant Canvas OR

89
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:47,120
sky and these things that we're adding in are just more things that are

90
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,519
included in that space of

91
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:05,880
mind so including now the realm of

92
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:16,160
thoughts not thinking the thoughts and falling into them by noticing them as

93
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,560
movements in the

94
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:28,839
mind so the mind is getting very large and Broad it includes the sounds the

95
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:38,040
breath body emotions various thoughts coming and

96
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,399
going it helps very much to relax in order to

97
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:07,600
allow so much into

98
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:18,160
awareness I'm including even the more subtle movements of mind like

99
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,199
intentions background

100
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,519
attitudes and let all these things come to

101
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,760
you you don't need to go chasing them all [Music]

102
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:57,160
down and opening our heart to all of this all of the real of Human

103
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Experience

104
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,060
providing the possibility of being with whatever

105
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:19,160
[Music] arises and letting whatever wants to pass away pass

106
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
away

107
00:15:52,360 --> 00:16:00,920
I'm seeing if there's a possibility of finding a form of peace

108
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:10,600
that is possible in this broad room the way the sky is at peace no

109
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,399
matter what weather is passing

110
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:26,580
through and sometimes there isn't much weather it's all just quite [Music]

111
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
C

112
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:44,000
at any time if it feels right you can focus in on something that the Mind

113
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:50,560
wants to gather around as long as there's still awareness

114
00:16:52,920 --> 00:17:00,480
there we don't force the mind to be in particular way at the intention is to try

115
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,480
experiencing this skylike

116
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,319
mind that can hold anything with

117
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
peace

118
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

119
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

120
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

121
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

122
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

123
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

124
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

125
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

126
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

127
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

128
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

129
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

130
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

131
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

132
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

133
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

134
00:25:53,279 --> 00:26:00,039
and now gently bringing the body

135
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:05,939
a little bit more fully into the [Music]

136
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:16,720
foreground connecting or reconnecting with the sense of physical

137
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:27,240
presence the posture that the body is [Music] in the breath coming in going

138
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
out

139
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:37,670
sense of contact or pressure where you're sitting or lying

140
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,759
[Music]

141
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:51,880
down the awareness of the body as a an aspect of

142
00:26:54,399 --> 00:27:00,240
mind we are embodied

143
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:07,320
that's what allows the hearing of sound opening to

144
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:12,158
sounds around you as well as my

145
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:27,159
voice considering the unification of Mind and Body In This

146
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
Moment

147
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:47,919
would it be possible to walk through the

148
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:54,679
world in this way being

149
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:01,200
open to any experience coming [Music]

150
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,080
in grounded in a physical

151
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:15,399
presence aware of emotions and thoughts as such able to engage with them when

152
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:18,960
needed but not

153
00:28:23,399 --> 00:28:29,120
entangled it's a peaceful way of being

154
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,399
having this broad kind of mind that's also

155
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:43,320
flexible able to turn toward anything in the foreground or relax back like being the

156
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,720
sky and this is a way of being that can emerge through

157
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,398
meditation and it's a great gift to the

158
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:02,279
world sometimes the Buddha was called the

159
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:04,799
peaceful

160
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Sage that's also sometimes applied to a person very deep on the path the sage at

161
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:26,120
peace may not be something that we literally embody very often but when we

162
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:33,760
touch into it and even in a small way through meditation we get a sense of the

163
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:41,399
possibility that we carry as humans everyone dies and that we can foster that through

164
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:49,360
our practice and it will be helpful in our relationships in our job

165
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:56,600
in our family and in our understanding and way of being in the

166
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,039
world

167
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,240
the great blessing of

168
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,960
peace

169
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,679
so this week we are considering four foundations on which

170
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:58,880
our practice can be based that are both simple and deep

171
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,279
things that we can do right away from any stage of the path and that will

172
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:09,559
carry us far on the path if we let them keep unfolding and

173
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:17,320
blossoming and today we are on the fourth of these which is to train for

174
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:23,440
peace and the word for peace here is Santi or Shanti in Sanskrit some of you

175
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,519
may have heard that word and this is the kind of peace that is associ assciated

176
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:36,039
with letting go and with Liberation so there's a lot of levels of

177
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:41,799
that of course and for today let's let's not

178
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:48,799
take this one incrementally at the beginning let's start right off with the kind of deep peace that can even

179
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:55,720
surprise us that really opens us which can occur

180
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:02,880
at times at any point along the path so we might call it utter

181
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:07,720
peace does this resonate in any way for

182
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,080
you it could happen in meditation can also happen in physical

183
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:21,399
or mental exertion can happen through a poem a painting a piece of music a walk in

184
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:29,320
nature there's suddenly a clear feeling of Peace inside and outside

185
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:35,480
and the sense of self drops away and one experiences no separation from the world

186
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:43,559
and all of its wonder and strangeness and there may even be a

187
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:51,840
sense of awe or reverence that such a peace could be possible for

188
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:59,000
humans and it gives us a new reference point in our practice of remembering wisdom of

189
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,960
opening to truth and learning to let go the other three things that we've talked about this

190
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,919
week A friend of mine who practices in the Tibetan tradition was drawn to go

191
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,960
visit the Quan Yin statue at the Nelson Atkins Museum in Kansas

192
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,480
City it's an amazing piece I've only seen pictures of it um but it's

193
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:30,559
strikingly beautiful and apparently quite large Onan is the bisa of compassion in

194
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:37,799
the Mahayana tradition and this friend of mine actually went and stood before this

195
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:46,159
amazing sculpture and he said his mind was just was stopped by its evocative power and

196
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,519
in fact he was moved to tears in that moment but surrounding all of that

197
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:56,720
emotional response was a deep sense of utter

198
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,880
peace so if you've experienced something like

199
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,919
this it's a landmark for you it doesn't mean that you're awakened necessarily

200
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:16,158
and certainly not that you're special compared to other people but it's worth letting such an

201
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:23,200
experience kind of seep into your heart and work in your heart over the

202
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,638
years so I wanted to point to that right away so that we have a

203
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:36,118
context sometimes these things can happen to us but with no context we can't integrate

204
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:41,200
them so now let's dial back to the more

205
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:47,440
ordinary experiences of peace that we tend to have we could have even every

206
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,960
day so every time we let go of greed or aversion or delusion there's an opening

207
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,240
to some kind of Peace in the wake of letting go and this release we can learn to

208
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,119
recognize that that release itself is what includes the Peace So as an example

209
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:13,760
Gil tells a story of becoming realizing that he was getting um kind of agitated

210
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:22,160
around getting his kids off to school in the morning that was his task for a while in the household and you know he

211
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:27,359
there was always kind of a rush he couldn't get them to get their jackets and shoes on and get to the car without

212
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:34,000
getting distracted along the way um and he realized that

213
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,440
um you know he his children weren't responsible for that he was the one feeling agitated and he thought what is

214
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,720
going on that I keep getting agitated doing this and eventually he realized

215
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,920
that what he was doing in the mornings was lingering over the paper he wanted

216
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:58,119
to read the paper he got interested in it and he wanted to read it more fully than there was really time for in in the

217
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:04,040
task of have dealing with the kids also so once he saw that what was really

218
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:09,839
underpinning his agitation was or wanting to be with the paper at that

219
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:18,800
moment he decided consciously to let go of that you know I'll read that later and um with that he felt more at

220
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:26,800
ease and it was the wanting that was the issue it wasn't that the kids weren't doing it right or something so often

221
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,960
it's like this we can identify somewhere underneath our agitation what is it that

222
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:39,079
I'm wanting and holding on to or not wanting and pushing away or what is it that I'm not seeing clearly and the

223
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:47,880
release of that will suddenly make the situation much easier I sometimes use the phrase if I'm

224
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:54,040
struggling what would I have to let go of at this moment to be more

225
00:36:54,040 --> 00:37:00,880
easeful what would I have to let go of to make this easier and often it's something simple

226
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,960
something that I hadn't seen or sometimes it takes longer to unfold what's really going on there but

227
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:14,760
it's a nice practice question so we can ask them you know how

228
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:22,040
do we get there with this uh instruction to train for peace the forth of the foundations to

229
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:28,839
train for peace what is that training so largely the training is to

230
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:36,560
use the qualities of the goal as the path that is kind of a skillful

231
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:43,640
imitation if you will essentially it says if you want peace be

232
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:49,359
peaceful similarly more specific things if you want to be a more generous person

233
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:54,920
then start being generous so what would I have to let go

234
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:00,000
of to make this easier what sort of how can I bring

235
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,119
peace to this very moment so we can you know for the

236
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:12,720
specifics we can look to one of the sutas somebody once asked the Buddha about what a peaceful person is like and

237
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,440
it's worth hearing his response it's kind of long um but I hope you'll allow

238
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:24,319
me to read the whole thing or at least most of it I I slightly

239
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:30,920
excerpted so the person's question is how does one see how does one

240
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:36,880
behave the one who is said to be peaceful they ask the Buddha that's a

241
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,599
nice question how does one see how does one behave the one who is said to be

242
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:49,359
peaceful so the Buddha says devoid of craving before death not

243
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:56,440
dependent on the past not to be reckoned by the middle for him there are no

244
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,480
preferences she is Without Anger unafraid not

245
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:07,200
boastful not regretful speaking with reflection not

246
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,640
Restless one is truly a contemplative controlled in

247
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:19,000
speech one is without attachment to the Future one does not sorrow over the

248
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,599
past one sees seclusion in the midst of sense contacts and is not LED astray

249
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:32,280
among views withdrawn not scheming without longing

250
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:38,839
not miserly courteous not morally repulsive not

251
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:43,880
intent on slander not swept up by enjoyment and

252
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:49,079
not swollen with arrogance gentle gifted with

253
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:54,480
Ingenuity not credulous not growing

254
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,359
dispassionate he does not train from a desire for gain nor is he irritated over

255
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:08,680
a lack of gain not hostile because of craving does not hanker after tasty

256
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:14,599
food equanimous ever mindful in the world she does not

257
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:21,420
conceive herself to be equal Superior or inferior for her there are no

258
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:27,640
[Music] swellings they have no dependencies having known the dham they

259
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:35,720
are independent no craving is found in them for existence or

260
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:41,280
non-existence I call them peaceful who is indifferent to sense Pleasures in

261
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:47,319
them no knots are found they have crossed over

262
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:53,480
attachment in her there is nothing to be found as either taken up or

263
00:40:53,480 --> 00:41:00,200
rejected one who takes nothing in the world as one's own and who does not sorrow over what is

264
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:09,039
absent and is uninvolved in doctrines that one is truly said to be

265
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:15,359
peaceful so just let those words settle in your mind it's too many to remember

266
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:21,079
them all so see what is still echoing for you maybe just one word or phrase

267
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:23,520
felt it

268
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,480
meaningful one overall comment is that many of the

269
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:39,000
items named are things that the peaceful person is not right there was a lot of not in

270
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,480
there not this not that mostly were becoming free of various

271
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:54,560
things the suta where the Buddha names the four foundations that we've been talking about this week he says that the

272
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:01,000
Supreme peace is the Pacific ation of greed hatred and delusion we are

273
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,760
pacifying the forces in our mind and heart that contribute to suffering that's what peace is this path is the

274
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:15,839
ultimate peace movement pacifying greed hatred and

275
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:24,160
delusion despite all these words there isn't actually much to say about

276
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:31,079
peace as noted it's mostly an absence It's always important to notice absences

277
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:36,880
notice the releases notice the endings notice the letting go that we talked

278
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,200
about yesterday do we notice that often we rush on to the next thing that's

279
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,680
present the next thing that's arising the next thing on our to-do list that's just

280
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,559
habitual so linger with the Letting Go linger with the space that's there when

281
00:42:53,559 --> 00:43:00,920
something ends linger with the feeling of release which is the

282
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:07,200
Peace So peace is available now in some measure in some

283
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:13,520
way and notice that and make it your training to encourage peace wherever it

284
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:21,599
appears this is how we train for Peace So the growth of Peace in one's

285
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:28,400
life I would say depends on valuing it on really wanting to protect it wanting

286
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:35,319
to preserve it wanting to feel into it that's a kind of wanting that's

287
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:41,280
skillful so it's interesting to check in our mind

288
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:49,040
you know what are the forces that don't value peace and why am I investing in

289
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:57,800
those mostly out of habit and is there a part that really does value peace and is willing to to

290
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:05,000
enact that and embody that and that's the training that's how

291
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,119
we train for peace we become peaceful by being

292
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:16,440
peaceful whenever we can

293
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:23,640
so not neglecting wisdom preserving truth cultivating

294
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:29,119
relinquishment and training for peace the four

295
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:35,720
foundations that we can start right now at any level and if we keep unfolding

296
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:40,760
them they will go very far maybe all the way to

297
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:49,280
Liberation tomorrow we'll step back and we'll at the bigger picture around these

298
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,480
and I'll tell you the story that goes in the Su up with these also so have a

299
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,040
peaceful day take care
