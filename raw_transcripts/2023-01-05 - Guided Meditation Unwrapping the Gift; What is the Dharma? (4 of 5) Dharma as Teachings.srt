1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:10,620
so hello everyone welcome and uh

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,839
hope that those of you who are local and not local are

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,939
safe in the weather here in Redwood City

4
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:29,820
we didn't have much much rain or storm or wind in the last 24 hours as expected but we

5
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,399
did lose electricity big parts of the town and um

6
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,980
at home where I did no electricity and then just a couple blocks away from IMC

7
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:47,420
it's still no none but here we're we're good for now

8
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:50,360
so

9
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:09,479
it probably can um never been to be over said oversaid

10
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,860
overspoken that the emphasis on this meditation of mindfulness

11
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:23,340
and meditation of the Buddha puts a great value

12
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:30,180
on what we can see no experience

13
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,000
Here and Now in this own field

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,020
of direct perception I was going to say here in our own body

15
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:50,280
but um but it's the whole way in which through the senses of the body we

16
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:58,860
experience directly whatever it is might be and so learning to come into the

17
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,060
fullness of our direct perception direct experience unmediated

18
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:12,060
by theories and doctrines and speculations and

19
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:17,220
views about the nature of life or even the nature of self

20
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,620
it's a radical phenomenal pointing the Buddha does to the

21
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:29,819
Simplicity of here and the metaphor I'd like to use for this and for this meditation

22
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:35,099
is that of opening a present there's a gift

23
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:40,519
someone who cares a lot about you loves you and wants the best of you has

24
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:45,780
given you a gift and that gift is wrapped it's in a

25
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,959
wrapped in maybe beautiful wrap wrapping and

26
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:57,180
maybe maybe in wrapping paper the person has made themselves

27
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:02,819
I've gone through all the trouble of of uh paper making

28
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:08,340
so it's beautiful and then within that there's a box

29
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:15,780
and so you take off the paper and because it's your friend's beautiful paper you don't want to just tear it up

30
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:22,920
you can take it unwrap it very carefully and as you open it you smooth it smooth

31
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:29,940
it out so it's flat and as little creased as possible so the beauty of this handmade piece of paper kind of

32
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:37,980
stands out and it's a beautiful box maybe the box is made from some also

33
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,080
maybe your friend has made and it's made from local

34
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,540
wood that the person has been able to maybe create that fell and person build

35
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:54,060
the wood and cut the wood put it together into a beautiful box

36
00:03:54,060 --> 00:04:00,239
and so again you want to be careful and loving and appreciative of the box as much as what's going to be inside the

37
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,420
Box the paper and the Box itself is part of the gift

38
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:12,780
and then now you do open the box to see what's inside and there's a something again that this person has made maybe

39
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:20,780
it's a beautiful Exquisite clay Bowl that clearly is very thin very fine

40
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:26,160
clearly very fragile could easily shatter if it dropped just a little bit

41
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,919
and um but is exquisitely made and and you can see the care and the love that

42
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,020
went into it and so you don't just pick it up with one hand and kind of like you know flip

43
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:43,500
it around if you want to because it's so special and delicate than a gift you pick it up carefully lovingly and hold

44
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,540
it maybe in both hands and kind of hold it gently

45
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:54,060
so the same way we enter into our own direct experience

46
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:00,180
maybe thinking of it as a presence and there are these three layers

47
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:06,120
and the way that we can unwrap it is to relax deeply

48
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:14,160
and first we relax the body and that's the the handcrafted

49
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:19,560
wrapping paper for it all and so we were and relaxing is how we

50
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:27,600
unwind how we unfold it how we open it up and take it off relax deeply in the body

51
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,020
and then we relax the mind the thinking mind and the mind the pressure the

52
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,660
tightness that pre the the contraction the hardness

53
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:46,259
the resistance the fear that's kind of embedded in the thinking mind itself

54
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:51,740
and that's and that's uh you know opening up carefully it's beautiful

55
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:58,380
handmade box our friend has made beautiful it's not quite handmade but

56
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,600
beautiful mind that we have care or love

57
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,620
and then and then finally we get to open it up

58
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:17,520
and pick up what's there and in the in the middle of the of this box there's our heart

59
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,100
and now we hold the heart carefully coming around with mindfulness a soft

60
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:30,300
soft Palms of her of our hand holding our heart our emotional heart or

61
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:36,180
depth of our kind of inner life where it's the deepest place of

62
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:42,620
and we hold it gently lovingly so it also can relax

63
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:48,479
and the present is not the present the present is what's left when we're fully

64
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:54,720
relaxed so in this way coming into our direct

65
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:03,740
experience for this purpose say taking a meditation posture

66
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,080
and gently closing your eyes

67
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,039
and begin to feel into your body

68
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:24,840
feel where it feels tight maybe where it aches

69
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,039
where it feels loose comfortable

70
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:41,360
and if there's easy ways of relaxing your body soften relax

71
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,560
and then to take a few long slow deep breaths

72
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:08,180
and the long exhale in which to relax further

73
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:34,080
relaxing and then letting your breathing return

74
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:41,219
to normal and again taking some time to

75
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:47,640
feel your body as you inhale feel where there's still some holding

76
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:55,920
and on the exhale to soften the body release

77
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,700
the body

78
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,940
and then on the inhale sensing feeling

79
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:53,940
the thinking mind the thinking muscle

80
00:09:53,940 --> 00:10:03,360
wherever in your body there's the energy the impulse to be thinking

81
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,300
whether in images or words or another way

82
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,800
and you feel if there might be any pressure or tension

83
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:21,920
contraction hardness

84
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,420
agitation

85
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,320
a feeling of activation

86
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,660
as you exhale

87
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,300
let the Mind relax soften

88
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,740
release

89
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,519
as you relax the mind

90
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:49,140
do it letting the Mind open up

91
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:57,839
spread out as if you're opening a beautiful box

92
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,800
to see all the spaciousness and openness in the mind

93
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,700
that's just beyond the edges of your thoughts your concerns

94
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:20,279
I think your thoughts buy it

95
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:29,240
almost as if they're melting into the space spaciousness around them

96
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:11,660
and then to now on the inhale feel your heart

97
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,540
or the center of gravity for your deepest emotional

98
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,480
life

99
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,540
and maybe as the you inhale it's like a hand two cup tens

100
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:45,899
they come gently from underneath to hold

101
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:48,740
to support

102
00:13:51,779 --> 00:14:00,079
the inner emotional life that we have whatever it might be

103
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:05,240
the heart center the emotional Center or the

104
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:09,980
very well maybe even the very center of

105
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,440
or lived life

106
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:38,040
and see if you can relax the emotional Center and relax the

107
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:44,240
emotions let them relax so that they are

108
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,139
settle more deeply into the palms of awareness

109
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:09,540
as if the palms of awareness offer safety

110
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,380
support

111
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:21,560
so that it's safe to relax the Heart Center soften

112
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,580
and when you relax steep as you can

113
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,519
letting go as deeply as you can

114
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:54,120
with no concerns and preoccupations take you away from here and now

115
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,260
just here

116
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:07,620
what is left for you in the Simplicity of breathing in and

117
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,280
breathing out

118
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:19,140
below all the wrapping paper all the tension

119
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:25,039
what is the gift of freedom

120
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:30,200
unbounded freedom

121
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,460
experienced with every inhale and every exhale

122
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:11,600
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

123
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:19,080
to relax now let go

124
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:25,919
now that we're coming to the end there's something about the effort or

125
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:32,240
the bracing yourself or undoing the practice

126
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,500
and you can let go of

127
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:47,100
and let go more deeply into yourself taking off all the wrapping paper

128
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,278
and settle to the deepest place of rest

129
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,000
so subtleness Within

130
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:08,760
from whatever degree of rest within that you can have

131
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:16,080
from that rest gaze outward into the world

132
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:23,159
thinking about the people in your life the people in your communities neighborhoods

133
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:29,220
on the streets in the in the news

134
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:35,840
wherever there are people that you're aware of in your life

135
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,480
The Gaze upon them from their settled place

136
00:28:44,039 --> 00:28:48,559
and perhaps Let There Be kindness

137
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,779
her friendliness

138
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:03,659
good will a simple good will it

139
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:08,940
is not demanding or a high standard that you have to live up

140
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:14,120
to just resting in Good Will

141
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:28,380
in that letting that good be a well wishing for others

142
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:35,600
what a wonderful thing it would be if more people could be happy and safe

143
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:45,980
and peaceful and free may all beings be happy

144
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:54,440
may all beings be safe

145
00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:00,559
male beings be peaceful

146
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:06,080
may all beings be free

147
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:23,399
[Music]

148
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,200
thank you

149
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:49,340
um warm greetings for our fourth talk

150
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:56,899
on what is the Dharma and um so one of the meanings of Dharma

151
00:30:56,899 --> 00:31:05,820
is the teachings of the Buddha what he taught and it's interesting then to look at

152
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:11,760
because there's the volumes and volumes of of texts that uh report to be his

153
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,919
recorded teachings I find these many of these quite

154
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:22,919
inspiring and then really delight and swimming in the

155
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:27,960
those those ancient teachings but the um

156
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,840
but what specifically is the Dharma and the analogy I'd like to use maybe a poor

157
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,000
analogy is that say there's a modern teacher that um

158
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,419
that has wonderful Buddhist teachings and the person used often talks about

159
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:53,039
um some as a metaphor assembly for their traffic lights driving down the road and

160
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:58,380
and when this teacher talks about traffic lights mentions that green means

161
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:04,580
go and red means stop so then over the centuries

162
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:13,559
people recognize that this is in the teachings of this teacher and so sure enough maybe at some

163
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:20,220
point society change decides are the better colors for go and stop but that teacher said you know it kept

164
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:26,580
he's referring to you know the colors that we have in the modern world for go and stop

165
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:32,220
and so the people who are into that person's teachings will say wait no no

166
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:38,159
we believe that green means go and red means stop and that's the way it is and

167
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,500
that's our religion and that's our faith and we have to believe that because that's what our teacher said

168
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:50,820
and now that's a misunderstanding of what the teachings were really about that that was just a metaphor an example

169
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,860
just because using something in the modern world is and it wasn't necessarily that the

170
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:01,740
teacher kind of held absolutely this is the truth that has to be this way

171
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:08,700
so in the same way the Buddha taught a lot and and is all of it really what you

172
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:15,600
know he was about really his teachings how much of it was just using and folding in uh teachings of his times and

173
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,299
ideas of his times and concepts of his times and we find people coming to the Buddha

174
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:26,399
to ask questions in a particular Paradigm particular framework

175
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:35,100
and uh and then the Buddha just accommodates that framework but he twists it or transforms it into his own

176
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:42,299
teachings what he wants to teach but he uses that person's framework and um is that framework you know the

177
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:48,000
Dharma or is it a little bit different it's kind of it's a vehicle for the

178
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,640
Dharma but maybe it's not exactly the his core teachings what's really essential to

179
00:33:53,640 --> 00:34:01,500
Carry On from generation to generation so what we can do to find kind of answer

180
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:08,280
this question what is the teachings of the Buddha is to go back and look specifically at the places where it said

181
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:14,220
these are the teachings this is the Dharma and where it's that specific that's

182
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:20,040
exact what's it being said and what we find is a remarkable thing

183
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:27,240
that over and over again predominantly the message is has to do with some

184
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:35,220
direct contact experience with the present moment uh something right here that we can do

185
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:42,240
um and um and very much what's pointing to is not only direct experience but

186
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:50,099
more than important than experience the actions that lead somewhere so we've been

187
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:55,378
talking about Dharma means actions or and then that these actions can have

188
00:34:55,379 --> 00:35:01,619
consequences so we want to kind of choose the actions that have the beneficial consequences

189
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:08,400
so for example the Buddha says in one place a very famous simile the simile of the raft

190
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,820
um that the Buddha says so I have shown to

191
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:20,400
you how the dhamma the Dharma is similar to a raft

192
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:27,900
being for the purpose of crossing over a river not for the purpose of grasping

193
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:33,119
so he says that the simile is that you come the person comes to edge of a river

194
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,339
and there's no way of getting across big big river except by making a small raft

195
00:35:38,339 --> 00:35:43,920
getting getting wood and Reeds and different things and constructing a raft

196
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:51,359
and then paddling the raft across the other side when they get to the other side the

197
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:57,480
purpose of the rest is not the gra of the raft is not then to carry on your back into the forest and down wherever

198
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:03,420
you go next it served its purpose so don't grasp it leave it behind

199
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:10,380
so one of the teachings here is a Dharma something provisional it's something contextual that is useful for a

200
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:16,560
particular purpose and beyond that we don't look for it to understand what color traffic light

201
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,960
should be the um and um and it has to do with not

202
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:27,359
grasping and um so then it goes up we're going to go on

203
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:35,339
to say when you know that dhamma is similar to a raft you should abandon even the teachings

204
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:41,160
how much more the teachings are things that are contrary to the teachings

205
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,099
so there's tremendous importance on not grasping don't even grasp these the

206
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:52,980
Dharma the teachings of the Buddha let alone other teachings don't grasp on you

207
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:59,579
know ideas about traffic lights don't grasp to anything so this idea the centrality of not

208
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:06,780
grasping in this little passage represents what I'm trying to say today that these teachings are so

209
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:12,480
about the immediacy of now the imminence of now how we live now

210
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,579
um something that we can experienced just as well 2500 years ago as we can

211
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:23,359
experience today these are very modern teachings except we don't build rafts but

212
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,880
but the um so much but um them so I'm grasping here

213
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,400
so the dust the Dharma has something to do the heart of it about not not grasping

214
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,980
um and here's a fascinating uh description of the purpose of the Dharma

215
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:47,640
that Dharma is for the elimination of all standpoints

216
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:53,220
all uh obsessions

217
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:59,540
all adherences all underlying tendencies

218
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:05,400
all decisiveness around teachings this is a true teaching

219
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:10,920
for the stealing of all reactivity for the relinquishment of all

220
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:19,380
attachments for the ending of all craving for a cessation for Nirvana

221
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:25,740
so uh this so whatever the Dharma is it's for this purpose and this purpose it's

222
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:32,520
kind of a lofty purpose it's not exactly you know something you experience in the moment but it is something that's part

223
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:39,119
of the moment part of our direct experience there's nothing here about future lives nothing here but you know

224
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:46,140
fantastic ultimate communion with a cosmos or some deeper

225
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:51,780
insight into the true nature of reality uh it's mostly about releasing and

226
00:38:51,780 --> 00:39:00,599
freeing and in particular around teachings earlier said don't even grasp the teachings the Buddha says here all kinds

227
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:05,880
of opinions viewpoints standpoints uh that we hold on to and

228
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,099
this is how it should be he teaches so we don't do that

229
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:16,320
somewhere else he teaches very eloquently

230
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:26,220
um that what he's teaching is not a view is not an a philosophy is not a Doctrine

231
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:33,900
uh what he's teaching is the uh is the letting go of all that

232
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:39,540
and something deeper something more valuable and it's a distilling of all

233
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:45,599
reactivity so the relaxation we did in the last meditation could be called rather than

234
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:53,820
relaxation could be called distilling of all reactivity bodily mentally and emotionally

235
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:59,040
that when we relaxed it's always relaxing our reactivity that somehow is

236
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:04,500
built up within us a monk once came to the Buddha and said

237
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:10,040
can you are you teach me the Dharma in brief so I can remember it and go into

238
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:15,960
the forest and have practice on my own and so um this is you know that's kind

239
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:22,020
of an important you know he's going to give you you know now that Buddha is going to give the pithy a

240
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:29,160
short version of this is what the Dharma is and in this case he said

241
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:35,160
um uh you should let go of Desire

242
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:40,800
to anything which is impermanent anything which is inconstant

243
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:47,520
let go of clinging to it that's all he says that's the heart that's what one of the

244
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,760
very simple key ways he wants to say it we can protest we can have our doubts

245
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:00,240
about it what about wait a minute but some here is pointing to something very deep and the important thing I want

246
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,640
to say here is that it's uh it's an action the action of

247
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:11,160
letting go um it's a letting go for uh for a

248
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:18,359
particular Consequence the consequence of becoming free and this is kind of the domain the area

249
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:25,619
what Dharma is about and earlier I talked about not grasping here at talk about not having desire for

250
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:31,500
anything impermanence anything's gonna if you hold on to anything which is going to change you'll suffer

251
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:37,020
what's the alternative way to be with it and um

252
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:43,859
and we find a good number of times the suit that someone comes to the Buddha and says teach me the Dharma in brief

253
00:41:43,859 --> 00:41:50,579
and repeatedly it's about it's something very immediate something a very

254
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:57,020
practical almost modern terms and be psychological that doesn't have any recourse to

255
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:03,420
metaphysics to Supernatural to anything beyond what's possible to experience in

256
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:10,079
our direct experience um so the last thing I want to read when he

257
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:16,740
says when you know the Dharma for yourself that's the point he's talking about something you can know for yourself not a teaching that you have to

258
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:22,500
take on faith but a teaching that you can experience and you know this is why we're

259
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:30,000
practicing this mindfulness to really be able to have some deep experience of this for ourselves and here is a another

260
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,839
pithy way where he says how you know that what the Dharma is for yourself

261
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:40,980
when you know there is greed hatred and delusion

262
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:46,260
within you and when you know there is no greed

263
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:52,680
hatred and delusion within you then you know the Dharma is visible Here

264
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:59,400
and Now immediate inviting to be seen for oneself onward leading and to be

265
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:05,300
personally realized by the wise so here you again

266
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:10,560
maybe it diminishes in some people's minds to call this psychological

267
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:16,640
but I use that as an alternative to Supernatural or metaphysical or or

268
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:23,040
something kind of beyond the kind of what our everyday experience is like

269
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,740
that that to know green head and delusion of

270
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:34,560
all its different forms and to know that it's its absence

271
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,599
then you know the Dharma the Dharma is about seeing that what's happening uh

272
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:45,599
knowing suffering knowing the causes of suffering and knowing the end of it

273
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:52,200
and that end of great hate and delusion or it can be temporary but the Buddha says here even if it's

274
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:59,339
temporary you have a qualitative experience of really free of great hate and delusion maybe

275
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:06,180
accidentally on a very good day he had good sleep appreciate that there's something about that that you're experiencing you're

276
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:12,960
knowing the Dharma directly oh this is what it's about this is a Dharma this is

277
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,720
possible this is what I have a relationship to

278
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:25,440
this is what the actions can be about how I live my lives in accord with or supportive for this movement towards

279
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:35,220
this kind of freedom and um so the Dharma as a teaching

280
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:41,819
is what supports or points to or highlights what I've been teaching the

281
00:44:41,819 --> 00:44:46,920
first three days of this week about what the Dharma is it's the relatedness that

282
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:53,040
we can live in it's the actions that have an effect on that relatedness

283
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:58,680
and it's uh the actions that transform

284
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:05,720
that relatedness to one of freedom of Goodwill of care of compassion

285
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:12,740
this is this is the Dharma and um so

286
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:18,440
so if you'd like to do some homework there on this

287
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:25,680
do this relaxation thing relax open up the present

288
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:33,480
see what's here and see if you can have some taste some experience of non-grasping of

289
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:41,280
non-clinging of non-reactivity that gives you a feel for oh the Dharma

290
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:48,000
this is valuable maybe you have a small experience but then if you extrapolate if this

291
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,960
became complete became full oh this is good Dharma

292
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:01,619
so thank you and um look forward to the last talk on this

293
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:03,980
topic
