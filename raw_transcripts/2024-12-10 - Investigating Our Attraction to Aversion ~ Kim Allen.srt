1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:11,679
so welcome those of you who don't know me my name is Kim Allen and I've practiced

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:18,560
and taught here for a while and I'm happy to step in for Di this

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:27,960
evening I want to start with a story that I heard um about that was that was

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,480
told by another insight teacher named guy Armstrong and I heard it from someone else so I might not have the

5
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:43,520
details exactly correct but you can just take it as a teaching story and the story is that um guy was

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,760
practicing in Asia and was ordained as a monk while he was there at one of the

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,320
monasteries and he was asked by the Abbot of the monastery he'd been there

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,840
for a while and you know kind of was getting to know how things were going

9
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,920
and so you know that that's when Abbott start you know giving you little tests

10
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:14,560
and little things to do as a monk so he asked him guy to give some instruction

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,880
to the other monks and um so he was having this

12
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:28,479
gathering with them and he was teaching some some new monks and he said to them so what would

13
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,520
you do if you had a lot of anger come up in your

14
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,680
mind uh and the monk said I would note it this is a kind of practice where one

15
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:49,119
basically names what's going on and experience noting practice we we teach it here also and you know you just sort

16
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:56,240
of note in real time what's going on in the mind oh there's anger oh there's a body sensation there's the breath you

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,520
know it keeps the mind on track so they said very duti and correctly I would

18
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,479
note it and he said well that's great and what if that wasn't enough and the

19
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:13,040
anger kept coming back and they said I would note it

20
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,400
again and he said okay and what if you're sitting there and it just keeps

21
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:26,239
coming back then what would you do and they said

22
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:33,360
uh so there was sort of a dir of op ions in their mind now noting practice is

23
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,000
very good and also you know basic mindfulness practice that we teach where you know you be with the breath except

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,879
if something comes and distracts the mind in which case you acknowledge what it is and then come back to the breath

25
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:55,680
you know these are all very good instructions and will actually take you very far if you follow them for a long

26
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,440
time but uh there are other options actually and in fact it's a fairly

27
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:10,360
common question that we get as teachers where people will raise their hand and say when should I just be with an

28
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,159
experience just be with it notice it note it and then go back to the breath

29
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:23,040
and when do I get to actually do something about it and it's usually uh people who want to do something who ask

30
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,599
a question like that and so um it's fair enough you know we don't want to be like

31
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:35,400
the monks that didn't know any option except noting what was happening in their experience

32
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:43,080
it's very good it'll take you a long way and you don't want to spend a lot of time doing other things but um sometimes

33
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:50,799
that those mind States just aren't changing right they're very distracting and they're coming back and coming

34
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:58,599
back so sometimes we do take action and the Buddha taught um a number of methods

35
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:03,840
that we might apply in cases like that but here's the catch

36
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,680
is that we take specific kinds of actions um in order to help deal with a

37
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:17,000
mind that's doing its Antics let's say everyone's mind it's very normal to have

38
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,280
things come up again and come up again and come up again sometimes just repeatedly in a Sit you know like my

39
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:31,320
mind's just really restless right now and so a lot of stuff keeps coming or other times you know notice over over

40
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,639
weeks or months that you have a similar pattern that keeps coming keeps coming

41
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:44,080
sit by sit by sit and you start thinking huh I'm getting a lot of that one recently so either way we have some kind

42
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:51,600
of a recurring pattern and it's nice to have a sort of a toolbox of approaches to be able to

43
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,120
work with different things coming up in the mind partly because that's just normal like like the way we would have a

44
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:05,560
number of different ways of inter acting with people right because there's a lot of different kinds of people so that's

45
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,000
useful not to just have one way so in the same way we can have this toolbox

46
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,080
but it can actually be a little bit more appointed than that also um from one of the discourses of the Buddha he said um

47
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:24,560
whatever a person frequently thinks and Ponders upon that will become the

48
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,840
inclination of their mind whatever a person frequently thinks

49
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,000
Ponders upon that will become the inclination of their mind it's true

50
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,280
isn't it so what we practice sticks over time if we are frequently thinking a lot

51
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,400
of irritated thoughts we become more inclined toward

52
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,600
being irritated if we frequently think judgmental thoughts about ourselves for

53
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,400
example or about the world then that becomes the usual

54
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,759
climate that we're living in that's the weather we get every day if we practice it enough and it works the other way too

55
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,840
if we frequently think thoughts of gratitude and care for other

56
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:19,240
people then that will become the inclination of our mind what kind of mind do you want to

57
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,639
live in so it's important not to just

58
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,720
dwell in unskillful thought repeatedly

59
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:37,160
if we can be mindful of them first of all it's good to know that if we can be mindful of them if we can really note

60
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,759
them like those monks were saying then it is actually okay if you are mindful

61
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:48,319
of irritation in the mind you're not you're not driving the trench deeper and

62
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:55,639
deeper you know the the inclination deeper and deeper if you can truly be mindful of it but often we're mindful of

63
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:01,240
it a little bit and then we get drawn right back in and we're like yeah that's right I am are irritated about that oh

64
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,639
right I'm supposed to be mindful and all the times when we're not mindful we are strengthening the

65
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,879
irritation so um it is important that we have that mindfulness and if we're able

66
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:20,759
to just stand back and be mindful that's a perfectly good practice um so we don't need to jump at every you know be

67
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:27,520
concerned about every flicker of aversion or desire or restlessness in the mind if we're noticing that that's

68
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:34,720
what's happening you're good don't worry um but nonetheless um it is nice to

69
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:41,199
consider some of these other actions we can take if we keep getting caught again and again and there's quite a few of

70
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:47,400
them named in the suas so I thought instead of trying to do like a General survey it would be interesting this

71
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,840
evening and maybe more meaningful to take a little bit deeper dive um and

72
00:07:52,840 --> 00:08:01,159
just focus in a little bit so what we're going to do is we're going to talk about one technique that's very useful and

73
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:08,080
then within that one technique we'll look at a particularly common instance of how to use it one that I suspect we

74
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:16,319
can all connect with so the the technique I want to share a little bit about is investigating the conditions

75
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,919
that are behind a pattern or a tendency that we've noticed so this is an

76
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:30,919
alternative to just noting it noting it noting it why don't we investigate what's going on with that repeated

77
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:39,159
pattern so um first of all uh as I named in the kind of the general uh title of

78
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:44,720
this investigating the conditions behind an UNH wholesome pattern or tendency so

79
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,320
we have to be able to recognize that what's going on in the mind is wholesome or UNH

80
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,519
wholesome and that's kind of the top level wisdom that we have to be able to

81
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:02,160
apply so what what do I mean by UNH wholesome so that means something that

82
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:07,959
is springing from The Roots what are called The Roots the three roots of

83
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:14,200
greed hatred or delusion those are just kind of the names given to the the

84
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,000
places the places in our heart that these unskillful or UNH wholesome or you

85
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,160
know negative kind of mind patterns come in from and each of those is meant to be

86
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:31,040
kind of an umbrella term that talk that can can covers a lot of territory so you

87
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,360
know kind of the umbrella term of uh the middle one AV verion greed hatred

88
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:45,079
delusion hatred let's say or aversion uh covers any kind of a negative response to something from mild

89
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:52,760
irritation to resistance to anger to unkind judgment

90
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,959
all the way up to like rage and hatred so it's not it's not just one thing it

91
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:04,200
has a lot of different shades so um I named I kind of Drew out that

92
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,399
middle one because that's the one we're going to look at a little bit more carefully but you can imagine then maybe

93
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:16,279
what the Spectrum around greed would be you know attraction compulsion grasping

94
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:21,920
desire these kinds of things and delusion you know confusion

95
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:28,640
uncertainty um ignorance those kinds of things so then the other thing that I

96
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:35,600
named about this technique is that it's about investigating these UNH wholesome States what do I mean by

97
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,399
investigating so this is a word you know it's one of those dangers we have in Buddhism is that sometimes we use a very

98
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,839
common English word to mean something kind of specific and and yeah more

99
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,959
specific within the Dharma practice so I say investigating but usually we think of

100
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:59,760
investigating as kind of a a lot of thought and maybe a pointed probe at

101
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,079
something where we investigate all the way back into the past you know like why

102
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:11,000
did this pattern begin where back in my distant history did it get inculcated in

103
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,079
me that I should think in this way oh I remember it was that person who told me

104
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:22,279
so many years ago Etc um that's there's a place for that kind of Investigation

105
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:30,160
often that's what's done uh in Psychotherapy for example is to kind of tell a story about how we got to this

106
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,600
State um and that can be valuable but I want to name that um the

107
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,079
kind of Investigation that's meant uh as a kind of a Dharma investigation that we

108
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,760
would do maybe during meditation with a repeated pattern doesn't really involve

109
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,959
tracing the story back into the past it's like a present moment

110
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:59,880
investigation where we understand that if something is here right now things don't appear randomly in in the mind or

111
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:06,160
at least they may come in for reasons we don't know but they don't hang around randomly in the mind there must be

112
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:13,360
conditions that are supporting them in this very moment kind of like the way if there are clouds in the sky there have

113
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:21,440
to be the conditions present right now for clouds right otherwise there wouldn't be them there so if we have a

114
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,560
lot of irritation coming up again and again uh there must be conditions in

115
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:33,519
this moment that are supporting that so we would want to look at those and maybe if we understood those supporting

116
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,800
conditions maybe we could work with those instead of hammering at the irritation again and again which doesn't

117
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:46,399
seem to be going away what if we took away the conditions this is a little trick in meditation and in Dharma

118
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,560
practice in general is you don't always have to work directly with thing what if

119
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:57,040
you could just remove one of the like like taking the leg out of under a table

120
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:04,120
it will collapse right so instead of working so much with that we could pull out one of the things that's supporting

121
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:09,560
it so it's actually less important to know

122
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:15,600
in light of that it's less important to know the whole storyline about how we came to be a person with a lot of

123
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:23,480
judgment in our mind than it is to know that this particular instant of judgment is being supported by several conditions

124
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,760
in the present moment um so aversion is definitely

125
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:35,839
worth investigating in our experience that's the one we're going to focus on let's focus on that middle one aversion

126
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,959
having aversion or irritation or hatred or resistance in the mind doesn't make

127
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:49,199
you a terrible person just let's just say that right up front it doesn't say anything about you as a person um these

128
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:55,880
mind States just kind of come with being a human being you're born a human you have the three unskillful roots in the

129
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:03,839
heart and we can work with them the great thing is we have a practice and we can deal with them and we're in a good

130
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,839
position then to to be looking at our irritation of various

131
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,519
kinds so um the Buddha also said that Dua which

132
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:23,120
is any kind of suffering and definitely we know that aversion is some form of suffering Dua is to be understood so if

133
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,279
something is bringing us duka like our our anger or our judgment then it's worth looking at that

134
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:37,680
it's worthwhile so I want to focus in on this aversion

135
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,639
thing on even a little bit more this is a deep dive tonight I said right let's

136
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:51,320
look at the specific case of being attracted to aversion and you might say

137
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:58,199
what these are the Terrible Things of the heart that are the UN un wholesome Roots I want them eradicated from my

138
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:04,279
heart and yeah we can get on board with non-harming and kindness and care but

139
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:09,440
actually um I'm going to suggest that there are

140
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:17,880
ways in which we are attracted to aversion we kind of like our aversion and what's going on there

141
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:23,680
what's going on there it's not often talked about really explicitly but I

142
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,440
certainly see it in myself there's ways in which I'm subtly supporting the a in

143
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:36,160
my mind sometimes um and it's also not entirely our fault so again if you're

144
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,680
starting to think uhoh I'm a bad person I do secretly like my aversion consider that it is actually

145
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:49,680
supported in our society there are ways in which um it's completely socially

146
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:56,600
acceptable to have all kinds of judgment hatred look at social media you get so

147
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:03,000
many more hits if you write about some thing that you hate and how awful something is and or you point out how

148
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,480
stupid something is that you saw and everyone's like yeah that's right you know they give you a whole bunch of

149
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:15,880
likes for that or they you know in our in our public discourse a little bit more seriously you know there's a lot of

150
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:23,120
polarization right now and it's really it's supported you know it's considered okay and even acceptable and even you

151
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:30,079
know you get you're you're sort of a more robust person if you have something that you're out there charging against

152
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:37,600
and hating great not great actually um not so great and it's

153
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:45,040
important to be aware of attraction to aversion in ourselves and around us so

154
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:51,560
that we can choose not to participate in it it's not good for your heart it's not

155
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:58,000
a good thing to feed in the heart you may not be convinced of that yet if you're sufficiently attracted but

156
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,199
I'm going to keep talking about this and we'll we'll see as we go

157
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:10,720
along so this is also not only our society let me say that one more time to

158
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:18,959
emphasize it's not our fault it's not something we need to you know that it's coming in from many ways the Buddha was

159
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:26,319
sometimes asked to teach What's called the dhma in brief someone would come to him and say please teach me the dharm in

160
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:33,799
brief I'm about to go off on Retreat just just give me some kind of nugget to practice with and um I think it's great

161
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:40,080
they asked him to summarize like all of the Dharma briefly but he did it you know each time somebody asked him that

162
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:48,200
he did give an answer it was he there's over 40 sutas where he discourses where he um does this and in one of them he

163
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:54,919
said it this way let go of desire for anything that is Dua that's what he told

164
00:17:54,919 --> 00:18:00,000
the person before they went off on Retreat let go of desire for any anything that is

165
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,520
Dua so it seems that the Buddha knew about attraction to aversion or desire

166
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,799
for dooka that would just you know attraction to aversion would be one example of

167
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:19,159
that so how about in your own mind just take a moment to think are there ways in

168
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:26,039
which you actually feed aversion sometimes maybe just sometimes supporting it to keep coming back

169
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:31,120
again it does take some clear seeing to be able to see that in ourselves and

170
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:36,320
some honesty so I hope I've set us up well enough that you won't feel uh

171
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:45,159
averse to doing that investigation and seeing if there's a little bit of like there one nun I knew um talked about how

172
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:52,320
uh in her practice she would often see in in her language she said I see a big fire burning in my mind and I think wow

173
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,159
where's this fire coming from and then I look just off to the side and I see that

174
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:06,360
there's a part of my mind throwing wood on the fire just off stage and I thought yeah this is um this

175
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:13,080
is true are there ways that we're throwing wood on the fire of aversion so it's interesting to open to this you

176
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:19,840
know we we like to dislike things we like to be judgmental of them and to protest

177
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:27,720
their presence in the world and declare that they should be obliterated aversion feels

178
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,919
powerful doesn't it feels power it has a power to it there's a a strength that

179
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:41,679
comes from knowing what you think shouldn't be there and being able to say that there's also kind of related to

180
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:48,679
that um a kind of a crystalline Clarity to a verion it doesn't have any

181
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:54,520
muddiness about it when you stand up and say no this is not the way it should be

182
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:00,880
there's a feeling of orderliness it's complete it's tidy and it's

183
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:07,600
Justified so there's a lot of um kind of this kind of energy can be around a

184
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:15,480
verion and it can it's a pleasant kind of energy it's it's attractive to feel powerful and clear in the world but does

185
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:24,000
that have to come from a verion no there are other things that are powerful and clear also wisdom for example or

186
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,240
compassion sometimes um but I'll offer just a specific

187
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:37,640
example since we're talking about specifics is that a very common pattern

188
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,919
in our society that is supported is what I like to call bonding through mutual

189
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,039
outrage I've talked about this before so if you've heard me say that before uh

190
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:56,240
please allow me to say it again and if you haven't it's a great one to learn bonding through mutual outrage so this

191
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:04,200
is this is like where one person people know two people know each other and one of them says did you read about

192
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:10,039
such and such today can you believe what happened about blah blah blah you know

193
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:17,600
something that's maybe just happened in the news and the other person says I know it's just terrible isn't it awful

194
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,640
and the other person says yes it's just amazing that such and such keeps going

195
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:30,360
on and there you go you're bonded together you're enjoying your shared values all shared around the hatred of

196
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:36,960
how awful this stupid thing going on is bonding through mutual outrage anyone

197
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,240
participated in that ever yeah so um

198
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,159
it's very seductive you know it's very seductive when somebody that we like and that we're connected to and that we care

199
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,679
about baits us with this kind of conversation we want to LEAP right in

200
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,200
yeah great I get to hate what I hate I get to be connected to my friend it's like a double benefit

201
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,880
it um so It's Tricky um and it can take

202
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,159
some strength if you decide you don't want to be feeding that aversion in your

203
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,720
heart which you are when you participate in that um you you need to find other

204
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:23,039
ways to connect with that person something even needs to be said maybe in that moment or you can try to divert

205
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,080
skillfully but you know bear in mind that there is a cost to that and then

206
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:34,760
later in meditation you wonder why these aversive patterns keep coming up well bonding through mutual outrage is one

207
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:40,799
way that we feed aversion in our own heart so it does keep coming

208
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:47,679
back another way that we like aversion is um often people use anger as a

209
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:54,080
motivator you when they think oh you know this is of course I have to be angry I have to be judgmental about this

210
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:00,960
that's how I go out in the world and do my work you know I'm my thing in the world is that I'm against such and such

211
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:06,480
and I'm trying to create a better world in this certain way and that that's because I don't like this thing

212
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,000
happening so if I didn't have that what would be my

213
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:22,360
motivation I think if we do this repeatedly maybe we forget that there ever could be any other motivation for

214
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:28,840
taking action in the world for making the world a better place for standing up

215
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:34,279
for what matters but there are other things that are better compassion being

216
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:41,080
one of them wisdom so there are so many other things that could serve as a foundation for

217
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:48,039
Action the Buddha said anger or reversion has a honey tip and a poison

218
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:54,559
root and I think we can start to understand that in our relationship to it so the honey tip is the part that we

219
00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:02,880
like of course we're attracted to the honey but we don't realize we don't maybe notice that down below it's rooted

220
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,440
in the aversive UNH wholesome root in the heart so you'll need to check out

221
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:15,279
your own mind to discover which ways you're attracted to aversion um but that would be part of

222
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:21,159
the subject of our Dharma investigation so we we can look more clearly if you

223
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:28,000
think this pattern just might exist in you from time to time you could investigate more directly in your own

224
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,240
experience okay what specifically is going on for me in those moments where I'm attracted

225
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:41,080
to aversion and we would want to do that uh kind of in the moment where it's happening you know it's we could think

226
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:47,520
about it reflectively uh outside of meditation and that that would be okay if you weren't on the cushion you could

227
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:53,559
sort of ponder about that sometime but it's also nice to uh look in the actual

228
00:24:53,559 --> 00:25:01,039
moment and see okay the aversion is here the clouds are here what are the atmospheric conditions supporting it the

229
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:06,279
the attraction to aversion is here what's supporting my attraction to that

230
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:11,320
aversion in this moment so I'll offer you know basically what's in it for me

231
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:17,640
what what benefit am I getting what's the honey there um so I'll offer some

232
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:25,000
that I've noticed um and you can see and I'll Al offer some uh ways one or two

233
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:30,360
ways that we could connect in if it's not uh so clear to us how to do that so

234
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:36,520
A big one is that um is kind of emotional Comfort if if we are

235
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:42,840
frequently thinking aversive thoughts that's kind of the climate in our mind remember I mentioned that that's how it

236
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:48,159
can be we actually just like what's familiar so we don't really like the

237
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:55,919
aversion but we like its familiarity that can happen feels like me feels comfortable to be complaining

238
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:02,480
that's what I do you know I like to complain about this not because I like complaining particularly or maybe I do

239
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,960
but it's comfortable feels like me so there's actually some emotional Comfort

240
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,480
related to this trying to attain safety or Security in some way if I resist this

241
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:22,080
push it away I create a safe distance right and then there's some emotional Security in having that distance from

242
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:28,440
what I don't like um by the way it's not a very secure

243
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:34,640
kind of safety there are other kinds of safety that are a lot more reliable and

244
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,679
durable um but we create kind of a weak false safety through aversion so we can

245
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:48,840
be attracted to that not very safe safety another thing that we do which is

246
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:55,760
really kind of embarrassing is that we do entertainment you know we entertain ourselves through being uh averse to

247
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,799
things it's fun because whatever Target we've chosen in our mind like

248
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,880
complaining to our neighbor or telling off our child or whatever it is they're

249
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:13,640
not there to respond and react and defend you know we just get the one side of the conversation so why not we can

250
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:21,720
you know we can just go at it um again not a very wholesome kind of

251
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:27,720
entertainment and probably the biggest one though is that we might notice in

252
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:33,520
our invest instigation is that we're bolstering some kind of self-image or a self

253
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:41,720
story about you know being a person who is opposed to this and therefore I'm I'm

254
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:47,840
attracted to being able to set myself up as looking that way um someone once

255
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:54,679
asked me what it means to identify with an UNH wholesome mind State like a version I would say that it means that

256
00:27:54,679 --> 00:28:00,840
we wouldn't know who we are if we weren't in ing that mind State there are

257
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:07,279
people who would not know who they are if they didn't have their hatred and their anger or their irritation or their

258
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:13,919
judgment and that's pretty scary so you're avoiding it's not a it's

259
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:21,760
not attraction then to the um some positive feeling it's the avoidance of

260
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,120
the fear of not knowing who I'd be if I weren't angry so there's an attra

261
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:34,559
raction in a sense there attraction to avoiding the pain of not knowing who I

262
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:40,200
am so check it out if you're resisting or pushing away or being irritated do

263
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,880
you think that's who you are who you just need to be in that

264
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,320
moment so that's all that all could be somewhat cognitive so I want to point

265
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:58,679
out that a a a clue instead of going too much into the

266
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:06,080
into the thinking about it is to bring it into the body this is a way to bring together all

267
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:12,720
the things I've talked about so far in the body we can feel the honey tip of

268
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,360
the aversion we can feel the sweetness of it and the power and the energy that

269
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:24,880
flows it's a very bodily energy when we rise up and feel that aversion so we

270
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:31,799
feel the attraction really quite literally but we also feel the body doesn't lie

271
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:38,960
and if we are willing to open to the whole feeling in the body we will also feel the cost in the cost benefit

272
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:47,640
analysis we'll feel the poison root so in the body we'll feel that aversion is actually a tense state it involves some

273
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:54,559
closing down some tightening up in some way uh it also involves kind of a stress

274
00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:01,720
a feeling of stress because we've set ourselves up against something um and then there's can even

275
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:09,519
be kind of a narrowing feeling in the mind or a darkening so um this is actually what

276
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:14,960
guy Armstrong told the monks to do when they kept saying I would note it I would

277
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,240
note it again he said maybe you should try investigating if something keeps

278
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,480
coming back and back and back and you can do that right on the cushion by

279
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:32,559
opening to it in the body you know really feeling uh what that feels

280
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:42,159
like so these patterns in our mind things

281
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:49,279
that are particularly like sticky enough that we've become attracted to our aversion

282
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:55,200
for example that's kind of a tangle is if you have something that's UNH wholesome the aversion and you've

283
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:01,240
wrapped it in like a grasping to it um that constitutes the beginning of a

284
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:08,639
tangle and then there could be other threads in there right I named self-identification I named fear um

285
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:14,360
coming in so if we have these things that have gotten kind of bound up uh we

286
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:22,240
the Buddhist called it by the technical term a tangle or a knot and that is one of the

287
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,880
reasons that they keep coming back either repeatedly in a sit or if you notice repeatedly over weeks or months

288
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:34,480
or years for that matter uh we might be dealing with what's called a KN and so this

289
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,960
investigation can be done gently and repeatedly and maybe we would just look

290
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:45,760
at one strand of it at a given time so I'm I'm encouraging you not to feel like

291
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:51,960
oh that's it now I've got to figure it all out in this moment Kim said to investigate my Avers my attraction to

292
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:59,000
aversion I'm going to work that all out figure out the puzzle and and that's it by tomorrow I'll be done with this one

293
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,760
it might take a little longer than that um but this gentle approach where we have some ways of investigating in the

294
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:12,880
moment you know some ways of looking in the body considering the benefit for us

295
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:20,840
what's going on with that and then maybe going back just to being mindful just be mindful name it note it

296
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:27,039
like the monks be with it for a while and then if it seems like oh maybe I could look at

297
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:32,120
that again a little bit more carefully kind of a a gentle back and forth is

298
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:38,039
like the way we gently work on a tangled knot you can't just say okay that's it

299
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:45,679
I'm going to rip it all apart we might have to sort of tug at it a little bit be with it hold it underwater let it

300
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:52,200
soften a little bit so consider this kind of Investigation a long-term project not something that you're trying

301
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:58,480
to figure out but a long-term project where you let the Dharma kind of help you work on it

302
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,159
be with it look at it a little bit then go back go back to the breath note it

303
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,960
note the breath maybe look at it again maybe we'll look at it next

304
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:16,639
Retreat slowly over time we are empowered in our practice to take on

305
00:33:16,639 --> 00:33:22,519
even some pretty pretty big Tangles even the fact that we like our

306
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:29,039
aversion and hence we don't really want to get rid of it right away

307
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:35,559
so I hope this has helped you to have a sense that there are many options with

308
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:40,919
how we work with uh our mind and that some of the stickier patterns that might

309
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:46,880
have several different strands to them uh can be slowly untangled over time as

310
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:53,760
long as we have a bunch of tools in our toolbox and I hope I've offered several tonight that might be of interest if you

311
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:00,679
have this particular pattern of attraction to AV verion which is common in our

312
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:07,880
society the world needs people who are not as attracted to AV

313
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:15,240
verion so it's nice to leave some time for discussion especially with a topic

314
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:20,919
like this that I hope appeals um or connects with I saw some

315
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:26,158
nods about this one so I'm curious what what did this bring up for you do any of

316
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:33,520
you have attraction to a virgin have you worked with it in certain ways do you have questions about what I talked about

317
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:39,960
yeah thanks and you could wait for the mic so that you can uh be

318
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:48,878
heard is there a skillful way to not like something because I know like for

319
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:54,919
me like um at a certain point my life I started a 12-step program right I really

320
00:34:54,919 --> 00:35:01,680
didn't like the fact that I was acting addicted so it drove me to 12 steps which saved my life so is there a

321
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,839
skillful way to not like something well definitely we don't have

322
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:14,680
to like everything at all um sometimes there can be an impression in spiritual

323
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:21,160
practice that um we're going to eventually come to just love everything

324
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:26,599
and be and approve of everything and accept everything well there's a way we have to accept everything but we

325
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:32,599
definitely don't have to love like everything so one way um is that I said

326
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:38,160
at the beginning there was this distinction between wholesome and un wholesome and things that are genuinely

327
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:44,720
UNH wholesome then we have these ways of working with them we're still recognizing that they're UNH wholesome

328
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:52,200
so that's actually wisdom is to know what's wholesome and what's UNH wholesome being addicted to substances

329
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:59,880
of any kind is definitely UNH wholesome we wouldn't want to uh decide that we like that in some way um but there's

330
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:06,000
maybe you discovered some subtlety through the 12-step program is that you can accept through the practices are

331
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,079
offered there you can accept that there's this addiction um that's somehow gotten into

332
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:17,640
your being um and yet there's there are empowered actions you can take that put

333
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:23,880
you on the wholesome side of that so you're not definitely not approving of

334
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:30,640
you know addiction as a way of being um but you're you're instead finding a way

335
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:37,480
to then turn the Mind towards something positive empowering a way of being in the world that doesn't rely on

336
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:43,160
that so I think you you you you did it yeah no what drove me to it though was

337
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:49,680
the intense dislike of of what I was doing yeah that was the so what would

338
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:57,240
you call that what would that be called I see I would call that um an early form of wisdom where you you realiz you knew

339
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:02,880
it was UNH wholesome and and so uh the mind the deeper the deeper sense was the

340
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,880
wisdom of this is not working I can't keep doing this and you didn't yet know

341
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,920
the skills of of how to deal with that uh in a way that you know that was wise

342
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:22,680
let's say or that was positive so what your mind did was it produced an aversion that got you to something

343
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:28,200
better so um there is there is wise

344
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:35,319
turning away from things and that's what you were doing so I call it wisdom Turning Away wise Turning Away wisdom

345
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:40,920
compassion renunciation has a flavor of this so but is that a dislike or is that

346
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,880
not a dislike why he turning away why is turning away is wisdom

347
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:54,240
yeah yeah these English terms like you know like and dislike are fairly um

348
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:00,920
vague terms so I would put a little more Precision on it to say that was wisdom

349
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,200
yeah good

350
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:17,920
job thanks thanks for your talk I I I really resonated with

351
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:25,920
recognizing uh the pleasure of aversion and I've examined it a lot um in my

352
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:33,920
practice and I've know noticed that uh maybe two things one uh the

353
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:41,520
motivating force is related to um as you said distancing from something unpleasant uh false or weak sense of

354
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:49,359
security from something is not pleasant and that the feeling of aversion is very

355
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:55,680
closely tied or almost superimposed with the unpleasant feeling

356
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:01,200
tone of a stimulus an otherwise benign stimulus a sound a

357
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,240
sight oh has a feeling tone that isant

358
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:13,520
unexpectedly unpleasant or it shouldn't be it's a benign stimulus but it's has an unpleasant feeling tone and then with

359
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:21,880
the unpleasant feeling tone there's a immediate superposition of this shouldn't be there

360
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:29,040
the aversion and then and as you said the aversion is a way of managing the unpleasantness mhm that's good

361
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,920
investigation so thank you the question is ultimately is the goal to dissolve

362
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,800
the unpleasantness of a stimulus or is unpleasantness just some stimuli or

363
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:49,160
unpleasantness and the practice is to accept that that's a good question um so

364
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:55,760
the feeling tone of experience is what you're talking about Pleasant unpleasant and neither Pleasant nor

365
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,880
unpleasant I'm sorry to say that we continue to have all three even after

366
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:07,839
we're fully awake I don't know that personally but the Buddha um had back pain for example which I assume was an

367
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:13,599
unpleasant feeling tone for him because he would say I'm my back hurts too much

368
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,640
you give the Dharma talk tonight he would say sometimes to his monks um so I

369
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:25,920
think the unpleasant feeling tone is going to continue and that definitely our uh our aim then is to be able to

370
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:33,440
relate to all three feeling tones in a way that we don't get entangled with them so when the Mind jumps on a verion

371
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,520
that shouldn't be there that's uh an unpleasant an unskillful relationship

372
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:44,400
with an unpleasant feeling tone so there are various approaches to you know trying to change that because you're

373
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:51,119
suffering when you start saying that shouldn't be there it is there right so the first one that we're usually taught

374
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,520
is acceptance so at least start with okay you know accept the unpleasant

375
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:03,040
feeling tone God thank you yeah I wish I could say

376
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:11,040
that it'll it'll end up being completely Pleasant I don't think so I guess I just wonder because it's an

377
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:17,960
unpleasant feeling tone associated with benign stimuli things that maybe you know

378
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:26,240
arbitrarily negative feeling tone um the negative feeling tone is not the

379
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:32,440
skillful the unskillful contribution the negative feeling tone is just the world

380
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:38,880
the unskillful contribution is the aversion in this case yeah you've yeah you've put a version on top of an

381
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,960
unpleasant feeling tone so the the Nuance that comes is that our our

382
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,440
feeling tone respon feeling tone is coming actually in your mind it's a it's an interface between the but there's

383
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:58,000
nothing inherently you said benign right there's nothing inherently unpleasant about that so your mind

384
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,119
decision that that's something unpleasant can that be worked with not really directly we tend to we get

385
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:10,520
feeling tone right with contact so who knows why your mind decides that's unpleasant person next to you might

386
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:18,359
think it's pleasant we don't get a choice about that necessarily but over time we do we do generally have a shift

387
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:23,559
through practice is that the mind starts deciding more things are neutral than uh

388
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:32,680
it used to but we don't really get to choose that it's not area that we work with directly great thank you

389
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:40,520
yeah thanks thanks that was a good talk I

390
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:47,720
liked how you were picking apart the various reasons why we might have this feeling of aversion and the reasons that

391
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:53,520
you gave for those made sense it's something that's bonding us with other people it's making us the attraction to

392
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,640
AV verion yeah why we have the attraction to it yeah one of in kind of

393
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,880
reflecting upon some of my own aversions one of the things that I noticed is that

394
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,960
I can sometimes have an aversion to something someone else is doing because it's a reflection of something in me

395
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:17,640
that I'm uncomfortable with and kind of this self lothing and I was struggling to come up with what's a good reason for

396
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:23,359
that so that would be part of the one where I talked about the um self-image

397
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:28,680
so you're actually just talking about aversion not necessarily attraction to aversion well well it's it's you're

398
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:34,720
you're protecting a self-image so you have a self-image of I don't want to have this part of

399
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,800
myself I'm trying to not I'm trying not to see my shadow essentially somebody

400
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:47,240
else is making me see my shadow by enacting it and then it resonates and I know that shadow is there but I don't

401
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:53,880
want it to be so if I'm averse to them I get to I it's just the same as being

402
00:43:53,880 --> 00:44:01,040
averse to that part in myself I get to kind of pretend that it's I'm I'm pushing it away it's this safety through

403
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:06,839
distance kind of thing and you've Tangled it up with a self-image so it's got two of them in there that's why

404
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:13,640
these things are called Tangles yeah so but the way to work with it is now that you figured the the

405
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:19,599
figuring out part is really only at the cognitive level so um touch into that in

406
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:27,240
the body like what do it feel like in you when you see that being enacted and you you know that's part of you can you

407
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:33,920
actually instead of worrying about them turn that lens around and be like wow

408
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,000
let me look at that part in me what happened what is with that part like

409
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,040
where's the friction with that maybe you start to have compassion for that part

410
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:50,240
or at least feel the pain of rejecting it within you and not be willing to put

411
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:56,040
up with that pain anymore yeah I would say go to the body

412
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:59,599
yeah thank

413
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:13,200
you okay good all right thanks everyone
