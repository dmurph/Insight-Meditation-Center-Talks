3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,760

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,960
practice vicarious joy happiness for happiness of others um happiness of

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,280
ourselves others just happiness for happiness because we usually our our default

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:41,280
mode in this human body and mind is to notice what's challenging what's

7
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,840
difficult um and turning our mind intentionally to what is good what is a

8
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,640
blessing um in our lives in other people's

9
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,760
lives it doesn't come naturally and yet when we do that we turn intentionally to

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,119
the good and celebrate blessings goodness happiness in the world whether

11
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:16,320
ours or others the heart feels uplifted and boy do we need uplift in our heart

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:24,200
especially especially in these challenging times um especially in these tough times

13
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:31,119
so this is a wholesome practice of gladdening our heart and mind um um it's

14
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:40,520
skillful means it's it gives us more um stability to be with what is

15
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,520
difficult of which there is plenty in our lives so by turning to what's good

16
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:53,560
we're actually building building more resilience so this is a way of

17
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,759
not shying away not turning away but

18
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:03,880
intentionally inclining the heart and mind to what's

19
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:10,360
good to build resilience so that we can be we can hold what's difficult with

20
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:19,319
more ease because if we always just turn our minds as as our minds want to just turn to what's ne ne difficult and and

21
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:25,200
challenging as our minds tend to do as human beings evolutionarily we're more

22
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,400
tuned to what's difficult and what's hard than what's good imagine our

23
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:38,080
ancestors walking in the savannah if they missed something good if they miss

24
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,360
the berry in the environment they would still live another day they would be

25
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,400
hungry but they would live another day and there would be other berries right

26
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,440
but if they missed the negative signals in the environment the bad the

27
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,599
challenging The Woolly Mammoth that was about to eat them they wouldn't Live

28
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:07,319
Another Day so guess who passed down their genes to us the ones who were

29
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:13,680
particularly tuned to scary difficult challenging

30
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,319
signals in the environment so we have those genes we

31
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:24,920
have those capacities we are more tuned to what's difficult what's challenging

32
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:31,720
what's scary what's fearful and not as tuned all of us beings not as

33
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:39,480
tuned um to what is good what is a blessing so we need to in we need to

34
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:44,599
balance our hearts and Minds by intending to what's

35
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,840
good so that's what we're going to do in our practice

36

205
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:12,839
especially if you haven't shared in a while if you have recently shared it's nice to um hold back and let other

206
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:18,760
people who might be a little more shy and holding back to to uh pull forward

207
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,760
so

208
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,960
so what what did you notice how were the different categories for you did you

209
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:44,920
notice differences moving from yourself to the dear person celebrating

210
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:54,440
them their happiness um etc etc Nicholas please

211
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:12,560
I don't hear you Nicholas oh is that better oh yes now I can hear you okay great yeah I was

212
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:19,880
saying that um mudita for myself is quite challenging right now because I've had ringing in my ears for a few days

213
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:27,319
and um you know that when we talk about focusing on the negative you know there's that pull to only see that and

214
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:35,960
all of my experience and it's very helpful I think to recognize the joy in others lives um

215
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:42,440
and I found that turning to everybody not just turning to somebody who was easy not

216
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:47,599
just turning to somebody who was a little challenging it it was a nice affirmation that there's joy in

217
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:53,000
everybody's life so of course there's also joy in my life that's available it's very

218
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:01,200
helpful nice nice beautiful thank you for sharing that Nicholas love it

219
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,480
um the the see seeing at first as you said

220
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:13,480
it was challenging to see the joy given that the tenus ringing in the ear has been so challenging and then by turning

221
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:20,280
and realizing oh yes there is joy in everyone's life then it actually made seeing the joy and the blessings in your

222
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:27,359
own life more available lovely beautiful thank you for sharing that may your your

223
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:34,640
wisdom the way you worked with it and the what you discovered may it support other people in their own Discovery um

224
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:41,040
as as we discover these ways other people might think oh if I have difficulty seeing joy in my life well

225
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:48,079
maybe I'll do the same thing I'll try for other beings so that's lovely Nichols and I'm loving your your your

239
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:40,720
someone's happiness you know I found that if I understand the cause of

240
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:46,720
someone's happiness it's it's very easy for me to you know feel happy for their

241
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,599
happiness but you know if I didn't have that um if I couldn't see into the

242
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:57,920
source of it it it wound up feeling um like uh like

243
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:03,160
meta you know I couldn't really say I'm happy for your happiness I just it

244
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:09,920
didn't ring true but I could say Hey you know may it continue may it increase you know with with loving

245
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:17,160
kindness yeah there's that little step more for Mita exactly yeah yeah yeah I appreciate the

246
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:22,960
question so um tell me which of the categories was

247
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:31,440
it challenging in what we're raising all of them one of them let's let let's speak about something specific

248
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:37,200
um um neutral a neutral being who you know I don't really know or have a

249
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:43,680
relationship with and you know so the further from got it proximity to me even

250
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:49,880
my difficult being was I I could conjure up a little mudita for my difficult

251
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:57,720
being I know what's going on in her life I see got it how about your deer how about your dear being easy oh okay great

252
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:03,680
good to know okay so so dear person you can feel into their life yes great easy

253
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:09,839
and then even the challenging person you're having challenges with yes because you know brother it's really

254
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:17,200
you're highlighting the neutral person that just not so much connection great okay very concrete so so this is what I

255
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:24,680
would recommend J to play to to play around with this um imagine this this in

256
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:34,040
order to find your way into it um think of something that that is is

257
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:40,079
you Relish in your life that's something that's you know you have a roof over

258
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:46,119
your head you know you have a comfortable safe home and ah and imagine

259
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:51,280
you know when you didn't have that for example and now you have it how happy you feel about it what a blessing in is

260
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:59,119
now imagine them oh and it's okay you can use your imagination it's okay you can be creat creative in this imagine oh

261
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:04,240
they they didn't have that they were sharing a home or something and it wasn't Comfort and now oh they have

262
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:10,359
their own like oh this is how it makes me feel I just Delight in it oh they wow

263
00:48:10,359 --> 00:48:17,319
they they probably feel the same way I happy for your happiness so that can build the

264
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:25,319
bridge that's creativity you're welcome yeah you're welcome and it can be very you

265
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:31,640
know again use your creativity it could be very fun and nourishing in this way appreciate the

266
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:37,640
question so okay dear ones it is time for us to

267
00:48:37,640 --> 00:48:44,359

268
00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:49,880
for practicing groups is um first let's

269
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:56,240
by the way how is it let me ask you um if you remember or maybe I'll ask you afterwards after you come out the group

270
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:03,760
because you may not remember I'm going to ask you to spend about 30 seconds without words at the beginning just

271
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:08,960
having mudita for other people's happiness imagining they have some

272
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,040
happiness even if you don't know what it is the other couple of people in the room with

273
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:21,240
you just doing real time would for them and then when you unmute then each of

274
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:27,839
you shares something that you're grateful for in your life is it is you're happy for and then you can

275
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:33,920
practice real time mudita for each other um and then you can share anything you

276
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:40,359
like so you could do that one round and then you can share anything about the practice if there is time after that so
