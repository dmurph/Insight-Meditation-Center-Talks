1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:08,400
good evening good evening welcome Happy President's

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,519
Day I admit I kind of forgot it was President's

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,840
Day until just uh as I was uh driving here there was a sign like oh right I

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:27,960
don't have a regular 9-to-5 job so uh sometimes forget that some of these Mondays are holidays so whatever you did

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,680
today I hope it was delightful and nice I know when I was a kid um this

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:42,760
was ski week right with the president's holiday we would uh go skiing or something like that go enjoy the

7
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,239
winter so we'll see if there's something that uh arises in my mind to tie what in

8
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:58,359
President's Day what I'm going to talk about there might be nothing but there might be something we'll

9
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:03,920
see but I want want to talk a little bit uh starting with this story that's in

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:11,438
the suit does and the story is of this woman her name is danan

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:19,799
johnni and she stumbles and she like trips and then as she recovers her

12
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,000
balance uh she says like the homage to the

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,520
Buddha so in my mind she see she some like oh my God or Jesus you know it's

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:39,159
something like this right except that she says NASA

15
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,280
a some of you will recognize that that's a part of a chant that we do even now

16
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:56,280
today but here's something that was uh you know thousands of years ago kind of gets recorded as the way that she like

17
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:03,079
this thing that she says when she uh trips so the veracity of that story is a

18
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:09,879
little bit questionable because I don't think somebody would say something quite that long nevertheless the story is she

19
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:16,720
says this and then somebody nearby a man named sarva who was a

20
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:24,400
priest of the dominant religious tradition of that time brahmanism says like is quite offended

21
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,040
that she would say something like that and he says to

22
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:38,360
her um I can't believe you know that you just paid homage to that bald pained

23
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:45,200
recluse so he's uh insulting the Buddha but even though right the Buddha has

24
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,640
hair but that I guess in the in this story he's bald and that that this is a

25
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,040
common insult that other people talk about the Buddha they say he's a he's a

26
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:04,319
shaving you know because he shaves his head or something like like this and then she says well you don't

27
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,920
know the wisdom of the Buddha and if you did you would not be insulting

28
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:17,080
him and I I give him credit he says okay well the next time he's in town let me

29
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:24,720
know and I'm going to go hear about this Buddha person and see what he has to say

30
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,280
because this is how it was right back then right you had to hear the teachings there weren't books or or you know there

31
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:37,519
wasn't certainly a meditation centers or Retreat centers or anything like that right so you had to hear from the

32
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:44,000
teacher themselves or one of their students so as The Story Goes and the

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,439
Buddha eventually Finds Its way to that part of uh where they were living and he

34
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:55,040
goes to talk to him SAR this guy goes to talk to the

35
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,480
Buddha and he says

36
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,640
asks about him that says there are spiritual teachers this is paraphrase

37
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,879
There Are Spiritual teachers who teach others after finding a final and

38
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:17,359
ultimate insight and where is Master Goa so he's

39
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:23,639
not even calling him venerable sir or uh the blessed one or anything like this

40
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:30,600
he's using his given name Master Goa where does Master Goa stand among them

41
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:38,720
so Sara is asking okay there's all kinds of spiritual teachers like where who are you amongst

42
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:47,199
all these do you are you a follower of this person do you do something else like who are you what's your

43
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,759
story and uh the Buddha replies well actually there's a difference among spiritual

44
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,520
teachers based on how they uh what wisdom they teach about

45
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,639
there's three different like bases or foundations that uh PE teachers can use

46
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:13,160
for Authority for their teachings and he says one is what he's calls like the

47
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:20,479
traditionalist and these are teachers that are relying on uh like the tradition what other

48
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,400
people behind them have discovered or taught and this was the truth for

49
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,080
brahmanism at this time so sarva he's a PRI and he follows this tradition that

50
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,520
is that they had this uh that tradition I just use this word

51
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,680
believed that everything that needed to be known to live a good life to have a

52
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,560
good life and a good whatever happens after death is already

53
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,680
known and it was revealed to other people a long time ago and it's been

54
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:00,039
preserved in the tradition so you just have to know the tradition you just have

55
00:06:00,039 --> 00:06:05,440
to study what other people have know you have to memorize it and really know that

56
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,080
a lot a lot of memorization so that's one way that

57
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:19,160
spiritual teachers come to be is because um they are just memorizing what people before them have uh been how what's been

58
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,120
passed down through the tradition excuse

59
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,400
me and then um they believe that just you know the sacred text were the most

60
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,440
authoritative or whatever it says in the text that's all you need and then

61
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,960
there's a second group the Buddha is describing that uh actually they think

62
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,160
that the spiritual texts have some value but needs some logic and some reasoning

63
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:55,319
and some philosophy to be added on to them maybe some way to um work with them

64
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:02,800
uh like well okay if it says this in the sacred text then it must also so mean that so there's a little maybe some more

65
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,400
interpretation that they add on to the sacred text and he called these the

66
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,800
reasoners or the philosophers or the logicians people that are you know

67
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:22,039
taking it one step further and then the Buddha says there's a third type of teacher who teaches based on their

68
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:30,879
direct experience from what they've actually known for themselves

69
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:39,199
this um this idea that you need to have this like a personal and

70
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,000
direct uh experience of reality or acquaintance of reality of the way

71
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,960
things are by things that they really are and this is often the contemplatives

72
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:57,360
or those who have meditative practices are the ones that can touch into seeing

73
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:04,039
things more clearly was this idea then the Buddha says I'm one of these one of

74
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:09,919
these third ones these experientialist these ones who have come

75
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:16,039
to know things through my own experience through discovering them through and

76
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:22,080
then he goes on to give sarava this uh his biography where he talks about where

77
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,800
the Buddha is talking about where he did all these uh meditative practices he did all of these aesthetic practices and

78
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,479
realized that neither of those were the way to complete Awakening but instead it

79
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:41,560
was um some meditative state of calm and ease and

80
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:48,160
stability and Stillness that allowed the Buddha to see things clearly and that

81
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:55,600
allowed for his Awakening so there's this way in which

82
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,640
the Buddha he's telling sarava that uh well he's teacher that he's based on his

83
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:08,760
direct experience and in fact we can see in the very first teaching that the Buddha gives this is the one that's a

84
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:15,040
the tradition holds is the very first teaching in it he says in regard to

85
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:22,120
things unheard before so saying like you know I didn't hear this from anybody else this isn't something that I just

86
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:31,160
learned there arose in me Vision knowledge wisdom higher knowledge and

87
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,760
illumination so he's talking about like this wisdom arises and this knowledge

88
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:44,240
and higher knowledge we could debate what does higher knowledge mean exactly but what I

89
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:50,360
want to point to here is this idea of direct experience there's a way in which

90
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:57,600
we know things differently when we've actually experienced

91
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,399
them we know what it's like through our experiences is so different than if we

92
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:10,480
just hear about it or read about it or may maybe hear somebody else talk

93
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,560
about it or listen to a podcast people talking about

94
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,240
it this is a silly example but uh not too long ago um I was going outside in a

95
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,640
place in the temperature was cold and I looked at the you know thermometer or

96
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,720
look to see okay what is the temperature like oh okay that's not so bad I'll be fine with what I'm

97
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,680
wearing and then I go outside and I'm like okay it's fine it's fine no it's

98
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,959
not fine it's really cold so then there's this like oh yeah

99
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:53,480
there's something when 38 Dees like I read that like okay that's kind of colder than what we normally think but

100
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,600
it's not until you actually experience 38° for some people who might be

101
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:04,920
listening to this who think 38 de is nothing I'll just say you know we're here in the Bay Area where 38 degrees is

102
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:13,000
a cooler temperature that uh it wasn't until you experienced it like oh this is very

103
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:20,279
different than just reading about a number and imagining it and thinking it's cooler and just to have this

104
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:28,079
experience I don't know if that's a good example I mean the typical example that I'm often giving is something about

105
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,079
maybe you have this experience too is we all understand that people are

106
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:39,519
going to die pets are going to die we all know this intellectually we know

107
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:47,120
this but I'll say for myself it wasn't until my father died that I realized oh

108
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:54,120
yeah this thing about death is different when it touches you personally it's

109
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:59,399
different than just an understanding and so the Buddha he he's

110
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:05,880
pointing to this this different way of knowing things just through experience

111
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:12,760
or maybe we might even say some insights this um Vision knowledge wisdom higher

112
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:20,440
knowledge and illumination and I appreciate in this list is both we have this vision and

113
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:26,160
illumination and even in um contemporary times we might say things like oh I see

114
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,800
like there's something about like seeing and then there's something about

115
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,959
knowing and like these are related but maybe they aren't exactly the same and

116
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:45,959
we see this uh in the Buddha's teaching sprinkled throughout about all kinds of things is this expression

117
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:54,120
y that means like knowledge and vision of things as they are so knowledge and vision like putting

118
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,800
together knowledge and vision like to see things

119
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:06,120
and to know things and these things are as how they

120
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,760
really are and I'll talk about this in a moment I'll unpack that a little

121
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:20,680
bit but I also wanted to say that um the Buddha he also when he was um describing

122
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,240
to sarava as part of his biography about like how did he come to have these

123
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:33,279
experiences that uh supported him and having becoming an awakened becoming

124
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:41,320
liberated and then in part of this biography that gets repeated in a few places and the suit does he says this

125
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:47,160
Dharma that I have attained so Dharma we could say is teaching or the way things

126
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,199
are are different ways that we can translate that Doctrine

127
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:59,199
but it's not Doctrine here because it's something that he has attained it's not something that he's heard

128
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:05,360
this Dharma that I have attained is profound hard to see and hard to

129
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:14,120
understand it's peaceful and Sublime but unattainable by mere

130
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,839
reasoning it's subtle and to be experienced by the

131
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,880
wise so he's pointing to also like it's not just reasoning it's not just

132
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:34,560
thinking about things but is experien Ed by the wise so the wise are being those

133
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:40,320
who maybe are following his teachings or

134
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:49,320
who yeah how do we Define the wise it's we kind of get into this uh loop here

135
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:56,199
um the word is pandita for wise here

136
00:14:56,199 --> 00:15:03,440
um one who has wisdom is experiences this Dharma so maybe we

137
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:11,279
could say it's the wisdom that has put aside what is extra what is not needed

138
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:17,360
that enables them to see this deeply so the Buddha when he's talking

139
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,759
to sarava he says well there's these three types of teachers who come to

140
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:29,920
teaching through three different routes and I'd like to offer that we

141
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:37,600
actually need all three of these types of teachings or these three ways of

142
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:44,120
coming to understand things both um teachings from others who

143
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:51,839
have gone before us some reasoning some logic maybe some philosophy if you have

144
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:58,519
an inclination that way as well as some direct experience this is a way in which we can

145
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:03,759
make the teachings our own and in which we can find The Liberation experience

146
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:08,920
the freedom and the peace that's uh being pointed

147
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:16,160
to because maybe when we first start this practice certainly this was the case for me I heard a

148
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,639
talk by accident I was at a in a yoga class and

149
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:27,959
uh somebody came in and started to uh talk about the Dharma which was

150
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:33,079
completely unexpected for me and I certainly would not have gone to that yoga class if I had known that was what

151
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:42,480
was going to happen but uh this person started speaking and uh something in my

152
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:48,319
heart I don't know I don't know what it was it uh I found myself kind of like

153
00:16:48,319 --> 00:16:54,639
with tears in my eyes kind like oh my goodness this it just resonated with me so

154
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,800
deeply and here I am all these years later having dedicated my life to this

155
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:06,880
now but there's a way in which we might read a book hear a talk these days

156
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,640
listen to an app Listen to a podcast and then we might say oh okay

157
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:19,319
yeah this makes sense I can see this maybe there's something that

158
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:26,160
resonates for us and maybe there's something that um feels like okay yeah I

159
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,480
can um I can feel that there's some truth truth here and it's not asking me

160
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:40,519
to get rid of all of my uh logic or uh independent

161
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:46,799
thinking maybe maybe for example we hear this teaching that uh clinging or um

162
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:53,480
grasping leads to suffering and then the teaching says well if you want less suffering do

163
00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:00,280
less clinging we could just see oh there's some clear logic here it's not asking us

164
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:06,520
to just believe something so we could say I heard this expression number of years ago and I

165
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:13,159
really liked it that just like hearing these teachings in the beginning before we perhaps we have a meditation practice

166
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:19,760
or perhaps before we've like really tried to bring them into our lives we could call them as like borrowed wisdom

167
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:26,480
like you know we've heard from others they seem to make sense but then for us to find this own

168
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,720
wisdom this uh own knowledge and true knowledge or direct knowledge for

169
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:38,440
ourselves we bring them into practice we um engage with them maybe

170
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:47,960
like roll up our sleeves in a particular way and so maybe there's a aan Amaro who

171
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:54,799
is a uh he's a well-respected monastic uh in this

172
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:00,840
tradition he used to be here in Northern California and uh he now is in England

173
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:07,880
he's uh heads up a monastery and he said that the teachings

174
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:14,760
need to be fully internalized fully actualized made real brought to life

175
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:19,880
through our practice during the course of the day

176
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:29,760
here in this moment and I appreciate this this way of internalized actualized and made real

177
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,360
by experiencing them discovering them for

178
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:42,159
ourselves and so we might say well how do we do this wh what is

179
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:47,760
this I'm going to have a drink of water here

180
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:05,600
there's a way in which we can maybe use some of this borrowed wisdom wisdom some

181
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,120
of the teachings as a way to help support this exploration this exploration in our

182
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:18,000
lives exploration in our practice and there's there's a number of

183
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,679
ways in which we can do this and I'm just offering one can be really powerful

184
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,960
and transformative well ideally I I could

185
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:34,720
say all of them can be powerful and transformative but I'll offer these and

186
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,480
these are some of the this teaching of anicha Dua and

187
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,559
anata some of you will recognize these as the three characteristics that is

188
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:53,760
that uh there's change and uncertainty in

189
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,400
eacha that things are like unsatisfactory that there's this little

190
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,840
sense of like things aren't quite right they could be a little bit better

191
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:11,919
daa and then this sense that there isn't a constant stable

192
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:18,039
controllable self that's inside here

193
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:23,559
somehow and that's a anata an Dua

194
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:29,279
an I'm using a lot of poly words uh today for some reason I apologize if

195
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:34,840
that's no need to remember any of these uh some people like it some people

196
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:41,440
really dislike it that's perfectly fine I think I started teaching poly recently again so that's maybe why it's uh more

197
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:48,960
in my head so these are ways in which we can use to

198
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:56,360
explore our experience so just exploring this idea of inconstancy and

199
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:01,480
impermanence is what we're exper experiencing whatever it

200
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,880
is is it completely static never

201
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,919
changing or are there some fluctuations are there sometimes it's

202
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:21,080
there sometimes it's not there or is there some

203
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:28,279
gradations or flickering or same intensity maybe a

204
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:35,679
different intensity just whatever experience you're having completely mundane washing

205
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,880
the dishes is it the same time exactly the same as the last time you wash

206
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:48,120
dishes is the experience itself just one thing that's exactly the same getting

207
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,320
repeated and this seems so obvious like no the things are changing so the

208
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:59,960
intellectual mind understands that but there's a way in which if we really like bring this question and

209
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:05,400
explore driving to work is it exactly the same we might be going the same

210
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:13,440
route leaving at the same time but it's not exactly the same is

211
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:21,200
it so using this exploration of what a inconstancy the changing

212
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:28,559
nature and then the second is to this idea of well is this completely satis

213
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:34,559
saory is this a lasting source of happiness because if this is

214
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,840
satisfactory will it always bring me happiness will I always be happy now

215
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:47,279
that I have found this this whatever it might be and when we initially we'll say but I

216
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:54,720
have lots of beautiful wonderful experiences in my life hopefully you do hopefully

217
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,159
everybody's life has these uh experiences but then if we start to look at them

218
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:07,000
there's often just this really quiet oh I hope this

219
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,240
last oh what did I do so that I can get here again so I can have this other

220
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:18,240
experience so I can have it again or there's this little thing like oh I

221
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,919
don't want this to end okay how can I prolong this there's this quiet little

222
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:28,960
niggling that's happening during even the most fantastic experience es that

223
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,279
we're having and so it's pointing to even the things that are wonderful there's this

224
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:41,679
tiny sense of this afraid of loss or wanting a little bit

225
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,480
more I'm not saying that's the dominant experience I'm saying that we don't

226
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:54,399
discover things that are completely 100% uh stressfree

227
00:24:54,399 --> 00:25:00,320
forever if you found it you would not be here on a Monday night

228
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:06,919
right so they might be sources of happiness and pleasure and all that kind of stuff but they're not like lasting

229
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:14,360
sources of happiness and so this is another way that we can explore not not uh to make

230
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:21,279
it be a downer because actually what I have found is that um if I'm having a

231
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:26,440
tremendous experience something that's just fantastic hiking and seeing like these

232
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:32,279
views that are just so uplifting and it was hiking not too long ago and

233
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:38,799
went to a place I hadn't been before and there's these views I just thought wow it was just amazing it was just I don't

234
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:44,919
know a little bit breathtaking and then I and then I start

235
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:52,000
to notice like why didn't I come here before how come of all these years I've never been here before and I'm going to

236
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:59,520
have to come back here later and I need to show somebody else this and like there's all this kind of stuff that uh

237
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,679
shows up but what I noticed is that when I recognized oh yeah there's that little

238
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,159
bit of I'm going to call it Dua Dua is this really can it's this one word that

239
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:17,120
has this huge range of ex uh meaning and one can just be that tiny niggling

240
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:23,120
little yeah something not quite right but when I acknowledged oh yeah there's

241
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:29,000
that little uh tiny voice that sometimes shows up that says oh why didn't I or it

242
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,679
should be something like this then I could let go of this why didn't I know

243
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:43,440
this earlier I better show somebody else and letting go of that just made it more

244
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:51,399
beautiful like oh yeah there's this experience here won't always be here at this

245
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:56,440
particular I mean that the view will be there but this experience will be

246
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:02,200
changing I will be different the weather will be different the light will be different some of those trees will grow

247
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,919
and you know whatever it might be so acknowledging that little bit of

248
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,919
Dua allowed a certain of Letting Go which made even the beauty be a little bit more poignant and maybe even a

249
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,440
little bit more beautiful appreciation gratitude

250
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:26,919
arising so that's a second way in which we can explore our experience have some of these direct experiences of this

251
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:33,799
unsatisfactory not the source lasting sources of happiness and then the third way in

252
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:40,720
which we can explore our experience is this idea

253
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,919
of just exploring what is it that feels like there's a

254
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:53,760
me that's having these experiences maybe out there in some kind of way or maybe

255
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:00,240
there isn't a location maybe there's just a sense of a just all these experiences that are happening to this

256
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:07,000
core here this Essence here what what gives me that idea what

257
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,600
what makes me feel like that we all do it's a natural thing to have that

258
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:20,039
experience or to have that belief or to have that uh

259
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:27,760
interpretation but what is it that makes it feel like there's this constant or

260
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:35,039
there's a me somehow this humulus maybe that's a inside to bring some curiosity

261
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:40,600
to this because if there's a me then there's often there's this sense of mine

262
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,519
and not mine what belongs to this me and what

263
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:55,039
doesn't certainly there are plenty of

264
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:00,559
um things that we don't think are

265
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:08,559
ours or we don't think that we think they're ours if you were right now wherever

266
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,519
you're sitting if somebody were to come in late and to say can you move that's

267
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:21,600
actually my chair I'm sitting there that's mine I I sat in it uh two

268
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:28,399
weeks ago I was in that location and uh and I'm pretty sure that's the exact same chair

269
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:33,480
or that seems silly right but there's a way in which we often like okay while

270
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:39,519
you're sitting there you feel like okay this is my chair but then you know as soon as you go away it's uh not it's

271
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:47,480
just a chair again there's a way in which we have these subtle ways of thinking this is mine if I asked you

272
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:52,960
guys to stand up and stretch or something and then to sit back down chances are you would sit back down in

273
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:58,120
the same chair because you have a feeling like oh this is mine or not not

274
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:04,799
mind in terms of you own it but somehow it has a relationship with you at this

275
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,519
time maybe that's not a very good uh example but there's this way in

276
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:19,799
which the sense of ey or the sense of me is getting created by these thoughts

277
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:25,559
that we have these just mental events that they themselves don't have any

278
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:32,519
substance but is this way that we feel like

279
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:41,679
um I'm this way well I'm a person who is likes to do things in a

280
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,840
XYZ I like to uh think about things

281
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,200
analytically I like to or I just like to think about I like to figure things out

282
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,000
so they have this way in which um they've identified that they're an

283
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:04,440
analytical person but are you an analytical person

284
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:13,080
when you're dreaming when you're asleep and dreaming are you an analytical person when you um knock on wood after

285
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:19,639
you say something that uh you don't little superstitious thing and you feel like you have to knock on wood or uh

286
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:25,240
whatever it might be right there's we have times when we're not that way even

287
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:30,399
though we might think that we are all the time so we might have the sense oh

288
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:36,279
I'm the one that's like this but actually it's just that that's

289
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:44,120
a pattern that arises and that's a pattern of thought a pattern of uh um

290
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:52,519
behaviors but it's not inherently who you are it's something that happens

291
00:31:52,519 --> 00:32:01,320
frequently and that you're identified with there's nothing wrong with having those identific ations but it turns

292
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:07,919
out that we need thoughts to support these

293
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:17,760
identifications we need plans we need programs we need um to do lists and uh

294
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,080
ways that we spend our time to support

295
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:30,399
this so there's this way that as the mind starts to quiet down with

296
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:36,240
the meditation practice as well as when we're just in daily life outside of

297
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,480
meditation we can just have this exploration like what what's what is

298
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:48,279
this sense of me what is it and there's this way there can be

299
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:55,639
kind of like a like what what what's spe there or kind of this like turning around and looking at what's

300
00:32:55,639 --> 00:33:02,519
looking what's doing the thinking what is feeling these feelings what is

301
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:11,480
thinking these thoughts so this idea of having our own

302
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:18,320
direct experience and then we can borrow some of the wisdom that the Buddha has

303
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:26,720
offered to help us like explore our experience so that we can have our own

304
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:31,880
insights our own understandings and then we don't

305
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:37,200
have to rely on what the Buddha is saying we don't have to have this borrowed wisdom instead we can have our

306
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:46,279
own so these teachings uh anich Dua anata these teachings of uh inconstancy

307
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:54,720
changing impermanence of unsatisfactoriness and not a stable

308
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:02,760
inherent core to the self or to anything it turns out that just

309
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:09,358
doesn't exist we can use these teachings as ways

310
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,320
to investigate our experience and you might even say that's

311
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,560
what Insight is is when we start to have our own

312
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:27,720
understanding of them where the Insight Meditation Center we might say Insight is to have your own direct experience of

313
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:34,358
of these in a way that leads to less suffering in a way that leads to more

314
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:40,480
peace and ease and freedom there a way that we can Define

315
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:46,919
insight and and become our own teacher or maybe even become a Dharma teacher or

316
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:52,200
become a just have a our own

317
00:34:53,879 --> 00:34:59,560
understanding maybe one last thing that I'll say here one of the the Beauties I

318
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:07,040
think of like exploring our experience through these lenses through these Frameworks through this borrowed wisdom

319
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:14,280
of impermanence not satisfactory no inherent substantial

320
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:21,480
core is that it doesn't require that we have any particular experience it's not

321
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:27,160
like meditation has to be always Pleasant in order for it to be impactful

322
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:34,079
it's not like that we have to have things going our way or the way that we prefer things like being our life or

323
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:41,800
meditation practice or anything we can bring these queries to

324
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:48,320
whatever is happening whatever is happening and then we kind of like fall

325
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:55,240
the tyranny of wanting to have a good meditation session kind of starts to fall away and you realize whatever is

326
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:00,839
happening in your meditation practice if the mind is all over the place or if there's a lot of calm and

327
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:07,440
Stillness whatever is happening we can just bring this this uh exploration to

328
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,319
all of our experiences so then to close out the

329
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:20,040
story Sara having heard this from the Buddha feels quite touched by this and

330
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:28,640
decides to become a follower of the Buddha so maybe there was something in that the Buddha said uh because he was a

331
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:34,640
priest in this uh in the dominant religion of the time and he became a follower of the Buddha so maybe there

332
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:42,160
was something that recognized some of these teachings and sadly this little vignette

333
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:51,760
with danan johnni this is all we know about her is that she just trips and falls and says namot

334
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,800
tasa so thank you for your attention and uh if you like I will have some

335
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,520
questions and

336
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,720
answers this idea of direct experience for me I'll say this is really meaningful

337
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,599
that we don't just have to adopt

338
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,640
beliefs but you know just like to investigate and explore for

339
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:48,440
ourselves can anybody tie this in with President stay

340
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,800
yeah I think uh that's one of the things I like best

341
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:17,200
about the practice is that it's not dogmatic I'm very rebellious in many

342
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:26,200
ways if somebody tells me to do something not alwayss but um so yeah I

343
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:34,680
love uh so far I've loved exploring what how these things come up

344
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:41,680
in my daily life and what it means and one the impermanence one I really like

345
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:48,599
lately uh early in the morning I sit with my coffee stare out the window and

346
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:55,480
watch the light change so I can see impermanence in the world and I also see

347
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:03,119
okay this is how I am when I wake up what's my state of whatever being and

348
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,960
then I see how it can shift and change in that time while I'm staring out the

349
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,720
window nice nice thank you

350
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:28,480
Elena okay okay thank you thank you all

351
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,319
