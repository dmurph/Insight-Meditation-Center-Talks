1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,200
good evening and welcome welcome everybody

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,859
nice to see you all

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:21,480
so when I first started a meditation practice number of years ago now I I so often had this idea like wow wow

4
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:32,660
everybody else must be like on the brink of Enlightenment or they're enlightened and I am so awful as a meditator

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,420
I remember the I actually learned how to meditate on a Meditation Retreat and it

6
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,640
was incomprehensible I just could not understand how come that person sitting

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:51,420
in front of me was still for 45 minutes I just didn't even like know how that was possible I was like in so much pain

8
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,940
and non-stop squirming and it was quite something

9
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:04,878
and I had this uh I was saying myself why did I ever think this was a good idea

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,360
but as I learned more and more about meditation you know it really touched me kind of like in my heart and some kind

11
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:19,799
of way that I couldn't even describe or explain something was pooling me

12
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:26,820
but I still couldn't do it very well and I couldn't sit still and my mind was all over the place

13
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,900
but it wasn't until I had been meditating for quite some time I remember precisely how long but for

14
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:41,460
quite some time before I ever heard of these things called the hindrances

15
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,680
and that was a game changer for me when I learned about this

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,159
some of you may be familiar with this it's a common teaching but for whatever reason maybe I was just absent on those

17
00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:00,420
days when they were being talked about I had never heard about them but it made such a big difference so

18
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:06,780
what are the hindrances these are something that the you know are um

19
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,300
preserved in the teachings from early Buddhism so it's attributed to the

20
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:20,220
Buddha so thousands of years ago people were talking about this same thing which

21
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:27,540
for me I'd love this idea like wow thousands of years ago they were talking about what I'm experiencing today

22
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:35,099
and that somehow you know makes it less personal right that countless numbers of people have had these same problems that

23
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:41,760
I'm having these same issues that I'm having so it kind of like normalized my

24
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,060
meditation experience and the difficulties

25
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:54,480
probably word is Never Enough which often gets translated as hindrances but we must we might also think of these as

26
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,800
obstructions or impediments or obstacles to the mind and bodily mind and body is

27
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,200
settling down things that are getting in the way from

28
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,680
settling down and they typically they have this list

29
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,260
of five these like all the things that ever happened to us while we're trying to

30
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:26,519
meditate they kind of like you know boiled it down to five there are other lists that um kind of are more fleshed

31
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:31,920
out than this list of five but I'm going to stick with this five

32
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,019
and I'm not going to talk about the hindrances themselves but I'll just

33
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:42,720
briefly mention them I'm going to talk more about our relationship to them and kind of

34
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,140
like flesh out what they are as a group and how we might work with them in different settings and our relationship

35
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:59,280
to them and what does it mean for us as meditators so what are these five hindrances

36
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,180
so the first two are about this sense of kind of like often we use this

37
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:14,939
expression or I use this expression of pushing or pulling so this pushing I don't want it get it

38
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:20,160
away from me pulling I want more of this please don't

39
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:27,479
leave pushing and pulling I guess pushing would be aversion and

40
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:34,320
pulling a sense desire typically they go in the other direction so it'd be pulling and pushing I guess since desire

41
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,259
and aversion the next two have to do with the amount

42
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:45,780
of energy that's present I think we all have this

43
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:52,259
experiment this experience that there's just too much energy and we just feel agitated and we can't fidget so it's

44
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:58,680
either with the body or with the mind that the mind is racing and trying to solve problems or kind of

45
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,720
like obsessively in a loop or something like this or just feeling like we have

46
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,180
to scratch or itch or shift or something so too much energy

47
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,220
restlessness or not enough energy

48
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,500
this odd expression sloth and torpor which these were never part of my

49
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:26,759
vocabulary before I started practicing Buddhism but that's the you know when there isn't enough energy kind

50
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,580
of like falling asleep or yeah I'll just falling asleep is a or

51
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:39,660
is it feeling like you're you know egoing in that direction and then the fifth one is actually one I

52
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:45,360
think is the most interesting I'm not going to talk a lot about it today I was thinking that maybe I'll do some Dharma

53
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,259
talks on it that it gets called doubt but it's really about vacillation or

54
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:58,740
hesitation okay well maybe I'm gonna sit and um I'll do some loving kindness practice I

55
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:04,500
thought that was good may you be happy but we maybe I should do some mindfulness practice because

56
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:10,259
this thing on my knee is bothering me it came looking at the well maybe I should do some concentration practice because I

57
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:16,979
heard that's really good no maybe I should do meta practice because that helps with the concentration practice I think I'm just going to go and defrost

58
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:24,419
the freezer you know is this thing kind of like you're just bouncing around and not really settling but it often has to

59
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:33,660
do with this what what should I be doing like what's the what's the right practice or does this really work this

60
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,699
practice do those teachers really know what they're talking about

61
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:45,600
how do we even know what the Buddha said you know these types of things so this is doubt kind of this vacillation or

62
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:53,940
this hesitation so these hindrances part of what um

63
00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:00,600
makes them so interesting I would say and Powerful to work with

64
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,759
is we notice them in our meditation practice when we're trying to settle

65
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,699
down when we've decided that we're going to meditate but they are there whether we are aware

66
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:17,100
of them or not they are there in all aspects of Our

67
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:25,020
Lives work any creative projects we'd like to do

68
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:33,120
any service projects we'd like to do volunteering and long-term relationships

69
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,060
these hindrances quote unquote don't just hinder the Mind settling into they

70
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:44,520
just get in the way if our doing what's important to us

71
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:53,120
they get in the way of our expressing our values in so many different ways

72
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,340
so there is one way that we might consider meditation practice sometimes I

73
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:04,680
like to lump things together so if you were to do like a big huge lumping together

74
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:12,860
we could say all of meditation practices of one of two kinds one is a really deep

75
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:18,000
meditative State very deep the other is you're working with the

76
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,960
entrances that's it like these are you could say these are like the two types of things because the hindrances are

77
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,940
always there unless we're in really deep meditative States

78
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:39,479
so in some way they are like seeds that uh you know Blossom or bloom or

79
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:45,240
grow and maybe what they are when they are growing they have like

80
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:52,800
these hooks that like to hang on to things or they're looking for things to hang on to

81
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,399
and then they then they kind of like fuel whatever it is they get connected to

82
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:06,360
for example a story that um I have is on this really long retreat

83
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:14,880
had it been in for months into the mind is really settled and I noticed but in this one sit in

84
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:20,100
particular there was like some of this uh desire there's like these fantasies you know now I don't remember what it

85
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:26,820
was but fantasies of something good right that I wanted maybe like a more comfortable uh cushion or you know

86
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:32,640
whatever it might be but then I noticed uh this you know like

87
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,760
oh okay this is just a hindrance the hindrance of desire there's a number of ways we can work with this and I was

88
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,920
working with it and the desire was kind of going away it was a baiting and the

89
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,140
mind was finally settling down and by the end of the meditation period I felt like oh

90
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:55,440
finally settle down a few okay feels good the Bell goes off at the end of the

91
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,500
session and uh I thought you know what I finally got settled I'm just gonna stay I don't

92
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:07,080
have to jump up right when the bell rings so I'm sitting and I'm sitting for you

93
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:13,320
know some minutes more then I decide okay it's time to get up

94
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,220
and it's uh lunch time so I'll go have lunch

95
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,459
and those of you about meditation Retreats know that's right it's just like a buffet line and I got your plates

96
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:31,980
and you serve yourself in the line so

97
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:38,459
I go to the dining hall wash my hands before get my plate and go up to

98
00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:44,700
whatever the first thing is oh my gosh this looks so good okay I'm gonna put some of this on wow oh my gosh this is

99
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:52,019
fantastic I'm gonna put this or maybe I should get two wow look at this they also have this I'm gonna get this I had

100
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:57,300
so much food on my plate there's like no way I was gonna be able to eat this

101
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:03,540
what I had seen is that the desire had just gotten a little bit more subtle and

102
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:10,380
I found this hook that when I went to lunch it just got expressed to just piling all the food I could onto this

103
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:17,519
one plate so there's this way that they get expressed and sometimes it's obvious

104
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,220
and sometimes it's really subtle

105
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:29,040
and that's a little bit what I want to talk about today is about how there's the hindrances it's not like they're

106
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,620
present or absent it's really definitely a spectrum

107
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:40,260
and there can be really obvious or really subtle and we can work with them

108
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:46,500
in all these different ways with the subtle and with the obvious end with the subtle

109
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:52,140
but how ever we work with them there's a way that we might consider and I'm

110
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:57,240
influenced by Rob burbella another Drama teacher wonderful Dharma teacher

111
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:04,380
and he describes hindrances as Hidden Treasures

112
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:11,040
Hidden Treasures and part of the reason why he says this is be this recognition that they are

113
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,700
showing up in our life all over a place wherever and that even if we go on a Meditation

114
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,760
Retreat and we're spending days weeks months on Retreat or if we just come to

115
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,700
a 45-minute sit or we do a day long whatever it is

116
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:36,000
if nothing happens during that meditation Endeavor except

117
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,440
working with desire working with ill will working with restlessness working with drowsiness like we feel like or we

118
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:50,639
have doubt like should I even be doing this I'm so awful at this if we if the mind and the body never

119
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,040
settle but we learn something about these

120
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,320
hindrances we learn our habits

121
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,360
the patterns of our minds patterns of our bodies

122
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:12,120
when we have a something we'd like to do and there's difficulties obstructions

123
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:19,260
obstacles that get in the way if the only thing we ever do is notice

124
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:27,600
oh yeah when there is desire I notice how my body leans forward and I'm just I

125
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,120
can't stop all these fantasies and they're colorful and provocative and

126
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:39,240
there's the mind is just doesn't ever want to come back it's just lost in fantasies and then I kind of forget what

127
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:45,120
it was I was trying to do if we have nothing but those experiences

128
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,879
but we've learned something about ourselves

129
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:57,920
those of that might be more transformative than having some settled meditations

130
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:06,420
that might be what really changes Our Lives because having a settled meditation is

131
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:14,880
pleasant and it helps us to see some of the more subtle things that are going on in our life but the subtle yeah subtle

132
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,500
Minds that are going to settle things that are going on in our minds but learning about the hindrances and

133
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,300
shifting our relationship to them

134
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:33,540
instead of like dang it this again shifting it to okay

135
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:40,860
this is what's here how can I work with it how can I be with it this is what's happening

136
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:47,160
um I might as well learn something I might as well practice some skills I

137
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:53,120
might as well see get curious about it

138
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,560
that can change your life

139
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,800
helps us like when we're having difficulties and difficult conversations somebody we love has a difficult

140
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:11,220
diagnosis and we notice like oh yeah I I don't want to hear that this is like the worst

141
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:17,779
thing I ever want to know but if we have know that how we

142
00:15:17,779 --> 00:15:23,160
the pattern of our reaction with aversion this helps us be present for

143
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,980
difficult things and this can change our life maybe we don't

144
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:34,760
shut down or yell back when our boss or a co-worker does something

145
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:42,180
untoward or whatever it might be so Rob Rebecca calls these hindrances as

146
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:49,740
Hidden Treasures and some and I actually really love this so is there a way that we can learn to

147
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:57,600
view them so that they lose their power so that they lose their Authority

148
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:05,220
they're still there they're still happening but maybe we're not as caught up in them maybe we're not believing

149
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:11,160
them the stories that they spin or we're not so swayed by the direction

150
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:19,199
that's that they're pointing to you so they still show up maybe as seeds but

151
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:26,240
maybe the blooming and the blossoming isn't quite as much maybe they're just plants

152
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,760
instead of seeds so one thing

153
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:39,600
that can help with this is to get a little bit curious when like I

154
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:47,000
hit either when hindrance is really evident or maybe just more

155
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:54,120
objectively to notice or get curious about the hindrances are a spectrum

156
00:16:54,120 --> 00:17:00,899
I say this is a really obvious or really subtle so it's not that they're simply present

157
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:06,780
or not present so there's a way when they're present we

158
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:15,839
can sometimes feel a little bit demoralized or dejected or like oh again all this desire I'm always I learned of

159
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:22,918
when I I noticed sorry when I started my meditation practice I discovered how much desire has such a role in my life

160
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:30,660
I'm always thinking about things I'm going to buy I'm thinking about things that I want or you know all these things that I

161
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:38,580
want that I don't have but if we notice that they are a

162
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:44,280
spectrum then we can start to rather it just being they're there or not we can

163
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:49,919
notice like oh okay it's there's desire here but maybe

164
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,679
there's also a little bit of settledness it's we're not completely consumed by

165
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,900
the desire or maybe there is a time when we are

166
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:08,880
pretty settled maybe maybe more than usual and yet we

167
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,460
could start to sense like oh there's this wish for even more settledness

168
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:21,600
so to notice that oh yeah even though the more obvious type isn't there there might be the more subtle type of Desire

169
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,720
that is there and so maybe we can work with it and I'll talk about how to work with some of

170
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:34,940
the hindrances here in a moment but I also I want to start by talking about

171
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:40,160
Spectrum in regards to energy

172
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:48,179
because one is one of the hindrances is restlessness

173
00:18:48,179 --> 00:18:56,760
and it turns out that the Buddha he actually talked about in some of these not as well-known suit does and not so

174
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:03,120
well-known lists those of you have been around the Buddhist scene no there's a so many lists

175
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:10,740
there's different uh levels of intensity of this too much energy so one is what

176
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:16,140
typically is called the hindrance which may be described as agitation or

177
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:22,740
excitement or distraction or this like flurry this sense of

178
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,960
agitation you're like this busyness

179
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:37,740
and so this could be in the in the body it's like this energies pulsing through and there's like this sense to fidget

180
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:42,860
but there's also like this agitated uh

181
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,960
vulnerability like as if we've had too much caffeine

182
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:55,200
so it could be in the body but it can also show up in the mind as this scattered or persistent thinking

183
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:01,440
can't quite settle down or just this inability to focus or the mind just

184
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:08,659
resists being directed anywhere it's just doing what whatever it wants to do

185
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:16,440
so that's one type of like too much energy this what we typically call the hindrance

186
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:22,740
but then the Buddha also talked about like this excessive efforting

187
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,140
that is like a little bit too much exertion in the practice

188
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:33,360
there's a certain amount of settledness but there's a straining

189
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,400
there is this I definitely have to do more I need more or I want more or I'm

190
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,440
just trying so hard and there's a way that this can make things feel really

191
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:51,539
tight like I I gotta get this and pulley this is a turreta Viria

192
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:59,700
and I love that uh there's this very simple simile that's offered that is of

193
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:05,580
a person that holds a quail you know these cute little birds

194
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:10,860
we have the California quail I just love them they're just adorable for those of you who know them the way that they walk

195
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:16,140
with these little things on their heads they're just adorable I just love them I just saw some baby quail the other day

196
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:24,179
it was just anyway so if you're going to uh hold a quail and if you hold it too

197
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:30,600
tightly you can crush it so in the same way if we hold our

198
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:36,120
practice the effort too tightly it crushes it and then it just this

199
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,220
straining so that's another type of maybe too much

200
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:46,159
energies kind of gets translated into too much effort

201
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:54,000
but then there's this even more subtle type is this often the Derma teachers

202
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,900
call this drifting so I haven't seen this anywhere in any Buddhist text this is something that

203
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:07,620
Dharma teachers have come up with but I find it's a good description and can be

204
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:13,200
helpful and this is when the mind is settled

205
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:19,980
feathers it's not agitated it's settled but there's a way that it just kind of

206
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:26,820
like slides from one object to the next

207
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:33,240
and then goes to the next so it's not that it's sluggish it's just kind of

208
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:39,840
moving slowly so it doesn't have this quality of agitation but it also doesn't

209
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:44,880
have the quality of just staying with the object instead maybe it's like

210
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:52,280
oh the sensation in my knee breath thinking about dinner

211
00:22:52,280 --> 00:23:01,080
breath other knee but there's a way that it's like um sometimes gets described as um

212
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:06,120
well maybe slow motion like a monkey that swings from One Tree to the next

213
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:11,640
but slowly so they have one thing but they're already reaching for the next and let go

214
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:19,020
and then grab the next and then let go and then grab the next so this drifting quality this is really

215
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:24,120
so the mind is settled but there's a way in which

216
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:31,860
the mind doesn't quite land so there's this tendency for it to drift off off

217
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:38,640
the object or the subject that's being it's looking at so they're just a

218
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,740
bit more thoughts and images in the mind than there would be if the Mind were

219
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:50,159
more settled and then maybe a fourth layer

220
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:56,520
maybe even more subtle is let's say okay the mind has settled

221
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:03,179
on this object and there's this it's just right here with the object I'll just say the breath sensation of the

222
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:09,059
breath just noticing the breath just being with the breath noticing the breath

223
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:16,740
and they're like wow the mind isn't thinking oh that's actually thinking but

224
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:22,500
because we didn't notice it it's just doesn't get really seen so there's this way in which there's

225
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:29,520
this subtle way in which thoughts kind of like intrude and like like whoa It's so still and you know

226
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:37,220
that happens we're over here as I thought and then coming back that's also a little bit more energy

227
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:45,659
so then I just want to share a little bit because energy is something it turns out that this is definitely the art of

228
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:51,179
practice I would say is working with these different levels of energy

229
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:57,900
too much or too little and to recognize that they're a spectrum and so we have a

230
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:05,159
those were going from the most energetic to most subtle form a little bit too much

231
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:10,860
energy and then if you don't have any energy at all the most obvious form is

232
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:18,020
when you're about to fall asleep is of course is not an uncommon thing with meditators

233
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:24,360
and this is you know where the body feels heavy and lethargic and weary and

234
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:30,740
the mind is dull and cloudy and sluggish

235
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:39,059
and when it's strong we don't even know it's there we're just you know doing this thing or you know this thing nodding off

236
00:25:39,059 --> 00:25:44,220
and this being a hindrance is distinct from physical tiredness or mental

237
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:49,559
tiredness so it's not that there isn't any energy

238
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:54,720
available it's that we're not accessing it

239
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,659
so there's a way in which there's a choosing not to access it

240
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:06,659
choosing maybe is too strong a word but often this is due to a sense of

241
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:11,760
resistance like like we don't actually want to be present for what's there so

242
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:18,480
there's a type of shutting down or this discouragement or this hopelessness or

243
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:24,059
frustration or boredom so when these things are present there's

244
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:30,559
a way in which they're kind of the whole energy just kind of drains out

245
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:38,700
so that's like the obvious form that's the most obvious but there's also a more subtle form

246
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:45,659
which uh the Buddha called atalina Viria and this is when there's not enough

247
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:51,240
effort it's a certain amount of complacency so

248
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,700
the simile is like the same as with the quail holding the quail instead of too tight

249
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:06,860
now it's too loose and the quail just flies away so like okay yeah I'm with the object

250
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:13,020
but not with a lot of energy and so it just kind of goes like this

251
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:18,840
the mind kind of drifts away and then maybe comes back a little bit and then

252
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:24,779
drifts away so this kind of deficiency of effort

253
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:33,860
maybe I'd say this like coming back there isn't a lot of emphasis on coming back to the to the object

254
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:40,080
there's also another type of way in which this shows up and this is as

255
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:46,200
inertia so just this way is the just kind of

256
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:51,960
like letting the momentum of practice unfold but then the momentum Runs Out

257
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:59,220
and then we just do whatever our habits are whatever our patterns are

258
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:05,700
just show up when the there's this kind of inertia like and it's not uncommon to like we'll sit

259
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:12,659
down on the especially long time meditators to sit on the cushion and just do what they've been doing for the

260
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:20,279
past five or ten years and they not really a sense of freshness or brightness or curiosity

261
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:26,100
okay look at this energy yeah this is what I do in the morning I sit

262
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:34,100
without a sense of it going somewhere or wanting it to be a support for one's life

263
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:41,220
and then even a more subtle version of that is what we call sinking mind

264
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,980
s this again is not anything that you'll find in any Buddhist teachings but something that Dharma teachers talk

265
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:52,740
about and I was so happy when I learned about this because come to find out I used to spend

266
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,960
a lot of time doing this unknowingly

267
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:04,140
it's a way in which there's a the mind is settled the body is settled and it's

268
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:10,279
in this nice cushy comfy cottony

269
00:29:10,279 --> 00:29:17,039
fluffy dull space so it feels like you know the outside

270
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:24,200
world is a little bit away but this feels like um

271
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:32,039
like it starts off maybe feeling nice because there's there's aren't

272
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:37,320
things bothering you but there's a way in which the energy is

273
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:42,779
always just slowly draining and there's something about by the end

274
00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:50,940
of this sit I feel awful you feel like oh I'm so tired and the world is meaningless and I

275
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:59,960
kind of hate everything and beautifully resistant there's a just draining out of the area so it starts as being comfy

276
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:06,419
secluded but then it doesn't it ends up feeling kind of awful

277
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:12,000
and it takes some real effort to get out of this and this can be a habit for a lot of people they just get into this

278
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,299
comfy cottony fluffy puffy I don't really know how to

279
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:23,760
describe it place and stay there and stay there and stay there and I think

280
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,899
that this is their practice this is a good practice and some way it is but they don't have a brightness to their

281
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:37,100
mind there isn't some uplift or some clarity or

282
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:45,659
Vitality instead that maybe that's a good way to describe it you're in this comfy fluffy place but the Vitality is

283
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:52,100
draining out and you you end up with no vitality and that's not a good feeling

284
00:30:54,419 --> 00:31:00,659
so there's all these different ways in which the hindrances show up I was just talking about energy levels you know to

285
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:06,899
the most obvious to the most subtle but then of course we want to work with them

286
00:31:06,899 --> 00:31:12,419
like what do we do with them and here's something that I think is maybe helpful

287
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:18,260
to consider how we respond to the hindrances

288
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:25,440
depends what kind of practice we're doing and what we are what Our intention is for that

289
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,200
meditation period more specifically

290
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,860
if you're doing mindfulness practice you'll work with them in one way if you're doing concentration practice

291
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:43,020
you'll work with them in a different way you might ask well what's the difference

292
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:49,799
between mindfulness and concentration and I guess I I can describe this in the

293
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:54,960
as a along with a description like how one would work with them in the mindfulness

294
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:02,760
practice so mindfulness practice is a practice of noticing what's actually happening here

295
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:07,860
in the present moment and we often do that by starting with

296
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:14,399
being mindful of the breath but we're mindful of the sensations of breathing like noticing how does an inhale feel

297
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:21,179
how does an exhale feel how do the transitions be between inhales and exhales when I'm doing guided

298
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:26,399
meditations for mindfulness of breathing I'll include like noticing some of the

299
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:33,120
changing aspects of the breath and then

300
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:40,760
when the Mind Set a little bit we'll turn to what's compelling discomfort in the body

301
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:47,159
emotional states lots of thoughts sounds whatever it is so mindfulness of the

302
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:52,200
breath something's compelling we turn over here and we're doing mindfulness I'll just

303
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:58,980
make this a pain in the OR discomfort in the knee when that's no longer compelling we come back to the breath

304
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:05,820
oh there's the sound the dog's barking then we come back to the breath so that's more mindfulness and so when

305
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:12,240
things are hindrances come up Ouija that's just one more thing here's the breath oh here's the sensation of

306
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:19,740
too much energy feel into that be with that and so it's no longer an obstacle to

307
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:26,220
mindfulness it's the object of mindfulness and then you're just being mindful you have to be mindfulness of

308
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:34,620
too much energy but it mindfulness is mindfulness however with concentration practices

309
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:41,460
we want to be a little bit more proactive with the hindrances and not just be aware of them

310
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:50,658
but to apply what we might say are antidotes like waste what are things that we can do to work with the energy

311
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:57,120
and so one way one thing that we can do is

312
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:04,019
if we feel like there's too much energy we can shift our practice to start doing

313
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:10,080
body scans going from the head down to the toes this gives the mind of something a

314
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:17,280
little bit extra to do and it's a way that rather than trying to keep something you know in one place you can

315
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:24,300
you know it goes Sensations in the head and shoulders back chest belly Sensations on the seat

316
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:32,000
Etc so giving something the mind to do is a little bit easier for a Restless mind

317
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,858
something else you might do with concentration but you wouldn't do with mindfulness

318
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:44,240
is to extend the exhale just a little bit

319
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:52,020
just the way the human physiology is the extended exhales are calming

320
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:57,560
it's kind of sometimes where we go ah right this guy is a habit but to just

321
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,580
intentionally just very simply extend the exhales a little bit and that might

322
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:09,780
be a way in which you can work with too much energy another way is to just find a way of

323
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:16,200
breathing that feels soothing and this might mean bringing in a little

324
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:21,839
bit of an imagination something that I've heard a Dharma

325
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:29,160
teacher say is that maybe as if when the mind is quiet pretty settled

326
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:35,940
but there's still some restlessness so it's settled enough that you can notice the feeling of breathing in your back

327
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:41,640
you like the or uh the muscles between our ribs move a

328
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:48,780
little bit when we breathe and including the ribs in the back when the mind is quiet you can like feel that

329
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:55,380
and you just might you know imagine like it's maybe like somebody that's like uh it's like stroking your back in a way

330
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:01,440
like a loved one like when we you know we do this like with kids or people that we love we stroke their back

331
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,660
just might notice or like have the breath of this maybe sensation of like

332
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:13,200
somebody is like soothing touching your back and that can be a way also with

333
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:20,040
restlessness bringing in a little bit of imagination that's still connected to the sensations of breathing and so we

334
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:27,900
would apply these antidotes just as a way to kind of help the restlessness settle and when that restlessness has

335
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:33,180
stopped or settled more then we can come back to more conventional concentration

336
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:38,700
practices so that's one way to be with the too

337
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:44,220
much energy if you're doing concentration practices but what if you're doing

338
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:49,560
you have too little energy and you want to be doing concentration practices it

339
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:57,119
turns out doing body scans is another way to do it if you're with the breath to shift to body scans so body scans

340
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,960
work with both too much energy and too little energy and part of what can be

341
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:10,619
the difference is the rate at which you're kind of like doing the scan can help bring the energy up or bring the

342
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:18,300
energy down for uh to bring up the energy actually

343
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:23,700
longer inhales just a little bit you know like just I'm not talking about

344
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:30,599
super long ones but just a tiny bit longer that kind of like brings up kind of like

345
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:36,300
energize the system energize the body and the mind

346
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:42,720
or something else same we might do if there's just not enough energy

347
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,119
if we're doing concentration practices is there's a way in which we can open

348
00:37:48,119 --> 00:37:52,760
our awareness really wide

349
00:37:55,260 --> 00:38:02,940
now this is hard to describe if you don't have experience with this but maybe in the same way that if we're

350
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:08,880
going to do mindfulness of sounds we kind of like open up and but like we're

351
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:16,079
listening to sounds that are in different places to open up the awareness to be really

352
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:22,200
big this is something you'll just have to play with it's hard to describe but

353
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:28,740
because when we're really tired have you noticed this that there's kind of this collapsing right and we're just kind of

354
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:35,240
there's or just this dark little experience

355
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:40,859
often with my body too like I can't help myself I there's this with the body is

356
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:45,900
leaning forward but if you want to bring in more energy to bring up the posture

357
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:51,599
and have the awareness be really big just something to play around and

358
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:54,200
explore with

359
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:03,140
wow so there's I'm saying well because I'm looking at the time

360
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:10,020
there's a lot I can say here but maybe I want to point to a few things I talked

361
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:15,359
about how the hindrances can really be working with them or even being aware of

362
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:20,700
them can really be a support for our life and part of that is

363
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:25,859
like shifting our relationship to them one way to shift relationships talk

364
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:32,760
about how or acknowledge that there it's a wide range obvious and subtle

365
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:39,540
and we can work with them with mindfulness or with concentration

366
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:44,760
with mindfulness what we learn about the hindrances as we're making it a

367
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:52,980
meditation object we can bring into our daily life some of the things I talked about for concentration we wouldn't necessarily

368
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:58,680
but there's something also to notice

369
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:06,180
that shows up as a hindrance which sometimes we don't even consider it as a hindrance in our meditation practice

370
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:13,920
that no matter what degree of settledness or collectedness we have

371
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,460
let's say that we we feel pretty good like okay yeah it feels okay

372
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:27,140
and then there's this way it says yeah but it was better that other time

373
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:36,300
so there's this way in which there's this little negativity that uh shows up

374
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,460
and I love the way that Rob Barbay describes this this he calls this this a

375
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:47,700
micro negativity this habit of the Mind and described it he has this simile it

376
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:55,260
says as if you were a Potter and you're throwing

377
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:00,780
I don't actually know what the crate words words for this but there's a potter's wheel the wheel's spinning and

378
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:06,480
you have a lump of clay in the middle and you want to make something you know like a bell or a vase or cut purple or

379
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:12,420
something so you're working with your hands and if there's just this little

380
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:19,140
negativity yeah it was better before this is so this is pretty good but

381
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:25,200
that's like a little bit of pressure and then the pressure gets put on the on

382
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:33,480
the this piece of clay and it starts the shape starts to change because there's just this slight pressure

383
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:39,839
so it's really subtle but it really starts to change the experience the

384
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:50,339
bear would change what's being made so is there a way that we can notice that

385
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:56,880
this feeling of yes it was better and then maybe do a little bit of a

386
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:04,200
course correction and lean into any sense of well-being

387
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:09,480
any sense of contentment any sense of

388
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:17,660
pleasure any sense of happiness and just attune to that

389
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:23,579
attuned to any sense of okayness

390
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:29,520
because also that will shape but it's less of a pressure and a more of

391
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:38,220
allowing and so I don't know if this analogy really works so it will but I will say that

392
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:45,119
tuning into any sense of well-being even if it's not your predominant experience even if it's just a portion of your

393
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,940
experience it turns out that it's always a Way

394
00:42:50,940 --> 00:43:00,300
Forward to tune into a sense of well-being okayness happiness contentment is always

395
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:07,260
a way forward in meditation practice tuning into what's not okay and kind of

396
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:14,280
awful turns out to be a dead end we have to discover this for ourselves I

397
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:21,660
mean I'm telling you this right but it's not until you go down that dead end 100 quadrillion bazillion times that you

398
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:28,440
start to really believe it but I just want to maybe offer this encouragement

399
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,720
sometimes we feel like meditation practice is this dull dreary thing we're

400
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:41,460
supposed to do and to be sure sometimes it is hard sometimes we come in contact with a lot

401
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:46,619
of difficulties difficulties arise and it's decidedly unpleasant and sometimes

402
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:52,560
awful so meditation practice has that those

403
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:58,200
experiences but even if we could

404
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:04,440
have a sense of any sense of okayness like oh yeah this really is awful I wish

405
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:10,560
it weren't like this but if there's any sense of but it is like this

406
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:16,680
not so it is like this and if we can attune to any sense of

407
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,660
okayness That's the Way Forward

408
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,220
so then maybe I'll end with this

409
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:34,800
maybe an encouragement that these hindrances they have this

410
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:41,880
wide range and there's different ways to work with them and to you know notice the obvious and

411
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:49,640
the subtle one way is to not take them personally

412
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:57,078
they've been described for thousands of years this is what human beings do

413
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:03,060
three human being does this is what it means to be human

414
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:08,099
is to be pushing and pulling and too much energy not enough energy or be

415
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:13,319
unsure and have vacillation we tend to make up stories because this

416
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:19,440
is happening I'm a bad meditator but because it's happening it just means you're human

417
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,079
all it means so is there a way that we can shift our

418
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:30,480
relationship to the hindrances like oh yep okay here it is but the hindrance

419
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,420
has this flavor at this time but this is just what's happening

420
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:42,720
and can we attune to that Yep this is just what's happening that sentiment and

421
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:50,640
that'll be part of the way forward okay so I did a lot of talking there

422
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:57,780
sometimes I talk less for these Monday nights but appreciate your attention

423
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:02,060
and I'll end there thank you

424
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:10,980
so we're at the top of the hour so I won't open it up to questions and answers in general but if you like I'm

425
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:18,720
more than happy to answer some if you'd like to come up here and talk to me otherwise I wish you a nice evening and

426
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,520
safe travels home thank you
