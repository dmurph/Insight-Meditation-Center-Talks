1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,880
warm greetings from insight meditation center here in redwood city

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,800
and uh greetings to all of you from all the different corners of the world

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,320
where you're listening and watching in

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,039
so one of the things to become wise about in

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,079
meditation is the nature of our thinking

6
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:41,360
and people struggle with thinking and in meditation sometimes

7
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,600
the struggle is unnecessary however at the same time it's important to

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:55,360
overcome the tendency to get lost in thought and or be preoccupied in their thinking

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:02,800
and so one way to uh to overcome that without struggling with it

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,479
excuse me is to become wiser about our thinking

11
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,520
and take some time to understand something of it and for this meditation

12
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,920
if you do find yourself thinking during the meditation i suggest you notice

13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,080
whether you're thinking about something other than what has to do with here and now

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,560
if you're thinking about something different than the meditation itself what's happening for you as you meditate

15
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:42,240
if you're thinking about work or home life or conversations with

16
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,119
friends or relatives or companions or strangers if you're planning vacations or if

17
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,799
you're remembering something in the past whatever if the mind is involved in something

18
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:02,560
that's other than here and now recognize that clearly and the way to recognize it clearly

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,920
is to rather than noting it or being aware of it as thinking

20
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,440
maybe just say the word other that's short for thinking about other

21
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,959
things and then to really take stock and understand how much the

22
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,040
mind is thinking about other things that that are not about here

23
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,280
it becomes a little bit of an alienation or a little bit of a abandonment of oneself

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:37,840
here and now it's choosing to go into a realm

25
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,200
of thought that limits your ability to

26
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:49,599
really delve into deeply your lived experience in the moment to

27
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,879
settle in it to wake up in it to really be

28
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:01,840
intimate with this time right here so say the word other

29
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,000
and then

30
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,040
if you say the word other i just didn't recognize when that's the case and then

31
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,800
come back to here come back to here

32
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,760
and do so gently if you find yourself thinking about the meditation

33
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,879
maybe continue to do that maybe even use the word here for that

34
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:37,040
but see if you can adjust how you think so it's only friendly and kind and

35
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,799
supportive calm settled at ease

36
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,840
just kind of like as a gentle friend gentle supporters accompanying the experience

37
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:57,120
recognizing the experience being with the experience where that thinking about here

38
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,720
becomes less important there's not a strong pull into it but it's you're not letting go of it

39
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,080
entirely just calmly maybe almost like a whisper in the mind

40
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:15,239
kind of adjusting it to support you to be here be here

41
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,400
so as so

42
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,800
entering into a meditation posture

43
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,240
maybe from the inside out feel yourself adjusting yourself into

44
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,400
the posture if you're sitting upright is there some way that from the inside

45
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:46,800
out you can sit up a little straighter or sit with a little bit more open chest

46
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,520
relaxed way with the shoulders a little bit

47
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,720
rolling backwards

48
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,199
and then

49
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:11,360
relaxing your gaze and if it's comfortable to close your

50
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,599
eyes

51
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,320
and then gently relaxedly

52
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,320
as a way of beginning to attune your attention

53
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:39,600
to your lived experience take some long slow deep breaths

54
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,840
maybe three quarters full just full enough that you don't get winded or stressed

55
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,720
stressed by it

56
00:05:51,680 --> 00:06:00,319
and this continuing as a way of attuning your attention to your lived experience in your body

57
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,039
breathe out a little bit more fully than usual but make sure that your attention is

58
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:14,000
accompanying it you follow along with the exhale

59
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,759
deep inhale and follow along with your attention

60
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,680
long exhale and have your attention accompany the exhale

61
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:44,159
as you exhale with the release and letting go

62
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:51,360
let's see if you can relax any tension in your attention

63
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:57,759
any pushing or striving or tightness

64
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:04,319
and attention that accompanies your breathing

65
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,440
and if you're a little bit too complacent or hesitant or

66
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,440
resistant to meditation attention

67
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:28,319
as you inhale awaken

68
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:35,360
in attunement to breathing a being

69
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,160
connected

70
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,879
perhaps even a little bit of diligence

71
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,560
in your accompaniment of breathing

72
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:06,560
and then continue to accompany your breathing let your breathing return to normal

73
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,479
and on the periphery of your awareness with the center being with your

74
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:23,919
breathing as you exhale relax your body

75
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:30,120
forever can soften or release

76
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,399
and then settling into your breathing

77
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:09,839
and as you're settling and focusing on breathing on your present moment experience

78
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,399
if you find yourself thinking a lot preoccupied in thought

79
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,880
recognize whether you're thinking about the meditation

80
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,839
here and now your present moment experience or anything other

81
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:36,399
and if it is other name it as other recognize it as oh this is involved in

82
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,800
other things not here

83
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,360
and then come back to the intimacy and the

84
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,600
realness of here and now

85
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,600
and if you're thinking about meditation

86
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,360
see if you can calm your thinking down

87
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,079
think calmly about it

88
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,440
and if thinking is in the background and you're not preoccupied with it

89
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:34,240
it doesn't interfere with your being with your breathing then no need to concern yourself with

90
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,440
your think thinking just continue with the meditation

91
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:30,399
recognizing other when you're thinking about other things

92
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,279
and then recognizing it maybe notice

93
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,639
the way that it is a disconnection

94
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:49,399
with the experience here and now

95
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,240
say other to yourself and then reconnect

96
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:05,720
to the embodied experience of the present moment breathing

97
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,039
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

98
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:24,200
there's a way in which a lot of thinking about other things and other places other people

99
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,880
limits our ability to

100
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,640
love or to care to be kind

101
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:43,760
and there's a way in which being centered in ourselves intimate

102
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:49,120
calm gives us access

103
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:56,320
to love to care to kindness as the situation

104
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,039
calls on it

105
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:12,240
and with whatever ways in which we're centered in ourselves at ease in ourselves

106
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,279
that we can in fact then

107
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,799
not so much think about others

108
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:29,440
but have our hearts open and directed towards others

109
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,640
to care about others coming from being centered

110
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,919
here not toppling over

111
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,480
with a lot of head concerns thoughts and stories

112
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,279
to center ourselves deeply and well here and then find ourselves being turned

113
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:03,120
inside out so that we

114
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:10,480
our hearts now can touch and be touched by the world

115
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:16,960
and may it be that our ability to be centered and grounded and intimate with our direct

116
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:24,320
experience becomes the source from which

117
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:32,240
we care for this world and live in some way

118
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:38,559
for the benefit and welfare of others may from this meditation practice we've

119
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:44,080
done today may the goodness of the practice spread

120
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:52,480
outwards from here out into the world may all beings be happy

121
00:28:52,720 --> 00:29:01,278
may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

122
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:08,080
may all beings be free and may we

123
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,880
contribute to that

124
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:27,479
[Music]

125
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:41,840
so again good day and before i give this talk

126
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:48,640
i want to mention my gratitude for all of you who donated

127
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:55,360
to our haiti fund efforts to support the people of haiti

128
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,640
passing on the donation to partners in health and to me it was phenomenal

129
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,559
how much was able to be raised this way as a

130
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:12,080
community we raised last count i heard thirty thousand dollars

131
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,480
and that that was a count a week ago i think there's something still coming in that's designated for that purpose

132
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:25,760
and we had the full accounting uh some beginning of the month but uh all the money that was donated

133
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:32,559
for that purpose will go to um partners in health so thank you very much it was inspiring

134
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:38,080
that that's enough money to i believe to make a big difference for some people

135
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:44,000
in the country of haiti and partners of health goes into the countryside and all kinds of places

136
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:51,840
where often people are forgotten and works with local medical care people and

137
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,519
so very locally focused so

138
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:04,720
thank you so today's topic on patients has to do

139
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:12,880
with patients under insult

140
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,399
and so this is any circumstance where

141
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:24,799
the tendency is to get angry or agitated or maybe

142
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,840
so afraid that we become impatient in a hurry

143
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:35,120
but especially in the tradition in buddhist tradition it has to do with situations where we get angry annoyed

144
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,240
irritated furious and it could be with other people

145
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:47,200
it could also be have to do with events in the world it could be that you are angry with your

146
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:52,880
computer because it's not behaving right or or it could be the weather is irritating

147
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,760
because it's not what you planned it for plan planned it to be

148
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:03,760
and um and so here uh the word patience

149
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:09,440
patience under insult patients under assault

150
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,960
is might be interpreted as a kind of tolerance

151
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:24,080
tolerance of people being unkind saying mean things doing things which are provoking

152
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,480
tolerance with all kinds of things but tolerance is not really the

153
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,840
orientation because intolerance is a focus outwards to the other to the thing

154
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:42,080
out there buddhist practice kind of the beginning point not the end but where it kind of

155
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:49,519
more often begins is not the other but here with us what's going on here

156
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:57,679
and so rather than tolerating insult patients under insult means that

157
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:04,640
maybe even a kind of intolerance an intolerance for us

158
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,000
inside diminishing us or causing suffering to

159
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,039
ourselves harming ourselves and

160
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:20,480
and so to kind of an intolerance no i don't want to harm myself and the particular way that the

161
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:27,120
tradition emphasizes that is through being angry so rather than tolerating

162
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,880
injustice in the world that's a whole other topic of what a relationship is to injustice things that

163
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,960
are wrong things that make us angry upset that's an important topic but but the

164
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:46,240
the core aspect of the patients under insult is that we don't allow ourselves

165
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,360
to succumb to anger and a particular kind of anger because

166
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,640
in english sometimes the word anger covers a wider span than what

167
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:03,200
classically in buddhism is considered to be angry the anger in buddhism is always

168
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,480
connected to hostility malice

169
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:13,760
there's always a so if you can have it be angry but there's no hostility then

170
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,358
it isn't what buddhists call angry anger so you have to kind of understand you know translate between

171
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:24,560
languages here when you hear buddhists talk about anger it's always implies that there's some

172
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,638
hostility involved in the motivation in the in the fury and the fire

173
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,320
but hostility that we have towards others always hurts the hustle always

174
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,398
hurts us it harms us and it's hard to see that when

175
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:49,398
the focus is on the other excuse me for a minute

176
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:58,640
so it's hard to see that when the focus is on others it can actually be a kind of pleasure even sometimes to be really

177
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:05,520
focused and angry and directed you know one pointedly on the on someplace else

178
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:11,440
if he can feel very alive or feel energizing it can feel some people feel so powerful that way

179
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,960
and they enjoy the power so but when but when we can stop

180
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,079
focusing on the other and what it feels like to be othering and directing

181
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,920
and feel the in intimately what's happening for us come back and being centered here

182
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,440
then hostility always harms ourselves and we don't want to harm ourselves and

183
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:40,320
buddhist practice as i say kind of always begins with ourselves it doesn't end there it ends with caring

184
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,640
for the world but we have more to if we can care for ourselves properly we have more to offer

185
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,320
the world we're safer for the world we're not going to make so he liable to make quick

186
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,880
mistakes in what we do and so um so there so sometimes we talk

187
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,320
about this patience under insult as a practice of restraint

188
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,599
uh not giving in to the anger and um and that's maybe the first kind

189
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:16,079
of line of uh action here so you know so if

190
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:21,119
buddhism likes to divide human activities into body speech and mind

191
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:28,079
with the understanding and maybe you don't share this understanding that the coarsest is what we do physically

192
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,520
with our body and that we have more we can see it it's visible and we can have a little bit

193
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,119
more control over it and so to be restrained

194
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:45,200
in harming people with our bodies and that can be with glares that can be

195
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,520
with um you know gestures and then um

196
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:57,520
and then the second which is a little bit harder maybe a lot harder mindful speech is harder is to be restrained

197
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,040
from causing harm through uh speech

198
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,640
and so if we feel angry start becoming very very careful with speech and don't

199
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,480
cross the line to speak in ways that then is expressed as hostility

200
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,680
wait if you can if it's appropriate to wait to calm down

201
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,880
don't necessarily leave the situation and don't address what's going on but

202
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:31,680
hold back until you feel you can do so without hostility you'll be much wiser that way and more

203
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:38,560
effective uh in the especially in the long term hostility is effective in the short term

204
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:44,240
because it frightens people and people pull away or they stop what they're doing and so there's a kind of reward into

205
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,680
being hostile but the long-term consequences in human relationships is not good

206
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:55,040
and that can actually be more harmful for you socially in the long term than

207
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:00,720
in the short term so to be restrained in speech and then the more subtle but the more

208
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,760
important area for buddhist practice practice is to be really careful with your

209
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:12,400
thoughts and if your thoughts are mean thoughts are hostile be very careful with that

210
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,000
and hold back restrain yourself from giving into those don't succumb to them

211
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,920
and this act of restraint is an act of strength it's not an act of repression

212
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,280
but it is an act of protecting yourself

213
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:36,320
from yourself the impact of actions that harm others

214
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,920
the impact of speech that our mothers on oneself is actually quite big

215
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:48,000
and the buddhist tradition kind of suggests that we don't really recognize how big it is because it has this karmic

216
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,800
impact it affects deeper conditioning the deeper subconscious workings of the mind the memories how things are

217
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:01,839
remembered how things are uh return in the future time in a way that's unexpected

218
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,920
and so but it's huge so

219
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,760
how to be restrained how to hold back in a way that is not repression

220
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:20,480
is not but really is for our own good and one of them is by really recognizing

221
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:27,119
the difference of othering having the mind concerns being directed towards others

222
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,560
others have to be different others have to do things certain way others have have wronged me

223
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,599
and of course it's accurate sometimes that kind of thinking but to be

224
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,760
preoccupied with that and caught in that is an alienation is a loss to ourselves

225
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:50,800
and as we're not grounded on ourselves and focusing externally that's when hostility can slip out

226
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,240
because we're not in we're not following ourselves mindful and careful what's going on here

227
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,440
and so to learn in meditation to not spend a lot of time thinking

228
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:09,280
other than thoughts recognizing it as othering and become skilled at not going down those channels

229
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:16,560
and coming back here is a training for in life to be patient under insult

230
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:22,800
to learn to recognize what's happening here and focusing him being careful attentive

231
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,839
and being so attentive that you're there with yourself at those choice moments

232
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:35,119
about what you're going to do with your body what you're going to do with your voice

233
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:41,040
and even what you're going to do with your trains of thought you're right there and that's where you

234
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,400
relax that's where you let go that's where you settle back

235
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,440
and if necessary so you don't cause harm that's where you practice restraint

236
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,880
maybe just you know clamp your mouth shut if it necessary you know

237
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,240
bite your tongue so you don't say something that you later regret and

238
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:09,680
restraint is the right action when the alternative is worse

239
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,960
and but through practice we can do better than restraint we can let go we can stay

240
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,960
close to that place where we're free we're not caught in these movements we have

241
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:28,800
we might still feel angry we might feel hostile but there's no tendency to pick it up no

242
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,960
tendency to go with it to do anything it has no power over us even though it might bubble up

243
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:41,599
and where the power is is in ourselves in our ability to be mindful attentive centered

244
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:49,920
and have choice about how we work with all the inner impulses that come along

245
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,000
and as we live that way then we start having wisdom and clarity

246
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:01,119
about how to interact with others how to have the difficult conversations

247
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:06,480
how to show up in ways that um don't frighten others but also

248
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,880
don't lead to retaliation or or difficult dynamics where you know

249
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:18,400
anger is meeting anger and it flares up even more

250
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,240
and um and then finally maybe i shouldn't say this as a

251
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:30,560
punctuation for this talk but just so you don't take

252
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:37,839
i want you to take what i said seriously but maybe you know not not to hold it up too idealistically

253
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:44,040
and that is that sometimes

254
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:53,440
you know the way to irritate someone who is being hostile to you or irritates someone as being a

255
00:42:53,440 --> 00:43:00,319
problem for you is um not returning irritation and kind and

256
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:05,520
not getting angry in return staying calm staying non-reactive

257
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:12,560
staying kind of uh un concerned with what's coming or something staying free

258
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:18,160
and um and sometimes that little reward knowing oh i got to that person the person you

259
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:23,760
know is frustrated now irritated maybe it's not the healthiest thing to do but

260
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:32,160
maybe it kind of can inspire you to find your way to healthy patients under insult

261
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:40,960
so thank you very much and and if you have opportunities the next

262
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:47,280
24 hours where you feel frustrated irritated angry

263
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,560
you might use that as an occasion to see if some of the things i've said today

264
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:58,800
how they play out in you how they're working inside of you and um and maybe you'll have more wisdom and

265
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:05,440
more options of how to live in a with your own frustration and anger

266
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,318
so thank you
