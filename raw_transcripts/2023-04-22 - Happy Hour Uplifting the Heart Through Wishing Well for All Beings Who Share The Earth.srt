by our body by the lower part of the body if possible

57
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:44,479
it's a way to settle into the body and connect

58
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,039
perhaps even feeling the breath move through our legs our feet

59

foreign

60
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:04,319

foreign

176
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,340
to bring the

177
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:19,340
meditation to a close

178
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:28,220
acknowledging that all of us share this planet

179
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:39,500
and there are challenges in living in this planet foreign

180
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:50,360
and acknowledging that living our lives with a heart that has good will and kindness

181
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:58,520
spreads radiates kindness Goodwill compassion 360 degrees

to

186
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:35,159
and without any judgment or attachment to what could have been or

187
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:41,340
wasn't letting go of attachment to outcome

188
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:46,440
trusting that we are planting seeds of kindness Goodwill

189
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,799
and they will flourish in their own time

190
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:59,480

cultivate our hearts and expansion and kindness in Goodwill

197
00:34:52,980 --> 00:35:00,500
for all beings everywhere not just for ourselves but for others it's so expensive

198
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:07,619
so uplifting so spacious happy making

199
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:13,500

that be enough let that be oh yes ah what a relief

201
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:27,359
how lovely so as we do and happier at this time we

202
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:33,480
turn to practicing with our eyes closed on the cushioned

203
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:40,820
practicing together in community and the invitation for the small groups

204
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:46,640
roughly of size three the breakout rooms

205
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:54,780
is of course showing up with um with kindness with kindness humility for

206
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:01,140
ourselves for others kindness and compassion and just sharing from our own

207
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:06,300
experience of course we can just say pass when our turn comes in which case

208
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:13,140
we'll just be sharing silent um presence kind presence but it's a

209
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:18,680
really wonderful opportunity to take our practice from the cushion to daily life

210
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:25,800
this is a Sandbox It's a Wonderful sandbox to be able to experiment with so

211
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:33,599
the prompt is what arises for you what what do you note when you when you have

212
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:39,200
compassion when you have good will matter and compassion with it both tonight

213
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:45,359
for all beings for other beings what would arises maybe share one nugget from

214
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,579
your practice if you wish and and it's perfectly fine to say actually I uh just

215
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:57,599
I was completely distracted or fell asleep it's okay there's no wrong answer it's not a quiz it's just to show up

216
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:03,200
with kindness and support each other and please only share from your own practice

217
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:09,480
no asking questions no giving advice to others and if you notice somebody's

218
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,520
doing that it's okay to say hey we're not supposed to ask questions or give advice just

219
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:20,040
keep the container light and as safe as possible for one another

220
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:25,800
so be kind enjoy um interacting with one another being

221
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:33,420
inspired with one another and again remember that you're sharing for your own benefit to be held witness you're

222
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,480
not sharing to impress anyone or educate anyone it's just

223
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:45,740
sharing in community this is what came up for me or maybe nothing came up and it's perfectly fine

224
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:53,160

241
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:56,940
read these

242
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:06,900
well thanks Nikki um so it's always better to do this than

243
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:15,380
not and it it doesn't have to be terribly powerful for me in in the

244
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:21,480
instant of the experience the experience is recognizable as being

245
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:28,099
positive and it may sweep out the

246
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:39,920
[Music] debris of of thoughts that aren't very very useful

247
00:49:40,859 --> 00:49:47,520
but I feel with increasing confidence that it's

248
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:55,579
uh it's it's worth it's always worth doing and uh the

249
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:03,200
the impact maybe later uh or it may be accumulative

250
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,099
it just doesn't need to be fireworks all the time

251
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:18,119
thanks Fred well said all the points you made doesn't have to be fireworks it

252
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:25,380
feels always feels better than not and it is accumulative and it is ripens

253
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:31,500
later all the wonderful points you made very wisely absolutely

254

255
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:43,079
he who says love for all is a two-way street the more we love the world the

256
00:50:43,079 --> 00:50:48,720
more love the world pours into US yes that's how it feels doesn't it it feels

257
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:55,260
like when we meet the moment with kindness um then it's it's basically our

258
00:50:55,260 --> 00:51:00,359
perception that the world becomes kind to us that we see more kindness in the

259
00:51:00,359 --> 00:51:05,520
world we see more compassion in the world and if we see fear and danger and

260
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,980
threat always that's what we'll perceive as what our mind will pick up

263
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:32,579

269
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:08,460
making lunch I was hurrying up and then you know I had two things in there and then suddenly your voice came to me oh

oh something like that oh I can see you're having a hard time sweetheart it's okay it's okay something like that

271
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:21,660
that I mean I was calling myself and then uh oh I hear you or something like so that you were talking about before

272

and then I just like calmed down and and then the things flew okay I don't know Wednesday uh

273
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:33,480
actually something that you had mentioned I had question about the wisdom and then you said without it

274
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:41,700
it'll be a bumpy road uh without incorporating the loving kindness aspect of the bird into wisdom

275
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:47,819
aspect only and that is that it that that I was just kind of like reflecting on that so I just wanted to thank you

276
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:53,819

284
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:50,280
taking this way and yes without kindness wisdom alone is pretty bumpy it's um

285
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:57,180
Joseph Goldstein likes to say that um writing um it's like riding a bicycle without

286
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:04,079
air in the tires wisdom without kindness It's a pretty bumpy ride you want to put
