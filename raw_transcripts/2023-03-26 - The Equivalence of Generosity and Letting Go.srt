1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,279
good morning and those of you online who are also attending good morning to you or good day

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:15,059
and I'll start with an announcement so we have you know over time

3
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:21,660
change some of the covet protocol from the when we first opened up and it feels like we're ready to do

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:28,640
another small change big change and that is the Sunday morning here

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:36,239
has been by registration it's supposed to sign up ahead of time in order to keep the numbers within about 50 or so

6
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,760
and it seems like it's things have changed enough that it seems time not to

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,920
do that register sign up anymore and now to limit the numbers

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:52,860
so so starting in April that's the way it works and I don't know if any of you

9
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:58,739
have already signed up for next week but but there's no longer a need and for the

10
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:05,460
time being we'll keep the room set up the way it is with the chairs and stuff because it does kind of create a little bit of social distancing

11
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,220
and we'll um uh maybe put out more chairs in the outer Hall you can get a

12
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,340
pretty good view in from the other other side and some people used to before the pandemic people Some people prefer to

13
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,720
sit out there they thought the sound was better out there and um and then at some point we'll

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:32,520
we'll rearrange the room the way it used to be pre-pandemic which puts the chairs closer together

15
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:39,479
so that's a change and then uh we're still uh requiring the n95 masks and I

16
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:46,320
can very much appreciate that some of you feel maybe that's not needed anymore and feel maybe even a little annoyed that we

17
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:52,320
should still be old-fashioned this way but I think it's still very helpful and

18
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,259
um and uh for the most part the discomfort that comes with wearing them it makes

19
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,479
for great practice and we have a practice that's supposed

20
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:10,380
to help us with this kind of discomfort to find our comfort with this discomfort so so you know if we were some other

21
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:17,580
kind of place maybe you know if we were a Bowling Club maybe there's no practice then to maybe

22
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:24,599
that kind of practice but we have one so hopefully we can just fold it in and and work with it for a while longer and then

23
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:30,660
at some point uh probably the masks will become optional but when that is it's

24
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,319
not so clear we're just feeling our way step by step as we go along here

25
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,840
and I think the need for a level of inner safety inner Comfort around not

26
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,500
being afraid about covet or something or less is actually quite important for people who are meditating because as we

27
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,900
get quieter and quieter Stiller and Stiller um if it does happen where in some ways

28
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,540
more tender more sensitive more more impacted by very subtle things and so

29
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:08,180
this the level of safety around this covet thing and can have an effect on people's meditation I think

30
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,640
so

31
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,640
so yesterday I was doing my taxes

32
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:29,280
and um and that seemed to go fine more or less

33
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:37,019
until I try to submit them electronically and then it became Kafkaesque

34
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:43,379
and uh it was like you got to be kidding me really but that's not just doesn't work

35
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:51,720
one of the things was I had to submit the first four letters first four letters of my wife's last name but she

36
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,640
only has three letters in her last name

37
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:04,440
so a lot of people do so I like how do you I couldn't figure out how to get around that and

38
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,959
and then it's later they wouldn't the IRS wouldn't accept her

39
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:17,040
personal information so you have to contact Social Security Office office to get it sorted out but

40
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,600
they're closed so anyway so that was frustrating because I was more

41
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,919
humbled by my level of frustration then you know anything is done for a long

42
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:34,500
time so that's a long way of saying that if I

43
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:41,100
hadn't given any thought to what to talk about today as I woke up this morning

44
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,040
a little bit teeny bit of a hangover from that experience

45
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,280
and um and I thought well what am I going to talk about and now so sometimes well I'm going to

46
00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:00,120
do my early morning meditation and sometimes something comes up in that so I was doing my minding my own

47
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,460
business doing my morning meditation at some point I took her to me well I'll

48
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:12,300
talk about what I've been thinking about the most in the Dharma lately I'm kind of instead of interested in it and that

49
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:18,600
seems obvious okay back to my meditation and then floated up his thought later on

50
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,720
well I need to have an example illustration to talk about this Dharma thing

51
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,660
back into my meditation and then at the end of it the pup is floated up

52
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:38,120
this meditation will be the example so that's what we're doing today

53
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,880
so the example in meditation was that um I sat down to meditate

54
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:53,220
and my mind was still I think little bit in the leftover frustration level with

55
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:59,580
having done the taxes so it was kind of racing or kind of spinning and more than usual

56
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:05,460
and it felt a little bit like my mind was a if it was mine was a car

57
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:10,979
I would still be in second gear but driving at the speed for the fourth gear

58
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:17,100
and you know it's kind of like racing and you know really high winding kind of like something's racing here

59
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:24,900
you know like wow and um like you know this is this is not me there's something that's taken over

60
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:31,740
here there's a compulsive or drivenness in my thinking and then you know I thought maybe maybe

61
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:38,220
it's a little bit like being in a terrible storm with strong wind and kind of hunkering down making your way

62
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:44,880
through it you know like it's making yourself small or something Because by the end of the meditation the

63
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:51,660
storm had cleared and it wasn't that I got into the fourth gear I think I got into neutral even better

64
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:58,199
and there was this wonderful feeling of being released from this drivenness the compulsivity of

65
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:04,620
these thoughts that went on but that took you know the duration of the meditation

66
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:11,960
and uh and part of that Journey was going through at the beginning and say wow

67
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:17,819
45 years of meditation and this is what it comes to [Laughter]

68
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:23,039
and I thought yeah okay well I have to accept this I have to let go of this

69
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:29,520
this is a bit humbling or a little bit you know so that's okay maybe it's good to be humbled or good to kind of let go

70
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:36,360
and accept this is how it is and so okay so I'll just I'll just this the freedom was found just accepting this is how it

71
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:44,759
is my mind is out of control it's spinning it's going fast and um and okay well that's the deal so

72
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,860
there was a certain kind of freedom but it wasn't like celebratory freedom

73
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:56,400
but you know okay this is the way it is so then as I meditated I could feel slowly my body was tense and that began

74
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,440
the tension kind of settled after the attention my body started settling I could feel my mind beginning

75
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,539
to settle just by doing the meditation just showing up and being present and being present

76
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:11,699
I didn't feel like I could address the compositivity the drivenness directly it

77
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:19,259
just felt like that was just getting mired in the mud mired and you know just adding fuel to the second gear

78
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:26,340
so I just kind of like let out away get out of the way let myself be humbled or simple or just kind of

79
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:33,180
and um and then after you know the end of the meditation things had settled enough that there was a sense of relief

80
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,520
release and now the feeling was one of kind of delight

81
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:45,839
like ah this is nice something has let go and then I got to a point where tax

82
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,300
thoughts that if they arose I could just let go of them

83
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:58,320
they could release them and now the releasing of them letting go of them just felt like a pleasure like a

84
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,839
delight like I wonder what a wonderful thing to be able to do this and come back to this kind of much more simple

85
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,940
relaxed peaceful way of being

86
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,940
so that was that's the example for what I'll talk about and um

87
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:20,760
so in the Buddhist in the Buddhist vocabulary the ancient Indian vocabulary

88
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,399
the language that Buddha taught there's a whole family of words related

89
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,920
to liberation and and the different words have

90
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,740
different nuances of associations with them and some of them have directly to do

91
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:44,459
with the word Liberation in English or Liberation Freedom emancipation these

92
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:49,920
kinds of um you know kind of release kind of like kind of

93
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:56,120
positive words we would have in English but some of the words

94
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:01,980
um if uh are often translated into English in Words which for some English

95
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:08,700
speakers are not celebratory words like Freedom or something

96
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:17,459
um actually so they're actually maybe a little bit off-putting so uh some words for example

97
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:22,620
um is translated sometimes translated into English as giving up

98
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:29,220
now the tone of the voice maybe has a lot to do with how that's taken of giving up you know oh no we have to give

99
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:35,300
up again and it's kind of a surrender kind of hopelessness okay this is it

100
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:40,980
um the word relinquishment is used for one of this family of words

101
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:48,779
and um and uh so I looked up the synonyms for relinquishment in the thesaurus

102
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:56,100
they're not good news [Laughter] one other one with a lot of most of them

103
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:03,060
are not good news you wouldn't be happy with if we use these words so one of them one of them is abdicate

104
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,760
you know and uh so maybe the association of the relinquishment is not automatically you

105
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:15,720
know so great and then there's the word letting go maybe the tone of voice also has

106
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,180
something to do with it letting go for some people is not a good idea not a not

107
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:26,820
welcome news you have to let go of that in fact sometimes people will tell you just let go

108
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:35,459
and like you it's kind of infuriating you know what are you telling me you know as if it's easy to let go or

109
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:41,220
and then people tell you to let go of things you shouldn't let go of let go of everything let go of your

110
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:49,339
house your you know your possessions let go you know just let go of doing your taxes

111
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,240
and um so um so letting go sometimes doesn't have positive connotations

112
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:03,839
but it turns out that in English some of these words that are kind of not

113
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:09,660
necessarily good news anymore for us had an if you do the archaeological

114
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:15,779
digging in the word the etymology of the word is actually quite wonderful

115
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:21,779
it seems like the word giving up originally meant offer up to the altar

116
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:27,000
so that's kind of a sacred Act uh you know someone tells you got to

117
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:34,800
sacrifice that but the word sacrifice originally meant to make in Latin to make sacred

118
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:41,760
well that's a beautiful thing so you know back there in the background there they were just something quite lovely

119
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,279
and uh apparently the word surrender also uh surrender doesn't seem like a

120
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:53,639
good idea but apparently it meant kind of a superior super kind of rendering a

121
00:12:53,639 --> 00:13:00,240
giving again this giving so all these words uh there's a kind of uh

122
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,839
so have a positive connotations originally turns out in Pali in the Buddhist

123
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,880
language the same thing occurs but not so much in the etymology of the

124
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:19,200
word but in the meaning of the word that some of these family of words having to do with Liberation means both

125
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:26,279
something like letting go and generosity letting go and giving

126
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:32,519
and uh and depending on the context of what's being taught and sometimes it's

127
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,639
translated as relinquishment or letting go

128
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:43,500
and giving up but sometimes actually translated as giving

129
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:49,440
uh you you know and then when it's translated as giving it's directly

130
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:55,220
connected to feeling Delight just you're feeling the Delight of giving

131
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,839
feeling the light of Letting Go feeling the Delight of giving feeling the light

132
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:07,440
of relinquishment so Nepali those words are kind of all the same there's a word chaga which

133
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:14,720
means both generosity and letting go there's The patini Saga which means

134
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:21,060
relinquishment and giving there is vasoga which means both

135
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:26,940
relinquishment and giving so when you hear these at these words

136
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:34,320
you know have this double meaning then translating as letting go or

137
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:41,160
relinquishment doesn't capture some of the richness or the association to it

138
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:48,899
so I've tried you know well let's let's just let's use giving as part of it and um

139
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:55,040
and um so maybe giving up

140
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,600
but you know but but and then I thought well how about giving

141
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,480
away but but it doesn't quite maybe so so

142
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,660
I'll just forget about the the up and the away or let's just call

143
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:19,560
it giving and I like that but then but then you don't get a sense of what

144
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:27,660
it means for The Giver that it's a beautiful feeling of release that goes on to give with release

145
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:37,160
to give we're giving is free kind of a freedom to give we're giving is a kind of a

146
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:44,339
you know just feels like fresh air it feels like the you know

147
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:50,040
the over-rev cars back in neutral and resting or the feel like the storm is

148
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:56,459
over and it's gotten to be calm and peaceful so what is this release that we can have

149
00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:02,279
this giving that feels wonderful celebratory

150
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:09,300
and this is a clear Association that the Buddha has with the deepest forms of

151
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:14,820
letting go of Liberation that we can have it's clearly a release it's clearly

152
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:20,040
something disappears it's given up is let go of

153
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:28,320
but uh it's not a diminishment but rather a kind of a feel it feels

154
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,500
great in fact the Buddha said something like

155
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:39,480
um if relinquishing something and the word he

156
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,699
uses here can mean both giving and letting go

157
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:50,360
um if relinquishing something

158
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:57,540
brought about unwholesome states of mind I would not teach you to do so

159
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:04,220
but if relinquishing something letting go of something giving up something giving away something

160
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:09,959
um results in wholesome statements of mind for you

161
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:15,480
then I recommend you do it so this is not a blanket teaching just

162
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:20,819
let go let go let go no matter what it's letting go

163
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:26,040
in a way that leads to positive states of mind

164
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:32,940
and so to be able to discern that that that's part of the criteria for knowing when to let go oh I'm

165
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:39,720
actually better by not holding on to this there's something gets free it's something good happens

166
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:49,260
and then when the Buddha describes the things we actually what he recommends we relinquish we let go of

167
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:54,480
and then some sometimes he actually uses words that there's no

168
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,880
um Redeeming the words I'm trying to redeem some of these words right there's a

169
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:06,840
family of words so Freedom you don't have to redeem Liberation that's good right but relinquishment giving up

170
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:12,240
that's you have to redeem a little bit here that's what I'm trying to do but there are some words he uses which

171
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:19,380
have no redeeming he uses like words like abandoned so uh

172
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:28,140
oh but what do we abandon what do we relinquish and um and all my wealth

173
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:34,080
you know my friends my possessions my sexuality right all these party pooping

174
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,320
things

175
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,120
and I'm not going to say you're not supposed to do that but here's a list

176
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,919
you can leave now before you hear it

177
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,080
oh here he comes

178
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:03,780
lust hatred delusion anger hostility

179
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:11,840
denigration insolence Envy miserlessness deceitfulness craftiness

180
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:18,260
obstacy vehemence conceit arrogance

181
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:24,900
intoxication heedlessness it's a great list

182
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:31,559
so what do these have in common are they all these words they all have to do with inner states in

183
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:36,960
our mind in our hearts that nothing to do with things of the world and what's out there

184
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,020
these are things to um

185
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:48,539
that to be let go of but to let go of them to relinquish to

186
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:53,240
give up to give up to give to something

187
00:19:53,820 --> 00:20:01,320
how do we do that and that's actually the full context of this quote how do we accomplish this

188
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:07,679
what help what what what states of mind can be cultivated to make this possible

189
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:15,120
and the Buddha says you want to cultivate a deep capacity for tranquility it's serenity

190
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:22,080
and insight what the practice we do here to really see clearly

191
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,440
so that when you let go you see you understand really deeply

192
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:35,760
what you're letting go of and why without seeing clearly letting go is not

193
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:44,640
wise we want to let go in Wise ways so that without wisdom that we can

194
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:50,039
um it's easier to let go we know why we're

195
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:57,660
letting go and so we're not letting go of the wrong things and so we can better appreciate the

196
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:03,240
benefits that come from letting go we learn how to let go

197
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:09,000
how to relinquish how to give it all away or to be generous it's

198
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,039
an act of generosity the movement of the movement of freedom

199
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:22,160
so when I was sitting in my meditation this morning you know kind of putting up with my

200
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,840
State of Mind grumpy State of Mind spinning mind mostly what I had to do was kind of like

201
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,720
okay well I guess I can be humbled sometimes okay you have to accept this too I'll

202
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,240
let go of you know probably have to let go of some kind of conceit of

203
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:45,900
I'm a great meditator today and so that didn't wasn't inspiring

204
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:51,240
but you know it was what was needed Maybe just okay I just have to practice with

205
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:56,700
this and then with by the end it was an act of generosity oh there's

206
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:04,440
those thoughts again but now I had enough Serenity enough Insight just okay I'll I'll release

207
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:10,440
those and I could feel the goodness of it I could feel how it felt good to do it and

208
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:17,820
it kind of felt like a generous thing to do because the alternative was not generous the alternative was not

209
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:23,700
good for me to go back into those thoughts I could feel what it was you know I had

210
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:30,240
the choice Easy Choice was like you take your hand off the hot stove kind of with the

211
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,120
and so I could appreciate it I could value it and so part of the wisdom of

212
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:43,740
letting go is learning to recognize the goodness of doing so

213
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:48,840
to recognize how we're better because of it what gets released the space that's

214
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:56,360
created the room it gives for beneficial states to Bubble Up and to flow

215
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,059
and um the Delight the joy

216
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:09,059
so there's a family of words connected to freedom and Buddhism the goal of Buddhism

217
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:15,960
liberation some of them more literally means liberation

218
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:23,360
some of them have this dual meaning of giving and giving up

219
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:30,240
relinquishing and giving something away and where does it go

220
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:37,340
if you're grumpy give it away but don't give it to anyone

221
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:42,539
give it to space give it to the ocean give it to the sky it knows what to do

222
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:49,620
with it and many years ago I discovered that at

223
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:55,740
the end of meditation the end of retreat whatever calm I had would usually go

224
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:01,919
away after some time and I used to be a little bit grumpy then like or

225
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:08,520
and what I learned was if it's going to go away anyway why don't I set the intention to give it

226
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,980
away I'll just give it to the world and just that shift

227
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:20,100
made me feel so much better rather than holding on to it or feeling disappointed if my good state was

228
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:26,720
leaving I said great another thing to let go of and other things to be generous to

229
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:34,140
so if you permit permit me allow me there is a kind of children's song I

230
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:40,200
think I think it's children's song Maybe it's an adult song maybe it should be an adult song that goes something like love is

231
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:46,640
something if you give it away okay you only end up with more

232
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:54,059
this in Buddhism they say the same thing for merit that if you give away all the Merit from

233
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:59,100
the good things you've done that's really meritorious you get more merits

234
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:06,539
what is Merit marriage is all the good feelings all the happiness that comes from the good

235
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:13,020
things you do so do good things feel the happiness

236
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:19,760
and give away that happiness share it with others don't hold on to it for yourself

237
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:28,380
and you'll end up more with more so the intimate Connection in Buddhism

238
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:36,080
between letting go and generosity and giving freedom and generosity

239
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:44,640
the intimate connection Buddhism in the other way too between giving and generosity and freedom

240
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,220
where do we start do we start with freedom and get generosity

241
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:55,919
or to start with generosity and then blow and behold we get freedom

242
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:02,520
so I just left you with a big problem and to figure that one out

243
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:09,059
aren't you lucky that's your problem just start anywhere makes sense either

244
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:14,820
one it's a great thing it's a celebratory the wonderful thing

245
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:21,480
that in these two languages maybe many other languages that there's such an recognize such a

246
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:28,080
close connection between letting go and generosity

247
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,340
may you come to appreciate that and value it and find a way

248
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:40,320
so thank you so we have a little bit of time we can do a few questions or

249
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,840
comments in here testimonials about letting go and generosity

250
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,940
and then uh maybe in about 10 minutes or so those of you who want to stay we can

251
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:56,880
go out to the parking lot and take some folding chairs and sit out there in a circle and if you'd like we can take off

252
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:04,020
the mask there and all of us and just have a continued discussion there but for now any any comments or question

253
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:08,960
in here that someone foreign

254
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:16,500
my question is when you realize that there's a state to let go of

255
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:22,860
um how do you make the choice between trying to

256
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:28,860
relax and do nothing to allow it to pass or to

257
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:35,000
try to engage loving kindness with yourself

258
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:42,480
so there's so many strategies to learn what's needed any given time and some of

259
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:48,360
it just comes from practice you just try different things so you know now apparently you know two things now you

260
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:54,900
know letting go and loving kindness right what a good what what good fortune that you have these two tools

261
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:02,279
so now you've got to practice with them until you get the street smarts you understand how it works and when when

262
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:09,240
one works when one doesn't work when one feels like the best thing for you and um and then you learn also through

263
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:15,600
trial and error you know well I'm not sure but right now I feel I feel more attracted to the loving kindness and you

264
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,880
do it and after a while you know actually that doesn't work that's not that's not really working

265
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,700
today so I think that's the best way rather than give you some formula

266
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,559
is that okay yeah thank you

267
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,700
I understand I understand the topic of today's letting go but my question is

268
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:44,880
why acquire uh what why acquire to begin with to begin with yeah you know there's this

269
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,980
thing that like a nouns of prevention is worth a pound of cure

270
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:56,220
so why be agitated about doing taxes why don't just laugh at IRS who has all

271
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:02,960
these problems and it's their problem not yours right like why do you get agitated

272
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:13,158
now you're asking such profound questions I cannot answer

273
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:19,500
but uh you know you said after 45 years this is what it amounts for so for you

274
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:27,059
it's easy to say that right like you have such a confidence in your practice but for us we're looking up to you as a

275
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:33,000
teacher and we don't have 45 years right so what do we do I hope I didn't how do

276
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,220
we get the confidence in our practice I hope I didn't discourage you today no no it's fine that's fine it is a little

277
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,919
discouraging to be completely honest it is discouraging

278
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:54,559
the um I think that 45 years ago what I didn't have was any ability to get some

279
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:59,820
perspective on my grumpiness in the race and the rising mind I would have been

280
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:06,299
sucked into it and caught in it and I was not today it's like oh look at that that's interesting

281
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:12,600
so there was some Freedom there oh as always there is two sides right so

282
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:18,539
one side I am a little discouraged on the other side I'm very inspired by your

283
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:24,419
ability to talk openly about this topic and you know being relatable to us and

284
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:29,820
uh it's it makes me more willing to listen actually to you because it seemed

285
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:35,960
like you're willing to be honest very honest great great oh so in this regard

286
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:42,240
I think I said I might have said this last Sunday or somewhere I don't know I teach so much so who knows where I said

287
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:49,260
it um is um uh I think in this practice we do we're

288
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:55,200
all of us all the time beginners but what happens when you practice for 45 years

289
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,960
you're just an experienced beginner which makes it easier

290
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:08,539
makes it a lot easier but you're still just a beginner so don't get too don't don't expect too much

291
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:18,720
hi Gill um I really liked an analogy used today

292
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,500
that I hadn't heard before about letting go which was to take your hand off the hot stove

293
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:31,080
I'm whenever someone says relax to me I tense up and whenever someone says let

294
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:38,760
just oh I love it when they proceed with the word just just let go I cling so

295
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:46,520
um at least I've arrived at that awareness um yeah

296
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:53,279
hold up hold on there's the aspiration right and so I thought of removing the

297
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,559
hand off the stove and then I thought take my hand out of the fire

298
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:05,340
when I think about the thing that will grab me is a feeling that somebody is really wronged me or dissed me or

299
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:10,799
something in a way that will have consequences not just gee I didn't like that that's a

300
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,740
feeling I can get that but oh 12 other people who I cared about heard that and were influenced

301
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:23,179
that's a problem um and so I I'm going to work with this idea of taking my hand out of the fire

302
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:28,980
but whenever I want to give up something I need something to go to if I'm going to give up sugar I need to go to

303
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:35,220
vegetables or something I need to have a goal I need to not give up as much as I

304
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:42,960
get something different can you give me any guidance around that process what can I substitute okay it's

305
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,299
got wonderful things you said so first I want to say that what are the functions

306
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:56,460
of developing mindfulness is developing heightened sensitivity to recognize the hot stove or the fire

307
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,980
and so then we if it's really a hot stove you don't need anything better to go to

308
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:07,919
it just it just you want to get out of it because it's so it's so obvious so instinctual and so as we get more

309
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,860
sensitive we feel the suffering in fact if some of you have heard me say that I recommend that we should learn how to

310
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:20,179
suffer better in this practice and that's also discouraging

311
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:28,620
foreign better means you don't go out to make better suffering it means that you feel

312
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:33,840
you're suffering more acutely so that you can learn the lessons of it so that

313
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,720
you can the Instinct not to be there to pull back or step away can operate so

314
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:46,440
sometimes like sometimes that's the only thing that helps and sometimes some of the deepest deepest attachments

315
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:52,919
um you at some point in this practice it just like you reach rock bottom and there's you have to give up

316
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:58,320
sometimes giving up is what's called for surrender okay I Surrender there's

317
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:04,260
sometimes there's no other way because you've tried every option other option none of it works

318
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:09,658
and um I mean in my first retweets that I sat I was

319
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:16,200
miserable until I I finally gave up because not because I knew it was wise

320
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:21,540
just nothing else I just I didn't know what to do anymore I was

321
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:28,260
hopeless and then the retweet started something with I had to let go so deeply

322
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:34,500
and give up all hope kind of and then something was able to happen so that happens sometimes but your

323
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:40,020
question sometimes you need a reward you need something positive I think that's really wise also

324
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:45,419
and this is where I think much of the western Buddhist teaching

325
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:51,960
that I grew up with when I was you know just 40 years ago and so it was so much On Letting Go and letting go and letting

326
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,900
go and there was even an emphasis a clear emphasis not not to emphasize the

327
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:04,680
good mental states that can come with practice because you have to let go of that too you have to let go of that tattoo and not have a goal

328
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,839
but if you read the teachings of the Buddha there's a lot of carrots in there

329
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:15,960
there's a lot of emphasis on cultivating and developing beautiful states of mind

330
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:22,680
and um and uh and and developed into the point of abundance

331
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:29,460
we let go of things that harm us but things that benefit us we let them

332
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:35,160
grow and develop in abundance so what are those things

333
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:42,440
Joy peace peace happiness Equanimity is one of them generosity

334
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,940
wisdom equanimity um

335
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:54,740
um compassion and loving kindness and

336
00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:00,900
anacampa care and ethical Integrity these are all

337
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:06,540
beautiful states that exist in us so so as we practice and clear kind of the

338
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:12,720
debris from our mind we start seeing the feeling and getting a visceral kind of embodied

339
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:19,560
experience of what these states are like so then we say oh when I let go I can

340
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:25,700
return to those and a turning point for me in my practice was to start feeling

341
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:31,380
feelings of peace and love and love was one of them

342
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:36,839
that they just felt like that that was almost like the natural state

343
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:45,060
and so the commitment in practice that kind of The Vow that I made in practice was to orient my life to stay true to

344
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:51,839
those because that's was more who I was than the opposite and but that was because I had learned

345
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:57,240
to recognize it and it wasn't there was it wasn't always readily accessible those States

346
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:03,180
but I knew that that's what the practice was helping me do so so sometimes you don't get the

347
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:09,119
rewards right away sometimes you have to wait a while for them so does this address your

348
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,540
question well enough yeah it really did um you triggered a memory for me my life

349
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:20,760
coach is always saying that in these difficult moments there is gift and

350
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:26,760
opportunity and I always groan at him but I think now I get what you said and

351
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:32,400
I get what he said so that's that's what I will look for is the gift and

352
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,460
opportunity for all of these more beneficial States

353
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:44,040
yeah and um and so in in one of the you know great

354
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:49,680
gifts of this mindfulness practice is when we see that just to be mindful in a

355
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:55,800
situation that is its own reward you know I mean wow you step back you

356
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:02,220
step away you open up and you're really here and yes you're grumpy yes you're whatever

357
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:11,000
but wow this is like the the the the the you know the clouds just parted

358
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:18,000
so thank you all very much and um so we have about five minutes before

359
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,200

360
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,240
important part of what's happening in this post-pendemic pandemic world if um

361
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:36,300
you'd be willing to just turn to someone next to here here and welcome them here even if this is your first time here you

362
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:42,240
can welcome them and say your name or something and talk a little bit if you want and then in about five minutes I'll

363
