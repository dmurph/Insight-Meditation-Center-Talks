preparation for this meditation as yesterday is an

14
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,438
image so as you settle into your

15
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,479
seat or whatever is supporting

16
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,078
you beginning to feel

17
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:14,800
stable I would invite you to bring this image to

18
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,319
mind I can imagine that

19
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:34,400
you're maybe standing maybe SE did next to a cool Clear

20
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,280
Lake this lake is

21
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:48,200
vast it's broad it's wide and it's reflecting the the Open

22
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:01,760
Sky and you

23
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,280
you're safely on the ground but you're near the

24
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:25,720
depths this moment you notice there is a weight in your

25
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:33,799
pocket and you reach in finding The Three

26
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:44,000
Stones maybe different colors and textures you can feel them in your hands and see them in your

27
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,120
hands maybe they're warm from your body

28
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,480
heat and after appreciating them for a moment

29
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,599
you realize you don't need to hold them anymore you extend your arm over the

30
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:18,109
Deep cool water and slowly start turning your

31
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:25,440
[Music] palm you can feel the rock

32
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,919
nudge then slide and

33
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:40,000
disappear dropping out of your hand and punk into the

34
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:57,080
water you can watch them fade and returning attention to your

35
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:05,600
hands feeling what was await is now an

36
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:15,160
absence empty

37
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
light

38
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,080
at the time of this

39
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:03,600
meditation as we gently kindly attend to the body this body

40
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,000
breathing do we not need to hold

41
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
anymore

42
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:44,400
what can be let go and offer it to this vast cool

43
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
L

44
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:14,440
breathing in breathing [Music]

45
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,399
out letting go of what's

46
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Extra

47
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,519
may find that we're staying close to the

48
00:12:53,720 --> 00:13:00,839
senses the senses without the added weight

49
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,399
of reactions and

50
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
involvement

51
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:00,400
breathing and letting [Music] go

52
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,240
making room for a a welcome

53
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
nothing

54
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:56,519
being near the senses and letting go of what's

55
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:04,360
Extra letting go of what's

56
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,679
extra what do you notice about what's left

57
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
behind

58
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:59,519
in these last minutes of the sitting

59
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:05,279
sensing

60
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:16,278
breathing having let go of what's

61
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,240
extra to appreciate the

62
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:34,320
possibility the possibility within the

63
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
absence

64
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:12,519
they all GS

65
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:19,799
everywhere have the conditions to let go of what is

66
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:26,000
extra to let go of what's weary

67
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:33,960
making making room for this

68
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:41,440
absence possibility and

69
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
peace

70
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
de

71
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:13,039
and again

72
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:19,720
oh what wonder that absence keeps turning into

73
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,880
something oh what might emerge for us

74
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:33,399
today so today we turn from the first Noble Truth to the second Noble

75
00:31:33,399 --> 00:31:40,000
Truth in our Reflections on this Core teaching of Luna

76
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:47,760
Dharma wanted to open with a a story from the suas there's a

77
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,679
um uh a householder named upali who goes to have a conversation

78
00:31:54,679 --> 00:32:01,320
with the Buddha a few circumstan an es transpire and then it's this that I want

79
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:07,639
to share for how it it says the Buddha prepares up Al's mind to receive the

80
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:14,039
teachings on the four noble truths doesn't Dive Right In And this is an important point the the four noble

81
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:20,679
truths we often introduce um as like the the first the first teaching but you can

82
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:26,399
see in this in this little section from the ancient teachings that actually the

83
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:33,518
uh the Mind does to be prepared to receive the for noble truths and this is how it's uh written

84
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:42,679
there so it goes then the Buddha gave the householder upali Progressive instruction that is

85
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:50,000
talk on giving talk on virtue talk on Heavens he explained the danger

86
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,039
degradation and defilement and sensual pleasures and the blessings of

87
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:02,600
renunciation and when he knew when the Buddha knew that the householder up Al's mind was

88
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:08,639
ready receptive free from hindrances elated

89
00:33:08,639 --> 00:33:14,720
and confident he expounded to him the teaching special to the

90
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,760
Buddhas suffering its origin its

91
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:28,039
cessation and the path you might recognize these as the four noble truths in brief and it says

92
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:34,440
that just as a clean cloth would uh evenly take on dye so to the householder

93
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:40,799
upali as he sat there had this spotless Immaculate vision of the Dharma arise in

94
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,200
him it's so beautiful it's amazing to me also that

95
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:52,840
just hearing the teaching um was transformative for upali I think that shows the power of

96
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:59,480
reflection and for the the the power of uh cultivating the supports for

97
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:05,960
understanding and wisdom and well-being so the tradition often

98
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:14,638
teaches the four noble truths as uh Dua suffering the origin cause of suffering

99
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,158
as the second Noble Truth the sensation of suffering as the third and the fourth

100
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:27,158
Noble Truth as the path the way to the cessation of suffering now Gil gives some great talks

101
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:32,280
on u a distinction he brings in something called the four liberating

102
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:38,480
insights where he points out that the um four noble truths as such aren't named

103
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:46,960
so many times in the in the sutas but the um the direct clear seeing of Dua

104
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:53,079
and its arising clearly seeing the arising of Dua right here in experience then

105
00:34:53,079 --> 00:35:00,520
clearly seeing its cessation and clearly seeing the path that these have a liberating power to see these four

106
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:06,680
things it's a really powerful framing I think uh and it points us back to the

107
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:13,079
practice happening right here in this mind in this body in other words our experience of

108
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:19,240
Dua our experience of suffering is constructed or made or born out in this

109
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:25,800
mind that's how we experience it not to say that's the only condition of

110
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:32,920
course so I think that this is uh this emphasis on the mind is well expressed in uh the

111
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:38,560
beginning of the the first verses of the dapada and say all experiences preceded

112
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,400
by mind led by mind and made by mind speak or act with a corrupted mind and

113
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,839
suffering follows as the Wagon Wheel follows the hoof of the

114
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:57,160
ox all experiences preceded by mind led by mind made by mind speaker act with a

115
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:03,440
peaceful mind and happiness follows like a never departing

116
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:10,680
Shadow such is the importance of the mind so as the task of the first Noble

117
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,920
Truth was to understand comprehend Dua in indirect experience the task of the

118
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:23,359
second Noble Truth is to abandon to abandon what and abandon in

119
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:31,400
what sense so first uh abandon in what sense um the word in English abandon has

120
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:39,560
a has certain connotations but when you look at the teachings what you find is that it's much more like letting go of

121
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:46,280
what's not needed anymore or uh the way we use abandon in the term Abandon Ship

122
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:53,800
this like this the ship is clearly going down it's time to get off for our safety and well-being that kind of abandon ship

123
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:59,960
and what are we abandoning we're abandoning the the conditions that give rise to

124
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:06,920
suffering the conditions that give rise to suffering and this points this points to

125
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:12,160
um something important about suffering and that is it arises based on

126
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:19,319
conditions just like everything else in our experience that um because suffering is

127
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:25,720
conditioned it's not uh an instance of suffering isn't forever stable forever

128
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,800
permanent it's bound to change so the conditions that give rise

129
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:38,160
to suffering uh in the classic teaching it says that the the origin or the cause

130
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,079
or the arising of suffering is um a certain kind of

131
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:50,800
craving now of course we um in in Buddhist circles we uh uh we might run

132
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:57,640
the risk of generalizing and saying something like all desire is the the the

133
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:05,319
cause of suffering but this isn't quite right if you look if you look closely what um the sort of craving that

134
00:38:05,319 --> 00:38:11,680
leads on to suffering is what we're looking for and the Buddha points to a few

135
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:18,920
um the p is K tanan and

136
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:25,200
viaan and piku Bodi the great the prolific translator summarizes these

137
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,319
like so he says the the desire for pleasure and

138
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:36,560
possessions the drive for survival the urge to bolster the sense of ego with

139
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,599
power status and privilege that these are the sorts of

140
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:48,560
things that we need to um we need to watch for keep an eye on because they can lead

141
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:55,240
on they can lead on through clinging creation of identity to the sort of

142
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:00,000
suffering that uh the Buddha is helping us to

143
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:09,079
eradicate so if we want to abandon the conditions that give rise to suffering we have to get to know them really

144
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:16,240
closely the Buddha's analysis of duka of suffering and craving traces its origin to a sort of darkening of the

145
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:22,160
mind we that we term ignorance in po the word is actually the

146
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:28,800
the opposite term of wisdom so for today I want to I want to

147
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,079
um for the the next few minutes talk about a few examples of how in the one

148
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:40,200
of the Buddhist descriptions we go from sense experience to clinging and look at

149
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:46,640
these links pretty closely and in a few ways so so that they they can um be practiced

150
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:55,160
with these few links uh of the 12-fold chain U say like a 12 factor analysis of

151
00:39:55,160 --> 00:40:01,359
how suffering arise just just going to zoom in on a couple and these

152
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:08,480
are first is a moment of sense contact that's like a sound coming to the

153
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:15,280
ear with that as a condition a feeling arises that is a feeling of pleasant or

154
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:22,760
unpleasant or neither Pleasant or unpleasant or neutral with feeling as condition the

155
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:29,000
conditions are in place for a craving to arise a thirst sting to arise an Impulse

156
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:37,440
to um get closer or to move away and this impulse can condition

157
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:44,560
clinging upana it's grabbing on grasping and then grabbing on grasping

158
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:51,480
as condition comes identity making becoming so we can we'll look at this in

159
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:57,079
just a few ways so let's take this example of a sound

160
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:03,520
it comes to the ear say say you're sitting in meditation and you hear a bird outside you happen to like the

161
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:09,920
sound of this bird first thing that happens if you're noticing very very closely sound comes to the door there's

162
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,359
a pleasant feeling that arises in the body maybe in the ear

163
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:20,880
itself and if you watch closely that Pleasant feeling arises oh here comes

164
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,800
rving oh the bird has faded away and I'm wanting sound of the bird is faded away

165
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:34,520
and I'm craving for more sound of bird that was so pleasant or I'm or I'm craving for more pleasant feeling that's

166
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:40,040
Arisen that craving arises and then we grasp on we start strategizing about how

167
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:45,280
we're going to hear more birds fantasizing about birds um and then all

168
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:52,040
of a sudden we have created an identity that's oh I'm I'm the person who likes and seeks Birds we've gone from the

169
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:58,680
simple sound sitting here in meditation AR Rising a Pleasant feeling wanting it

170
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:05,520
and Clinging On and then all of a sudden we've created a self

171
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:12,560
imagine so this um that's sort of an innocuous example of how that can happen with a

172
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:20,319
pleasant sensation or a pleasant sense contact that arises also also can um we

173
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:27,119
can take the example of maybe um unpleasant speech let's say we're

174
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:33,000
having a conversation of and let's say at our ear again we come into contact

175
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:39,040
with a sort of everyday but innocuous speech um there's no like particular

176
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,599
boundary issue that needs pushing back on there's no threat there's just the experience of

177
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:51,440
unpleasant speech comes to the ear again unpleasant sensation this time and

178
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,599
then craving comes up in the form of wanting to push away push away push away

179
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:04,000
want to push against the experience and then all of a sudden we're grasping onto the

180
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:11,040
pushing doubling down on the pushing if we will so pleasant and unpleasant if

181
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,200
you're watching for it it's happening all the time throughout the day you can

182
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:22,480
you can see and feel and sense the way that that uh Pleasant and

183
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,880
unpleasant they don't remain just themselves they can we have the power to

184
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:33,599
do this with mindfulness but very very often if we're not paying so so close

185
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:39,599
attention if ignorance is in the way what happens is our our pleasant

186
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:45,800
experience becomes craving clinging and we just go full in we become fully

187
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,720
committed to an Impulse we're no longer in control of our body and mind craving

188
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:59,319
and ignorance and clinging have taken over so my encouragement for today might be

189
00:43:59,319 --> 00:44:04,680
um if you happen to notice this uh Pleasant and unpleasant sensation get

190
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:10,640
really close to noticing how it influences us influences the Mind influences the

191
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:16,119
body and the way this fulfills the task of the second Noble Truth it supports Us

192
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:21,960
in abandoning craving because we can see and observe and recognize how craving

193
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:27,800
operates we understand suffering as suffering we sense it we see it and we

194
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:33,599
can maybe have the opportunity to Let It Go but we'll start with just getting to

195
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:42,040
know it getting to know suffering and then through observation and patience practice letting go of this

196
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:45,480
this cause of the second Noble

197
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:53,000
Truth thanks so much for your attention today and tomorrow we'll pick up with

198
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,760
the third Noble Truth may all

199
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:05,760
beings may all beings have the conditions for Freedom may all beings abandon the

200
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:12,559
causes of suffering and no true happiness take

201
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,359
care
