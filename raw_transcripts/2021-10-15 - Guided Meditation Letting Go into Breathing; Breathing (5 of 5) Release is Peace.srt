1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,520
so warm greetings welcome to the meditation session and

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:13,360
welcome into this meditation community of ours

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:20,240
and if this is your first time special welcome and you get a sense of the

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,080
goodwill in this community through the chat that represents well many people

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,840
who come so um

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,000
many years ago a good number of years ago um

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,120
i went to with my young son who was maybe 13 maybe um

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,320
went for the only time in my life where i really went to play a round of golf

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,840
i don't know anything really about golf and i thought it'd be fun to go with him it was

10
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,520
fun and it turned out to be that that first tea

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:08,799
of phenomenally difficult to hit the ball i was so surprised how many times i

12
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:17,280
whiffed the ball on the tee and i remember finally hitting uh hitting a really good solid clunk

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,439
against the ball and i thought you know the immediate thought was wow this is great

14
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,280
and um and the ball rolled about four feet

15
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,799
as we went around the course there was maybe two maybe three times where i hit the ball off the tee

16
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,079
pretty nicely for me and you could hear in the in the smack

17
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,439
against the ball the club against the ball that something was right

18
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:54,399
and then the ball lifted up into the air and as it did so

19
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:01,920
my mind got really quiet it's kind of like time stopped and my mind just focused on the ball

20
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,440
going up up up out away sailing through the air and then sailing down quite

21
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,080
you know for me far away down the green and and i thought oh this is my thought at

22
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,319
the time was oh this is why people do golf the feeling of time stopping and the

23
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,760
feeling of just kind of fully almost like becoming the ball flying

24
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,360
through the air was uh was such a kind of wonderful

25
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:41,200
feeling of being standing there in harmony and with the natural world around me

26
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,920
so this idea of quieting the mind and

27
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,760
really being present for something in the wonder of this life that

28
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,879
is part of what can happen in meditation it's not easy of course for this to happen

29
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:05,440
but as we learn the art of release letting go quieting your thoughts

30
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,360
letting go of our thoughts one of the places that it's sometimes possible

31
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,599
to have the same kind of feeling as you would have i had watching the ball sail through the air

32
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,200
is is watching the breathing

33
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,920
kind of really but it's not so much the breathing that's so interesting as it is

34
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,400
when the mind becomes still and quiet and and the attention

35
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,760
is really just almost absorbed in the breathing or

36
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,080
becomes the breathing or there's no feeling of separation between awareness and breathing it's just like

37
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,879
in the in the breathing there's awareness in the breathing there's awareness in awareness there's breathing

38
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:01,680
and there's very little else going on or if there is it is receded far in the background

39
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,439
so to do that as i said

40
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,040
involves a quieting of the thinking mind and some people focus on the idea of

41
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:18,320
letting go of their thoughts or quieting their thoughts as a permanent thing to sit down and

42
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:27,040
you're able to quiet it but it might be more useful to think of it as happening in very small short

43
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,440
segments small little episodes that uh and to appreciate the small

44
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:40,000
maybe second half a second a moment when something about the thinking mind

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,759
has paused quietly there's a gap between thoughts and there what is that what is the

46
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,960
wondrous there what is it like to welcome or allow the breathing to

47
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,880
really sail through that awareness like the golf ball sailing through

48
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,400
the air so for this meditation

49
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,639
i'd like to suggest that the practice be a lot to do with letting go a lot of

50
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:17,280
these so you have a lot of these momentary episodes of letting go and being quiet

51
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,960
and so that more and more the awareness

52
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,639
is fully available for just the breathing so the awareness is not split between

53
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,919
thinking and trying to be with the breathing but that because when you're thinking

54
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:40,560
part of your awareness is dedicated to thinking and to let all that dedication of

55
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,880
awareness go into just breathing just breathing without any concern that

56
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:52,400
you're trying to do anything more than just um

57
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,520
allowing welcoming the experience of breathing into awareness

58
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:07,840
so i'll guide us through it a little bit here so taking in an upright posture

59
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,560
and lowering your gaze

60
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,560
and gently closing your eyes

61
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,919
and taking a few long slow deep breaths

62
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,440
and on the exhale relaxing

63
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,440
deep breath in and a releasing of

64
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,759
the shoulders the belly

65
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:06,160
maybe they also on the exhale that can be release of any holding in the small of the back

66
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:17,479
any tightening or holding in the thighs or the arms

67
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:42,919
and then to let your breathing return to normal

68
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,520
and with a normal breath not focusing so much on working at breathing

69
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,400
maybe there's more attention that can go to the subtlety of holding in your body

70
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,240
even the quiet subtle places where the body's tense or held

71
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,638
as you exhale relax let go

72
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:56,480
and also as you exhale to soften the mind

73
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:03,760
relax the thinking mind especially if you can identify any

74
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,160
tension pressure tightness

75
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,720
agitation physical agitation that's related connected to breathe to

76
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,720
thinking

77
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:35,640
maybe as you're breathing to relax let go of your thoughts

78
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:45,120
maybe you're thinking or like a piece of cloth that is

79
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:52,800
bunched up creased and as you exhale you're flattening it

80
00:09:52,800 --> 00:10:00,760
out straightening it out quieting the thinking mind

81
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:33,240
and then become aware of the transition from the exhale to the inhale

82
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,880
and in that transition welcome allow

83
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,760
yourself to receive the inhale

84
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:36,720
and as you exhale let go of your thoughts

85
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:46,880
and as you exhale and let go let go into

86
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,800
the body's exhale

87
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:00,160
see if see if you can in letting go of thoughts quieting thoughts

88
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,320
for a few couple of moments give your full attention

89
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,240
to the experience of the body exhaling

90
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,279
maybe like you're watching a ball flying through the air bird

91
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:25,720
flying through the air marveling

92
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,399
at this natural process of breathing

93
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:03,399
every time you exhale let go of your thinking

94
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,120
as if you're opening up a door or window

95
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,680
to let the breeze of exhaling

96
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,839
move through you

97
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:49,040
and with every exhale that you let go of your thinking don't concern yourself with how well you

98
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,560
can do this that's just more thinking

99
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:03,319
be content to do it the best that is available

100
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,000
appreciating whatever degree there's more awareness available

101
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,800
to receive the experience of inhale exhale

102
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,959
as if for these minutes meditating the most important thing to do the most

103
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:33,360
important thing happening is the body breathing

104
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,160
and you letting go of everything else

105
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:48,279
so you can attend a company your body breathing

106
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:09,279
feeling your way into the deeper places that you can let go

107
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:19,840
letting go and letting go into that and then letting go into your breathing

108
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,960
so

109
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,600
so

110
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,240
so then as we come to the end of sitting

111
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:24,080
one of the significant consequence of

112
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:31,360
letting go release is that we become available

113
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,960
to experience the gifts of this life

114
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,480
when the mind is preoccupied in thoughts and anxiety

115
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:49,760
there's little room to be available for the wonder

116
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,440
of our moment-to-moment life

117
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,000
and if we turn that availability of attention available to

118
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,039
see available to listen available to perceive and be with other

119
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:15,200
people perhaps people will more often be seen

120
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,520
as a gift as a wonder

121
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:29,320
maybe there's more ability to care and love have good will

122
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:38,480
to listen deeply to hear deeply to see deeply

123
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:45,279
others and perhaps as we come to the end of the

124
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:50,399
sitting you can imagine

125
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:58,120
in the best of circumstances what it's like to be

126
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:05,679
to let go deeply of your concerns your thoughts judgments

127
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:12,559
and to be available to others available in the sense available to

128
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:18,799
perceive them to see them to know them

129
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,520
so that they are seen clearly known clearly

130
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,440
and they feel safe they feel known they feel cared for

131
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:40,559
loved may it be that this meditation we do

132
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,080
always has a role

133
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,640
in the social world that we live in always has a role to

134
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,080
help make this a better world for ourselves and for others

135
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:04,480
may our ability to be available with our attention

136
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:11,760
support the welfare and happiness of others may all beings

137
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:19,200
be happy may all beings be safe

138
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,559
may all beings be peaceful

139
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,720
may all beings be free and may we

140
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:37,320
maybe in humble ways contribute to that

141
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:52,498
[Music]

142
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,600
hey

143
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:56,000
so on this fifth talk about mindfulness of breathing

144
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:04,399
the topic is release and now there is a saying in

145
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:14,120
english buddhist english maybe because it rhymes that release is peace

146
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:21,440
so there's something about the proper or appropriate way of letting go

147
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,880
that leads to peace it leads to

148
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,600
an availability when attention is hijacked

149
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,840
by our preoccupations excuse me here

150
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,880
i don't have the mute button for the time being so i have to hopefully take the mic away

151
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,240
from my mouth took off clear my throat so

152
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,559
to um to let go properly you were letting go of the things that

153
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:12,399
preoccupy our attention or awareness so awareness becomes more available

154
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:19,679
as awareness becomes more available we're available to what is happening

155
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,559
and some of those things are uncomfortable suffering or challenges

156
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:33,200
and there's something very special about being available to see it perceive it to know it

157
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,559
as opposed to not being available which kind of implies or leads to maybe feeling

158
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:44,000
like it's a problem or it's right to fix it or feeling oppressed by it

159
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,279
just available oh this is difficult it also helps us to be available for

160
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:56,799
love to be able to love or care or have good will to be friendly

161
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:03,440
and so this idea of letting go letting go gives lends us it gives us

162
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,878
all these wonderful gifts and the gifts of being available to the world

163
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,960
it's a wonderful feeling to really be present walking and be available rather than asserting ourselves into the world

164
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:21,280
and you know seeing the world through my our wants and our fears and our aversions

165
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,960
but being available to what's happening is um

166
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:33,280
also tends to lend itself to um much more perceived that this world is a

167
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,800
gift what happens rather than a right

168
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:43,919
or a should or something

169
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,000
so how does this relate to mindfulness of breathing as we

170
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,800
settle down in meditation and settle into something it doesn't have to be the breathing some primary focus

171
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:03,280
that's appropriate for us and so breathing is for many people works as we settle down into the breathing

172
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:10,560
that and more and more of our attention is able to stay with the breathing more we let go of our preoccupations our

173
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,000
thoughts um if they're easy enough to let go of just let go and come back to the

174
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:23,680
breathing let go and let go into the breathing let go and receive the experience of breathing

175
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:30,800
and root ourselves in the breathing the more that attention is available for breathing the more the

176
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:37,280
sense of availability the feeling of being available comes and the less we are caught up in the

177
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:44,800
world of thoughts of ideas of experiences memories few projections into the future

178
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,480
that tend to be agitating and and so we're more available

179
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:57,119
attention becomes more available for the breathing but as it becomes more available for the breathing the reciprocal aspect of that

180
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:03,040
is that we're less caught up and and so the more you're able to focus on

181
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:09,119
the breathing the more there is also kind of a natural letting go or letting things fall away or no longer being

182
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,880
involved in them so sometimes we let go of thoughts and sometimes we just hold the course

183
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:22,560
with the breathing staying with the breath and less energy than is given to the preoccupations

184
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:29,520
and as more attention goes to the breathing the more awareness gets gathered it gets available it's present

185
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:36,079
it's not kind of caught up in things which are not so healthy for us

186
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:42,000
now the opposite you know this the benefit of

187
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,400
breathing on meditation isn't just that we can do it but when we're the sense of availability

188
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,599
also means we're available to what makes it difficult to be with the breathing

189
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,640
and there are powerful forces in us that keep us distracted keep us caught up in

190
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:04,800
thoughts keep us swirling in our emotional life

191
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:12,640
those should be respected deeply and they're not should be dismissed or feel like they're you know unwanted

192
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:19,040
but to let go of what's easy enough to let go of or to stay focused on the breath in the way

193
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:25,520
that's relatively easy to stay focused and then being available

194
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:32,079
for for seeing more clearly what's going on in us and that's one of the values of

195
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:38,800
meditation and breathing is not being successful at the breathing staying with the breathing but how the

196
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,880
effort to be with the breathing highlights more what's really happening for us

197
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,640
if we're some people are so distracted by their distractions they don't know they're distracted

198
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,960
but if we have this reference point of of attempting to be with a breath

199
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,640
don't if even if you're not able to do it much just the effort to do it

200
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,920
is beneficial if it shows us much more clearly what it is is happening for us that

201
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:13,760
keeps us away from breathing the preoccupations we have and then this idea of being available

202
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,040
for that oh so this too should be cared for should be

203
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:25,520
should be you know loved in a certain kind of way and uh so in the next weeks i'll talk

204
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,960
about mindfulness of the body mindfulness of emotions mindfulness thinking that

205
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:37,760
is kind of how we practice with the things that are revealed

206
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:43,359
as we attempt to do mindfulness of breathing but these other things then get highlighted

207
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:48,400
and so sometimes it's a completely appropriate to not stay with the breath it's kind of

208
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,599
to fight against everything else and stay with the breath is counterproductive

209
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:58,800
and so the art of learning to let go of breathing sometimes to attend to these other things

210
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:05,599
is part of what you know i'll be teaching over the next few weeks but for now the topic is a

211
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,280
release with breathing and if you're able to kind of really settle in

212
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:17,760
get gather yourself on the breathing there's a natural process of things being let go of or

213
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,200
our concerns of the day the memories the the resentments we have that for the

214
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,560
time being kind of get forgotten and one of the values of meditation

215
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:34,880
something simple as breathing over and over coming back to the breathing is the way that um

216
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,640
the kind of a cleansing kind of emptying of the preoccupations of the day the

217
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,960
momentum of in the mind that goes on and so there's kind of a release that goes on

218
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:54,079
and sometimes it's appropriate to support that release by a little bit of active efforts at letting go

219
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:59,520
and uh and that i i see that the exhaled maybe other people would be the inhale

220
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:05,040
but for me it's the exhale that is a wonderful place to let go of my thoughts

221
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:11,760
it's amazing uh till to this day how thoughts kind of sneak in quietly

222
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:18,160
through the back door of the mind so that uh sometimes i don't really notice that i started to think again

223
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:26,000
and um but by every time i begin exhaling it's a time to kind of notice

224
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,359
in my thinking and if it's easy enough to let go and let go into the breathing

225
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:40,560
to let go into a receiving of the experience of breath and if i can let go with the exhale

226
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:47,760
then i'm more available more present to be able to receive the gift of the inhale the arising the

227
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,200
appearing of the inhalation as it occurs

228
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,240
and this rhythm of letting go with the exhale and receiving on the

229
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:05,359
inhale sometimes is a wonderful way of supporting this process of release

230
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:11,599
and um but in this way that i'm talking now about uh letting go on the exhale

231
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:17,200
it puts a lot of agency in the meditator like this is what that meditator is supposed to do

232
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:22,400
and that also kind of can keep us agitated and keep us kind of preoccupied

233
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:29,920
and so sometimes we want to kind of try to do this with a very light touch without expectation without need for

234
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:36,000
anything really to happen without using it to judge ourselves or to be in

235
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,319
a hurry as if we have lots of time in the world and uh and sometimes if there's too much

236
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:47,680
self going on and efforting then sometimes it's easier just to kind of

237
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:53,520
just simply very simplistically stay with the breath the best you can

238
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,680
hang in there gather yourself on the breathing and don't worry so much about letting go

239
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:06,800
the letting go will happen by itself the more we get gathered around the experience of breathing

240
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:13,200
and uh and then as we keep practicing that time will come it will feel obvious

241
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,480
that the right thing to do is to let go that it's such a healthy thing to let go

242
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,800
of what is unhealthy when it's not helpful what it diminishes us or brings that more

243
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:31,920
agitation into us and the quieter the mind becomes the more peaceful we are the more we can see

244
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,200
oh here i'm getting involved in that thought again i've done that a thousand times i don't

245
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:42,560
need to do that and let go and then let go back into

246
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:48,319
letting go into back into the breathing coming back just breathing in and breathing out

247
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:53,839
and uh the deeper we go in meditation the more that experience can be

248
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:59,440
characterized as a release either that something so released that's very

249
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:06,640
gradual over time or something that's very clear like a big shift that happens

250
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:13,680
suddenly there's a little like quantum shift boom and now we're here in a fuller way and embodied in a fuller way

251
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:20,640
or something um but release release is peace

252
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:27,839
release helps us become available for our experience in our life and the people in our life

253
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:33,839
that availability makes us available to know suffering

254
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:39,680
more intimately clearly but not as to suffer more

255
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:45,119
but to care more to meet it in a new way maybe with love

256
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:51,520
there's something about the availability to the challenging aspects of our life the

257
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:58,800
suffering that can give rise to real real love and compassion and care

258
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:05,839
good will and love supports letting go

259
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:11,200
letting go to be available to be available to feel

260
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:19,520
the fullness of this life all the aspects more fully and then perhaps to love some more

261
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,880
and so we go around and around and i hope that

262
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,800
you will trust mindfulness of breathing give yourself over to it if you continue

263
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:36,960
meditating through the weekend really kind of trust it and be intimate with it and

264
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:43,119
see if some of what i'm talking about can uh you can feel or sense

265
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:48,880
in the in the very very simplicity of mindfulness or breathing

266
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,880
and then on monday we'll talk about um

267
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,760
we'll talk about mindfulness of the body

268
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:10,599
and uh and have a week on that so thank you all very much
