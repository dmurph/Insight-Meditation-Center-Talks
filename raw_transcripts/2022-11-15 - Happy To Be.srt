00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:02,600
inherent dissatisfaction that human beings have

20
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,879
so all beings have duka all beings want to be free from dukkha I

21
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,099
want to be free from suffering all beings

22
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:25,879

for each other not just human beings all beings insects

24
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,700
Scurry away when they feel your

25
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,200
approach

26
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:57,019
and we also share a desire kind of the two sides of one coin

27
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:03,379
the desire to be happy we want to be happy

28
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,440
we want to be at ease and peaceful

29
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,440
have some sense of well-being which is like

30
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,000
a quality of love we have some

31
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,099
some intrinsic love

32
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,000
that wants to be happy once our loved ones to be happy

33
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,400

34
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,780
yeah we share this love isn't that wonderful we share love

35
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,879

36
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:57,739

39
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,040

40
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,699
um who

41
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,740

43
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:52,220
this all this come about this

44
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,180
what am I

45
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:11,240
there's a a saying by Miller repatis is a saint

46
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:17,479
a national treasure in Tibet said something like

47
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,860
strong and healthy we don't think of sickness

48
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,759
until sickness strikes like lightning

49
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,740
caught up in the world we don't consider death until death strikes like

50
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,979
thunder

51
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,900
thank you so those are other things that we share

52
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:00,840
very soon older than most of you here but very soon all of you you know it's

53
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,660
like sick

54
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,880
won't be able to sit here and meditate

55
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:24,600
so um that's saying

56
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:30,240
that observation was meant to like well let's not waste time

57
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,500
here let's do what let's let's uh we don't have much time here

58
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:45,020
what do you want to do with this time do you want to get distracted until you get sick

59
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:52,759
do you wanna go

60
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:59,060
none of us want to get involved with the five poisons that you know greed and

61
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:05,940
hatred and jealousy and pride and all these things that hurt we don't want to

62
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:09,560
do that but sometimes we just

63
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,240
we want to you know spend this time maybe maybe

64
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,199
well something think about what

65
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:33,060
what really matters to you what do you want from this time honestly

66
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:41,120
truthfully which meaningful to you

67
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,620
the Buddha was amazing he

68
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,259
he had what many people would consider

69
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:03,919
um the perfect life

70
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,880
he had what many consider he had everything people some people would say you know according to the human value

71
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:17,400
system the worldly value system [Applause] he had wealth

72
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,400
sensual Pleasures his father um an oracle had told his father that

73
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:31,620
you're going to have a son who is going to take two two paths one of two paths One path

74
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:38,240
is going to be he will be like you our great king

75
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:46,099
with power over many kingdoms revered respected feared by

76
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,720
many people and or he'll become a renunciate he'll

77
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,500
become a sage a spiritual a monk a spiritual Seeker

78
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,040
and his father didn't want that

79
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:12,079
so he created this you know

80
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:18,839
Haven of Earthly Delights he was not exposed to any suffering whatsoever even

81
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:26,880
a nice sense pervaded the castle and music and art and

82
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:35,700
loving family and and he was the best at Athletics he was he was so smart and loved by his parents

83
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:43,500
and haddock wonder he had a family he had a loving wife and

84
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,540
one son rahula and uh

85
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:53,940
but then he went into the town unbeknownst by his

86
00:09:53,940 --> 00:10:00,959
father I forget how old he was maybe 30 I don't know and it's late 20s

87
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:07,940
and he saw sickness he saw somebody who was

88
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:14,720
um foreign

89
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:22,260
I forget what the sickness was I forget how that was but it was clearly he said what someone was apparently very

90
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:28,980
apparently ill and asked his chariots here what's going on

91
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:34,380
there I've never seen that before and he said well that man's really sick

92
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:41,519
and then he saw an old man and what's going on there I've never seen that before well

93
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:48,600
human beings get old then he saw a corpse being carried

94
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,700
through the village what's going on there what's that all

95
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:58,519
about well human beings die

96
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:07,380
and then he he saw a man in with a shaved head and robes and

97
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:14,339
walking peacefully through the village who what's that who's that and he said well that's a spiritual Seeker that's a sage

98
00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:16,700
he

99
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:29,660
so this this hit him

100
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:39,720
this struck struck him deeply that

101
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,240
that human beings get old and they get sick and they die

102
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:52,399
and he wanted to he was became obsessed with what is going on here

103
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:59,519
and and whatever he was was happening with him before these Earthly Pleasures these Earthly Delights

104
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,820
and and you know reputation and so forth

105
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,420
they paled in comparison to this this question of

106
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,200
who am I what am I what's meaningful

107
00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:24,019
foreign and um

108
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,899
so he left the castle left his family behind

109
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:37,820
and uh wore robes and uh

110
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:45,959
he pursued yogic practices the most strenuous yogic practices that

111
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:51,000
were going on in India the greatest teachers and he surpassed all of his teachers

112
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,120
and they shall get practices and so he had no answer to these questions it didn't it didn't really

113
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,360
resolve anything and then he

114
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,459
did concentration practices John is

115
00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:18,440
and he surpassed all of his Masters in these concentration practices and he went you know into deep levels of

116
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:25,279
space and peace and nothingness

117
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:33,720
and he would always come out of those so what nothing's happened

118
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,000
here nothing's happened to me I I don't I'm no further along in understanding

119
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,820
what's going on here this mystery

120
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:50,519
of finding meaning of finding who I am of what's

121
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,540
truly important

122
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:06,120
and then he he was

123
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:11,700
had five friends who were ascetics and they were practicing extreme

124
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:18,000
asceticism they didn't really even want to eat they barely ate

125
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,899
and that didn't all these practices all these Pursuits

126
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:31,519
didn't bring him any peace didn't bring bring him any resolution

127
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:42,320
and he was so thin it was like a skeleton it was said that there are there was a mustard seed could

128
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,779
separate his spine from his belly and he almost passed out by the side of

129
00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:54,360
a river I hope this is okay I'm telling you this long story

130
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,920
it uh it'll come to a punch line pretty soon

131
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:07,980
[Applause] um so this shepherdist was watching him from

132
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:15,660
across the river and she understood what a great Sage he must be you know

133
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:21,779
and she saw him almost die almost collapsed by the river skeleton and so she she crossed her her

134
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:30,120
name was sujata she crossed the river and brought him a bowl of rice milk

135
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,699
and she said venerable sir would you accept my offering

136
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:42,779
of some rice milk and the Aesthetics were around him and they

137
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:49,560
were just appalled they would not be drinking this bowl of rice milk but he did he said

138
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:56,519
okay I will he and he he drank it and he revived

139
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:03,139
a little bit and then he went over and they left

140
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:09,380
disgusted and they and he went over and sat by a tree

141
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:16,860
and he gave up he had just given up on all this driving

142
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:23,300
all the wanting to become all the wanting to get rid of

143
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,899
get rid of negative states of Mind get rid of

144
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:39,199
thoughts get rid of

145
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:47,100
distractions get rid of

146
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,500
maybe everything emotions

147
00:16:53,339 --> 00:17:01,259
he gave it up and he just sat by that tree and a memory came to him when he was

148
00:17:01,259 --> 00:17:08,160
seven years old just an innocent sitting by a tree watching his father do

149
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,799
plowing exercises out in the fields

150
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:19,040
so this is what I'm getting to he just gave up

151
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:28,100
he just sat there and he gave up gave up striving

152
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:38,720
and he just became himself

153
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:48,360
gave out trying to become somebody else

154
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:54,900
trying to become some goal some some something other

155
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,299
something other than just this

156
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:12,620
and he became enlightened something wonderful

157
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:18,720
dawned on him and he had a lot of he had a lot of very positive Karma that

158
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,179
had been built up that allowed him to have this fantastic experience but it

159
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:30,260
just it just came over him just this enlightenment

160
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,960
just by being himself

161
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:49,020
and he he said this is peaceful

162
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:57,919
this is he described who he was like this you know what he'd been looking for all these all this time

163
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,039
this is peaceful

164
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:11,840
not even me just this this is profound this is natural he said

165
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,860
this is beyond Concepts

166
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,220
so this is Luminous words like that you know who knows

167
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:31,940
exactly what he said but these are some words that have been passed down

168
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:45,919
and um he sat with that he sat at ease with that

169
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:54,980
there's a story about a rabbi his name was zuzia

170
00:19:55,020 --> 00:20:00,480
and he was a great Rabbi he had so many you know congregants that adored him and

171
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,539
he he would people would give him gifts and money he'd give everything he'd always

172
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:11,880
give everything away and he's his family it was penniless lived in utter poverty

173
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,700
and whatever and then he came as well he was yeah

174
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,520
just a totally kind man totally good man

175
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,900
and when he was dying

176
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:36,299
his congregates were all gathered around him as he was dying

177
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:43,740
and he was crying and he's his congregants would say Susie

178
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:49,919
why are you crying he said I'm afraid to go to heaven they

179
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,960
said why are you afraid to go to heaven you'll present yourself to God you've been

180
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,320
you've been as kind as Abraham you've been as wise and just as Moses you've

181
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,639
been a Supreme Being

182
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:11,700
he said I'm not afraid that God will ask me zuzia why weren't you more

183
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:17,400
like Abraham why weren't you more like Moses he'll ask

184
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,799
why weren't you more like azusia

185
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:38,100
this um craving that we have

186
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,158
to uh

187
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:52,380
create some kind of superior self or uh

188
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,539
get rid of inferior selves

189
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:04,919
or to Adorn this self with praise from others with reputation with achievements

190
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:11,000
hoping for all these adornments of self

191
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,820
I think it's safe to say these are common to all of us we want to be praised we want to be

192
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:26,100
liked we want to have a good reputation we want to achieve we want nice things we want pleasures

193
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,240
for this self

194
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:37,440
all about the self we don't want to be criticized we hate to be criticized

195
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,539
we hate to be judged we judge ourselves

196
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:51,539
we hate to fail all these worldly

197
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:56,120
Endeavors that have to that that are

198
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:03,260
have to do with a dualistic

199
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:11,159
perspective that there's this me

200
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:17,100
and other and I want this me to be

201
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:26,600
um acquires be seen and so forth

202
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,760
foreign

203
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:45,500
s of the self the

204
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,400
the pain and the suffering around

205
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,179
the self is something that's addressed by

206
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:09,620
all Buddha Dharma it's the problem the self is the problem

207
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:29,120
and when zuzia wanted to be himself

208
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:37,380
and when the Buddha let go of all striving

209
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:43,320
to become and seriously

210
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,360
all is striving to be like Abraham to be like Moses to be like the other

211
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:55,320
Patriarchs just to be himself is like a no self

212
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:58,399
it's like giving up

213
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:09,200
and just relaxing into whatever this is

214
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:20,960
in the avadan tradition it's called no self

215
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:27,740
and the Zen tradition or the Mahayana tradition it's called emptiness

216
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:35,159
in the vajrayana tradition it's called

217
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:41,580
the dharmacaya understanding

218
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,640
that we aren't a self

219
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:55,740
and the more we understand that and the more we let go

220
00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:02,600
of our grasping to self

221
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,700
and our aversions to what's not validating the self that

222
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:15,779
we want to be validated the more we let go of this this kind of

223
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:23,659
dualistic perspective and come back to

224
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:27,500
what is really no self at all

225
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:36,360
it's like the degree we can do that is the degree that we are relieved of

226
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:42,659
suffering is the degree that we are happy there's a

227
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:49,020
a correlation the less we think about concerned about strive about

228
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:54,559
ourselves the more at ease we are doesn't that make sense

229
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:13,460
so it's like we don't have to do anything at all

230
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:33,900
foreign just to be

231
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,679
is enough

232
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:48,679
just to be foreign

233
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,520
there's this great master and he was

234
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:18,059
speaking to a large congregation he was on a platform Podium or whatever

235
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:26,480
and giving a speech and giving a talk to his followers and

236
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:33,480
over to his side was the president of the congregation and he said my dear

237
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,480
my dear follow the followers my my dear Congress

238
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:45,860
I've come here today to tell you something very important very profound

239
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:53,480
and then he started to cry tears came into his eyes he says

240
00:28:53,580 --> 00:29:00,179
I have finally discovered that I am nothing

241
00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:07,679
and then he started to cry and there was silence in the auditorium people were in rap just looking what's

242
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:14,539
going on here and um

243
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:22,020
then the president walks over to him and and he addresses the congregants and he said

244
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:29,460
you know I've been president you're president for for so many years and I followed the Great Master and

245
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:36,779
and he said and I too I I've I've finally plumbed The Depths and I realized that I am nothing

246
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:42,240
and he's crying too and people just don't just don't know

247
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:49,799
what to think they're struck and then from the back of the of the

248
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:55,559
hallway and the rear of this old small man who'd been the janitor

249
00:29:55,559 --> 00:30:01,380
cleaning up there or taking care of the building for 30 years 40 years a long time

250
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:09,960
he was so moved and he he fell to his knees from the back of the hall and he he yelled out I am nothing I am nothing

251
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,480
I know that I'm nothing and he was crying

252
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:22,559
and the uh president goes up to the Great Master and he says so look who thinks he's

253
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,919
nothing

254
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:41,480
yeah so there can be spiritual materialism as well as worldly materialism

255
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:53,220
but to examine this this idea

256
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:58,980
and I'm not sure how helpful this is to you but um

257
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:07,380
this idea of no self this idea of emptiness

258
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:16,820
but it's like a bit of a scientific proof we're clearly not our bodies

259
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:23,700
I'm holding out of my hands if you feel your fingers you feel the the pulsations in your

260
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:30,000
fingers the uh the body's changing

261
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,279
on a micro level it's just pulsing pulsing the whole body is

262
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:41,658
in constant change from microsecond to microsecond

263
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,559
the blood going through the system the digestion of food

264
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:54,179
on a macro a little bit more of a macro level the the breath is

265
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:57,500
constantly changing

266
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:06,860
we're always changing our form is always despised so we are not this body

267
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:17,120
I was a little boy not too long ago look what look what I am now an older man

268
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:25,799
so you're not your body you're not your mind your thoughts are

269
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:32,159
like butterflies flickering and flickering and flickering changing every what were you thinking

270
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:37,620
30 seconds ago just

271
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:44,340
thoughts thoughts thoughts we often think we're I'm this thought

272
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:51,140
I'm that thought I'm just this happened to me and you know

273
00:32:54,179 --> 00:33:00,559
but it changes very very quickly even the most stuck thoughts give way very

274
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:08,600
relatively quickly and the thoughts are tea bags for our feelings

275
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:18,659
so they change a little more slowly but what were you feeling a half hour ago

276
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:21,919
what are you feeling now

277
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:32,419
and if you listen what are you hearing

278
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:41,779
and you can sense the changing you can't grasp

279
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:51,000
and you know seeing we think we're seeing something but really I'm seeing Pieces Just My my

280
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,080
focus is always changing we're in a state of just

281
00:33:57,539 --> 00:34:03,320
complete change all the time

282
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,919
so we're not our sense perceptions we're not our thoughts our mental formations

283
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:15,440
we're not our body

284
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:30,440
what are we what are you this is the question that was driving the Buddha

285
00:34:42,899 --> 00:34:49,440
from a scientific perspective quantum physics tells us that we are

286
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:55,800
particles that the particles that make up this this

287
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:01,800
are the same particles that are everywhere they've looked at under a

288
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:08,640
whatever a microscope super magnifying glass

289
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:17,660
it's all the same and what's more the particles are

290
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:26,220
made up of subatomic the atoms are made up of subatomic particles that are made up of some and it goes on at infant

291
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:33,180
items so that you so that actually you cannot see you cannot see a particle

292
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:41,180
and they're moving at thousands hundreds of thousands time of times the speed of light

293
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:49,380
and to add insult to injury there 99.999 space

294
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,819
these particles that we are

295
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:07,140
so in a way we're like uh that great Master we are nothing

296
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:14,660
we are nobody and we have nothing because it's all just all yeah changing

297
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:27,740
so that's a very cognitive you know that's a thought but but

298
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,380
it's it's true you know you when we think about this

299
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:42,440
it's we can we can contemplation is is a

300
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:50,700
very healthy part of our spiritual practice inquiry

301
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:58,440
to get down to it what really is here who am I

302
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:04,680
what's worthwhile why am I practicing what do I want

303
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,460
it's important

304
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,480
for Buddha conclude just

305
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,740
to be

306
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,640
just to relax to let go

307
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:43,519
to not try to become some

308
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:50,420
illusion that we're pursuing

309
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:58,500
and just be like space open

310
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,339
empty

311
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,740
but we are not nothing

312
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:34,640
yeah we can see and hear and

313
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,079
more vividly vividly

314
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:46,880
alive present

315
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:54,320
wonderful it's wonderful what we are

316
00:38:55,619 --> 00:39:03,500
we're conscious as we were meditating just now I was

317
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,420
reflecting on

318
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:15,839
the Buddha described we well we have this awareness we have this

319
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:22,280
you know we're conscious and I was I was looking to think all of you are conscious

320
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:29,599
you know we're conscious of hearing conscious of sight

321
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:35,779
conscious of thinking conscious of feeling

322
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,359
conscious of our the Buddha named eight consciousnesses

323
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:54,440
and besides the five sense doors there was just thinking

324
00:39:54,660 --> 00:40:00,180
and then he had a whole separate category for self

325
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:07,020
self me me me thoughts and feelings and impulses the

326
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:12,300
meaning the meaning the selfing consciousness wonderful I have this self in

327
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:19,440
consciousness and then the afflictions the habitual

328
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,099
afflictions

329
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:35,160
so this is another just just looking whatever you know when today just looking around what what

330
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:42,300
Consciousness were you involved with at the time were you involved with consciousness of

331
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,820
an Affliction like low self-esteem

332
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:57,359
or were you conscious of the breath sensory perception

333
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:00,078
or hearing

334
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,560
so we can

335
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:22,400
when we relax and be

336
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:32,540
we are also not just empty not just nothing

337
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:39,020
but we are vividly luminous

338
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:50,119
so anybody you have any questions or

339
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:56,579
foreign comments any thoughts have been

340
00:41:56,579 --> 00:41:59,720
raised in you

341
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:29,880
just hold it up like thank you David for the discussion uh oh

342
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,400
sorry okay um um I really like the part where you

343
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:43,320
mentioned uh what was like our level of or at least my level of Consciousness as I was

344
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:49,020
sitting and meditating uh and it just allowed me to think about

345
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:54,599
when I am attempting to sit in my striving for something or am I conscious

346
00:42:54,599 --> 00:43:01,380
of the breath or whatever it is that I'm trying to or not focus on so thank you

347
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:07,260
for helping me be aware of that so you know it's good to have the the

348
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:10,160
breath as a support

349
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:21,720
but not as a goal this is the support to be conscious to be aware

350
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:29,400
a supportive Consciousness a supportive being here just being

351
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:37,800
simply not to be the best best breath meditator in the world

352
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:43,140
just the support to be simple humble

353
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:57,078
thank you
