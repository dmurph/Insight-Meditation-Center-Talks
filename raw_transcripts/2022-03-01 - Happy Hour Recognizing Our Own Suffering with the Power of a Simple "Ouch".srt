7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,040
last time on friday it was long long ago

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,879
we explored the practice of compassion

9
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:57,120
combined with mindfulness of the breath anapanasati mindfulness of the breath

10
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,920
and um really figure figuring that combining those two

11
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,560
practices uh is a way to practice tongue glen which is this beautiful compassion

12
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:18,000
practice in um [Music] in the later schools of buddhism

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,560
so so for today um let us continue practicing prac the

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:36,078
engaging with the practices of compassion for ourselves for others um for

15
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,799
however we are doing in this moment or have been doing the challenges

16
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:49,439
and the goodnesses as well as for other beings it is said that

17
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,570
this famous quote be kind for

18
00:01:54,570 --> 00:02:02,240
[Music] for everyone you meet is fighting a difficult battle

19
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,560
for everyone you meet is fighting a difficult battle

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,360
at times we might think oh everybody has it figured out they're just

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,120
as happy as a climb in this shell and they have no problems in their world in their life

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,879
and oh it's only me only me poor me oh but guess what

23
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,840
everybody everybody in this in this life in this

24
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,879
world is fighting a tough battle in different ways we may not know

25
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,160
what other people are dealing with we only know our

26
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:54,560
psyche we only know our bodies we only know our story

27
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,239
but but but so

28
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:08,080
so cultivating compassion cultivating kindness can we bring more kindness to ourselves

29
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:14,400
can we bring more kindness to others can we imbue every interaction with kindness with

30
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,519
compassion knowing that everyone is having a tough time

31
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,280
in some way i mean we all have a you know put on a facade of yeah

32
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,599
everything is going well and maybe things are going well not to say everything it's challenge everything is doom and groom i don't want to give that

33
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,720
impression at all there are many many joys there are ten thousand joys and ten

34
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,200
thousand sorrows so appreciating the joys in our lives

35
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,840
bowing the joys the goodness

36
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,519
and and also having tenderness instead of taking out

37
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,560
the whip and self-flagellating ah having tenderness

38
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,560
and maybe i'll i'll add one last thing before turning our practice towards compassion is that

39
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,959
um if you forget everything i say tonight

40
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,680
remember one thing whenever you're having

41
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,800
a difficult time whenever you're hurting whenever

42
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:34,160
it's it seems hard either your body seems hard life seems hard

43
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:41,440
something seems hard we often don't recognize that we often

44
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,720
not to say every time but we often don't recognize that we often think ah

45
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,720
this is terrible you know get it together come on get let's get going you're not you're not

46
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,680
working hard enough you're being sharp enough or you're doing so we actually respond to when we're having a tough

47
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:07,360
time with trying to push ourselves further and or or turning

48
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:14,479
towards what is is challenging either with harshness with it shouldn't be this way pushing it away either pushing

49
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:21,440
ourselves away you're bad or pushing the difficulty away

50
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:30,080
that ouch that we feel that ouch is a signal ouch i'm hurting

51
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,160
right now i'm hurting right now this is hard this is hard

52
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,639
this is the time to bring in compassion ouch i'm hurting right now

53
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:50,000
this is hard and when we learn that we can also be the same way with others

54
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,319
ouch they're hurting right now they're having a hard time they're not just being difficult they're

55
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:02,639
having a hard time this is the best they can do given the causes and conditions

56
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,000

now i'd like to invite you if you would bring to mind something

87
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:46,079
from today it could be in this moment perhaps

88
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:54,079
something that was challenging for you in your body in your mind

89
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:00,959
the emotional space perhaps or physical space relational space

90
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:08,400
maybe it was an instance where you didn't quite recognize you were suffering

91
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,640
and instead you took out the proverbial stick and

92
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:22,839
started to beat yourself up for not being enough

93
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:38,320
no such an instance comes to mind it's okay maybe it's just something that was

94
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:47,840
challenging for you or is challenging physically maybe a pain ache emotionally

95
00:17:51,840 --> 00:18:00,200
see if you can really recognize the ouch ouch sweetheart

96
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,480
this is hard anyone anyone [Music]

97
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:14,799
going through this would be having a hard time this is not easy

98
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:22,000
just like anyone else would be hurting would be

99
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,679
feeling challenged i too just like anyone else

100
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:35,120
feel challenged hurt tender

101
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:43,080
by this recognizing the ouch it's not your weakness you're not bad

102
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:50,399
so many causes and conditions have together have come together this is difficult

103
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,520
and is it possible to recognize this

104
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,720
recognize yourself and hold yourself with care

105
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:09,000
as if you're holding a younger version of yourself

106
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:24,400
just having a hard time and recognize them in this image

107
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,279
there's both the honoring of the strength

108
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:38,160
of the empowered you the older you the one who is a source of compassion as well as

109
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:46,880
honoring acknowledging the tenderness the hurt both of them together

110
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:54,320
not just the hurt not just the strength both together

111
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,039
and see if a loving

112
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,840
version of you can hold a younger perhaps

113
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,679
tender challenged version of you it's okay sweetheart it's okay this is

if you could have done any better if you could do any better

122
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,280
given all the causes and conditions

123
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,880

124
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:31,799

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:12,480
in war zones with lack of safety with uncertainty

166
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,800
oh dear fellow human beings

167
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,919

168
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:34,560
can't even fathom wish you ease

169
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,760
wish you safety may you be free

170
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,398
from this sorrow this pain this challenge

171

you have ease grace in the midst of

172
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:03,000
this difficulty holding witness with each breath

173
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:15,799
holding witness without toppling into sorrow and grief

174
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,079
holding witness with each breath

175
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:35,119
surya khan said oh if only my monks robes were wide enough

176
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,720
if only my robes were wide enough

177
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:48,079
to cover to protect all the suffering beings in this entire

178
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,079
world

179
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:12,040
holding witness with care with compassion with each breath

180
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,280
machine safety and ease

181
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:54,560
may all pinks everywhere all pigs in all conditions

182
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,760

183
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:06,800
may all beings everywhere have ease and they have well-being may they be

184
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:13,520

185
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:22,040
difficulties may they be happy may they be free

186
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:40,099
[Music]

187
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:53,920
thank you for your practice everyone

188
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,359
so today's practice we started as always

189
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:11,119
by landing by arriving and the offering tonight which you can

190
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:17,440
take if it was helpful for you was the three r's

191
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:23,200
releasing releasing thoughts releasing the mind

192
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:30,240
relaxing the body and taking refuge in the heart

193
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,760
then we turned our attention to something that was challenging for

194
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,520
ourselves to recognize the out and to hold that with care with compassion

195
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:46,720
not with judgment then we turned our attention our

196
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:54,160
awareness to someone we had an interaction with today to hold them with care and compassion

197
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:00,000
and then we extend it to all beings especially those who are

198
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,119
in living [Music] in war zones

199
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:11,760
in the war zone especially at this time of turmoil in our world

200
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:18,079
and and many invitations along the way and

201
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:25,119
i'd love to hear what worked what didn't and especially if you haven't shared if you haven't

202
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:31,680
spoken for a while if you have put your voice in the space i invite you

203
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:37,839
to pull back from raising your hand you're welcome to type in chat

204
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:44,560
and if you haven't spoken for a while i'd love to invite you to pull forward

205
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:50,720
what did you observe what happened for the benefit of yourself to be held witness

206
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:56,880
and for the benefit of others if there was a discovery an aha moment

207
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,200
or maybe that was something that was challenging

208
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,760
and if you type in chat if you type to me alone i won't read your name it'll be private

209
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:17,280
reflection if it's typed to everyone i'll read your name as it is public

210
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:24,720
and as i'm waiting if you wish to share for with others what's come up for you

211
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,920
um [Music] say that one thing i invited you to

212
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:36,319
notice was the sense of of nourishment the sense of feeling good

213
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:43,200
when we extend when behold with compassion what's arising for us

214
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:50,480
challenges and also what's arising for others difficulty of others it can be quite healing soothing

215
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:56,319
compassion feels good the practice of compassion it's not supposed to be sad

216
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:02,960
or difficult or painful that's empathetic distress that's when we fall

217
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,160
into sorrow without balancing it with kindness and good will

218
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,440
so did you notice did you notice this nourishment of ease of

219
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:20,720
sucker of soothing again if you haven't shared in a while

220
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,480
you're welcome to raise your hand

221
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:34,040
say if you haven't spoken last week and the chat is open too

222
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:53,760
bill says tried feeling compassion for someone i had a bad interaction with

223
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,160
felt guilty instead then went back to trying to feel compassion for myself

224
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,839
great great

225
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:11,040
yay bill that is very wise that is very wise because we don't always have

226
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:16,160
control over the emotions that come up you know you're trying to feel compassion and

227
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:22,000
then you feel guilty like you can't and brilliant that you then you turned to

228
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:30,079
yourself with compassion like oh dear feeling guilty ouch this is painful ouch this

229
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:37,839
instead of well i'm not supposed to feel guilty this is what's not supposed to come up so great beautiful

230
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:43,119
one more um reflection my fear and my nurturing both

231
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:48,400
come from my heart so i found myself holding my heart with my heart oh that's

232
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:56,040
lovely thank you for that reflection beautiful esther

233
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:06,079
oh hi hi um i attended a prayer session this morning

234
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:14,560
for ukraine and uh people were sending compassion

235
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:22,880
to all involved and uh i noticed i got

236
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:29,280
very angry when one person was offering

237
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,359
good wishes to putin

238
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:41,799
so much judgment came up so much anger

239
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,800
i i couldn't go there i mean i couldn't go to feeling compassion for prudence

240
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,040
but as i'm sitting here thinking about it i could feel compassion for the person who

241
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:00,160
was saying that uh

242
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:05,440
and of course for everyone who's suffering in that in that warsaw

243
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,359
yeah yeah yeah i appreciate you praying the dubas

244
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:17,599
there so so what i heard you say is that the prayer service you attended for ukraine and

245
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:22,880
someone was offering compassion for putin and that brought up anger for you

246
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,960
and and you know how could you have compassion for this person who's causing harm and

247
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:35,280
and yet there was compassion for the person who did that and for everyone who's impacted did i hear that correctly

248
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,319
ascension um it was actually i was

249
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:46,480
i'm not sure if i heard you correctly i wasn't i was feeling compassion for the person

250
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,040
who was offering compassion for approval here's

251
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:59,520
yeah yeah thanks for sharing that and it's important i'm glad you brought this up because what's what i'd like to share

252
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:05,119
is that um let's take a bigger perspective and you

253
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:12,319
may not be ready for it right now esther so don't push it and yet let me offer this as a perspective

254
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:19,119
that often we have this limited viewpoint and and yet with the bigger perspective

255
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:24,480
with a bigger perspective you know i hold putin with compassion

256
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:32,800
too like ouch ouch the ripples of his actions the karmic impact ouch of what

257
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:39,920
he's doing just it it i feel pained in a bigger level

258
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:47,760
in the bigger in the in in a more transcendent view of life and

259
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:54,880
death and humanity our actions the ripple of our actions through generations through lives this person

260
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:01,839
who's causing so harm so much harm to himself and to others karmically ouch

261
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:09,680
ouch so maybe i'll just leave leave it at that and i'm not trying to convince you of anything but just to plan to see for

262
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:16,079
when there might be ready to readiness for a different perspective to rise is that okay

263
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:21,820
yeah thanks yes that's okay yeah so um

264
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:30,319
[Music] we so i see other hands i see more reflections and just to say

265
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:36,079
need to leave enough time for our practice together so i'm going to

266
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:41,839
quickly go to the reflections and the written one actually tell you what

267
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:47,440
how it to do how to you know what maybe i think it's

268
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:54,000
time let's turn let's turn to small group practice because i want to make sure we have time

269
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:01,040
and that's important 650 that's the time we always turn to small group practice so let's turn to that and i'll come back

270
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:07,599
to the reflections that you've shared in in chat if there's time afterwards so

271
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:15,599
so i will create the the rooms and um let's hold ourselves let's hold

272
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:21,119
each other with compassion uh taking care of yourself taking care of each other

273
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:28,079
the small groups wear it deep deep practice happens so i've created the rooms take care of

274
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:35,200
yourselves take care of each other and opening them here we go

275
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:41,760
the rooms are now closed everybody's back we just have about a minute and i wanted

276
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:49,359
to just share a couple of reflections that uh you shared before i went into the rooms

277
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:55,040
pepper said upon reflection saw that there was a point in my day when i had to push through to finish a project by

278
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:01,200
deadline even though my body was really needing a break happy that i didn't whip myself to do it

279
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:08,480
but rather was aware of the discomfort while continuing to do what i had to do nice thanks for sharing that yay that's

280
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:14,000
a great practice report yay and ah

281
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:20,960
and shinny says shame that i gave someone else an ouch ah yeah and that's something when shame

282
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:27,920
comes up of course turning as bill was reporting turning the the compassion back to oneself to hold the

283
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:35,040
pain that's arising um one more reflection anonymously this one this meditation was deeply

284
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:41,200
connecting to both release and refuge and wonder how to stay with the sorrow

285
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:49,040
of the war that brings tears to my eyes but not toppling and the last last couple of reflections

286
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:54,400
um also deborah saying i've included putin in my meta list referring to the

287
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,559
conversation earlier if someone like him acts in the way he is acting he must be suffering must need

288
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:07,920
the same thing we all need that is true indeed it is said that hurt people hurt people

289
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:14,480
hurt people hurt people and it is so true it is so true if people were not hurt

290
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:19,920
they wouldn't hurt others uh lastly from sarah thank you for this

291
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:26,000
space of practice it was challenging but i think it was good so it's oh we're

292
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,839
out of time thank you all for engaging with the practice tonight

294
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:43,359
for you and may it support you and support others in the

295
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:49,760
way that we all show up in the world may all beings be well may all wings and beings including

296
