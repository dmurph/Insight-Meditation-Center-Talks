1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,399
good evening again welcome

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:11,799
welcome so tonight I'd like to start with a story that we find in the ear the

3
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:16,960
literature of early Buddhism but part something that I think is remarkable

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,000
about this story is that it's not only captured in the Buddhist literature of

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,080
ancient India but other religious Traditions at that time I think that I

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,960
think it's in the Janes and I think it's and some like Proto Hinduism stuff so

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,160
this was like a story that was kind of like float this is my interpretation know some Scholars would say this as

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:45,039
well a story that was kind of like floating around and then different religious Traditions as they do kind of

9
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:51,760
like sucked it up and Incorporated it and made it their own so uh this is a

10
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,559
something that comes and maybe you've heard this heard this story I know I've heard it uh in different settings a

11
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:06,240
number of different times and then um I'd like to use it as a springboard to jump off on to talk

12
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,520
about uh some topics which you'll hear about

13
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:20,280
shortly so there's a king and uh he asks somebody to uh round

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,799
up some of the people that have been blind since birth individuals who have

15
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,920
never had the site faculty who cannot see

16
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,640
and the um individual does this it's a group of uh I don't know like maybe 10

17
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,040
or so people who have never seen before and then the king instructs uh the

18
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:52,200
person show them different parts of an elephant and tell them that this is an

19
00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:00,799
elephant so show them an elephant but only one particular part so the person says to the king okay

20
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,640
and so he shows uh one person the elephant's head showed another person

21
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:14,640
the elephant's ear you know these big flappy things uh the Tusk the trunk even

22
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,560
for me this is interesting that it's listed out specifically right the trunk the elephant's body the elephant's foot

23
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,599
elephant's hind quarters the tail and the tuft at the end of the tail so all

24
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:35,160
these different parts of the Buddha I'm sorry of the elephant and uh so to each person he

25
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,200
shows them he like brings their hands and allows them to touch this particular

26
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,879
portion of the elephant and he says to them this is an

27
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:54,480
elephant so one person's with the test at the end of the tail one person the tail one the air ears etc etc and then

28
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:01,720
the person who's doing the king's bidding tells the king okay I did that

29
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:08,000
and then the king says um oh no the king says to these individuals

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,400
directly the king says tell me what is an elephant

31
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:20,120
like what is an elephant like and one person says it's like a

32
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:26,879
pot this is the person who touched the head and the other person said no no no it's like a fan this is the person who

33
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,799
had touched the ears and another person said it's an arrow it's a pole it's a

34
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:40,200
room it's the wall of a room like this is the person who was touching the big side of the elephant uh it's like a post that's the

35
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,360
person who was touching a leg was like a mortar it was a pestl it was a broom that was like the little tufted on the

36
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:53,799
end of the tail I thought no no no it must be like a broom and then they started to when the

37
00:03:53,799 --> 00:04:01,400
blind people when they heard other people saying what it was like they were like No And elephants like this it's

38
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:09,480
like a broom it's not like a fan it's not like a fan it's like a broom it's like a uh the wall of a store

39
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,159
room it's not like a arrow or a pole or a pot or you know so they're all

40
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:22,040
disagreeing an a an elephant's like this it's not like that you wrong I know what

41
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,759
an elephant is like I felt it and it feels like

42
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:34,160
this so then they uh got in you know arguments as you might imagine and they

43
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,320
started to get in fist fights saying no no no I know what's true and clearly you

44
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,039
don't know what's true and the King was

45
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:51,600
delighted he loved this this it was like entertainment to see you know these

46
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,759
people like fighting and uh disagreeing like hold having a particular View and

47
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,840
holding on to it and um getting into fights with

48
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,960
others and so maybe that's kind of like just how the story ends like okay this was just

49
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:13,919
like entertainment for somebody else there's a lot of stuff in this

50
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:21,319
story actually there's a lot of stuff in this story but one thing that maybe I'll

51
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:26,360
start with here is that often that we don't

52
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:31,639
really um hold on to or pay attention

53
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:37,600
to and that is what we see happening in this story is there's these individuals

54
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,000
they are having an experience they're touching a portion of

55
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,160
the elephant so they're having like tactile

56
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,680
experience like there's this is nothing that uh really can be denied or disputed

57
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,800
or argued about right I mean they felt what they felt and then they made the this leap to

58
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:09,360
a mental construct of me they it's like this an object that they made up I mean

59
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,400
they didn't actually feel a pot but they said it's like a pot it's like a pan or

60
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:22,400
sorry a fan or a post or a broom so they made this transition from

61
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:30,560
what's being experienced felt to an idea

62
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:38,080
this is natural humans do this all the time of course we do right we need to uh

63
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,240
um makes we like to make sense of our

64
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:51,759
experiences but there's this way in which we don't even notice this that

65
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:58,639
thoughts are like the map of the territory we've heard this expression before right the map of the territory

66
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:06,120
thoughts are the map the territory is the actual

67
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:13,000
experience and sometimes it doesn't matter that there's a distinction between the map and the

68
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:21,160
territory but here we're talking about people getting into fist fights getting into conflict kind of blaming each other

69
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:28,639
say I'm right you're [Music] wrong and they're basing it on a thought

70
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,840
that they have after having a sensory

71
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:41,599
experience and this is a big part of what Buddhist practice is about what meditation practice is about for us to

72
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:47,919
learn what is the distinction between a thought about

73
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:53,520
something and the actual experience of

74
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:01,360
something the difference between a Concepts you know ideas views beliefs

75
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,720
opinions thoughts these all fall in the same category they're just mental events

76
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,720
I shouldn't say just mental events they're really important and they're helpful we need

77
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:23,280
them and it's helpful to make a distinction between these all these mental events and then what's actually

78
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,759
being seen what's actually being heard like the experience of hearing the

79
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:38,120
experience of feeling the experience of seeing because there's this way that

80
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:46,200
thoughts they are creating kind of a if we wanted to compare it to the

81
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,440
experience of the sensory experiences there's a way in which thoughts are like

82
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,839
kind like flat and two-dimensional and

83
00:08:56,839 --> 00:09:04,560
fragmenting like it's this not that as opposed to an experience

84
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:11,200
is just an experience it's not a way in which we

85
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:17,440
are drawing all these lines and uh distinguishing it from that or the other

86
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:24,120
thing it's just an experience a scent that we smell is just something that we

87
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:29,399
smell where as soon as we start to bring Concepts in and Views and thought

88
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:34,760
thoughts and beliefs we start to uh start to be making divisions just

89
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:43,920
natural of course we do this it's partly you know how we make our way through the world just to this is a chair uh not a

90
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:51,600
frying pan or you know something else I don't know we can make up something

91
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:59,839
else but there's a way in which that um sensory experience we

92
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:06,560
might say is uh vibrant and it's fluid right it's not

93
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,320
like there's this clear delineation where one sense experience absolutely

94
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,600
stops and then the next one begins like with vision or uh feeling or what we're

95
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,240
smelling or something like this whereas with thoughts we like to draw straight

96
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,000
lines make clear distinctions and make judgments and often we kind of like or

97
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,560
assigning like okay this is good and this is bad which can be helpful and valuable

98
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:43,399
and a useful thing to do but there's a way in which we can do

99
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:49,279
this that we get completely disconnected from the

100
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:55,959
experience in the same way that a menu is not the same as the meal there's a way that we could get

101
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:01,959
into fights about what's on the menu and forget that there's even a meal we can

102
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:08,959
get into fights about the map and get disconnected from the actual

103
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,959
territory which is our experience our life's

104
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:21,959
experience so maybe in this example of the uh blind people and the Elephant we

105
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:28,600
could imagine that they could have said it's instead of saying it's like a pot

106
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:36,000
it's like a fan it's like a broom they could have said h i experience it as big

107
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,639
and kind of round I think it's a pot I experien it

108
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:49,440
as flat and kind of big I think it's a fan that's really different than saying

109
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,360
it's a pot and something is wrong with you if you think it's a fan if you think

110
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:02,440
it's a broom I don't know what you're smoking but that's not it or you know whatever is going on with this

111
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:12,320
right so there is this way that if we talk more about experience if

112
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:19,320
we tune into our experience it creates a way in which

113
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:24,360
there's some maybe some openness some spaciousness and there's a way in which

114
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:32,519
it can be onward leading I experienced it is really

115
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:38,880
big instead of insisting nope it's a store room or that's the way they're

116
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:46,440
calling it in the poly the word is story room so that's one thing that's happening in this story there's this

117
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:54,720
translation from an experience into you know a concept about what it's like but

118
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,160
then not only that these people are coming to fist to cuffs because they're really cling

119
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:07,920
they're really holding on to this idea that they have based on their

120
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:15,240
experience and there's this way in which uh they're really invested in their beliefs like people wouldn't come to

121
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,320
fist to cuffs if they didn't really care okay I think it's a you think it's a

122
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,680
broom yeah so what okay what's for dinner but no instead they are feel like

123
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:33,800
really entrenched and that they have have to somehow um

124
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:41,279
defend their belief here so in my mind I I'm imagining like

125
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:47,880
what what makes a person think that it's you know this is so important enough that they're willing to fight physically

126
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:54,680
fight harm others and harm themselves risk themselves getting harmed maybe

127
00:13:54,680 --> 00:14:00,320
there are some underlying beliefs under underneath the concept

128
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:09,040
that they're holding on and these under underlying beliefs are something like I know what's

129
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:15,160
right or maybe it's something like how dare they question

130
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:24,880
me who don't they know who I am or maybe there's something like uh

131
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:31,600
that's very disrespectful to question me so I have to uh stand up for myself I've

132
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,680
been disrespected in some kind of way because they don't agree with me with uh

133
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:42,880
my experience or maybe there's something that they're thinking like oh the king

134
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,639
is here I better look good for the king I don't want the king to think that

135
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,480
other people can push me around and so something that's common

136
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,440
with all of these thoughts or these beliefs in here is that they are

137
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,720
self-referential it's all about me it's all about the way that I look

138
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:14,519
the way that I think not me as Diana but right you know these self what they're holding on to

139
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:20,360
you is tied up with their ideas that they have about

140
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:27,600
themselves and it's quite something if we start to really look at uh the things

141
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:34,440
that um get us agitated or things that we find

142
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:40,360
ourselves getting really wrapped up in and Tangled Up with we'll discover that

143
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:47,519
there's a way in which there's this uh sense of who we think we are needs to be

144
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:56,120
propped up or bolstered or defended it's tied up and often it's not

145
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:03,000
maybe the first thing that we're noticing but it's a belief underneath this underneath of this

146
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:10,440
feeling of uh maybe there's something like well I don't want people to know that really I I'm not quite

147
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:16,120
sure but so I'm going to pretend like I'm really sure or you know something

148
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:22,639
like this I don't want people to uh know that I have this doubt this doubt about

149
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:29,440
myself or doubt about why I'm even here why did I get uh us to touch this

150
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,199
elephant or maybe they have a life of uh their life experience we don't know

151
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:42,600
maybe they's Shame about their they not being able to see and they're feeling confused about uh why the king asked

152
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,120
them there and they think that well maybe this is an opportunity the king needs somebody who's never been seen and

153
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:54,079
I got to make myself look the uh biggest or the best so that the king will choose

154
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,800
me for something to so I can get out of this life of poverty we don't

155
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:07,678
know but there's all often around this sense of I have to look

156
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,760
good or I have to defend myself in some

157
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:20,600
kind of way this is often what's uh behind when people are really holding to

158
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:27,880
some beliefs or ideas that they have and we know this right kind of like in

159
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:36,440
the Buddhist teach teachings this is a a theme that we see throughout so many of the teachings about how ginging holding

160
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,640
on leads to suffering holding on to our beliefs

161
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:49,679
leads to suffering and suffering being this you know one word that has this giant range

162
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,120
of meanings from just this slight irritation to just the most horrifying

163
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,559
thing ever this single word for this big big big range of

164
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,360
meanings and so some of we could say that the suffering in this setting is just being in

165
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:16,320
conflict and feeling like having to defend ourselves but there's this way in

166
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,360
which thoughts and beliefs and our views

167
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,520
they're important they serve important functions we need

168
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:34,360
them and they can lead us astray lead us astray away from a life

169
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:40,360
of Greater Peace and Freedom and ease and well-being if there's a way in which we

170
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:46,320
are overly attached to them just clinging holding on to them and if we're

171
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,400
mistaking them for reality if we're forgetting that they're the map and not

172
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,320
the territory if we're think we think if

173
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:03,840
we're thinking that uh these mental events which are they just come and go right for any of you who have ever tried

174
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,840
to meditate and all of you did right you sat here for 30 minutes quietly maybe

175
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:17,080
you were planning your Thanksgiving meal but for those of you who weren't trying to meditate you notice like how many

176
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:24,919
thoughts come and go and beliefs and uh views they're in

177
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:33,440
the same family as thoughts right they're just mental construct they they are completely

178
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:42,000
insubstantial so there's this way that just to recognize

179
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,039
that clinging and I've given um other talks on this this idea that just

180
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:54,080
clinging to our views clinging to our beliefs I'm not saying we shouldn't have any beliefs and I'm not saying that we

181
00:19:54,080 --> 00:20:00,159
shouldn't have any views it's when we're holding on to them

182
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:08,440
so tightly that we think it's okay to harm others based on

183
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:15,919
them that we think it's okay to um just like

184
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,799
abandon things that we know that are harmful to ourselves and others and and

185
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:28,240
so that we can hold on to these views and I appreciate that part of the

186
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:35,960
way that that Buddha when he spoken about an awakened person somebody who has complete Freedom complete

187
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:44,080
ease part of the way that he described them was person who doesn't get involved

188
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:51,440
with disputes because 100% guaranteed as soon as you

189
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,440
start clinging to views and beliefs there will be somebody who has a

190
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,360
different one and you will be in

191
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:10,200
conflict and may have disputes so the Buddha describes a

192
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:18,720
completely awakened person as they are not an enemy to any Doctrine seen heard

193
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:25,640
or thought out not forming opinions not shut down and not desirous they are the

194
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:32,159
wise ones who have laid their burden down the wise ones who have laid their

195
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:40,840
burden down so what is this burden the burden is having this sense of self that

196
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:50,159
has to be protected and bolstered and defended at all costs sometimes it feels

197
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:57,400
like and so this isn't a belief that you have to adopt about the not being this

198
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:04,840
permanent self this uh entity that's at the core the essence of us you don't

199
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:12,080
this is not something that to be believed whether I tell this to you or whether you read it in a Dharma book or

200
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,120
hear it in other Dharma talks or something this is something that comes from

201
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:24,159
experience this is not something I mean it could be a view you could adopt of course but it's really not until you

202
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:33,360
have the actual experience and usually it's a meditative experience experience not always that you start to see like oh

203
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:41,000
yeah there's actually nothing here except just a whole collection of experiences a whole bunch of them moment

204
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,480
of seeing a moment of feeling a moment of hearing a moment of sealing a moment of thinking feeling and that's just

205
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:53,559
what's happening that's it but sometimes we want to grab onto

206
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:59,919
them and uh create a a separate self that we is enduring

207
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:05,039
but there's this way that uh trying to defend what we

208
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:10,960
think this separate self is that we hold on to views but there's this way not

209
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,799
don't that this holding on as I said causes suffering but part of the way this suffering shows up is as this

210
00:23:17,799 --> 00:23:22,880
dogmatism or this sense of conceit like

211
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,840
I know it I don't know what you guys out there are doing but I know right when we

212
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:36,080
have these things that we're holding on to this sense of uh there's some must be something wrong with everybody else who

213
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:42,080
disagrees or maybe there's this self-righteousness or this

214
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,158
indignation which just leads to

215
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:54,279
division I'm not saying that we have to agree with everybody and I'm not saying that we

216
00:23:54,279 --> 00:24:00,039
can't have values and Views and beliefs but there's a way that we can have

217
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:06,039
values views beliefs that aren't causing division

218
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:11,640
aren't causing harm that instead promotes our own

219
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:17,600
freedom and the freedom of others this is what the Buddha was pointing

220
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,799
to I want to talk about this for a

221
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:29,919
um in a moment but before I do I want to say one more thing about this story

222
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:36,000
that uh impacts me that uh for me there's just something that you know the

223
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,559
story ends with the King being delighted like this is entertainment for him to

224
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:47,080
get people to have different views and then get all riled

225
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:52,399
up because it occurs to me that in contemporary times this kind of the same

226
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:58,600
thing is happening right we have different people that uh are having different experience

227
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:04,120
es different life experiences different news

228
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:10,640
sources and there think that one thing is true and these people have different life experiences and different news

229
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,960
sources and they think something else is true and there are others that have a

230
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:23,480
vested interest to see conflict happen when there's outrage I mean this

231
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:30,960
is what the media industry depends on right they are not for profit I mean they are are for-profit they are not

232
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,480
nonprofit right they depend on us feeling

233
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,919
outrage this is what politicians depend on say feeling

234
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:48,360
outrage this is what advertising feels on maybe it's not outrage but uh for us

235
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:55,120
to you know have our feelings manipulated in some kind of way so that we'll behave

236
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:02,480
differently so there's vested interest for us to get agitated and and want and

237
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:10,320
to want us to really hold on to our views and beliefs and not to treat each other with respect to not treat each

238
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:16,080
other with care I'm not saying that there aren't uh

239
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:25,960
that everything is okay and uh that that that feels uh like some gaslighting or

240
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:31,799
something that's inappropriate there are clearly things that are are happening oppression is happening terrible things

241
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:39,799
are happening but we don't have to in our own lives be holding on to views and

242
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:45,640
opinions in such a way that we are in disputes with

243
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:52,360
others and I admit that part of the reason I'm giving this talk on a Monday before

244
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:58,080
Thanksgiving is sometimes families get together and sometimes not always

245
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:06,600
sometimes sometimes there can be some uh Flames or there can be some there can be some disputes

246
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:14,760
and I appreciate uh very much what

247
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:22,799
um Ezra Klein said uh I I don't know when this was he's uh you

248
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:28,559
know what I'm not sure he's in the media might I don't know what he does exactly

249
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:37,960
somebody sent me a clip of him so I can't quite pull out what the context of what this was but um I I appreciate very

250
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:47,120
much that he's um he said somebody asked him about he's

251
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,399
a he's a commentator of some sort maybe political commentator or something like

252
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:59,880
this asked him like well um I heard that uh your family is kind

253
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,519
of angry about one of a position that he had or something like

254
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:11,159
this and he said you know it's actually

255
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:17,159
I love my family and it's not my job to in my

256
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:23,600
personal life to police and change the views of people I love and care

257
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:30,240
about I'm just going to love them they're my family and he admitted there was people in his

258
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:37,880
family that had radically different views than he did I think this is so fantastic it's not our job to police the

259
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:46,159
views of other people in our family and then he went on to say that

260
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:52,720
uh somebody had told him of a rule that he was trying to follow in these family settings and he

261
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,799
says before trying to persuade anyone of anything

262
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:04,120
and in particular we could say family he's saying ask them three

263
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:10,320
questions so somebody who has a different view than you do a different opinion and you are going to engage with

264
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:17,760
them rather than getting into disputes he said ask them three

265
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:24,159
questions about their view ask them how they got to their

266
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,120
position how did you know what what is it that uh bringing bringing them to

267
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:36,360
this position and ask what does it mean to them is it something that's meaningful

268
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:41,519
to them or does it stand for something or what is it that makes them hold on to

269
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:47,799
this and the third question is what is behind it so maybe in some ways these

270
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:53,399
are all the same but just to ask

271
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:58,760
them about their position because

272
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:06,120
because if the truth is if we're ever going to be persuasive to

273
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:11,720
anybody which let's be honest doesn't happen so often right that we change other people's mind it just doesn't

274
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:18,640
happen I don't like it when somebody's trying to convince me of something you know and they're using their loud voice

275
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:27,279
and trying to convince me like it just doesn't work but um as we Clin in this um I wish

276
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:33,840
I could remember exactly where this came from uh I remember the name so and I but

277
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:40,559
um he says you know if you're ever going to help change or persuade somebody it's

278
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:45,679
because they feel safe with

279
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,519
you it's because they feel seen by you

280
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:59,679
it's because they feel heard by you then they might be willing to listen

281
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:05,320
to something

282
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:13,679
so it might be that you encounter people who have different views so one thing we can do

283
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,600
is kind like maybe open our hearts to them if we're having a Thanksgiving meal

284
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:25,399
with them be o open to what they have to say

285
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:31,159
listen to them ask them these three questions how they got to their position or what

286
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:37,600
it means to them or what's behind it maybe what's behind it is maybe they're

287
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:45,720
all related these three questions but ask them three questions and then we might

288
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,880
say that there's this uh part of engaging in this way

289
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:58,440
is part of a bigger picture of how to work with conflict

290
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:04,519
and this is uh Gil fronal said um I think he said this a number of years

291
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:10,760
ago and I think you said it more recently this phrase be

292
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:17,360
still and look upon everything kindly be

293
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:25,120
still and look upon everything kindly so look upon everything kindly we

294
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:32,559
could say part of that is this look upon everyone that you're uh interacting with

295
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:38,440
kindly when you're in Conflict I'll say a little bit more

296
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:44,159
about that but I want to talk a little bit about this be still

297
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,960
part because be still is there a way can we quiet the

298
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,880
mind because often when we're in conflict or we're really holding on to views there's a certain amount of

299
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,760
agitation in the thoughts can be racing okay I got to make a good uh uh comeback

300
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:11,039
for what they're going to say and wait until they hear this or you know this type of thing but there's this way that

301
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:19,279
uh that well our thoughts that might be spinning and agitated and our labels and

302
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:27,760
our beliefs they are useful we need them in our everyday life but also abst

303
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:33,720
ractions like holding on to Concepts they also

304
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,720
divide that's just their nature and they create conflict because

305
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:45,039
as soon as you divide there's a conflict so just recognize that thoughts will

306
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:50,320
always be like uh perpetuating a certain amount of

307
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:55,600
conflict but is there a way that rather than getting lost in thoughts as part of

308
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,480
this be still can we shift towards our sensory

309
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:08,800
experience like what's being felt I'm I'm uh putting my hands on my

310
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,800
clothing here because it's soft and it's something that I could feel maybe that's something that you could do too like oh

311
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:20,118
yeah there a little bit softness here or if you're at Thanksgiving dinner maybe

312
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:25,760
flavors just tune in you know at a moment just kind of tune towards what's

313
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:31,440
actually happening in the the moment feel your feet on the ground listen to

314
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:37,358
The Sounds maybe there's kids play running around Maybe not maybe there's a

315
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,720
football game on you know different different families have different ways that they celebrate

316
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:49,440
Thanksgiving and not everybody celebrates Thanksgiving so I'm offering this if uh you happen to be in any

317
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,480
situation in which there are some uh conflicts

318
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,200
happening but there's this way that this shift toward sensory experience not only

319
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:07,160
does it kind like bring us into the reality of this moment but it disrupts the momentum of the thinking of like

320
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:15,320
trying to defend whatever we were going to do but it also helps like loosen our

321
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:20,520
identity with the thoughts this loosens into like okay I'm they're being

322
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:27,000
disrespectful for me towards me or those types of feelings and instead it brings

323
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:32,960
us to well the truth of this moment is that maybe the chair you're sitting on is

324
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,000
getting uncomfortable you've been sitting there too long or maybe you're hungry or haven't eaten enough like

325
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,520
that's happening also the same time that maybe this conflict is happening but if

326
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:50,200
we're only tuned into the conflict and what we're going to say if there's just going to exacerbate get bigger and

327
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:57,040
bigger so be still and look upon everything kindly be still part of it is

328
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:04,640
to just be with our sensory experience the senses what's being felt

329
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:11,318
tasted smelled heard seen at this

330
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,920
moment so there's this also this way about

331
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:27,200
to look upon everything kindly to look on to if you're in a

332
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:33,319
conflict kindly what would it be like to give the

333
00:36:33,319 --> 00:36:38,720
other person in which you're conflict with a

334
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:45,400
victory what would it be like to say huh you may be right I hadn't thought of

335
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:51,160
that H okay I can see that part Mak sense

336
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:57,319
yeah okay yeah I'm not sure I agree about I I'm still not on board with this

337
00:36:57,319 --> 00:37:02,440
but yeah I can see that I hadn't heard that

338
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:08,560
before even if you don't do that give them a victory but even just the idea

339
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:14,000
what would it be like to give them a victory that just like shifts the relationship right it kind of like

340
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:21,079
shifts the whole ecology instead of like okay I got to show them or I can't believe I'm related to

341
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:27,920
somebody who has or that's invited to this meal that has these thoughts or these views or but instead even the idea

342
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,400
what would it be like to just give them a victory why

343
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:39,880
not why not it's another way in which to look

344
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:48,040
upon everything kindly I'm kind like unpacking gilsa expression here some

345
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:54,160
kindness I heard uh Ken Wilbur maybe this is in one of his books that I read

346
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:00,400
maybe some decades ago which I appreciate so much he said there is

347
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:07,800
nobody on this planet that is such a genius that they

348
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:15,400
can be 100% wrong like you could like you would have

349
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:21,160
to like just like to be 100% wrong means you would would have to have created

350
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:26,960
your whole other you know I don't know something other than the laws of physics

351
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:36,160
that we have currently thinking all this other stuff so nobody's 100%

352
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:44,680
wrong so then maybe I'll I'll add here maybe

353
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:50,480
this verse that often gets said again and

354
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:59,480
again hatred never ends through hatred by non-hate alone does it

355
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:08,000
end this is an eternal truth hatred never ends through

356
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:16,359
hatred by non-hate alone does it end this is an eternal

357
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,839
truth I'm translating this word by non-hate alone does it end and Polly

358
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:29,119
that's how it is literally some people will uh say it by Love by Love Alone does it end

359
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,200
but for me I feel like love feels idealistic in a pretty high

360
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:41,319
bar but nonh hatred maybe nonh hatred

361
00:39:41,319 --> 00:39:48,400
is being willing to listen being willing to engage somebody

362
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,560
with respect ask questions maybe non-h hatred is uh this

363
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,839
willingness even for us to question ourselves and to see oh yeah you know

364
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:07,280
what am I holding on to why am I defending this so much something like

365
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:17,599
this so maybe I'll end there there's more I could say and maybe I'll follow up in some uh later talks about this

366
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,839
idea of conflict and to recognize that you know

367
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:30,119
the map is not the territory our life is actually filled with sensory

368
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:37,200
experiences and I used to think that life was all about what was in the mind and I certainly was rewarded for this

369
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:46,119
and academically and professionally but life is you know we have senses as

370
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:51,960
uh this is what life is about and with our thoughts we need them

371
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:58,359
but our thoughts can get us into trouble too so with that I'll end and I'll open

372
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:06,520
it up to see if there are some comments or questions thank

373
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:17,599
you so in World War Two my grandfather was in the Army and I'm wondering that

374
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:24,319
in some cases like someone like Hitler right I'm sure no one is completely wrong about everything but sometimes

375
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:30,560
isn't even appropriate to fight with violence against something like that and you join the military and try to stop

376
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:35,560
the Nazis from you know dominating the

377
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,480
world so can you put your question in the context of what I was talking here

378
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,079
so you're saying yeah can can you re yeah so in other words like so in the case of World

379
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:53,119
War II the Nazis Hitler right and I'm like I'm sure Ken Rob was right no one's

380
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,520
completely wrong but in that case it seems is really appropriate to want to

381
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:03,960
join the Army and fight against the Nazis yeah yeah so this is interesting

382
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:10,240
so for you to go to the like the extremes I don't know about the extremes I've never been there I hope I never

383
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,079
have been in World War II like that's just awful awful awful right what

384
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:22,280
happened but can we bring it into our lives something that you and I can work

385
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:30,240
with you know that I can work with in my life you can work with in your life I don't want to say that uh not fighting

386
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:38,680
the Nazis that that just doesn't seem make any sense at all but I don't want to my saying that say that uh negate

387
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:45,200
kind of what I was talking about here but I I agree right I mean like I don't know that's just so

388
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:52,000
terrible even to think about that we wouldn't have uh um fought the Nazis in

389
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,720
Germany that was that's not or even like now in Ukraine right fighting against Russia I mean sometimes it seems like

390
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,000
even that kind of violence is

391
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,520
Justified I don't know it honestly I don't keep up to date

392
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:16,319
on all the news about uh Russia and the Ukraine and I don't really want to I

393
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:23,400
don't feel like I'm in a place to say what is right and what is wrong and what we should do and shouldn't do I have

394
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:29,119
very limited information based I'm like one of those blind people who felt just a little bit

395
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:37,359
of the elephant and I'm thinking like I felt the ear I'm thinking oh it's like a fan so I don't feel like I can make a

396
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:42,520
comment on it is that

397
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:49,319
okay yeah here

398
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:58,319
Sor yeah maybe this is more of a a comment uh for the talk and

399
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:04,400
um one thing that I it's about something that I um struggling with is I think

400
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:12,160
even when we can try and um see if I can articulate it um I think

401
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:19,480
even when when we as individuals can notice when we're only touching one part of the elephant and have some humility

402
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:27,760
to say okay like I don't know everything um when it comes to others sometimes

403
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:35,000
um I find myself realizing they're not necessarily giving themselves that same level of humility and so right I find

404
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,599
there's a frustration there but what would help is being able to articulate we'll call it like the source

405
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:48,319
of suffering in that so I I do find that there's a suffering of like why is this other

406
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:55,800
person you know or other people um not realizing you know or missing the

407
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:02,839
fact that there's a um they're clinging to one part of the other and so is it me clinging

408
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:08,000
to you know wanting that control or I guess that's where

409
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,240
um I'd like to better articulate what that source of suffering is I see I

410
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:20,720
found it difficult uh thinking about the uh this this talk so well I I'll say

411
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:26,440
that uh uh there's a an there's a person in

412
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:37,160
my family has very different views than I do and I started to think like you know what if I was a born and raised in

413
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:42,599
the same community that person was if I was the same age as that person if I was

414
00:45:42,599 --> 00:45:50,280
the same gender that person if I currently lived in the same place that person lived if I currently uh had the

415
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:58,359
profession that I did I probably would think the same thing that they do so it's just this recognition that

416
00:45:58,359 --> 00:46:03,920
you know people come to their views and the beliefs just because there's so many

417
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,839
causes and conditions that are uh supporting it it's not like there's one

418
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:17,119
uh like we believe what we believe because we've been exposed to whatever it is we've been exposed to and have had

419
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:22,920
experience that we've have experienced so for me that kind of helps me to say

420
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:28,160
oh okay this is this is what makes sense to them based on their life experience

421
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:35,040
and then I kind of feel like that their Humanity like yeah okay and then maybe

422
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:43,000
the suffering gets uh reduced I don't feel like I have to convince them otherwise even though they might be yelling or doing whatever they're doing

423
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:51,240
is that helpful definitely it sounds like a lot a stronger doses of loving kindness um

424
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:57,680
get us to that place um where you can like empathize or kind of piece together

425
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:03,680
where they're coming from yeah yeah kind of like humanize them and recognize them as a product

426
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:09,440
of their life in the same way that we are in the same way that we

427
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:19,400
are we you know we came to our conclusions based on our life experience and news

428
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:28,200
sources okay so for those of you who celebrate Thanksgiving I'm wishing you

429
