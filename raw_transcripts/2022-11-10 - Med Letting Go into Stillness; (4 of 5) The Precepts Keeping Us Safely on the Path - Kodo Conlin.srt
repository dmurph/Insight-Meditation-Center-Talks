1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,640
so greetings far and wide early and late light and dark

2
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:23,119
taking 45 minutes together settle in with ourselves and

3
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,380
reconnect with Our intention for practice

4
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:40,579
reflecting on these precepts again and beginning as we do with mindfulness

5
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,520
I noticed in myself a sort of quality of

6
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:59,039
appreciation or something edging on reverence for

7
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,980
the practice and the

8
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,200
the ability we have to come together as Sangha

9
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:16,939
something to celebrate as we settle so let's take our seat

10
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:39,799
coming into that upright alert

11
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,659
and useful meditative posture

12
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,298
reclining if that's the need for your body or sitting upright

13
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,780
sensing into balance

14
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,819
maybe the shoulders are asking to roll back

15
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,540
maybe the breath is asking for just a little more depth

16
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:01,680
with listening to the body taking its cues to guide us into

17
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,459
alignment

18
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,659
as we settle if there's any obvious tension or

19
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,080
holding

20
00:03:53,879 --> 00:04:01,519
just a little relaxation it's okay to let go

21
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:44,300
relaxing releasing settling

22
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:50,360
and attentive attentive breathing in

23
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,800

dull

30
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,860
perhaps adding just one more level of precision

31
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:32,960
with the awareness a little bit closer with the breathing

32
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:45,020

rather than putting

36
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:16,579

thank you

80

thank you all and hello again my name is kodo

81
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:35,880
some many of us have been having a discussion or reflection on the

82
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:41,640
five lay precepts this week it's our fourth day

83
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:47,539
and the plan will be to address in some way

84
00:30:47,539 --> 00:30:53,159
the fourth lay precept which is for the sake of our training

85
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:58,380
together I undertake the precept to abstain from

86
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:05,840
false speech to abstain from false speech

87
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:14,220
it's difficult to overstate the importance of honesty and

88
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,740
truthfulness and the Buddhist teaching

89
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:26,399
um so much so that the Buddha called

90
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:32,760
uh false speech non-dharma not Dharma

91
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:40,399
not the truth not the Buddhist teaching and he called true speech Dharma

92
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,860
broadens the scope somewhat about what is Dharma and what's not Dharma perhaps

93
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:52,940
but I think emphasizes just how important truth honesty

94
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:58,980
were for the the path of practice that the Buddha taught yeah

95
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:05,580
specifically we've been talking a bit about the middle length of this course is 61.

96
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:12,240
the Buddha's advice to rahula and in this teaching when he's advising

97
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,659
his own son in the in the training of a monastic the Buddha says something to the effect

98
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:25,020
of um for anyone who is willing to tell a

99
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:30,960
deliberate lie anyone who is willing to tell a deliberate lie

100
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:37,580
in dramatic language the Buddha says there's no evil that they will not do

101
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:45,360
I want to have a little bit of caution here as I say this because it's easy then it's very very easy to then appoint

102
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:52,140
the fingers to the dishonesty around us when the invitation at least for this

103
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:58,140
reflection this morning is to look look at our own conduct begin there

104
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:06,299
let's be sensitive there become wise there and then allow that to

105
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:12,740
um support us to be wise socially yeah and interpersonally

106
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:22,860
no evil they would not do so I think something something maybe many

107
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:29,220
of us recognize is the is the power with which true speech

108
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:35,220
honest speech inspires faith some might even some might even observe

109
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:42,779
the way that when we speak truthfully when we speak honestly um it it supports and establishes the

110
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:49,260
kind of confidence in US I can rely on my own word

111
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:56,039
uh it's almost it almost um a support for the mind that's observable

112
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:01,559
these little kindnesses we do for the mind in our practice somehow true speech

113
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:07,320
brings in this sense of settling Foundation oh I have my I have my feet

114
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:13,879
on the ground so

115
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:22,378
again poetically the Buddha the Buddha uh discussing truth and not truth Dharma

116
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:27,898
not Dharma he also compared them in these dramatic images not truth false

117
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:35,480
speech he compared to dung in fact and true speech he compared to flowers

118
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:44,099
can really sense into the Buddha's value for truth I think there may be something here uh

119
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:51,300
uh in my in my own speculation about how the truth served the Buddhism path

120
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:57,780
in the story that we that we know very well perhaps um the Buddha is a young one

121
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:04,200
was very very protected he was maybe royalties semi-royalty grew

122
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:09,960
up in a trio of palaces that were just perfectly suited for each season

123
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:15,300
never exposed uh never exposed to old age illness and

124
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:21,599
death and when he finally encountered them the truth of those drove him

125
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:27,240
into a different life and then he became some he became

126
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:33,359
and taught and practiced something that I think is possible for us

127
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:39,119
and that is to be devotees of the truth

128
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,559
devotees of the truth

129
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:54,920
I've heard mindfulness practice described or I've heard honesty honest speech described as mindfulness out loud

130
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,260
mindfulness out loud I think we can see when we reflect on our mindfulness practice

131
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:07,140
the the honesty with which we observe our inner world

132
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:14,579
the activity of our inner world supports us to see clearly outside

133
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:20,940
foreign Marlene's brought up this great question in the chat I appreciate questions in

134
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:27,300
the meantime it makes this more of a conversation what if the truth is unclear

135
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:34,740
wow that's a profound question isn't it what if the truth is unclear

136
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:41,060
I think um My First Response might be

137
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,740
yes yes

138
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:53,700
because how often the truth is unclear this actually touches on something else I wanted to mention uh came up as a

139
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:58,859
question yesterday how do we recognize harm I think as I explain that it may touch

140
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:05,099
on this question of what what about when the truth is unclear so I'd like to open this up maybe with

141
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:11,040
an exercise so just for a minute let's bring ourselves back to the

142
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:16,440
meditative posture but this time I'd like you to lay your

143
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:23,660
hands open in front of you your eyes can be closed but your hands open on your lap

144
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:31,740
and then I'd like you to bring your attention to let's say your left hand

145
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:37,500
your left hand let's take a minute to feel and sense

146
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:45,000
into the left hand and then maybe any tensions or

147
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,220
holding or twisting in that left hand and see what you can relax

148
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:56,400
just right there and the muscles the tendons the fingertips

149
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,359
of the left hand

150
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:08,099
grieving the tension in and out relaxing

151
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:10,940
relaxing

152
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,838
it's just for a few breaths

153
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:29,299
now I'd like you to sense into your other hand without that relaxation

154
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,440
maybe you can see or feel or sense the difference between those two hands side

155
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:41,579
by side one with some residual holding clinging

156
00:38:41,579 --> 00:38:46,859
tensions discomfort and one that's been cared for and

157
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:54,260
relaxed it's just a sense into that contrast

158
00:38:56,339 --> 00:39:02,780
it's a simple exercise but one that I think starts to point us toward how to recognize harm and not harm

159
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:09,980
and this applies to what happens when we're confused what happens when the truth is unclear

160
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:15,599
and reflecting on harm and not harm what I wanted to share with you is

161
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:21,000
we can begin where it's simple where there are say clear admonitions

162
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,880
about what to refrain from we can begin practicing there

163
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,520
and then what's required of us is repeated reflection

164
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:38,880
over and over uh we grow more subtle in our sense of what's what's harmful and what's not

165
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,700
harmful the training in fact isn't to isn't to always walk around with a with a clear

166
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:50,339
sense of this this um this activity leads to harm this one doesn't

167
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:54,440
know I should take care without saying this now

168
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,079
but the the notion is is that we will continually deepen

169
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:06,300
the skill of recognizing harm it too is part of the practice it

170
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:16,280
develops over time through repeated reflection and through a process actually of trial and error

171
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:22,680
one of the ways this can happen to describe this sort of as a developmental model that I think applies to both harm

172
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:28,380
and Truth is the is this simple but clear

173
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:33,900
observation oh they're suffering here in my life they're suffering I noticed this

174
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:41,700
specific suffering not a suffering in the abstract so seeing oh they're suffering here and our

175
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:49,440
mindfulness recognizes that our mindfulness meets that and through that encounter

176
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,020
um oh you may have seen my hand do this this is a reminder to myself that the

177
00:40:55,020 --> 00:41:02,160
suffering that we experience often is repetitive often a similar suffering repeats itself

178
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,040
for us we end up doing the same things

179
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:13,260
but that also gives us the possibility the opportunity to recognize

180
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:19,380
that every time this particular kind of suffering arises for us there are all these conditions that lead

181
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:25,619
up to it through all these contributions that come and make this bit of suffering

182
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:31,500
and then seeing that seeing the conditions underneath we have a chance to

183
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:37,320
possibly do something different so we learned to recognize harm

184
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:44,339
we learn the contributions that go into harm in just over and over practice it's a slow growth in wisdom

185
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:49,859
and the same is true for truths in the

186
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:54,900
in the early teachings the Buddha encouraged encouraged a

187
00:41:54,900 --> 00:42:01,619
person to remember three locations one was where they were ordained he was

188
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:07,680
talking to monastics but we can maybe remember the place where we first encountered the Dharma teachings

189
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:13,260
the second is where they saw all four noble truths at the same time

190
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:19,200
where they had some penetrating insight and to oh this is the ennobling truth of

191
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,079
the Buddha these are the truths of the Buddha and what do those comprise something

192
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:30,660
about suffering and its ending so maybe this is a long way of saying

193
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:35,880
that our our un our understanding our familiarity and our recognition

194
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:44,900
of harm and Truth develops over time develops over time

195
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:50,640
um we act with the best possible intentions available to us

196
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:56,820
and then make an honest assessment about how that went in terms of

197
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:02,660
in terms of true speech and false speech um

198
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:08,520
the we can take a cue from the vinya the monastic rules about how one makes

199
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:14,099
amends to recognize something important one makes amends

200
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:19,740
one makes amends through recognizing that something has

201
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:25,200
gone wrong confessing and laying that open to a

202
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:31,619
good Dharma friend in their case monastics and then making a resolve to try to do

203
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:38,940
something different in the future recognizing laying it open and making a resolve

204
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:45,359
d so in this sense the Buddha is very clear actually that our mistakes there

205
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:52,380
must they may be our mistakes but it's um it's a it's a source of growth he

206
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:59,099
actually calls it growth in the Dharma when we do this we recognize our mistakes lay them open and then resolve

207
00:43:59,099 --> 00:44:06,180
for something different in the future so hopefully that touched on touched on

208
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:13,200
a bit the fourth precept with the time we have um before we do a short precept

209
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:20,760
recitation I want to say a little bit the plan for tomorrow we will discuss reflect on the fifth

210
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:27,359
precept of abstaining from intoxicants that are cause for heedlessness I'll make I'll uh

211
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:32,880
make some concluding remarks about this week and then I would also like to make

212
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:39,839
room for more questions tomorrow um so you may consider what is

213
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:46,680
um what feels alive or evocative or unfinished from our conversation not to

214
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:51,900
say we'll finish everything uh tomorrow but um anything you'd like to bring up

215
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:58,980
we'll have some time for that and then I would I would like to do a little bit longer precept recitation

216
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:05,160
tomorrow uh perhaps in the ancient language of the Pali just so we can all

217
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:11,280
be exposed to that uh or hear it again so

218
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:20,060
let's close as we have been all week and then we can say for a while here we have the five precepts

219
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:27,180
for the sake of our training together I undertake the precept to abstain from

220
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:34,440
harming living beings for the sake of our training together I undertake the precept to abstain from

221
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:40,260
taking what is not given for the sake of our training together I

222
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:47,460
undertake the precept to abstain from sexual misconduct for the sake of our training together

223
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,560
I undertake the precept to abstain from false speech

224
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,380
for the sake of our training together if I undertake the precept to abstain from intoxicants that are cause for

225
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:05,220
heedlessness may we all be well

226
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:10,740
and may our integrity and honesty support us in the practice today

227
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:18,599
and those we encounter may all beings know the benefits of Truth

228
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:22,400
take care until tomorrow
