1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,739
yeah so welcome again

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,800
it feels so still in the hall and I'm inspired to say

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,460
if the if the gravity of

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:25,619
the sitting practice is predominant just keep that going

5
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,840
and let all this just wash right through

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:43,200
so the the topic for tonight I wanted to bring up is practice discussion

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,079
it occurred to me that we so rarely talk about practice discussion

8
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:54,719
so I wanted to offer some reflections and first to start I wanted to recognize

9
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,539
that um there may be a range of maybe degrees of

10
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:07,020
experience with this I know there are some in the room that have probably been doing practice discussion

11
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,500
for decades and some maybe never done it before

12
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,759
um yeah so to try to to try to discuss the topic

13
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:27,540
knowing there's this broad range of experience so I thought I would begin with a story

14
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,659
um one that's about maybe good friendship in the form of practice discussion and it it's a story

15
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:42,439
that comes out of uh Gill's book a monastery with him it's called appropriate instruction

16
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:50,820
one of the monasteries old monks had become a Hermit living deep in the mountains

17
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,000
a two and a half day hike over difficult Mountain paths

18
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,040
many visitors made the Trek to receive advice and teachings from the old man

19
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:09,000
he was reputed to have an uncanny ability to know just what each visitor needed

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,720
prior to giving instruction The Hermit asked that the visitor promised not to tell anyone what advice

21
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,000
or instruction they received

22
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:27,180
After the Promise was made the hermit would say simply say what are you not willing to pay

23
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:34,200
attention to this was the only thing he would ever

24
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,040
say to anyone asking his help many visitors were first perplexed by

25
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,140
this question but by the time they'd walked the two and a

26
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,540
half day track out of the mountains they invariably would praise the hermit

27
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:56,480
for giving them just the instruction they needed to hear

28
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,760
the story makes me so curious of all the different all the different places and times we can apply the question what are

29
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,200
we not willing to pay attention to

30
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,040
and I think of the the person who must have been so motivated motivated enough

31
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,340
to Trek for two and a half days into the into the difficult mountains to seek advice what must have been going on in

32
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:30,060
their lives but something something called to them

33
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,640
and they recognized this was a beneficial thing to do

34
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:42,000
and they sit down they have this discussion or receive this comment

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,580
and then and then something for me is like the Trek the two and a half day Trek

36
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,340
back out it's like it worked it worked the lesson or it worked the question or the thought

37
00:03:53,340 --> 00:04:00,019
into the body just over and over on the walkout

38
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,500
so I'm hoping we can look at practice discussion in terms of uh three things

39
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,080
and that is practice discussion as a practice of recognizing

40
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:18,299
recognizing what's wholesome practice of articulating expressing in

41
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,760
words and then a practice of embodying

42
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:30,540
embodying spiritual maturity so for anyone anyone who hasn't hasn't

43
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:36,780
done this before in our Insight tradition practice discussion are these they're one-on-one meetings between a

44
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,940
practitioner and a teacher in the context of Dharma practice

45
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,419
um one of the primary purposes is to

46
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:53,520
recognize and reflect upon the teaching the Dharma that is

47
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,240
apt for exactly your current experience and we sort of find that together and

48
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,720
Discover it together I think that from the perspective of the teacher practice discussion provides

49
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,020
that opportunity for a really good understanding of what's going on for someone and to apply just

50
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:19,320
the one right question perhaps and then from the perspective of the practitioner

51
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:25,500
it could be to receive support or clarification to bolster confidence about the next

52
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:32,100
step of the path or um even a practice in its own right of

53
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:39,539
reporting on your experience to try to report on your meditative experience and your inner landscape

54
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:46,320
in your daily life so

55
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,800
these sorts of these sorts of these aspects these skills and qualities that come to come

56
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,680
to develop in practice discussion of recognizing articulating and embodying

57
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,199
of course we develop them in other ways too I think of our um year-long Dharma programs where we

58
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,479
move through with a cohort and we have Dharma discussion we have small groups or you have friends you get together

59
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:15,000
with and have coffee and talk Dharma

60
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,280
so all that's here too in the spirit of a good Dharma friendship

61
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:40,319
so in the context of the the tradition way way back in my textual memory

62
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,680
and it occurred to me looking at the sutas of these these ancient teachings of the Buddha

63
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,100
it seems like the vast majority of them are question and answer

64
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:59,039
it's almost like we have these really ancient records of people going and doing practice discussion with the Buddha

65
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,560
pretty amazing that that's available and most of them follow a similar format

66
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,580
there or at least they have a similar frame so there is most of the time a sort of respectful

67
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:18,660
approach and then a formal greeting of some kind then someone will take their seat

68
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,759
and then they'll bring up their topic one of the most well-known collections

69
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:31,020
of that is uh sujata was just teaching about this the chapter to the way to the Beyond uh the

70
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:38,840
paryana Vaga basically 16 practice discussions that we get to read read in on

71
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:45,900
um and then also very well known the questions of King Melinda where um

72
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:51,500
the king is having this extended interview with the Monk nagasena

73
00:07:52,979 --> 00:08:00,360
outside of the texts and real lived bodies and places in time I think of the terravada and monasteries

74
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,819
also something of a model for us in my in both my hearing and my visits

75
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:11,340
to places like this something I notice is that the interviews can sometimes be pretty informal

76
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:16,380
they kind of run the run the spectrum of formal and informal sometimes it's just

77
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:22,440
like group t with the Abbot in the afternoon it's like it feels um maybe I

78
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:28,080
can appropriately say low stakes but um the Abbott is just totally

79
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,599
available and If you have Dharma you want to bring up a question you want to ask

80
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:39,180
so that's there in the background of our tradition also and then I'm also kind of delighted

81
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:45,480
there's one more image of monastic uh practice discussion where I've heard

82
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:52,800
about a certain Monastery where during these intensive periods the meditators will line up about one at a

83
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,680
time and they'll just they'll approach the teacher they'll ask ask their question they'll get their answer and then the

84
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:05,160
next person goes but because they're all lined up like this I would imagine the few people right

85
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,440
here get to hear the Q a right so it's not exactly private but you're you're

86
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:17,660
gleaning some of this Dharma wisdom from overhearing the Q a

87
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:27,259
so these ancient texts and these forms in the monasteries they form some of the context for

88
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:34,160
for our form of practice discussion and the Insight movement the Insight tradition

89
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,600
of course we have practice discussion on Retreat and we have practice discussion off retreat

90
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,760
um yeah yeah

91
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:50,880
I want to address that that uh for some I have I have heard

92
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:57,779
um the practice discussion can kind of feel like a high pressure situation because uh I don't know if anyone here

93
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:03,899
has ever had that experience um and it reminded me of this

94
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:10,380
anecdote about Blanche Hartman she she was the first abess of San Francisco's

95
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:17,399
Zen Center and she was describing what is a really formal meal ceremony that happens at Zen

96
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:23,820
Center called oriyoki um everything is prescribed you know there's a detail for everything takes

97
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:31,500
about an hour to eat lunch and wash your bulls and put them away and very very common for someone doing

98
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:37,940
this for the first time or the first 20 times to be really nervous about the details

99
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:44,459
she set us all or she set everyone at ease by saying all it is

100
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:50,519
we're gonna we're gonna unwrap our bowls we're going to eat our food and then we're going to wrap them up and no one

101
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:58,220
is going to die [Laughter] if things if things go according to plan

102
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:06,540
so something as high stakes as a formal Zen meal was sort of set at ease and

103
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:12,839
I think looking at the looking at the structure of just how simple a practice discussion can be might also put us at

104
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,980
ease it's like we we get in the room we sit down we discuss our topic we say

105
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,980
thank you and then we go that's it's just that easy

106
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:42,000
when we look at the old text of course we might see that it's it looks quite formal uh there's a there's this

107
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,160
really great formulaic way that they they talk about it say when um

108
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:53,519
let's see a certain brahmana approach the Buddha goes like this then a certain brahmana approached the

109
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:00,240
blessed one having approached the blessed one he exchanged friendly greetings after Pleasant conversation had passed

110
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:07,079
between them he sat to one side having sat to one side the Brahman spoke to the blessed one thus what does the

111
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:12,360
venerable gotama assert what does he preach it seems like there's this long wind up

112
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:17,880
to the question of prescribed activity similar but abbreviated for the

113
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,279
monastics like venerable Ananda went to see the Buddha and it just says he approached

114
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:29,820
the blessed one the Buddha paid homage to him or paid respects and then sat to one side and then asked his

115
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:37,339
question these days you just come right in

116
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:44,220
come on in and have a seat so after you've taken your seat we we

117
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:50,639
get to discuss or whoever you're there with you get to discuss the thing that comes into my comes to my

118
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,820
mind is um another another notion about sort of setting one at ease and practice

119
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,100
discussion is that the time is totally yours the time totally belongs to

120
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:09,000
the the person coming to ask the question um whatever feels whatever feels alive

121
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,779
most relevant most helpful for you right now but it's totally totally up to you

122
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:21,839
um I think of I think of entering the room when I go when I go see my mentors and

123
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,779
teachers I think of entering the room kind of is like entering a field of gifts

124
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:33,959
like entering a field of Donna like they're they're just they're just there holding this open space where I

125
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:39,540
can bring up whatever whatever in the context of the Dharma

126
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:44,880
it's such a special thing and in some of the best meetings there's

127
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:51,360
this Simplicity and I imagine some of you had recognized this this feeling like actually nothing at all has to

128
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,399
happen there's nothing we have to accomplish through this conversation

129
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:03,440
even if we just sat there in silence that would be perfectly fine maybe that would be the best

130
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:11,399
but say you do want to bring something up um

131
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,500
I look again to the ancient texts and there's this there's a sort of formula

132
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:23,220
for wise reflection and it takes a little bit of translation I think for for most of us to apply it

133
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:29,100
in our lives and um but when think when going to visit when

134
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:36,060
going to visit monastics and going to visit the Buddha in these old texts the um the formula was something like uh

135
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:41,339
what is it what is it that's skillful what is it that's unskillful what's

136
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:49,019
beneficial what's not beneficial and what uh if I if I do it would lead

137
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:55,740
to my long-term harm or what if I do it would lead to my long-term benefit and happiness

138
00:14:55,740 --> 00:15:03,660
so it's um at least in the in the text here it's focused around one's conduct questions

139
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:09,000
about one's conduct one's practices and then the qualities that develop out of

140
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,620
that that seems to be some of the focus of these discussions

141
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,380
you know for a long while I would go to practice discussion and then I would just of course I would leave when the

142
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:34,199
practice discussion was over but I um I didn't have any regular way of reflecting and thinking about it after

143
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:40,079
the fact um I think it may have been years it never

144
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:46,199
really dawned on me oh you know I'm going to write about this I'm going to reflect on it I'm going to see how I can really put this into action I kind of

145
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:51,480
just put myself into the practice discussion container and then I left

146
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:57,420
and I trusted that something was going on that was fruitful or something was continuing to work on

147
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:03,899
me until I remember I remember going to a meeting once and

148
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:09,360
um asking based on this conversation what do you

149
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,500
what should I do a novel question and the teacher said oh you know I hope

150
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:22,079
that you remember what we talked about I hope you reflect on it

151
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,720
and then make some decision about how you want to act on it so he he gave me this like very clear

152
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:35,000
way of integrating I hadn't known that was missing

153
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:48,480
I think one of the things of immense value that can emerge out of you know such a

154
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:55,019
simple form is the fact that practice discussion is a place where the the let's say the

155
00:16:55,019 --> 00:17:00,660
Dharma the theory let's say of Dharma meets actual lives

156
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,880
actual lives in the Dharma come together in the in a conversation

157
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:13,079
the um what's what's revealed if um

158
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:20,579
let's say if we meet in the spirit of the Dharma or meet in the context of the Dharma is um

159
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:27,120
yeah our actual life like the the tangible bits of this lived life and how

160
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,439
the Dharma reflects on that

161
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:44,360
so in order to be available for that something that something that um I found really helpful over time was to

162
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,919
invoke or invite a sort of sensitivity to have a kind of attitude of

163
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,380
sensitivity um

164
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:04,320
so yeah so I could be receptive to the

165
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,279
Dharma that was coming or sort of open the channel and let the Dharma arise

166
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:16,919
I think they're a host of really useful attitudes that might might serve Us in practice discussion one is to be open to

167
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:22,700
possibility of something different to recognize a possibility

168
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,919
um yeah I remember having a number of

169
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:35,580
conversations where um it almost felt like the teacher was just like tossing out something in the moment

170
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:41,580
that was like wow how obvious I never thought of that and it um

171
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:47,340
it landed with a spark of inspiration and opening and all of a sudden it was like they loaned me their confidence for

172
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:54,120
this new beautiful possibility that um if I could then reflect upon and see if

173
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,080
it opened up in my life

174
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:11,000
one more important comment I think is that even a brief exchange can be quite powerful

175
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:20,539
um in the text we have the example of course of venerable saripota Awakening by the end of a four-line stanza

176
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:27,660
may it be so and uh and I think of these little Snippets

177
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:33,059
there are these they're these questions and answers that we still

178
00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:41,400
they end up being stories for US 20 30 40 years later there's this one well-known story in our in our circles I

179
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:48,600
think of had come I think to Spirit Rock and someone asked her what's what is in

180
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,559
your mind and she responded um

181
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,100
loving-kindness concentration and peace

182
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:09,419
and I still feel a wow in my heart and she didn't even give that response to me

183
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:14,640
but it it's it's brief it's powerful and it's

184
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:20,280
still living in uh I guess in this talk

185
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,740
the brevity can also be non-verbal I've heard that upon Dita is known for the

186
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:32,039
power of the raised eyebrow um the gestures can mean a lot

187
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:38,700
Suzuki roshi the founder of San Francisco Zen Center is also pretty well known for this and not the eyebrow but

188
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,280
the brief teaching and um

189
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:48,960
yeah another one of these pithy q and A's that that sticks with me someone

190
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,539
asked him what is nirvana and he said seeing one thing through to

191
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:56,899
the end

192
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:05,760
and how that you know how that lands it must be you know

193
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,940
let's say that was 1969 how many years ago was that conversation that was just a guess it

194
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:17,220
might have been earlier anyway I think through these exchanges

195
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,260
through through these meetings even if they're brief

196
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:27,960
we come to recognize something about what's skillful

197
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,360
and we get to see it being enacted right there with us you know we're discovering the Dharma

198
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:41,760
together emptiness emptiness means one thing

199
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,520
when it's um oh how does he how does he put this uh

200
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:54,780
it's like as a concept or in the abstract but it's quite it's quite another to encounter it in a being

201
00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:00,120
you know the Dharma living right there and I think that teaches us something about how to bring It Forward in our own

202
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:05,000
lives or what's possible for us

203
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:15,000
so having talked about receptivity I think it also um Bears talking about the additional

204
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,059
opportunity of checking out teachers well I think it's an interpretation of the

205
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:27,059
Kalamazoo to the encouragement to like really check out for a long time

206
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:32,400
teachers in terms of do you notice in their content conduct

207
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,559
greed hatred and delusion I think and like

208
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:43,200
please please do please do that I think it's for the health of the community

209
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,679
for all of us not just for a one particular teacher-student relationship but that

210
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:56,280
we're we're sensitive to Greed hatred and delusion and their opposites practicing over and over their

211
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:01,320
recognition and then there's this other thing that

212
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:07,020
sensitivity opens us up to and that is whether there's Affinity with a certain teacher

213
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,559
you know

214
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,799
so I think there are many ways to frame practice of practice discussion or to

215
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:44,700
frame the notion of who you're meeting with I I think for some folks it's thinking

216
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:49,740
of the visiting a teacher as like a consultant others go seeking a guide others go

217
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:56,159
explicitly seeking a teacher or supporter um one really fruitful way I've I've had of

218
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:03,539
reflecting on this or thinking about it is is with the teachers that I've connected with long term it's thinking

219
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:09,780
of them in a sort of apprenticeship relationship and this the more I dig into this

220
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:16,260
metaphor the more I really like it um just the way we think about

221
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:21,419
Carpenters developing skill by watching very skilled Carpenters or working with

222
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:27,299
them or I think of musicians especially

223
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:34,320
um when I think of someone someone with just like Talent enthusiasm and interest

224
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:41,700
and they're given a piece of sheet music okay that that takes you so far that's like our that's our written Dharma okay

225
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:48,840
now put this put this written Dharma into practice like play this sheet music and and with someone who really knows

226
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:54,780
the cello let's say they can listen along and hear possibility

227
00:24:54,780 --> 00:25:00,840
even if they're not being like Oh yes great and no no no that was terrible they could be like oh

228
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:07,380
I heard this in your interpretation have you thought about this have you considered this possibility

229
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,840
and in that way you develop skill develop skill with this instrument and

230
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:18,120
it uh it feels quite alive when I think about the Dharma in that way

231
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:23,760
you know um we have the we have the Good Fortune of having in our community people who have

232
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,799
practiced for a very long time and and coming into conversation and

233
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:34,980
discussing hey this is what I'm thinking about um skillfulness and unskillfulness this

234
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:40,500
is my situation this is this is how I'm practicing this is what I'm seeing

235
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:48,679
and um yeah bringing bringing them into that bringing in our good drama friends

236
00:25:54,900 --> 00:26:02,520
one of the other one of the other pieces I really like about the apprenticeship metaphor is that this um this pointer

237
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:08,279
to have practice discussion with someone from whom you're willing to

238
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:13,919
receive input seems obvious seems obvious but someone

239
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:20,820
you're whose feedback you're willing to hear and consider um

240
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,139
for obvious reasons

241
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:46,559
maybe one more thing thinking about practice discussion

242
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:53,760
specifically in terms of Kelly animita or kalyanamitata admirable friendship or

243
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:00,440
good good spiritual friendship good friendship um

244
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,380
the

245
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:13,380
in learning to recognize good Dharma friendship and look at the texts very interesting

246
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:18,960
there's an opposite it doesn't it's not really bad spiritual

247
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:26,100
friendship but it's this word it's this word that um one of its meanings is infertile like

248
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:31,559
infertile soil I find that evocative like what what

249
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:38,940
friendships what connections what conversations are nourishing the soil of my practice

250
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,759
and how can I how can I care for those and develop them

251
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:52,278
in the um in the terrigata kisagotami's poem

252
00:27:53,460 --> 00:28:01,320
she says associating with an admirable friend even a fool becomes wise

253
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:08,400
later on associating with people of integrity one would be released from all suffering

254
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:14,159
and stress would no stress the origination of stress

255
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:21,020
cessation and the Eightfold Path the Four Noble Truths

256
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:27,960
I'm encouraged by this and how our our good friendship and tonight in terms

257
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,960
of practice discussion um that movement

258
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:40,020
that supports our growth in our discernment of the Four Noble Truths our realization of the Four Noble

259
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:47,480
Truths our walking of path to peace and that we don't have to do it alone

260
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:57,120
so maybe in the last minute or so I'll just say at uh

261
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:04,799
for those who don't know at IMC a couple of the easiest ways to engage in practice discussion day longs usually on

262
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:09,900
Saturdays and then Wednesday half days their sign up practice discussions for both of

263
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:15,059
those at Insight Retreat Center that they're folded into the schedule so that's

264
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:22,559
that's part of what goes on um and then there are various days a

265
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:29,820
small group or individual practice discussions that happen on Zoom so you can check all that out on the IMC

266
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:35,100
website then find an opportunity to

267
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:41,399
to recognize the Dharma together to articulate the Dharma and to embody

268
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:48,320
it into yeah take part in this joyful path

269
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,480
so

270
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:04,320
to close with just a simple wish I think may it be that all of our encounters

271
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,840
nourish our practice and may all beings everywhere grow in

272
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:15,980
wisdom and compassion and be free from suffering

273
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:23,460
yeah thank you and I

274
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:29,279
skipped a fair amount so we could be sure to have some conversation or questions or comments or

275
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,799
stories whatever whatever you'd like

276
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:08,179
thank you codo yes I'm wondering um thank you first for this

277
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:19,559
question I've often asked the question about what

278
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:28,100
I should be discussing during our practice discussions and I've never really gotten it

279
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:43,880
so going to sleep um

280
00:31:54,260 --> 00:32:01,679
I'm wondering um if you can say you know on the sutas they always talk

281
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,720
about um greeting go to my

282
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:14,340
with reverence and then sitting to the side yeah it seems that they're always sitting to the side and I'm wondering

283
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:21,000
is that um I don't know what that means does it seem confrontational to sit

284
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:28,020
directly across or do you know what the relevance of sitting to the side means yeah it's a

285
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:34,080
really it's a good question I I'm not I'm not so sure about its meaning within

286
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,360
the context of ancient India yeah I I could I could guess about some

287
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,580
things but they wouldn't be grounded in any any kind of evidence

288
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,380
yeah if anyone here knows

289
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:00,179
well this is an entirely speculation but in many places

290
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:07,440
it's considered um disrespectful to show the bottom of your feet to somebody yeah

291
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,620
certainly in some of the Pacific Islands but I've had a a monk at the monastery

292
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:19,260
point out to me that I was sitting with my the bottom of my feet

293
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:25,279
pointing towards him and I did I didn't know that that was a

294
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:33,779
breach of etiquette sure so that's might possibly be part of it sure sure

295
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:43,220
yeah I'm curious same thing extends uh to uh altars I think Buddha statues

296
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:56,519
so I wanted to thank you for your talk um

297
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:02,580
I mean a couple of kalyanamita groups and

298
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:11,099
so we share people take turns each week or each meeting offering a prompt question you

299
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:17,760
know some kind of uh maybe a question that's relevant for

300
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,000
them and um

301
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,520
often turns out to be a very relevant to everyone else as well because it's it's

302
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,358
somebody else's question but it might be something that's a little bit of a blind spot

303
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:41,158
so the sharing of questions in a group like that

304
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:47,638
um can often deepen inquiry yeah yeah

305
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:53,398
I appreciate that and it it sparked something for me when you use the word blind spot

306
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:58,859
that seems to be uh in my in my observation over over the

307
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:04,160
years one of the most important functions of

308
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:12,000
keeping up a practice discussion connection with someone who you can really trust in terms of the Dharma to

309
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,520
kindly point out your blind spots because we all have them

310
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,579
so we and we sort of entrust ourselves to our Kelly animita and our teachers

311
00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:28,819
and our Dharma friends to help us see these things

312
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:56,640
well I want to say thank you and um

313
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,880
yeah just to appreciate our time to sit talk

314
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:10,320
um maybe it's the dogwoods outside

315
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:16,859
there's something really soft and lovely in the meditation Hall tonight and I want to appreciate being here with you

316
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:24,079
so thank you for having me May our practice

317
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:29,640
certainly benefit us and benefit everyone we know and all

318
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,700
those beings we don't know may all beings benefit
