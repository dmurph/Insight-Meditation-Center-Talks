1
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,720
good morning Sangha

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,800
um so sweet to read the messages each

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,600
morning knowing that you're joining from all

4
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,439
over the world

5
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:56,100
hello again welcome everyone thank you for joining This Global Sangha in all

6
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,920
those days meditating learning together

7
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,599
what a gift to ourselves and to the whole world

8
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:18,239
hmm and just a feeling that joy and

9
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,660
uplift from this whole week being with you all

10
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:31,739
and today and in our meditation this week we're being speaking about

11
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:37,379
this list of words start with R

12
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:42,480
and today we'll add yet another r word

13
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,580
and so we started a week with relaxing

14
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,980
and then recognizing [Music] the phenomenon

15
00:02:52,980 --> 00:03:00,000
in a relaxed field and then we added

16
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,700
um what did we say we had relaxing recognizing

17
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:13,940
and we have releasing releasing any extra tension

18
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:20,480
are seeing in our world we call it tukkah releasing dukka

19
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,940
and um when their extra tension being released

20
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,599
we can rest rest here

21
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:41,299
peacefully calmly and today I'll add another word

22
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:46,080
uh which is realizing

23
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:52,799
and this realizing comes as a flavor of

24
00:03:52,799 --> 00:04:00,560
having some insight into our phenomenon our lived experience

25
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:07,080
and it can be as small as recognizing oh

26
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,180
I didn't have to believe the story that I've been telling myself in my head

27
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:19,019
anymore that I'm always quick tempered

28
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:25,860
that was just a story and so that comes from

29
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:34,020
this began to see clearly this is just a phenomenon of

30
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,080
thinking grasping

31
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:48,000
and we can recognize the truth of it and realize that we don't have to get

32
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,360
entangled with this anymore so this realization doesn't have to be

33
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:02,100
some sort of a big bad realization you know but um can be small

34
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:09,840
um uh moments of seeing something that's true that's new that wasn't available

35
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:16,440
before and it may be

36
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:23,460
realizing that a holding on to certain kind of

37
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:31,940
um for myself this uh realizing the striving the try trying

38
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:37,740
holding on to the goal that I have set up for myself at the bar I was holding

39
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,259
for myself that was just a barrier for the practice

40
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:50,400
and that's a moment of realizing something and the realization realization has a

41
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,280
function in our practice it began to offer something for us to

42
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:04,620
shift within so there can be an inner shift when this kind of realization

43
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:11,100
come forth so a realization can come along the way

44
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:17,100
in this process and doesn't have to be kind of happening in some sort of

45
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:24,180
and of a certain process and so it takes pain careful attention

46
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:32,000
to what is happening so what began our meditation

47
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,240
and are inviting everyone to kind of go through this process that we've been

48
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:46,620
speaking about and practicing with and allow yourself to kind of open to

49
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:54,900
whatever might be available in this process um wherever you are is a perfect place

50
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,860
to be as a girl often speak about this

51
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,340
so let's begin

52
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,440
arriving Here and Now

53
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:26,479
entering into the Temple of this body mind and heart

54
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,599
entering into a practice lineage

55
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:42,740
that has been going on for Generations

56
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:03,620
or the practitioners before us practiced like this

57
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:10,220
arriving here and now

58
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:25,039
mindfulness front and center

59
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,220
heart bonus front and center

60
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:47,300
as you take the inner outer seat

61
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:59,100
again to open to the broader sense of

62
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:05,279
your experience maybe the global sense of the body

63
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,920
sitting buying down

64
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,440
you're standing

65
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:33,680
and relaxing and easing into the posture you're taking

66
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:57,500
it's the relaxing invoke a sense of opening in various ways in the body

67
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,680
maybe opening of the chest

68
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,080
softening of the belly

69
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,339
dropping of the shoulders

70
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,620
letting go of the thoughts

71
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:51,540
letting go of the conceptual overlays

72
00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:02,839
dropping into about sense of your experience

73
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,899
and allow this earthy body resting on Earth

74
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:42,440
grounded and settled

75
00:12:00,839 --> 00:12:09,000
if you like you can gently turn your attention

76
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,380
to The Familiar object of the meditation

77
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,560
the movements of the breath

78
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,560
and dancing Sensations in the body

79
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:45,060
are there elements earth water

80
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:51,060
fire winged

81
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:14,779
recognizing each arising just as it is

82
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:30,440
each passing away just as it is

83
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,839
releasing the stories

84
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:11,040
resting in the field of clear kind

85
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,940
knowing

86
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:40,860
who's arresting is a kind of not doing doing

87
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:45,560
so one of my teachers often says

88
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:21,620
quiet and still knowing

89
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,919
he must come still

90
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,539
field of knowing

91
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:58,020
every experience that arises

92
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,220
is fresh

93
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:45,320
the tension stories creeping again

94
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:52,100
you can always began again

95
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:16,080
as we invest abide

96
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:23,179
in a peaceful clear knowing

97
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:31,260
sometimes you may realize that

98
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:36,799
there is a different way of being

99
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:41,360
that does not involve

100
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:50,520
getting hooked in our stories grasping

101
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:18,080
maybe New Perspectives open up

102
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:39,500
we can choose

103
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:49,760
we can choose calm rather than agitation

104
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,480
you can choose these

105
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:09,080
rather than an entanglement

106
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:57,360
and sometimes there's realizations

107
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:04,100
may be manifested ask exactly how we are

108
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,059
nothing needs to happen

109
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,460
foreign

110
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:47,559
[Music]

111
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,200
hmm

112
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:10,138
so uh yesterday um I left you with a cloof hair

113
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:17,460
it's a cliffhanger as the statement that the app is made in the story that I was

114
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:24,898
telling yesterday and that it says the Buddhist the path only exists

115
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:32,898
while one walks it so I'm going to continue

116
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:40,878
and today's story it's gonna follow this theme

117
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:47,158
and it's called they Abyss

118
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:54,118
so we have to end with some dramatic ending so

119
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:58,639
they Abyss hmm

120
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:06,599
a monkey told this story I had a reached and in passy after 25

121
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:12,240
years in the monastery I had it devoted myself diligently to

122
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,400
monastic practice through much effort my powers of a

123
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,920
concentration mindfulness and compassion were among the strongest the apples had

124
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:28,260
ever seen I was known for my peace and equanimity

125
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:34,020
I had no obvious attachments however

126
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:41,220
I had not yet attained the realization other monks and Nuns with less time in

127
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:47,520
the monastery and the less thorough practice at a reach to various levels of

128
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:54,359
Awakening everyone thought my circumstances was most estranged

129
00:35:54,359 --> 00:36:00,540
then one day the abyss took me aside for a long talk

130
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:07,140
we discussed how I was held back by my fear of completely letting go

131
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:14,900
as much as I trusted the spiritual life at my core was some deep

132
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:22,560
unarticulated nagging mistrust as long as I could remember

133
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:30,320
a part of me was on the lookout for impending tragedy

134
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:38,099
and this is a side comment and I think most of us probably can relate to this

135
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:42,859
always on the lookout for danger

136
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,619
at the end of the conversation the app is told me she could think of only one

137
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:55,680
more Catalyst for my enlightenment just the possibility brought me tears of

138
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,760
a joy until she told me it meant entering a basement room called The

139
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,339
Abyss no one in many generations had entered

140
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:15,359
this room only the abyss was entrusted with the secret knowledge of what was inside

141
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:22,380
no one else knew while the red door to the room was kept locked it didn't need

142
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:27,720
to be an atmosphere of Terror in emanated from

143
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:33,060
within and the monks announced were afraid to walk anywhere near the door

144
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:38,640
walking down to the basement the app is explained that my one and last

145
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,579
opportunity was inside this room once I entered this room

146
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:50,220
there would be no turning back standing in front of the door I had to

147
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:55,380
mix the feelings about entering the app is carefully explained the

148
00:37:55,380 --> 00:38:03,119
instructions that had been transmitted to her I was to step into the room the abbess

149
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:09,300
would close and lock the door behind me and under no circumstances would she

150
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:14,940
unlock it again I'll enter in the room I was simply to

151
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:21,420
walk to the other side of the room and exit through the door there

152
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:26,700
it sounded easy enough suddenly the app is opened the door and

153
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:34,560
pushed me inside before I could get my bearings I heard the door locked behind me

154
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:41,160
the room proved to be huge perhaps a hundred feet wide

155
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:48,380
on the other side of the room was the door just like the one I had entered

156
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:56,640
the room had no floor I was standing on a two foot ledge as wide as the door

157
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:04,200
between me and the other door was a gapping Abyss I could not see the bottom

158
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:10,040
from the depth came horrible grinding and cracking sounds

159
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:16,020
occasionally a ball of a flame shot upward

160
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:22,500
I was scared and perplexed how was I supposed to walk across

161
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,599
I spent the first day standing on the ledge studying the room

162
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,480
certain that I was meant to discover some secret way to get across

163
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,880
I spent the second day banging on the door hoping that someone would let me

164
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:46,859
out I cried most of the third day until while sitting on the ledge one of my

165
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:53,760
slippers fell off my foot as it fell the grinding noises seemed to

166
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,820
get worse on the fourth day I desperately and

167
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:07,400
repeatedly reviewed the instructions they were so simple

168
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:14,280
walk across the room and out the other door

169
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:22,619
could I trust the abyss tired and hungry on the fifth day I give

170
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:29,820
up all hope and thanks I had no other choice but to try the

171
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:35,640
instructions I decided to walk off walk out of the

172
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:42,780
ledge I tried not to imagine what awaited me down in the depths

173
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:49,320
terrified I looked straight ahead and took a step into the room

174
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:55,619
into the unknown as my foot came down

175
00:40:55,619 --> 00:41:05,420
the ledge stretched forward receiving me with affirm steady base

176
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:14,599
it took me another day to take the second step but when I finally did the ledge again

177
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:20,780
extended itself outwards to receive my foot

178
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:26,339
I continued walking into the emptiness

179
00:41:26,339 --> 00:41:32,520
and with each step the ledge became longer

180
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:38,880
long in a song enough I had reached the opposite side

181
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:44,579
from that day on letting go into the freedom of

182
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:50,520
realization as um easily

183
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:05,539
the Buddhist a path only exists while one walks it

184
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:13,560
that's a real daring Endeavor right what we're doing here

185
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:20,700
showing up each day to practice and learn

186
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:26,880
to walk the path it's a real

187
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:35,300
courageous Act even if you don't feel heroic just yet

188
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:41,820
until we there do we dare to walk the path unfolding

189
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:49,140
right underneath of our own feet maybe with the fires shooting up

190
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:53,838
underneath and the Heat

191
00:42:54,180 --> 00:43:03,859
do we dare to choose calm and compassion when someone is needing and angry to us

192
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,579
do we dare to meet our own inner turmoil turmoil even though

193
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:17,660
the default reactivity would be to blame and Escape

194
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:28,800
your way there to choose a wholesome even though when it seems to be quite

195
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:34,380
impossible my husband my husband shared a little

196
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:41,280
cartoon yesterday with me I had a picture of a old wise man and a

197
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:47,160
young little girl and the little girl asked the old man a

198
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:56,339
question and she says tell me sir in which field could I make a great career

199
00:43:56,339 --> 00:44:04,200
and the wise man replied with a smile being a good human being

200
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:11,539
there are a lot of opportunities in this area and very little competition

201
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:19,020
yeah the way they are to choose something unpopular

202
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:29,339
so walking this past um takes a lot of Courage patience

203
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:36,060
persistence determination sincerity

204
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:42,119
and commitment and boundless kindness

205
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:45,859
to ourselves and others

206
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:55,920
so in many ways there's a whole week of stories and Reflections are pointing at

207
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,980
how the practice path is a whole life path

208
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:10,280
I think one of you kind of put this in the chat box the other day that's a whole life path

209
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:17,900
and I would also add it's a whole lifelong path

210
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,039
it's a way of a living a great

211
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:32,339
Thai monastic feature key in her book

212
00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:39,780
pure and the simple says this the practice isn't something you do from

213
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:45,780
time to time you know you have to keep doing it continuously

214
00:45:45,780 --> 00:45:55,859
throughout life you have to keep up with the Holy life because you're playing for real

215
00:45:55,859 --> 00:46:02,520
you are playing for real here and this is not dipping our toes in

216
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:08,579
water and just walk away this is crossing the flood

217
00:46:08,579 --> 00:46:13,880
crossing the flood of a greed hatred delusion

218
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:21,540
and so may the stories and reflections enrich your practice

219
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:28,140
and deepen your practice and may our practice and and are

220
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:34,099
learning together benefit all beings everywhere

221
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,040
and so I deeply bow and appreciate all

222
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:49,640

223
