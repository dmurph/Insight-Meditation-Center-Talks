1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:06,799
hello on this Thursday in Redwood

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,480
City at the Insight Meditation Center

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:19,840
welcome and um one of the amazing capacities we have

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:27,279
as human beings is attention and using the word attention to

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:36,440
highlight this is to point out that attention is a very uh broad term that

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:43,399
encompasses uh all the different attentional faculties that we have so to

7
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:51,120
to pay attention to offer attention to be attentive um is uh different ways that

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,440
we attend to something attending with

9
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:03,359
attention and sometimes we attend sometimes we we are aware sometime

10
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,759
through our eyes sometimes uh we might be aware

11
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:16,799
mostly through our ears some people who can see will close their eyes in order to hear

12
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,439
better we might uh attend through our

13
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:31,920
nostrils or through a taste when we're eating food or and

14
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,759
um remember when I was a kid haven't done this for a long time and we wanted

15
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:43,680
to know whether a a small battery was uh especially was uh still had a charge in

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,159
it and we would put our use our tongue to taste to feel to feel the the little

17
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:58,320
charge that was left um and um there was uh we attend

18
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,320
through uh something something that uh is not exactly connected to any of the

19
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:12,480
sense stors we might attend or by knowing something carefully it's

20
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:20,599
cognitive if we see an oak tree uh we might know it as being in

21
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:26,599
California a Valley Oak or a coastal oak or a Black Oak and

22
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:33,239
um and that's how we attend to it to recognize it and we might have a kind of there's

23
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:40,040
something called the inner eye nothing mystical about it but the way of being

24
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:46,920
aware that um it's kind of like uh seeing with the regular eye but kind of

25
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:54,760
just kind of uh being aware without any of the sense doors at the center of it

26
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:01,840
and uh just somehow some deeper place in the mind that knows that watches that

27
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,200
senses that feels what's happening so all these ways in which attention comes

28
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,720
into play and um and when people meditate

29
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,159
they'll use sometimes one or two of these uh with uh some

30
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:24,799
tension with some prioritization with some sense that uh that we're the doer

31
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:34,159
of it that we we are it in some ways we are defined by by by being aware or we

32
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,280
have to engage awareness in some way that we get contracted or tight or put

33
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:45,480
pressure on something and um the art of

34
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:50,920
Somali is to more awake to awareness

35
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:57,599
more allow awareness more trust the capacity for

36
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:04,920
attention rather than active applying it in a way that is tense or

37
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:13,159
straining so there's a softness or an openness or broadness or a lightness to

38
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:22,560
the how we attend how attention operates when we're entering into the in the

39
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,280
practice of samadi and um and at the same time there

40
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:38,440
is a kind of a there is a persistence there is a gentle stress

41
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:45,280
free um um kind of I don't know if commitment is

42
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:54,199
too biger word uh devotion dedication there's a a uh hanging

43
00:04:54,199 --> 00:05:01,320
hanging in there a a

44
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:09,080
engagement that has no stress in it but it kind of like Keeps Us close to it like this is important this is

45
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:16,360
valuable this is interesting fascinating important this is precious a treasure

46
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:22,520
stay close to it be it so that it we stay in that world

47
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:29,840
continuously we stay attending continuously with a attention

48
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,319
and I'd like to offer another aspect of how to do this uh and this theme today

49
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:45,280
of being inclusive that Sadi is including everything rather than excluding and um at least

50
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,560
initially and that is to associate Sade with

51
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:59,199
composure to be composed in the middle of things to be at the middle of your

52
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:07,400
experience to have some choose a place that's a centering spot the settling spot the

53
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:14,560
place around which everything will be composed and then we're composing

54
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,720
ourselves um kind of when I when I was young the older generation used the

55
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:26,199
language of compose yourself and um it was an important concept for certain people in the

56
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:32,759
english- speaking world word world and when I was growing up I think we kind of pulled away from it as being maybe a

57
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:40,120
little bit too formal or a little bit too contrived but there's something quite

58
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:45,639
lovely about being settled being whole being

59
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:52,280
all of us there in a aligned balanced kind of composed way

60
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:59,840
whether we're standing or whether we're sitting or lying down or the idea that we're there to compose

61
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:08,039
ourselves bring all of who we are together and um and be centered

62
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:13,479
in um and then with that composure to stay

63
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:18,759
there stay composed stay centered stay

64
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:24,400
grounded stay

65
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:31,400
present so a light soft attending awareness

66
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:36,639
that supports our whole being becoming

67
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:45,560
composed holistically without being caught up in the concepts

68
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:52,199
so much just enough Concepts to support composure and presence in the midst of

69
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:59,560
it all so to assume a meditation posture

70
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:07,840
a posture in which it might be easier to compose

71
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,800
physically compos settle be

72
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:22,520
balanced and softly closing the eyes

73
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:38,640
and as you breathe in see become

74
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,760
aware let your attention almost expand

75
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:49,480
outwards to become aware of your body

76
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:57,240
globally almost as with the inhale the attending the attention the

77
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,040
sensations rise from deep inside and spread out

78
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,360
through the whole body as much of the whole body that's

79
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:14,399
easy and maybe even delightful to

80
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:25,360
experience and as you exhale not just settle or relax the body

81
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,279
but do so in a way that feels like you're composing yourself

82
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,399
that you're Gathering and settling

83
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:49,279
yourself around a central settling Place Gathering

84
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,120
Place grounding place

85
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,200
and as you breathe in feeling the global

86
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:15,079
body imagine that your

87
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:24,600
body is like a There's No Boundaries there's no

88
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,839
edges especially with your eyes closed it might be easier

89
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:35,640
that there's no edges to

90
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:44,360
awareness imagine that your body from the inside and

91
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,480
outside is like vast open

92
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,399
space and the awareness of that space

93
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,800
spaciousness is inseparable from the space

94
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,760
itself to be aware of any kind of

95
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:22,120
spaciousness awareness of some kind is

96
00:11:27,639 --> 00:11:36,959
present breathing in and letting there be a spreading outwards into that

97
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:48,800
space space beyond your body and as you

98
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,399
exhale settling in here

99
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,160
and see if you can recognize the

100
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:26,440
lightest easiest softest way in which you could

101
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,839
know be aware as attend to the global

102
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:37,959
body the spacious body as you breathe

103
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:52,160
in in a soft relaxed way relaxing

104
00:12:52,639 --> 00:13:02,079
way that you compose and relax and settle your whole being on the

105
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:23,639
exhale and while you're attending to the body breathing in and breathing out

106
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:37,639
there's a very light soft connection

107
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:45,199
intimacy between the experience of breathing and the awareness of

108
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,920
it almost as if it's space spaciousness

109
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,720
that attends to

110
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,079
breathing e

111
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:26,639
and maybe like you would be sitting firmly relaxedly on a

112
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:34,079
bench where there's a vast view of mountains and

113
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:40,399
space great distance and both are there you are

114
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,639
centered on the bench content

115
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,519
happy while there is this wide

116
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:59,040
attention so allow yourself to the allow attention

117
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:06,839
allow yourself to sit on the bench of your settling

118
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:14,120
Point centering place place

119
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,959
where from where your inhale

120
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:30,399
begins where the exhale ends

121
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,600
stay close to that feeling the

122
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:49,199
changes the oscillations the Rhythm rest

123
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:57,120
there softly with a peripheral

124
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,240
attention the wide soft

125
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:11,520
attention lightly aware of the whole

126
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,558
body the spacious

127
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,400
body all of which

128
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,480
is oriented all of which is

129
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,880
settling all of which

130
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:50,520
surrounds the settling place with

131
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,840
breathing e

132
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:47,080
relaxing the thinking mind so that the

133
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:54,200
spacious body can

134
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,440
feel the vacuum that's left when there's very little

135
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
thinking

136
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

137
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

138
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

139
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

140
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

141
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

142
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

143
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

144
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,440
for e

145
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
for e

146
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,278
and as we come to the end of the

147
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:28,960
sitting with the exhale maybe even with the inhale

148
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:37,799
feel a gentle weight in your body or a gentle pull

149
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:46,760
or to be settled in the

150
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:06,240
body as if the gentle pull from gravity is welcoming awareness

151
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,480
attention to settle with the settling

152
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:16,000
body into a settling

153
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,720
place a grounding place within

154
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:38,720
and that radiating from that grounding Place spreading from

155
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,080
it is an open

156
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,799
awareness simple relaxed form of

157
00:27:51,799 --> 00:28:00,120
attention that's available for the world

158
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,240
that's open receptive

159
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,799
available while settled in the grounding

160
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:19,039
place and from there to have the Gaz spread out into the

161
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:23,919
world or from there have all the

162
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:32,278
world come to you come to your

163
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:42,679
awareness and to meet that with

164
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:50,039
friendliness to meet that with compassion and

165
00:28:53,720 --> 00:29:01,360
love to meet that with a dedication to honesty and

166
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:10,600
Truth to an ethical goodness that arises from the Simplicity

167
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:15,200
of this subtle Place deep

168
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,360
within trusting being

169
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:33,799
settled and being available in a kind way to whatever

170
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,080
comes available with kindness and

171
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:48,640
care may all beings be

172
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:54,600
happy may all beings be

173
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:01,398
safe may all beings be

174
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:06,200
peaceful may all beings be

175
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:16,320
free and may we realize that we don't have to react or go out or be

176
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:25,320
actively responsive we can be available

177
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:31,799
and peacefully

178
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:45,200
responsive to offer Good Will to our entire world may all beings be happy

179

[Music]

180
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:09,679
[Music] thank

181
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,919
you e

182
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:20,880
so welcome to this um now the 19th talk

183
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:27,080
on on samadi as we go very slowly into this

184
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:34,240
topic and um avoiding a headlong dive into

185
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:40,760
Samad an assertive kind of approach to really getting it and being deeply

186
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:48,919
concentrated but almost allowing it to grow in its own partly out of becoming more and more

187
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:55,679
familiar with your inner life your inner life of attention the different ways of

188
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,960
being attentive the different ways of being being aware the different ways of

189
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:08,200
that we can begin Gathering ourselves together becoming

190
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:14,559
composed being settled being gathered here all of us who we who we

191
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:22,600
are and for each of you this is going to be a different process and my words my instructions my

192
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:29,880
suggestions uh are just suggestions or pointers for you to begin to discover

193
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:37,399
what works for you what how are you what's going on what's your inner landscape like and how could your inner

194
00:33:37,399 --> 00:33:43,080
landscape become whole not divided not

195
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:50,840
fragmented and um and somadi has a lot to do with becoming whole and uh the classic language for

196
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:58,720
that is unification and um and uh

197
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,360
and I like to think of it as a you know Gathering everything together to be so everything's

198
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:10,040
included and everything is a lot of stuff you don't have to make an inventory of everything that you could

199
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:17,200
possibly do to kind of bring it in it's more a sense of um of uh a kind of

200
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,118
availability and expansiveness a presence that we have attention we have

201
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,638
which is not divided which doesn't actively limit and block things

202
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:34,398
and it's so easy to be preoccupied and the world that we're available to is

203
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:41,358
just very narrow and small uh it's very easy to have a particular idea belief

204
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:46,760
orientation about things and then we just zero in on that that becomes

205
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:54,240
important and uh and we don't notice anything else and the idea that samade is a

206
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,400
one-pointedness can lend itself to the idea of it's attention with blinders on

207
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:05,000
and uh and we're just really going to really bore into some some objects of

208
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:12,079
attention but rather than that to open awareness up to take take off the

209
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,599
blinders and um and be available in a very relaxed open way to the whole world

210
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:27,280
to everything and in the process of that to um become composed settled gathered

211
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:35,119
um in a in a way that we're sitting at the center of all things we're sitting at

212
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:41,040
the center of vast space or a center of all things

213
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:49,160
included um and um and uh and you know I've said this

214
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:55,040
many times but um I I to me it's very meaningful to use the analogy of uh

215
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,880
central vision and peripheral vision and so there's kind of a

216
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:08,400
central way in which we can become be aware attentive to what's happening we can have a center but then also there's

217
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:16,599
this peripheral awareness that this place where there's no edges where we're not staring at it you can't stare at

218
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:24,400
what's at the periphery of attention you have to kind of be have a soft and relaxed and kind of kind of a wide

219
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:34,359
angle kind of seeing to see peripheral awar uh uh attention

220
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:42,240
eyesight and um so the same thing with awareness and so to to be aware of

221
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:49,359
ourselves and be aware to find a place that's the the I call it the S settling

222
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:58,960
place the centering place the Gathering Place the the

223
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:06,760
um the um I have other words but uh uh that

224
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:13,640
that's that's a center of it all that it can be the place where we uh stand take

225
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:21,760
a stand take to compose ourselves on and uh it's almost like being there maybe

226
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,800
taking a stand but then opening our metaphorical arms really wide to be be

227
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:34,920
available to what's what's there to all around but we feel grounded settled on

228
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:41,560
this place and uh and then the other analogy is out of a bowl and the bowl

229
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:47,000
has a center at the bottom and and so everything can begin kind of angling

230
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,359
towards that Center and be included in the bow but everything kind of points to

231
00:37:53,359 --> 00:38:02,560
the center everything um rolls towards a center that's going to roll it's all included in this wide bowl of

232
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:11,119
spaciousness um and um the um so the

233
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:16,880
um so the language of today the the the

234
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:25,200
the idea today is that of comp being composed in ourselves so uh take a deep

235
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:31,920
breath relax be composed osed and maybe be oriented the whole

236
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:37,240
attention now is oriented towards that place at the center where the centering

237
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:42,760
place is we compose ourselves We Gather everything else around it and so that

238
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:50,480
there's a wide open sense of light awareness that supports the primary

239
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:56,319
attentiveness to that Center Point and if that is connected to breathing that

240
00:38:56,319 --> 00:39:03,079
it's the place where where the inhale Begins the exhale ends at the same place

241
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:08,240
uh and maybe the whole time we're at that place that point where it begins we

242
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,440
don't actually leave it there's a way in which that's the bench we sit on that's

243
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,440
the ground we stand on as we open up and become aware of what's wider not with

244
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:27,599
this active intentional attention exactly but rather this peripheral awareness that um that opens up and

245
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:32,760
allows everything then to get become composed around that

246
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:39,119
Center and what happens over time is that uh this uh if there then can be

247
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:45,560
this not a straining attention a narrow attention a laser focus attention there

248
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:52,760
can be a um a a a centered attention there that

249
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:58,720
over time um that becomes uh more and more

250
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:05,560
the kind of Fuller and richer and fills awareness more and more and and in some

251
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:11,000
ways the objects around us the objects in our body elsewhere begin to recede

252
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:18,000
into the spaciousness kind of become less and less attentive and aware and uh

253
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,560
and uh at some point you people even feel that there's no body anymore around

254
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:31,880
it it's all just kind of space and particular sensation ations maybe that are floating in space uh because the

255
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,880
minds latching on the mind holding on looking and wanting and not wanting um

256
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,880
labeling uh being concerned with judging as quieted down and its very mind

257
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:53,760
becomes more and more content to rest at this centering place at the spot where

258
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:01,200
we're getting oriented we're getting composed we're getting

259
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:08,079
settled and um and uh how big that place is and spot is varies from person to

260
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,480
person some it can be very small some people it can be a broader place but it

261
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:20,599
is a place where we're kind of this is where we're there's a continuity of attention and we're kind of not leaving

262
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:26,800
it we're not losing touch with it we're not uh uh getting lost in thoughts and

263
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:34,160
preoccupation ation and so one of the supports for this uh is this

264
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:41,560
gentle but but ongoing uh counting uh and some people can just

265
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:47,760
count up to one and start over again and that keeps the mind really simple but there's something gives us a little bit

266
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,520
like a little bit that gives us the emphasis stay there rest there stay open

267
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,079
there sometimes it's useful to count to 10 because that requires a higher order

268
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:04,480
um tracking of it in the mind and so the mind is a little bit more engaged uh

269
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:11,119
instead of its tendency to wonderand off in thought some people don't like the counting but it might actually be better

270
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,599
than the alternative the alternative to have the mind wander off that CH that um

271
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:21,880
Groove to WAND off is so well oiled and Slick that it just feels smooth and nice

272
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:28,040
and easy to wander off in thought and be lost and it's not really helpful for who

273
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:34,839
who allowing somat to arise and so even though it feels less

274
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:41,880
satisfying to count then to let the mind wander off uh it still might be the better alternative to keep you there to

275
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,079
keep you there and um and what happens with something like the counting is

276
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:52,680
after a while the counting becomes softer lighter easier more natural and

277
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:58,119
it supports the Gathering it's like the Mind begins to um

278
00:42:58,119 --> 00:43:03,559
uh accept that this is what we're doing being here on the Simplicity of the

279
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:09,559
moment moment after moment and when that happens when the Mind finally relaxes

280
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:16,440
and settles and you know is no longer afraid or Desiring or wanting or um and

281
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:21,559
you really settle in to being right here it can be such a

282
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:28,480
relief it allows so much sense of uh goodness and health and satisfaction and

283
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:35,680
contentment to beginner Rising um but there is a transition and uh sometimes the counting

284
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:41,760
can help us overcome that hurt that bump to really be able to settle in so

285
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:47,400
counting 1 to 10 and at this point I recommend uh you count the exhale so the

286
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:53,599
inhale can really be living there in the wake of the each count on the exhale to

287
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:59,160
really allow uh this quiet awareness to fill us

288
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:04,559
being and being centered there so

289
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:10,920
um so to sit

290
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:16,680
quietly and and begin learning the wonderful

291
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:23,839
art of using this wonderful multifaced capacity that we have for

292
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:31,359
attention that can be a vehicle for love so much so that at some point attention

293
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:40,280
and love might seem the same thing and Somali can seem not as a engineering

294
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:47,920
feat but can seem as a flowering of a kind of love that we're very happy to be

295
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:54,960
completely in as uh and let everything else kind of dissolve into the

296
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:02,880
spaciousness of awareness as as we stay uh in the settling spot the grounding

297
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:08,520
spot and maybe that description I just gave is what's coming and uh maybe it

298
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:20,520
gives you a little preview but we'll continue step by step and uh and uh thank you very much
