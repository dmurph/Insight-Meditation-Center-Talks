1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:07,000
good morning and welcome and for this meditation I'd like

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,960
to offer a simile uh maybe some of you have had

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:22,240
this occasion to maybe when you were young to learn to ride a bicycle and um sometimes people learn to

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,359
ride a bicycle with training wheels and uh imagine that

5
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:34,760
uh uh that you are accustoming yourself getting used to

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:40,440
you riding a bicycle with big solid training wheels maybe four of them one

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,160
in two in the front two in the back and so you're really stable and it's great to ride a bicycle it feels

8
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:54,239
wonderful but then uh you're afraid of uh taking the training wheels off uh

9
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:01,199
because then gravity will have its uh chance on you and and gravity is

10
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,280
dangerous and how are you going to be able to manage on your own and and so

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,560
then the attachment to the security of the wheels is quite strong can't imagine anything

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:22,159
else but then the training wheels go off and it's hard to write because uh this

13
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,479
conf this uh the way that we participate with gravity is confused and we don't

14
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:34,960
know how and we're very strongly ident identified as someone who's under the sway of gravity and and it's

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,560
inimaginable how we can be free of gravity and

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:48,159
um and uh then slowly we get the hang of keeping the balance as we pedal the bike

17
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,920
and then at some point just suddenly feel free and in a certain way we're still

18
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,079
under the influence of gravity but we've learned how to manage how to Pedal have

19
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:07,159
the right speed how to stay balanced and it feels like now we're free now Bic

20
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:13,599
bicycling can just be like a free thing it feels so delightful and within time you know how to you could even bike

21
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:19,760
without holding the handlebar and and uh be upright and it just feels so

22
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,519
wonderful and um and now in a certain kind of way we're no

23
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:31,720
longer preoccupied by gravity we don't identify ourselves as someone who is

24
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:39,040
under the sway of gravity or someone who is a victim of gravity or someone who's

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,360
incapable of responding dealing with gravity the sense of self is so caught up in this idea of

26
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,400
gravity that it's impossible to be free of it but at some point uh the pedaling

27
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,000
and the movement of the bike we now are in a certain way free of gravity we can go about on the bicycle without having

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:06,000
any concern about it no conscious involvement and there's no identification with it there's no being

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,519
caught or gravity is no longer a sticky thing for us uh we're unstuck from

30
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:19,200
Gravity so and that's similar the same thing with awareness with mindfulness

31
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,640
with our capacity to know what's happening to clearly recognize it the

32
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,920
capacity to sense what's happening without being entangled with what is

33
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,280
known or entangled with what we sense there's a freedom that can come

34
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:43,799
when uh mindfulness awareness has is no longer caught in the gravity of

35
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:49,080
stickiness of attachments of identification of me and mine I can't

36
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:56,159
and I can and can't and and uh it's unimaginable to imagine a life uh that

37
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,760
um is is uh not using training wheels and imaginable to use a

38
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,760
life where we're not uh stuck to and entangled with our

39
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:14,159
emotions or our beliefs or our thoughts but it is possible it is possible to

40
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,639
think to have emotions uh just like there's always gravity and there's a feeling of

41
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,680
non-stickiness a feeling of like oh this is freedom I can go about now with these

42
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,680
things but I'm not pulled down I'm not pulled into into them I'm not caught in them they don't Define me there's a

43
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,880
freedom of moving about this is the possibility with awareness a Clarity of

44
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:45,479
seeing Clarity of knowing in the clear knowing of what's happening in the

45
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:51,919
moment in the in the intimate sensing without any

46
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:58,039
identification there we find our freedom and uh and with this it's not

47
00:04:58,039 --> 00:05:04,840
about putting on new training wav it's not about getting you know a a

48
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:11,320
bicycle with much thicker uh Wheels getting a tricycle it's not about uh

49
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,120
what bicycle you have even U but rather it's learning to be free and writing it

50
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,240
learning how to balance and all that so the freedom that comes with mindfulness

51
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:28,360
is not about the experience we're having it's not like having a special

52
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:35,520
experience but rather no matter what's happening we know how to ride the bike we know how to

53
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,240
be free we know how to be present see know clearly see clearly feel clearly

54
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,680
without being entangled with what is known felt or seen so this becomes particularly useful

55
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,240
and very important when we have challenges challenges in meditation with

56
00:05:55,240 --> 00:06:01,400
our own mind our own heart our own body um that our mind body and heart are

57
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:09,080
not behaving the way we want that we don't have to change necessarily what's happening but we can find our freedom

58
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:15,160
with it we're not going to do away with gravity but we are going to find our

59
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:21,440
freedom with it and so uh some people are expecting meditation and wanting

60
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,520
meditation uh to be really Pleasant and wonderful deep calm and peace of course

61
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:33,000
that's important that's a a part of it but that's not how freedom is found

62
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,120
freedom is found no matter what the experience is that it's known in this

63
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:46,160
free way so with that long introduction we'll start so

64
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:56,360
to assume a meditation posture that for you regardless of your

65
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:04,000
posture standing sitting walking or lying down somehow or

66
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,360
other um

67
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:18,280
represents a posture of being free a posture of being somehow in a

68
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:26,199
dignified way

69
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,639
independent even maybe in C certain kind of mindfulness way

70
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:41,199
self-reliant adjusting your posture maybe so the chest is a little bit more

71
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:52,199
open maybe sitting up a little sitting up straighter or adjusting the body with

72
00:07:52,199 --> 00:08:00,879
pillows in such a way that the belly is relaxed and has a chance to relax

73
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:08,360
gently close your

74
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,919
eyes and now to just start

75
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:31,440
directly notice in your way your experience how you are

76
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,839
and not how you are in the abstract but how What in in detail

77
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:47,600
specifically what are the direct experiences that are happening for you that make up how you are here and

78
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:54,320
now what are the sensations of the body the mind the

79
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:02,360
heart that contribute to the more abstract way that we say how we

80
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,600
are what how do you experience yourself

81
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:18,040
now and are you caught in that are you that's sticky for you are

82
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:26,399
you pulled into it and reacting to it or believing it or prioritizing

83
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,360
something or pulling back or judging

84
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,079
can you know what's happening for you right

85
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:49,160
now and find a way to know to

86
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:55,800
recognize that feels free of what is known

87
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:10,360
like you would hear a innocuous sound in the distance and so clear that you're not

88
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:17,200
involved in the sound or judging it or reacting to it it's just a sound that

89
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:27,600
has nothing to do with you and you're free of it not caught by it it's not sticky

90
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,600
or you're seeing something in the environment that's neither appealing nor

91
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:50,760
threatening neither yours nor anybody else's maybe a cloud in the

92
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,800
sky an unthreatening Cloud floating in the sky

93
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:09,279
and the seeing of the cloud you're free of the cloud no

94
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:17,839
stickiness and so to Center yourself on your

95
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,720
breathing and see feel

96
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,639
know the sensations of the body body as you

97
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:50,639
breathe is there in fact some stickiness for you in experiencing

98
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:06,320
breathing for you you what way can you begin

99
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,320
feeling

100
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:21,040
freedom from the experience of breathing while attending to it

101
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,160
for

102
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,600
perhaps taking a little time to relax your

103
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,079
body maybe every time you

104
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:16,600
exhale the tenser the body the more likely we are to identify

105
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:21,240
or be sticky sticking to

106
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,079
something e

107
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:29,600
relaxing the mind the thinking mind

108
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:52,240
softening in the Heart

109
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
Center

110
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

111
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

112
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,880
for e

113
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,280
gently quietly

114
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:41,840
peacefully like you're slowly pedaling a bicycle with freedom and

115
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:51,559
ease Let each moment of knowing recognition being

116
00:18:52,360 --> 00:19:00,360
aware be a little push of The Petal that keeps you free

117
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,440
from whatever is

118
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:18,919
known no what's happening while moving on with

119
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:29,400
awareness no while letting the river of experience

120
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,880
flow through

121
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:47,639
you knowing mindfulness not sticking to

122
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
anything

123
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

124
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

125
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

126
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

127
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

128
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

129
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

130
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

131
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

132
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,360
e for

133
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:52,679
perhaps you can feel a quality of calmness or

134
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:58,000
Stillness from these minutes of meditation

135
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:06,799
or a quietness relative to how meditation started for

136
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,520
you or maybe with the

137
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:25,320
exhale you can relax into a calm or quiet or Stillness

138
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:41,960
and without making extra effort can you

139
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,440
notice some sense of knowing being

140
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:54,880
aware that does not is not sticky doesn't stick to what is known or what

141
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,600
we're aware of

142
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:11,520
awareness is free to move on to allow things to change and move

143
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:17,760
on available for whatever is new this River of

144
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,679
time letting everything flow

145
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:42,000
and may it be that our ability to be present with no entanglement no for

146
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:48,840
against no stickiness allows our care and

147
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:56,240
love respect for others to be present when we're with

148
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:04,240
others May whatever Freedom we

149
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:11,440
discover in knowing

150
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:18,159
freely be like an Open Door through

151
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:23,320
which our Good Will can

152
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:32,919
flow may this practice that we do support

153
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:38,278
us to meet the world with Good

154
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,960
Will wishing others

155
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,600
happiness safety

Peace and

157

Freedom may all beings be

happy may all beings be

159
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:14,000
safe may all beings be

160
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:23,039
peaceful may all beings be free and may our good

161
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:28,080
will support that possibility

[Music]

163
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,559
thank

164
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,039
you e

165
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:56,240
so hello and welcome to this third talk on the hindrances the hindrances are

166
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,440
five kind of strategy IES that our inner life has

167
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:07,000
to um to respond to challenges in unhelpful

168
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:12,799
ways and maybe in some ways life is always has always has some challenges

169
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:20,080
and so how we respond to them is part of the nature of this practice of ours and I think it's important not to

170
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:27,559
think of mindfulness practice about kind of floating on a cloud of bliss and joy and just being just

171
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:35,399
peaceful ful and and have you know and happy ever after a more more valuable way of

172
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:40,679
understanding mindfulness practice is that we are actually learning how to be

173
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:46,840
present in an effective way and a Wholesome Way with u the challenges that

174
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:52,720
life brings that they always bring and um so one of the ways to do

175
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:58,000
that is to understand the unhelpful ways in which we respond to challenges and

176
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,039
the five hindrances are such things so sometimes we respond with uncertainty

177
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:10,320
and confusion and running around not being able to make decisions

178
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:17,120
um sometimes we respond with uh agitation

179
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:24,519
restlessness uh maybe with regrets and remorse about who we are what's happening how

180
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:30,919
we're showing up what happened in the past sometimes we are which the topic for

181
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:39,919
today is that somehow we freeze up we shut down we go to sleep in some way so

182
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,840
we're not having to deal with the challenges that come and then for the next two days next day is sometimes we

183
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:53,159
respond with uh hostility with aversion ill will with blame with

184
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:58,480
complaining um with hostility and then finally on Friday

185
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,559
we uh respond with u desires of different types uh sensual desires

186
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:11,720
avaricious desires desires of greed we want something to uh to fill us

187
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,919
to make us feel good to get away from what's difficult and challenging and and

188
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:24,880
we want to substitute it with you know something that makes us kind of have pleasure and and so this engagement with

189
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:31,720
desire and um and some of these uh patterns can be pervasive in in a

190
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:38,799
person's life some people you can they can recognize that one of these is their calling card and this is where they keep

191
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:45,000
falling back to keep falling back to so part of mindfulness practice is

192
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,240
become a uh wise about recognizing these

193
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:56,519
hindrances so vasna student Insight student should really learn these well

194
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:04,000
and um uh listen to Dharma talks study them think about them read about them I have

195
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,878
a whole little book called uh unhindered that uh you can you know has

196
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:16,839
my essays about them and it might give you a kind of a clear sense of how they work for you to to read something like

197
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:23,200
my book and um the um so for today it's a

198
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:29,520
topic that's usually called sloth and torper and and for many of us the word

199
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,839
sloth as a quality of lethargy or something is not really something that

200
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:43,398
we that use that word in English much though we most of us will might know what it means and um but when I studied

201
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:50,358
the poly for it uh the ancient language uh the dictionary says that it can mean

202
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:55,878
rigidity and um and I think that works a little bit better because sloth and torp

203
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:02,839
are a little bit too closely connected too too similar but to have something a little bit wider that uh uh talks

204
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:09,320
through some very common human reaction to somehow to freeze to shut down to get

205
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:18,400
rigid um to get uh so really tight and contracted in situations maybe from Fear

206
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,800
um uh I think there's it it expands the meaning of this third hindrance in a way

207
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:31,320
I think is useful for many people and um this is where we feel overwhelmed or feel excessively

208
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:38,440
challenged by what goes on in life so there's some mechanism of shutting down it's not ordinary tiredness when they

209
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:45,119
talk about torper but it's a kind of shutting down um and giving up or uh

210
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:51,680
that uh the system gets so tired so um

211
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,720
dull so uh um um yeah kind of like like

212
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:04,839
mud in the mind and it's hard to get through it and um and so um things don't

213
00:36:04,839 --> 00:36:10,680
seem very clear and there's a vagueness and there's um not much energy to apply

214
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:16,480
ourselves and kind of kind of giving up sometimes of our engagement with things

215
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:23,680
that kind of makes things dull and shut down sometimes they can be quite intense

216
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:32,160
uh if there's a lot of fear or a lot of anger or the emotional response we have is just so strong that um the other or

217
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,359
the other three four hindrances are just like really uh energized or that um

218
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:47,560
something shuts down again something uh we don't want to pay attention we there's a resistance there's a a um a um

219
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:54,480
we're resisting what's happening we're bored uh because we don't want to pay attention we don't like what's happening

220
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:01,599
so um there's a shutting down again so to pay attention to this movement of of

221
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:10,119
um the drop of Engagement the drop of energy the drop of of um Clarity is an

222
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:15,440
important uh part of this practice notice is how that hinders us how this

223
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,480
gets in a way of clarity gets a away of understanding what is wholesome and it's

224
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,520
said that this kind of this third hindrance sloth and torper or rigidity

225
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:33,640
and torper um is unhealthy is a hindrance is a is a um is an UNH

226
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,720
wholesome movement and it's possible to feel that it feels there's a dulling

227
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:45,480
there's a shutting down there's a a unwillingness there's

228
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:53,480
a not engaged in understanding or or reflecting or studying the situation

229
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,800
being curious and interested in it and it can feel this that very uncomfortable

230
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:05,040
to be in our own skin when sloth and torpor is present in a very different way than you're simply tired or

231
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:11,760
exhausted or something and um and so as uncomfortable

232
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:19,400
it is to feel this if there is this rigidity and and um and and torper the

233
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:26,200
practice of mindfulness is to turn around and really see it to become the expert on boredom the expert on

234
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:33,560
Resistance the expert on shutting down uh the exert exer expert on how we avoid

235
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:40,359
and deflect how we you know uh how

236
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:45,680
we you know get um

237
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:54,200
dull and uh and how we can change that how we can become different and I think

238
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:59,760
the wisest way of doing that is to understand that the unhealthy ways in which we're responding to what's

239
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,160
happening around us what's happening in our life um some forms of depression uh

240
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:10,599
are kind of this hindrance it's a kind of shutting down a giving up that where

241
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:16,880
the energy disappears and we're not we don't feel any V vitality and inspiration and there could be a sinking

242
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:23,160
into that so uh and so to be mindful of that

243
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,680
that can be very hard if we are identified with it if We believe We

244
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:35,640
Define ourselves by it if we are invested into the the strategy of

245
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:41,359
rigidity and toror and and we we're

246
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:48,000
so part of it that there's so much stickiness between us and it that it's

247
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,480
unimaginable that we could be any different but in fact we can and one of

248
00:39:53,480 --> 00:40:00,000
the things we can cultivate and what we want to develop here is is not just mindfulness not just being aware of

249
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
what's happening but one step further we want to discover the way of being aware

250
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,599
the way of knowing we we where we are independent from what is

251
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:19,480
known that uh we're able to see into the seeing to understand how

252
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:26,200
seeing can be free of what is seen the solution in a sense the The

253
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:32,079
Liberation we're looking for for in Buddhism is not in what we seek but how

254
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:40,560
we seek not in what we know but how we know of course we have to know but how

255
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:49,440
we know how we feel how we hear and so if we have sloth and torpor

256
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:57,960
rigidity and and this dullness is how we know it is important and to learn how to

257
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:04,480
awaken how to rise up with a sharpness

258
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,839
or a Clarity of attention to bring energy into the mindfulness into the

259
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:17,880
knowing so we begin to uh be free of what is known this Clarity opens up the

260
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,560
image of a a a Lotus that's growing in muddy water but then when it's going to

261
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:29,520
flower the lotus flower comes out of the muddy water and is Untouched by the mud

262
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,640
and it's clear so as we get out of the muddy water of sloth and torper

263
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:40,400
something the wareness becomes somehow this beautiful flower that's untouched

264
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,319
while we know we have sloth and torper which begins to decrease its influence on

265
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:53,920
us so the traditional um uh discussion about letting go of sloth and torper uh

266
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:00,400
and it's possible sometimes to just let go of it because because but uh or when

267
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:08,200
we clearly know how to see it we've learned to recognize its ins and outs and how it works um we see it is an

268
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:15,040
activity of the Mind there we're doing something we're picking up the strategy and so it's possible when we

269
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:21,079
know it well enough to see that it's possible to put it down to let it go so

270
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:29,079
the Buddha WR said having let go of rigidity and toror one dwells without

271
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:34,640
rigidity and toror mindful with clear

272
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:42,760
comprehension and consciously seeing doing this one cleanses the mind

273
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:50,880
of rigidity and torper so they have cleansing the mind so so here the emphasis to overcome this sloth and

274
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:57,400
torper rigidity and dullness boredom and and shutting down

275
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:04,200
is to cultivate these attentional qualities of mindfulness clear

276
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:10,280
comprehension clear recognition of what's happening and um and conscious

277
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:16,960
seeing so not just seeing but seeing with purpose or seeing with intention or

278
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:23,000
seeing with uh knowing that we're seeing conscious seeing knowing we're seeing

279
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,440
and uh it's possible to see something be so involved with it we we don't really

280
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:34,400
know that we're seeing because we' that's kind of taken for granted we're so caught up in what we want or what we

281
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,200
don't want that um that we don't notice that our eyes are popping out of their eye

282
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:47,359
sockets and so but to to see consciously means to be

283
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:53,280
aware of the quality the characteristics the the healthiness the wholesomeness of

284
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:59,119
how we see and so or how we know how we sense

285
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:04,319
sense so it's in the attentional faculties that we have that we bring

286
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:09,760
attention in all the different faculties of attention we have hearing seeing

287
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:16,400
smelling touching uh tasting um the everything all the sense stores in the

288
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:23,960
in the body and in the Mind's Eye where we know and see what's going on internally with us with the mind all

289
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:32,319
these attentional faculties can be awaken can be engaged without any stickiness without

290
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:39,119
any invocation with the challenges that we have and that's my suggestion for you

291
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:46,400
today is um certainly become aware of how sloth and toror shutting down

292
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:53,839
rigidity and and U dullness come into play for you in different points going to watch your mind it's fascinating to

293
00:44:53,839 --> 00:45:00,640
watch like at a meeting or something um when your mind mind starts to drift off when your mind starts shutting down when

294
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,960
you get sleepy or dull and when it picks up again what is happening in the room

295
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:13,079
what's happening in the talking what's happening in yourself and you can watch sometimes the cycles and rhythms of of

296
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:21,760
being clear and present and being dull and not really paying attention but more important uh see what

297
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:27,960
you can learn about being present being with attention

298
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:33,760
where whatever form of attention you're using whatever mindfulness you have is

299
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:42,760
um independent of what is known that you find your freedom in it and um like like

300
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:48,480
you find your freedom from Gravity when you learn to be skilled at riding a

301
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:55,640
bicycle so um thank you very much and um so tomorrow and Friday I'm tra I'm
