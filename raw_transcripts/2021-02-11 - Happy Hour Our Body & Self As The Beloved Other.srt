so a warm-hearted welcome to all of you wherever you are in this

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:14,799
moment in this world of ours this being human

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:22,720
whatever the weather whatever the weather externally whatever the weather internally whatever is happening

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:30,720
here we are together practicing so as we've been practicing

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,960
i'm going through the categories of of karuna compassion together

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:44,160
we're lingering a little longer with self-compassion karuna for because you

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:51,600
can never have enough karuna for self compassion for self filling our own cup so tonight

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:01:00,000
we'll we'll continue with that and there's so many different ways to do this practice there is no right or wrong

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,720
these are all skillful means you can try different methods see what works

10
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:15,200
and um and one thing i wanted to bring up

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:24,000
today in our exploration for the practice is to explore the relationship

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,680
between self-compassion and resilience

13
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,479
well you might wonder hmm okay what's the relationship between self

14
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:49,520
compassion and resilience some aspects might be obvious some may

15
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,159
not be i'll offer a couple of thoughts and then we'll just explore and experiment on our

16
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,000
own so one thought one reflection about

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,840
resilience is the sense of when something challenging happens in life it doesn't

18
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,800
so much mean that you don't get knocked over yes you do get knocked over but how quickly you stand up

19
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,840
how quickly you get up how quickly you write yourself

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,879
and there are studies supporting that this

21
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:38,480
practice mindfulness meditation and this practice in general it increases resilience in this way in

22
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,080
this way of getting knocked over getting up more quickly whereas something would happen perhaps

23
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,280
you would berate yourself or be upset or depressed for days or

24
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,680
weeks [Music] you bounce back more quickly and you may

25
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,959
have already observed this about yourself if you've been practicing for a while

26
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,599
there are areas of your life that don't get you down as much or as long

27
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,200
as they used to now one thing to consider about practice of

28
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:21,120
self-compassion and the relationship with resilience is when you're more compassionate to

29
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:30,159
yourself there is a sense of soothing there is a

30
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:38,280
soothing self that supports you to stand up to get up more quickly it's a sense of support sense of

31
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:46,879
empowerment imagining compassion to be weak actually it's it's a powerful expression

32
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,239
of our own strength and love for ourselves to hold ourselves with care

33
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,720
to hold our difficulties with with care and love so there is a sense

34
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,760
of resilience um instead of being down especially if we

35
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:11,439
keep being down with self-recognition with self-judgment it will keep us down

36
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,919
it will keep us miserable and depressed but with a sense of self-compassion can

37
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:24,479
actually take responsibility okay okay i did my best

38
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:33,040
given all the cause and conditions didn't turn out as as well as i aspire to but it's okay

39
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:41,040
sweetie i forgive you i love you i care for you ah and let's

40
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,560
aspire to to uh to our values to show up in in the way

41
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,680
that we really want to instead of oh you're terrible you're a loser you're awful so

42
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,000
it can really support us in resilience in that way not to give us a free past

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:06,160
that's not the idea but to support us in resilience so without further ado

44
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,280
let's practice together so i'd like to invite you

connect with this beloved other in your own way in time

121
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,278
are there ways that you underestimate yourself

122
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,840
diminish yourself

123
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:58,960
see yourself with not enough

124
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,480
depth perspective dimensionality

125
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:12,720
grace and beauty such that

126
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:19,279
this being that is you actually is a beloved other you don't completely

127
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:27,360
know or understand

128
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:31,840
they are far more unfathomable

129
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,320
there be love and compassion for this

130
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:55,840
beloved other and their beauty

131
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:09,840
and challenges

132
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:53,840
and for the last few minutes of this practice

133
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:07,840
see what's needed

134
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:28,000
never feels appropriate opening the circle of care and compassion

135
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,960
to all those who are practicing with you with their physical

136
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:49,838
energetic emotional challenges and all beings everywhere in your own time

137
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,200
all beings everywhere all beings in this zoom room and on

138
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:30,480
youtube practicing with you as these beloved others

139
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:38,640
you only get a sense of them perhaps a limited sense in the small groups

140
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:45,838
but they are far more complex

141
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:55,520
not reducible to either our or their conceptions of

142
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:04,559
themselves wishing all beings everywhere

143
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,000
goodness may all beings be free

144
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:27,838
and happy and then peace

145
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:31,840
[Music]

146
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,839
thank you for your practice everyone

147
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:51,280
so the idea of ourselves our bodies our hearts this being who's us

148
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:57,599
as a beloved other the way we would treat a beloved friend the beloved being

149
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:04,640
treating ourselves in the same way same way that we give them the benefit

150
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:09,760
of the doubt and allow them

151
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:18,560
to have their their complexity not let them be reduced

152
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,359
to a limited understanding doing the same for ourselves and holding

153
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:35,359
ourselves with compassion care so we'd love to

154
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:42,240
invite you if you like to share something about your practice something

155
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:48,839
that came up an observation maybe something that was challenging

156
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:54,720
also if you'd like to share the wisdom of of that how you worked with that or

157
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,960
how you were stuck with that it's all okay you can either raise your hand if you haven't shared

158
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:08,160
in a while uh or ever or you can type it in chat

159
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,200

160
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,960
ben you're welcome to raise your hand to extend

161

benefit of the doubt oh benefit of the doubt okay

162
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:41,119
play on words i see yeah i like that benefit of the doubt

163
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:47,800
benefit of the faith bill asks what did you mean when you use the word

164
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:52,720
energetically that's a great question

165
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:01,838
so it's something to open up to and explore

166
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:08,400
um that often as as we sit and we practice for a

167
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,520
while or also for some people when they're new

168
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:18,560
to practice there's a sense of physical the physicality of the body

169
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,240
the physical sense of the body there's also kind of an energetic sense of the body

170
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,760
that the body is breathing there is um as i was describing the

171
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:36,400
meditation as if the edge of your body is is a few inches beyond your skin there's

172
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:43,760
a sense of ah you've you know have you here's a simple way to to relate to it have you ever felt like

173
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:50,480
you're buoyant you can walk on air you feel so good energetically wow you feel expansive and

174
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:58,000
light and sometimes you feel heavy and just ah contracted so

175
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,640
it doesn't just feel physical at those times there's an energetic sense of buoyancy

176
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,760
so that's what i'm inviting you to you to become more sensitive to

177
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,800
and tune into there is so much to discover about ourselves does that make

178
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,359
sense bill

179
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,760
and yeah

180
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:32,240
and susan please see your hand raised

181
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:39,838
yeah um i noticed that sometimes i feel some confusion with

182
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:48,000
accepting like um so i have some challenging health issues

183
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,839
so accepting my body and loving my body

184
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:59,200
but yet wanting to heal and get better and not get

185
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,680
caught in identifying with the illness does that make sense so sometimes i have a problem of like when i go into wanting

186
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:11,839
to love my body yeah and telling myself it belongs all of it belongs the pain whatever i'm

187
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:18,480
feeling belongs that i'm then allowed i'm allowing that all to be there

188
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:25,599
and i'm identifying with it and then i won't get better i won't heal i have some

189
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:32,800
does that make sense that can i'm saying that confusion yeah yeah it does i hear that this conflict

190
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:38,560
sort so let me reflect reflect back there's a sense of when when you get into meditation trying to

191
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:46,160
love the body and and all the ways it is suffering and accepting the pain feeling it belongs

192
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,200
then feeling like oh if you accept that then you're not going to get better because you're allowing it all to be

193
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:57,040
yeah and i'm identifying with the pain like right you know so so here's exactly so

194
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:05,760
here's the slight shift in perspective i'm going to suggest susan so instead of identifying with the pain

195
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:12,880
as as you're turning to to love and appreciate the body appreciate and love all the ways the

196
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,839
body is hurting not the pain but all the ways the body is struggling is trying to heal

197
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:25,040
and it's having a hard time like a good friend who's really doing its way so so in that way

198
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:32,319
you're not identifying with the pain but identifying with the body hurting and just having a hard time

199
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:38,720
aligning itself with health so in that way you're accepting and there's an inspiration for health

200
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:44,319
does that make sense that shift yeah i think so it's like yeah not

201
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:49,760
identifying with the illness and i'm just using pain as an overall yeah

202
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,880
because it's easier for people to identify with so it's like not identifying with the illness

203
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:01,760
but just being really kind and loving with my body and all the sensations and my

204
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:08,400
feeling and and um giving that that care and love and

205
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:17,040
compassion and knowing that that probably is the most healing thing from my body that's exactly right right on yeah

206
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,240
thank you so much thank you susan thank you for that

207
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:30,160
the other reflections questions realizations came up for you in this practice

208
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:38,240
mara christine says it makes me think our practice needs to be proactive

209
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:45,119
help tell me what you mean by that amari christina uh if you could um

210
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:50,240
see if you could kind if you would like to unmute yourself if you wish you're

211
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:56,560
welcome to if not that's okay as opposed to being um passive recipients we're quite

212
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:02,480
in the process of um how we feel about our body and where how

213
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,599
our mind inclines yes oh absolutely yes yes yes i see what

214
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:13,839
you're saying there's yeah and the way that i i would i say that usually in

215
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:21,359
nikki's wording is you know um we our act of perception the way we're

216
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:26,480
perceiving creates our world every

217
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:35,200
act of perception is a weaver of worlds so the way we perceive is really weaving

218
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:42,560
a particular kind so in this proactivity that you're naming is the way we choose to perceive we choose there's so

219
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:48,480
many different perceptions we can have so yeah thank you

220
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:55,680
other reflections are there especially if you haven't shared for a while

221
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:04,599
i was how is the idea of the body as the beloved other connecting with this friend the

222
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:09,280
unfathomability the dimensionality

223
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:16,000
or anything else i'll take one more

224
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:19,839
pause

225
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:31,599
okay so having taken one beat so we'll leave some time for the other

226
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:37,599
side when we come back ben says i've only recently started

227
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:45,520
playing paying down the debt of love i didn't know to give my body growing up ah that is

228
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:53,040
sweet that's yeah the debt of love it's it's wonderful to pay it to pay it down

229
00:45:53,040 --> 00:46:01,440
whenever ben it's i appreciate your your use of words they're beautiful

230
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,480
makes me makes me happy so the invitation for tonight here hear it

231
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:13,359
before you jump off those who think of groups so one way one invitation which is a

232
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:19,280
really unique way to relate to other human beings and take this as a

233
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:24,800
practice as a little sandbox that then you can take to

234
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,400
people in your life to practice with them the invitation is in the group

235
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,920
to see if you can see them as people who you know you're getting just

236
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:42,880
this small two-dimensional one-dimensional three-dimensional perspective of who

237
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,880
they are and what they're saying but there's so much more to them so much more to them so can you listen

238
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:55,760
to them and can you listen to yourself appreciating this this uniqueness that

239
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:01,839
you haven't quite explored about yourself or about the other people really giving them the benefit of the

240
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:06,960
doubt or benefit of the faith as as ben was saying just really opening up

241
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,560
to each other and seeing what what it feels like if you held the other people in this way what what

242
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:18,880
might switch do it as an experiment as if you're scientist of your own

243
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:26,000
mind nothing might happen but something profound might happen so i'd like to invite you to to relate in

244
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:33,599
that way with each other and start with 30 seconds of silence holding each other these amazing beings that you are each

245
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:38,720

challenging to to share some challenging and difficulties with

265
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:37,119
with your group um whenever you reflected and that's completely understandable it can feel

266
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:44,079
very very very vulnerable to share something that's very challenging right now sadness

267
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:52,079
depression to share with the group and feel vulnerable and i hope you felt supported in that and i'm happy
