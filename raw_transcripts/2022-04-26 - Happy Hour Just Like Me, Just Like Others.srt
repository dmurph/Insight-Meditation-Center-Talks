meta for compassion uh both ways so the way you can support

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,720
us for and what i mean by both ways is the following so one way is

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,799
um for us to take it easy on ourselves like oh yeah

17
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:49,840
i'm like anyone else i'm just like anyone else anybody else who would be in this kind of situation

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,759
in this physical situation with this illness or with this emotional challenge

19
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,960
they would be having a hard time right now they would be having a hard time so i'm not separate i'm not different from

20
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,640
anybody else just like others i'm just like others just like me

21
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,560
or just like them and the same way so you get the one way right so you're not separate because

22
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:21,200
we're usually so hard on ourselves like get it together come on get it together like you should be able to do this like

23

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,120
like anyone else that's one way this just like me can be

26
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,720
supportive the other direction where it can be

27
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:54,000
supportive is when we see others when we see others

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,599
um maybe other suffering and we feel with them we feel for them

29
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:08,400
that oh just like me this is a human being just like me they're just like me

30

31
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,840

33
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:34,400

can be super power can be really supportive in our practice so

38
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:03,519
so what i'll do tonight in guiding us in practice together

39
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,799
is um as always we'll start with

40
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,920
settling settling into our bodies with our breath we usually take roughly about

41
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:20,479
10 minutes just to settle it's so important to settle in the body and the breath before

42
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,639
starting meta we always do that always do that very important

43
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:33,520
and then we open up and what i like to do is to actually start with um

44
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,919
well i'll keep it a surprise you see you'll go explore and as always i like

45
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,199
to say especially if you're new to this practice or even if you've done it a

46
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:53,280
million times whatever arises whatever arises

47
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:02,240
even if or especially if it's not what you expect as long as you're kind towards it as

48
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,840
long as you're kind towards yourself you are doing this practice right

49
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,440
so if there's a little voice that comes oh you're distracted you're sleepy you're not doing this right you're

50
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,039
terrible if you're kind towards it oh sweetheart you're having a hard time it's okay

51
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,479
it's okay dear it's okay you are doing this practice right

52
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:31,520
as long as you have kindness towards whatever arises that's what we're cultivating here okay

53
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:39,440
so be kind be kind to whatever rises so

54
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,680
so with that i'd like to invite you to settle if you need to move to your

55
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:54,240
cushion or to a chair or maybe even lie down if that's what your body needs right now

56
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:03,840
take care of this body my body wants to shift a little bit before settling in my chair

57
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:13,600
sitting such that you can be comfortable for the next 30 minutes

58
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:20,280
sitting lying down standing it's all okay all postures

59
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:29,039
of meditation and arriving arriving in this body

60
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:36,080
letting go [Music] in this moment from how busy the day might have been

72
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,039
letting go releasing thoughts in this moment preoccupations

73
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:06,720
of course there are many and it's okay trust that they're important enough they

74
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,720

77
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:35,839
letting all the busyness be outside be away dancing on its own

78
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,839

and letting the breath be received

82
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,399
each breath let it be received in your abdomen

83
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:48,880
not from the control tower no but as if the body is an organ of perception

84
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,120
receiving each breath the entirety of the in-breath the

85
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:01,760
entirety of the breath like a lullaby

86
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:11,600
soothing breath calming calming

87
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,199

88
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,440
with the breath

89
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:33,000

and if thoughts arise it's not a problem not a problem at all

92
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,399

93
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:12,320
and then gently gently released released from your heart your chest

94
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,079

99
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:36,720
entangled in the busyness of thoughts it can be so calm and sweet

100
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,880
enjoying enjoying the breath being received

101
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:49,839

let it be enjoyable you're treat for the day for yourself

103

and i would like to invite you if you would bring someone to mind who's

105
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:24,639
easy for you to have warmth care kindness towards

106
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,319
could be a pet a child a friend

107
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:38,120
someone who has been kind to you in the past benefactor so with with whom you have an

108
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:44,240
uncomplicated relationship ideally a little bit of complication is okay but

109
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:52,399
not too complicated so when when you think of just a smile maybe shows up a sense of

110
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:57,600
safety just a natural care

111
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,880
or this being for this person or being

112
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,120
breather image their sense to your mind's eye

113
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,839

114
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:25,520
with them and let there be a sense of kindness the phrases flowing out of

115
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:31,760
the sense of connection you have the four traditional phrases

116
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:37,840

117

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:08,559
just like others i suffer in these ways may i be free

162
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:15,919
from this challenge may i have ease i am no different

163
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,960
i am no different from anyone else in this way

164
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:35,200
it's common humanity appreciating my own common humanity

165
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,600
that this is hard it would be hard for anyone

166
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:48,440
may i have ease in the midst of it

167
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,600
and i'd like to invite you to choose someone who is neutral for you a person

168
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,600
maybe you know them a little bit or maybe someone you have just a slight

169
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:51,279
bit of irritation with a tiny bit not the number one person on your list

170
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,039
and realize that this person the stand-in for all of humanity this other

171
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:02,480
being this human being or maybe just choosing a random person

172
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:09,039
you don't know here on zoom practicing together in sangha

just like me they want to be happy they want to do their best in this world

175
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:30,919
in this life they're an object of affection of someone

176
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,640
and they care for others we have a tender heart for others

we're human of course our life circumstances are different

180
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:07,200
maybe our gender identity or size or age

181
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:13,840
background but the basic basic humanity

00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,640
mind except calming uh just relax the animal of your body let

269
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:10,319
also suffers and cares about his family this is a big step for me i have been hating him thank

270
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:17,599
you syrian yeah that is powerful thank you for bringing that in to um separate

271
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:25,040
the actions which are not condonable and from the human humanity of the human

272
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,720
being there is so much delusion so much confusion so much hurt that

273
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:36,880
turning around and hurting others so thanks for bringing that in serena and yay what an opening for you mudita for

274
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:43,200
kim says peggy beautiful yes same here lovely mark says the five remembrances tell us

275
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,560
that it is inevitable that we will all get old sick die and lose all we love

276
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:55,200
how does it fit that we wish everyone health and happiness knowing they and we will get sick and lose all

277
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:01,200
we love oh yeah of course yeah yeah mark of course yeah it's not a problem um

278
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:07,440
it's that of course we know that that's what happens and yet we wish it it's without attachment to

279
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,839
outcome that is what's important because if you're attached to outcome if you want it to happen

280
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:21,280
then of course like it's not going to happen so why am i wishing it but you offer it as a generosity as a gift to

281
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,480
train your own heart and generosity it's a training for your own heart it's not

282
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:33,839
an outcome in in the world that you're attached to so that is the way and these two practices

283
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:40,400
actually are perfectly compatible with one another so i

284
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,000
invite you mark to sit with that um with sick sit with with that you

285
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:53,760
you're cultivating like knowing that there is no safety i wish you safety may you be safe as as a wish from my heart

286
00:43:53,760 --> 00:44:00,079
so anyway i've said enough i'll let you sit with this there is a lot more here but i trust you will sit with us and you

287
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:06,240
will find your way um i've seen peggy's hand and then

288
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:12,880
vicky's peggy hugh and then i'll read vicki and they will be going into

289
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,079
small groups this time is short please peggy i've been having difficulty with the

290
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:25,119
woman who um just annoying the academy but um this this helped me see we both

291
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:30,160
probably have just the same wants and needs and we're just two different type

292
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:37,599
personalities on opposite ends of the extreme so it just helped me see her as more human and a little more like me so

293
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:42,720
it was helpful thanks how beautiful thank you peggy yeah i love hearing that

294
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:49,280
yeah thank you is this especially important for when we're working with people we have challenges with lovely

295
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:55,200
yeah and um vicky says i have difficulty thinking

296
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,880
people with less security as undocumented immigrants and unhoused people are just like me

297
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:08,000
how do we think our privilege is just like others yeah so so the idea of this practice here and

298
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,560
the just like me is not that everyone in every way is just like me i mean that's taking it too far

299
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:21,200
definitely taking it too far and that's not the suggestion at all the suggestion is that you see

300
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:26,720
their needs everybody else's needs for for safety for their wish to be happy to

301
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:34,000
be free from suffering as just like to see people's humanity not their background not there as i was saying so

302
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,280
any practice we can just take it too far and make it ridiculous so

303
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,960
just like me does not mean that we're that in those ways or just like me so

304
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:52,720
there's a way that we can get stuck or get ourselves stuck with every practice so i invite you not to do that pull back

305
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:57,839
um and stay with the humanity maybe this is

306
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:04,160
the way in for you vicky think that if you were born that you could have been just as well born

307
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:09,839
as they are it's so random they could have been born as you are it's so random

308
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:15,359
we have no control over it and that's another way to enter into just like me morgan i see

309
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:20,480
your note but it's coming i'll read this after we come out because

310
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:27,119
i want to make sure we have time for the small groups so so let's go into

311
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:32,640
small groups breakout rooms and here's the opportunity to practice

312
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:38,880
with other beings with other human beings who are just like me
