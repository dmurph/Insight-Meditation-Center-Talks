1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,440
so good morning everyone and welcome but we'll have a

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:18,320
zoom meeting when we finished here at 7 45 for those of you would like to come i'll announce it again the

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,759
the link is at the very top of this chat and i'll probably post it again later and say more about it

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,880
so to begin this meditation it's a little bit uh auspicious

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,079
uh many ways and

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,840
here in this earth care day we um earth day we

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,320
come at the end of the inner development that happens

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,079
in practicing sati awareness the upper reaches of what

9
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:05,198
happens with awareness practice in that we come to equanimity

10
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:11,680
and one of the wonderful really wonderful qualities

11
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,680
imagine that

12
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,920
this modern technology that we have and virtual reality glasses

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,920
imagine they make glasses that are attuned to your mood and mental state

14
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,280
and what's happening inside of you and so the frame of the glasses and the

15
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:42,479
glasses themselves morph and change according to how you're feeling and what you're concerned with

16
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,920
and so sometimes those glasses the rims get really really wide

17
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,079
sometimes they get really narrow sometimes they almost like uh

18
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,280
move away from your face like going towards something that you're interested in

19
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,200
sometimes they recede backwards and press up against your face sometimes they raise

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,480
one one side of the frame one like an eyebrow rise it raises rises really high

21
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,959
sometimes they wink sometimes they have all kinds of looks that they do

22
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:25,040
and people would start feeling maybe kind of almost naked because the way they keep their face

23
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,760
sometimes is not quite representative of what is going on inside

24
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:39,120
but now as everything's uh everything is there so um of course so we don't have those

25
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,879
kinds of glasses yet rather the glasses that we have those of us who do have glasses

26
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,560
are not reacting to the world around us they don't pick up our emotions they don't

27
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,040
are not interacting with the world in emotional ways reactive ways they're just there

28
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,800
peacefully we can say we could say equanimously and isn't so much that i want to make

29
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,640
this as an analogy for equanimity is i want to say that

30
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:18,560
all our responses and reactions all the rich world that we have out there

31
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:24,239
continues even with the glasses that don't react

32
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,840
but we see through the glasses the medium for seeing for some of us and so the

33
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,040
glasses have a fantastic function kind of independent of how we're feeling

34
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,799
in our mood and what's going on around so in the same way as

35
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,920
awareness gets stronger and stronger more developed there comes a time

36
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,599
when awareness has a quality of non-reactivity non-engagement

37
00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:00,400
it doesn't it's not riding and being pushed around by caught up in the inner moods reactions

38
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,760
that we have the thoughts that we have it's not exactly aloof

39
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:12,239
it's there everything it goes through it in a sense like everything goes through the glasses

40
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,519
it doesn't diminish our humanity it actually enhances it it's kind of

41
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,880
like we can see things more clearly however there is this place of

42
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,800
steadiness stillness non-reactivity that is able to do a fantastic work of

43
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,560
seeing but does not interact it does not get caught in

44
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,280
just like my glasses don't get caught in what's happening right now so i say that so that maybe there's a

45
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:50,319
little bit less hesitation to explore this topic of equanimity

46
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,360
a balanced state of mind where awareness is strong enough clear enough where the clarity is clear

47
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,479
enough that we clearly see we don't have to get

48
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,240
involved not only don't we see we don't have to but the very name of

49
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:15,280
the very quality uh the very state that we're in there's no inclination

50
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,720
for awareness to get swept away or caught up in

51
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,800
all the different movements of the mind and the world around us

52
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,880
so taking a

53
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,720
a meditative posture

54
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:51,400
taking a few moments to feel your body as it is

55
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:59,520
any tensions you might have agitation you might have any contentment you might have

56
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,638
in taking the posture

57
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,560
allow yourself for a few moments just to breathe with however it is in your body

58
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,600
letting the tensions be there the holdings be there agitation contentment

59
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,080
whatever it is

60
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,000
and as you do so do you have reactions in the mind

61
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,600
is awareness hijacked by preferences

62
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,639
likes and dislikes desires for it to be different

63
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,960
and what would it be like to sit here with your body with an awareness that is equanimous

64
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,479
about how it is right now

65
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,880
an awareness that allows things to be as they are

66
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,240
and so now taking a few long slow deep breaths

67
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,800
and on the exhale relaxing the body

68
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,160
softening the belly

69
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,240
on the exhale letting go into the support

70
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:52,680
your seat your chair has for the weight of your body

71
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,080
relaxing the shoulders

72
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,640
on the exhale softening the face

73
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,519
especially around our eyes

74
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:55,360
that we often do in fact express our feeling inside

75
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:02,080
nothing wrong with that but the eyes could use some rest

76
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:09,839
where they don't have to be looking searching expressing anything

77
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:27,760
and on the exhale softening relaxing any tension

78
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,920
that's easy to relax in the mind

79
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:18,199
and now like we did at the beginning how is your body

80
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:33,440
and now you're able to be with your body more a little bit more calmly

81
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:41,199
with less agitation maybe more settled

82
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,839
and if you are or if you're not

83
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,399
breathe gently through your body

84
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:03,519
and as you breathe through the body especially on the exhale

85
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,079
settle yourself into a kind of

86
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,800
quiet stillness

87
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,959
quiet tranquility

88
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,000
where you know what's happening but you're not

89
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,680
entangled with it just knowing

90
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:50,839
as you breathe especially on the exhale see if you can settle your mind

91
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,360
allowing the mind to become quiet and still

92
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,880
where the mind is more at rest than it is working

93
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,040
the meditation

94
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:03,440
and as you're aware does awareness itself

95
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:11,000
have some quality characteristics of equanimity non-reactivity

96
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,760
being balanced without being for against

97
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:27,839
only the awareness steady stable

98
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,759
there might be other feelings ideas tendencies in the mind

99
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:44,880
that involve preferences and wants and not wants

100
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,160
but awareness knows them equanimously

101
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,480
just knows them without being involved reactive or judgmental

102
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,399
awareness stays clear

103
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,560
unagitated

104
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,919
let go so that your awareness can be

105
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:35,200
non-reactive aware but not involved

106
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,440
a medium through which you know what's happening

107
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,360
like a glass window when the curtains are pulled

108
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,919
and the glass is clean we see through it

109
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:09,760
without the glass being reactive

110
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,240
we see through awareness

111
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:21,840
with awareness at ease

112
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:28,720
and in the classic instruction around equanimity

113
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:36,880
one knows equanimity is present

114
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:45,559
or if it's not present one knows it's not present

115
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,720
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

116
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:20,480
one valuable contribution that equanimity gives us

117
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:27,679
it allows for love to flow freely

118
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:33,039
without being hijacked by our desires our

119
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:40,320
attachments our aversions our preferences

120
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:50,799
a simple love or kindness

121
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:58,320
generosity of heart in which we can gaze upon others

122
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,200
in loving friendship

123
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,360
and with equanimity helping us to stay

124
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:17,639
close to this loving friendship friendly love

125
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,159
perhaps with whatever equanimity or stability of attention you have right

126
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,799
now in whatever way makes sense for you

127
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:37,600
gaze upon the world gaze upon the people of your life

128
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,640
with loving friendship friendliness

129
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,520
allowing the preferences and opinions

130
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:02,720
desires and aversions hurts and needs

131
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,799
recede to the background enough

132
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,440
that the loving kindness

133
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:22,240
can join with equanimity for an equanimous love

134
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,840
stable relaxed non-reactive

135
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:35,720
just kind just kind regard

136
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:51,360
and may it be that this practice we do allows us to see the world in loving

137
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:58,960
through loving eyes may we see the love the world

138
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,799
through our kindness and care

139
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:10,159
may we live for the welfare and happiness of all beings

140
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:18,480
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

141
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:25,600
may all beings be peaceful may all beings

142
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,840
be free

143
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:45,720
[Music]

144
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,398
thank you

145
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,600
so hello everyone and we come to the end of the

146
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:06,159
five part series on the seven factors of awakening the second to last exercise

147
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:14,000
in the discourse on the s for establishing awareness

148
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,960
and um and that these seven factors of

149
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,200
awakening are the foundation for

150
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,600
the last exercise which is to have the penetrating insight

151
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:39,760
to see in a liberating way and awaken in a way that awakens

152
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,679
so that's one of the reasons seven factors of awakening are called factors of awakening

153
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,960
is they set the stage for awakening for freedom

154
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:57,039
and they also are qualities of that awakening itself so it's a beautiful thing where they

155
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:04,720
they were growing we're growing in the qualities that will be mature with our awakening

156
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:12,720
so i

157
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:20,960
still want to say what i've been saying all week that these factors of awakening are not ordinary

158
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:27,600
mindfulness investigation effort joy tranquility

159
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:34,000
concentration equanimity whatever ordinary might mean they are really the product or the

160
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,279
result or the consequence of having really

161
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,720
settled in doing this practice of mindfulness of awareness

162
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:52,399
where the mindfulness uh has brought us to a place of stability of clear lots of clarity

163
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:58,320
and uh where in our whole being our body our mind have become somewhat unified and

164
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,840
collected for the purposes of meditating of being here

165
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,120
we're no longer thinking about events of the day yesterday or what's

166
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,559
going to happen we're not caught up in our fantasies or our resentments or

167
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:20,240
um this you know distracted thought

168
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,240
no it's not easy to come to this point but at some point we come to this point we really feel like oh there's a

169
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,840
vitality in awareness vitality and being present in

170
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,600
the full way and so then these states the same factors

171
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:44,720
awakening there's no instructions to cause them to arise to make them happen

172
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:50,399
but one recognizes when they are present and when recognizes when they're not

173
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:55,840
and and we also recognize when they arise they're appearing

174
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:01,120
and our role is to maintain them to let them keep develop

175
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,320
and a lot of that has to do at this stage of practice getting out of the way

176
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,599
the um if a ball is rolling down a hill if you stand and stop in front of it and

177
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:17,200
block it it won't roll but if you get out of the way it continues to roll down the hill

178
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:24,000
so these seven factors awakening will keep growing and moving if we have learned how to stay out of the way

179
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,800
and a lot of that has to do with not getting involved in thoughts not getting caught up in our thoughts distracted by thoughts

180
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,760
not getting involved in wanting and not wanting not tinkering with our experience making it more refined and

181
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,960
kind of working it but beginning to just let go of the doer let go of the

182
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,480
activity of being the meditator and just getting out of the way and allowing

183
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,878
something else to emerge to unfold these seven factors of awakening

184
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:01,280
and and for that there has to be some momentum in the practice also so this is why

185
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:07,440
really having done the practice for a while maybe a long time so that it becomes like second nature to

186
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,480
do it it's like there's a kind of momentum there's a the body knows the

187
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:19,119
body is connected to this practice sit down to meditate and the body gathers itself together because it it's familiar

188
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:26,000
with this it knows the it's familiar territory and it's like coming home

189
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,720
so as these develop and uh following somali concentration stability

190
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,720
real stability unified mind the tendency of the mind to get

191
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,800
fragmented again to get caught up in any kind of mental or interstate that's

192
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,079
arising or any external thing um is diminished because the sense of

193
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,800
awareness is feels so strong so precious so rich in that clarity of being

194
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,240
that um uh it's it's it seems like it's much better than any

195
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,839
alternative any alternative of being thoughts and distracted and caught up in things

196
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,880
and um and so we come back to it and stay there and in that mind

197
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,480
there's a wonderful precious sweetness or beauty or

198
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:29,680
wonderfulness to this clarity of mind which is non-reactive

199
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:35,119
this clarity of mind that's not working the practice anymore not reacting not

200
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,560
fixing or tinkering where there's no doer operating

201
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:46,320
where there's just a clarity of being aware so and

202
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,920
and that stability that equanimity is what allows for there to be

203
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:59,119
deep insight then our seeing we don't see through the filter our projections our agitation

204
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:06,079
all the concepts and ideas and commentary we have about things but we begin we start seeing or

205
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,760
perceiving feeling what's happening in a much more direct

206
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:18,000
way and in doing so we start having insights into what's happening

207
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,359
that is freeing and that's for next week

208
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:31,680
so this remarkable thing that these beautiful qualities of being uh are a byproduct of uh mindfulness

209
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:38,560
practices and so at some point we want to recognize that these are beginning even the hints

210
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,760
of these are beginning to arise because it's the recognition of their presence

211
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:50,000
that allows them one of the factors allows them to grow so to recognize it becomes more and more

212
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,240
clarity of awareness that is mindfulness recognizing in that clarity

213
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,960
there is a capacity to choose between what's healthy and not healthy skillful

214
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:09,680
and not skillful to know how to stay present in a mindful relaxed freeing way

215
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:16,240
then there's the enthusiasm the energy to do that which allows the practice to grow

216
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,599
and then there's the joy of doing it and then with that joy perhaps a

217
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:28,880
contentment of satisfaction it lets so many of our anxieties settle and quiet down

218
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:36,078
and then um and then we have um

219
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,760
concentration a unification of mind and we have equanimity

220
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,240
so the seven factors of awakening mindful of the present mindful of their absence

221
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:57,280
mindful of when they arise so that we can get out of the way and maintain them and let keep them going

222
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,119
these are the what happens at the mature some of the mature level stages

223
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:09,440
of mindfulness don't worry about being in these mature space stages

224
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,720
the only thing that's important a moment by moment is this moment

225
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:20,000
this moment of practice as if you're putting drops

226
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,040
into a bucket each drop is as valuable as any other drop

227
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:31,040
and so each drop is it's complete in itself and so each drop of mindfulness each

228
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,560
second each moment of mindfulness is complete in itself and don't be so

229
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:42,079
concerned or caught up with attainments or getting somewhere

230
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:47,200
but when the seven factors awakening start showing themselves

231
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:53,920
recognize they're there know their present and maybe even know as they're arising

232
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:59,680
and then learn the art of maintaining them getting out of their way and letting them grow

233
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:06,560
so thank you very much

234
