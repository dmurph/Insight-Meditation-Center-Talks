00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,839
hello and welcome everyone to this edition of happy hour

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:15,440
practicing together so before i hit the record button we're talking about

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:23,359
smokes fires lockdowns so much happening

4
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:30,560
externally internally so for today's practice i'd like to

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,718
invite us to

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,879
to approach the practice of compassion which is love meeting suffering

7
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:49,360
love meeting suffering and for this addition we'll be

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,120
practicing self-compassion so our own suffering whether it's physical whether we have

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,690
civil physical pain suffering illness

10
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,799
[Music] anything that's happening physically or whether it's

11
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:14,720
it's emotional psychological [Music] pain of the heart not

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,680
literally both literally but but also metaphorically

13
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,200
and and two invitations tonight to invitations for

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,360
our guided practice the first is to consider that

15
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:43,000
to consider a meeting meeting or pain meaning or suffering or sorrow

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:52,320
surrounding infusing holding it with love complete love the way we would hold

17
00:01:52,320 --> 00:02:00,479
a baby a newborn a tender young being just holding

18
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:07,360
them with tenderness love completely engulfed in love that's

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,879
one invitation that i will be weaving through

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,720
and the other invitation the second invitation

21
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:27,959
is considering that our

22
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:35,760
self-sense our self-sense in the suffering is quite malleable in

23
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,160
the story of course there is pain there is sorrow there's suffering and then there are

24
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:49,040
different ways there's different self-senses so for example you can think of the buddha who could

25
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,400
have you know his story instead of one of nobility one of nobility

26
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,840
and service and strength awakening etc instead of that

27
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,879
narrative the narrative could have been oh

28
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,200
you know yeah i was a prince i was you know i couldn't get out of this prison of a

29
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,720
castle my dad didn't let me get out and then i got out and

30
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,879
and you know and then oh yeah i couldn't you know no one would would

31
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,360
um in um you know after i got enlightened oh nobody would believe me and you know people turned

32
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:40,480
around and like so so it could be a sense of oh poor me poor me which would be a funny way right i mean funny way to even think

33
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,480
of that story it's kind of exaggerated but the same way

34
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,280
can we think of our own suffering our own pain our own sorrow however shows up

35
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:00,080
with nobility with nobility as if this challenge this sorry this

36
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:06,239
pain we are we are bodhisattva just like the buddha before his awakening we're

37
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:13,519
bodhisattva we're offering we're holding this pain we're um in ways maybe we can't quite

38
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,440
understand we're offering it to all beings everywhere for their awakening for our own awakening

39
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:26,080
for all sentient beings bodhisattva bodhi awakening satva sentient beings

40
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,960
for all sentient beings including ourselves this suffering this sorrow it's

41
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,840
the sense of nobility in enduring and offering in being with this

42
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,680
difficulty so that can bring a sense of um again nobility

43
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,600
strength power to being with both the sensitivity the tenderness

44
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:01,360
in the image of holding with love as if it were a newborn and this sense of nobility

45
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:08,240
um so these are two invitations that i will work i will invite us

46
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:16,479
through the um [Music] guided meditation as ways to consider

47
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:22,880
as ways to enter and also i want to give credit uh to robert bay i heard these two

48
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,639
mention these ideas as a part of a longer talk and just got me thinking that oh this

49
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:35,039
can be a whole practice and the talk uh he mentioned this in

50
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,639
just to give it reference is love healing and emptiness which i have mentioned before and

51
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,080
and i believe neil has sent it to the sangha and the google groups mailing

52
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,440
list so so without further ado let's start our practice

53
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:59,039
let's get into our into our posture

54
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,319

60
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,800

65
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,120
inviting awareness to be present with the breath with the body

66
00:10:51,120 --> 00:11:01,360

as if we are sitting

74
00:12:53,760 --> 00:13:00,800
comfortably relaxing into spacious awareness

75
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,200
not so much trying to push it and pull it and expand it just

76
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,800
it's more expensive than we realize oh

77

enveloping the challenge difficulty dukkha with with love as if

167

or heart with our palm and to bring in a sense of nobility

this sense of self-support a sense of empowerment supporting ourselves and then

transitioning into this sense of

171
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:52,960
offering the mud the lotus or suffering

172
00:39:52,960 --> 00:40:00,400
for the benefit of all beings finding changing the self-narrative

173
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:08,319
from one of perhaps poor me to sense of resilience

179
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:49,200
you can type in chat your reflections as always if it's just typed in me i

180
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:54,319
will only say read the reflection not your say your name

181
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:59,760
it's time to everyone i'll read the whole thing you can also raise your hand especially

182
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:06,400
if you haven't shared a reflection in a while what did you discover

183
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:14,240
was there a sense of nobility a sense of opening up as if oh

184
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:21,200
there is empowerment there's beauty there's grace there's i can endure there's so much more here

185
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:26,960
did it unearth abilities that you didn't realize you

186
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:34,480
had yeah question comes

187
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:41,440
up from casey what if one is overwhelmed with constant suffering and is tired

188
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:48,319
yeah so the overwhelm is probably happening because of the fatigue because

189
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:52,960
of being tired and

190
00:41:54,319 --> 00:42:00,400
different different possibilities one is to come back to the body simply

191
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,240
mindfulness of the body and holding and the other actually is this this

192
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:12,400
practice can bring up more empowerment more sense of not being overwhelmed by it it can

193
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,400
change the narrative completely you can change the narrative from feeling

194
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,520
overwhelmed it's too much to actually wow as a bodhisattva here i am

195
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:29,200
there's so much more that this heart can contain it can expand

196
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:36,079
our conception are conceiving so hang in there don't give up give up

201
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:11,520

202
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:18,400
pain i've been ex i've experienced this week as we worked through covet ah

204
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,920
and emotional wow thank you that to me that it sounds from what you wrote it

205
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,040
was a beautiful experience of of of transcendence of

206
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:45,520
okay there's so much more here so of being in the midst of it overwhelmed by it

207
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:55,839
rising above it thank you so much for sharing that reflection anonymously beautiful

208
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:03,359
i'll pause if any more reflections or

209
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:09,839
questions

210
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:19,920
so we'll save some time on the other end when we come back from small group

211
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:27,760
practice sharing with each other and also holding witness for one another

212
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:34,839
in this practice so as always we'll start with 15 seconds of silent

213
00:44:34,839 --> 00:44:42,480
um meta compassion empowered for ourselves for each other

214
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:52,000
and then you can share as little or as much as you like with um with your small group

215
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:59,760
and again taking care of yourself taking care of each other in compassion small groups is really

216
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,440
where the practice where the rubber meets the road such

217
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:13,119
an important opportunity to be present for yourself for each other slow down slow

218
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:19,440
down slow down and listen to yourself slow down and listen to

219
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:27,359
yourself slow down and listen to one another this is profound practice

220
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:33,838
okay i will open the rooms now

221
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,640
okay welcome back everyone

222
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:47,359
we have a few minutes left for any reflections that came up especially

223
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:56,559
after discussing conversing in small groups and feel free to raise your zoom hand

224
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:01,839
or type in chat

225
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:19,359
we haven't had any any uh verbal comments so yeah raising your zoom hand would be great

226
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:28,160
i see jerry's physical hand let's see jerry here um you can unmute yourself

227
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,920
jerry please i'm dressed i know it's crazy i live in toronto but it's so hot and

228
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:40,880
humid here that i had to turn the air conditioning on and now i have to wear this coat to say warm in the house it doesn't make sense so

229
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:47,280
that's the uh the nature of uh living in canada at least on the east coast so what i

230
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:54,000
thought about was just the end of the small group this whole like you know it's been raining a lot

231
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,000
here and uh and humid but the grass looks amazing and the flowers look wonderful

232
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:07,839
so without rain there's no flowers or without mud there's no lotus and i thought without without covid

233
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:15,760
we wouldn't be and have met in this particular group and uh you know that was really quite

234
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:23,520
i didn't i sort of thought about it and maybe someone's already said it but i was like thinking wow out of necessity

235
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:28,400
was born some beauty

236
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:36,240
thank you jerry yeah thank you so true and

237
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:41,359
eileen says in chad this was a new perspective for me

238
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:46,720
nobility in the face of dukkha it's different from feeling a second

239
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:54,640
arrow in the heart yes eileen well said beautiful mark asks about

240

yeah i feel like

245
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:39,920
i've just seen very clearly how much life kind of for me centers on the drama

246
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:45,760
of like it's my dukkha and i have to get rid of it and i have to figure it out and it has

247
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,800
to mean something to me and it's it's really touching i think the

248
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:57,200
nobility is like just kind of shining on it you know

249
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:03,359
it's like it has my cat's fight in the background beautifully

250
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:08,400
you know it's just the nobility it just there's just that feeling of like the

251
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,440
heart just shines on it and it doesn't do anything specific it doesn't outsmart

252
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:18,559
it it doesn't beat it it's just it's just there

253
