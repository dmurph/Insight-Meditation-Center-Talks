1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:09,599
Welcome to our YouTube meditation time and uh oh someone just wrote the

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,639
links are still wonky um so I used a calendar link today

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:26,199
and that worked for me fine so I don't know uh maybe there are other places that it hasn't been uh uh fixed so um if

4
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:33,960
maybe if some of you are trying other places to get a link to the to the YouTube maybe you can put in the

5
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:42,760
chat where you tried and where you found it not working um and uh and I can't really ask

6
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:50,079
the people who haven't made it here who are maybe kind of uh not finding a good

7
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:57,039
link so uh but there a little team of people have been working hard try to figure out what's going on and there's

8
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,960
some idea that maybe something has changed that uh at YouTube about settings

9
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,439
or something something went wonky so

10
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:20,200
um so welcome and

11
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:29,920
um I I believe there comes a time when it's useful to consider that meditation

12
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,200
budh meditation mindfulness meditation um involves a very different

13
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,960
Paradigm very different orientation or basis than how we ordinarily go about

14
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,159
our lives and not necessarily to um

15
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,920
to dismiss or belittle how we go through our ordinary lives the concerns and

16
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:06,000
orientations we have but it uh to add to it a a very different way of being at

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,040
least for a short time maybe it's as the different as between being awake in our

18
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:18,640
ordinary life taking care of all kinds of things and then sleeping both are needed but you don't

19
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,200
want to continue doing in all the activities of daily life um in your

20
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,400
sleep and that doesn't belittle what we do in life to sleep it actually enhances

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,480
them because it hopefully makes us refreshed for it so the same way with meditation it's uh something that's

22
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:44,000
different than both the activities and usual ways the mind works and it's also different than sleep and so it's a third

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,400
option which is refreshing it's has its own tremendously valuable

24
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,920
value and um so I'd like to offer you a perspective on this alternative way of

25
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:04,000
being that meditation can offer ordinarily in our life uh we can be

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,360
concerned about something sometimes we're concerned about other people sometimes we're concerned about

27
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,040
ourselves sometimes we're concerned about events and things and ideas

28
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:25,000
and objects and experiences that we can

29
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,680
have the possibility in meditation is not to have the mind

30
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:38,120
concerned about anything and what I mean by concerned is that uh it's oriented towards something

31
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:45,080
it's picking something up it's considering something it's um it's uh

32
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,080
organizing its thoughts its emotions its attention around something that's we

33
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:57,280
want to deal with or respond to or be involved in or not be involved

34
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,720
in and uh and uh and

35
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:10,680
so to um uh and so and that's kind of often

36
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:16,560
how the minds you Minds usually work but to have an attention and

37
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,960
awareness which is not concerned with uh

38
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,080
anything but alert and aware and receptive to what

39
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:37,360
is not con concerned about it not avoiding it not shutting down from it not

40
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:45,240
distracted from it but a certain activity of the mind has come to rest

41
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:56,080
and I'd like to offer uh some Expressions that might uh represent

42
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:03,680
these uh we have a number of Wonderful ful expressions in English that begin with the word

43
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,400
open a person can be open-handed which means that uh they're

44
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:16,240
not clinging and holding on to anything there's an openness and willingness to share and be available to the

45
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,440
world open-handed with their

46
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:27,560
generosity openminded open-minded means we're available and open to lots of

47
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:33,639
perspectives points of view consider to uh you know we're not holding on to any

48
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:38,800
particular view or opinion and saying it's the best or the only one we're

49
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:47,880
receptive and and able to take things in and to hear them and and um maybe

50
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:54,880
maybe even consider their truth or their possibilities so to be open-minded to

51
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,840
things openhearted the heart is open

52
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,199
means it's receptive it's available but I think it also has a

53
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:13,680
meaning that uh that uh some of the best qualities of the heart have been revealed so love and kindness and

54
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:19,120
compassion and sensitivity and

55
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:26,680
connectivity and then we have uh kind of a modern Buddhist uh idea the of open

56
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:34,400
awareness so uh open awareness that uh that uh we

57
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,599
are that the awareness is not limited or

58
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:47,199
contracted or fixated on anything the awareness is available to all things and

59
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:54,000
all these seven common a sense of openness to possibility openness to availability to what

60
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,360
is and in terms of not being about concerns about others being concerned

61
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:08,120
con ered about oneself being concerned about things and events it's a kind of a prec concerned

62
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:15,599
State before we become concerned what is awareness like before

63
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:23,479
we become fixated or worried or start planning or wanting or not

64
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:30,240
onean thing what is it like to be aware

65
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,639
openly aware openly openminded so that's kind of the the

66
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:43,360
suggestion for this meditation is to explore this open way of

67
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:52,039
being that is there

68
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:58,319
before the mind gets involved in its concerns and you will get involved in

69
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,919
your concerns for this this meditation I'm sure but

70
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:10,400
um look behind them look underneath them look before

71
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:19,440
them look between them look let go of them to see what is there in this this

72
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,159
openness vast openness of awareness of

73
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:34,640
attention so to gently close your

74
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,560
eyes and let there be a gentling

75
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:51,000
within a gentling that includes relaxing the

76
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
shoulders

77
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:08,350
and [Music]

78
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:31,120
two soften the belly

79
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,480
maybe softening the hands relaxing the hands they're a little more

80
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,160
open fingers are not tight in any

81
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,839
way and letting the face

82
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:04,279
relax we talk about something times a face being an open face s of openness in

83
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:09,079
the face a lot has to do with the muscles

84
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:30,839
relaxed relaxing the thinking mind softening gentling

85
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:38,639
the energy of thinking the intensity of

86
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,639
thinking the speed of

87
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,480
thinking and any tension associated with

88
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
thinking

89
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:12,399
and sitting here with a global awareness of your

90
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,600
body whatever Global might mean for you easy

91
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:25,800
relaxed awareness of the whole

92
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,320
body in whatever way that is is for you maybe just a

93
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:38,279
torso above the waist or anything and

94
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:05,480
to and then this way of being aware that's before

95
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,720
concerns before agendas before judgments and needing things to be a certain way

96
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:20,440
or not be a certain way see if you can let that

97
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:27,760
be the way in which you now become aware of your body

98
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
breathing

99
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:47,000
being aware of the body breathing wherever it's easiest to be aware of

100
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
breathing

101
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,639
being

102
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,760
aware in a way that's easy to be

103
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,720
aware aware of the

104
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:51,600
obvious before you have any concerns or with relaxing the concerned

105
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,480
mind letting the concerns recede to the

106
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
background

107
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,920
openminded

108
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,480
openhearted open

109
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,680
ended open awareness

110

111
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680

open

126
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,799
handed

127
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,880
openhearted

128
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:29,919
openminded open

129
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:38,158
not limited by any concerns not focused on any

130
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,000
concerns with awareness wider more

131
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
open

132
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:56,960
Fuller than any concerns for self or others or

133
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,960
anything the unconcerned

134
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
awareness

135
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

136
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

137
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

138
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
for

139
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
for

140
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
for

141
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
for

142
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520

for

146
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:29,320
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

147
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,960
there's a different way of caring for the

148
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:41,960
world where the heart is

149
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:48,159
unconcerned meaning it's unfocused or

150
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:54,240
un not worried not preoccupied not

151
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,320
tense not fixated on anything

152
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:06,158
but the heart the Mind knows something about being deeply at

153
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:14,519
ease and with that ease knowing that ease wishing that for others wishing

154
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:19,960
others to have a kind of unconcerned happiness unconcerned

155
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,919
peace un fixated

156
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:32,480
freedom may all beings be

157
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:39,320
happy may all beings be

158
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,840
safe may all [Music] beings be

159
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,720
peaceful and may all beings be

160
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,220
[Music]

161
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
free

162
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,840
thank

163
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,159

164
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,159
so

165
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,279
happy to be here with you and to continue here on Wednesday

166
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:15,279
with the topic of the day which the week which is action compassion compassionate

167
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:22,200
action and trying to offer some different perspectives on what we can

168
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:29,480
do motivated by compassion and so Monday was compassion

169
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:35,559
and action for the sake of others yesterday was compassion and

170
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:40,600
action for the sake of oneself not distinct or separate from

171
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,960
others but in addition so the compassionate action

172
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:54,320
where we're both doing it for our own sake and for sake of others for the sake of others and for ourselves so there's a

173
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:03,679
mutuality a fullness of care in all Direction c s and um the suggestion is that that uh

174
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,440
compassion for others caring for others is richer more valuable when we know how

175
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:16,120
to do proper care Compassionate Care for ourselves we have more care we are more

176
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:21,360
love to give others when there's a Kind of Love here for

177
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:29,519
ourselves so today I want to do uh the third form of AC ction or way of acting

178
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:37,799
and that is action that's uh for the sake of both self and others and this is

179
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:44,120
a category that the Buddha often uses um that in addition to kind of intentions

180
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:49,159
for the welfare of oneself of others he also talks about the intention for the

181
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:56,039
welfare of both self and others and um and uh and I understand

182
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:03,440
this both both self and other as being the we that exists between us the kind

183
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:10,560
of the the nature and quality of the Rel relatedness the relationship that exists between us and

184
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,040
that's something that's distinct enough from the other person from ourselves

185
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:21,240
it's kind of the the dynamic the chemistry the the interaction the

186
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:28,599
quality of the interaction between two people and um and uh so when we do

187
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:33,638
compassionate action for others what what relationship does that

188
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:41,158
establish between you and um and this mostly focuses now

189
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:48,919
on uh you know compassion action that you're doing in the presence of another person uh if you send a check to

190
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:55,878
support um you know uh orphanages in Uganda because you read about in the

191
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:01,720
newspaper you know there's not that much of a relationship between the Orphans in

192
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:09,119
Uganda but there is maybe uh you are in a sense establishing some kind of

193
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:16,280
relatedness that maybe is a little bit one directed but it's still a relatedness with uh suffering in Uganda

194
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,560
and and uh and you know there's a bigger kind of Wei that's operating here as

195
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:28,599
well and what is that so especially when we're doing to directly for ourselves uh

196
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:35,040
directly with someone else and it's easy to have easy enough to do what we think

197
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:43,040
is compassionate action that um uh uh we're kind of very strongly

198
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:48,560
kind of uh imposing ourselves on the other person or so focused on the other

199
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,640
person that we're completely ignoring ourselves and in ignoring ourselves we

200
00:35:53,640 --> 00:36:00,040
also then ignore what's being established between us because that involves both self and

201
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:06,119
other a relatedness and I've known people who have done wonderfully compassionate

202
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:13,119
things for others out of compassion but there was no personal connection even when it was oneon-one It was kind of

203
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:19,800
perfunctory or it was kind of just like yes I want to help this person and here you can this here something you can have

204
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:25,079
or do or how how you can be helped but there's a kind of a

205
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:32,200
distance um and and um and some of that distance sometimes is when we hold ourselves apart sometimes uh with the

206
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:37,680
idea of pity or superiority or here let me help you who's so poor and you know

207
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,359
miserable and um and is kind of looking down at people and so the relationship

208
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:49,040
then is not a healthy relationship to be the one who has the power and the

209
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:56,119
authority to do things and the other person doesn't and so then to be compassionate with our power and our

210
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:03,839
Authority to fix things for them or do things for them but what it continues is a the relationship of kind of a power

211
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:10,520
Dynamic uh that's not really that healthy either and it's not the best vehicle through which compassion and

212
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:16,520
love can flow much still be helping people in beneficial way but their relationship is

213
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:23,720
not necessarily such a wonderful relationship to have and so is it a relationship of

214
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:28,800
mutual respect or is a relationship of respect

215
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,960
even if it's not mutual in One Direction which kind of changes the nature of the

216
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:41,520
dynamic between the two people is there love is there friendly Friendship between them is friendship being

217
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:47,599
offered um are we contributing to a richer more valuable relatedness between

218
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,920
the two people or are we holding ourselves off at a distance and are we

219
00:37:52,920 --> 00:38:00,480
kind of being one-sided or are we not open to the relationship uh we don't want to

220
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:07,000
be open to the relationship we don't want a relationship we maybe give uh uh

221
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,240
maybe some money to someone who's homeless but you know we're afraid of the person or we aversive of the person

222
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:19,520
we don't really want to have any more contact we want to help them but we don't want any more contact because of

223
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:28,480
all kinds of reasons and so that the relationship is one that is not no relationship in a sense and the the the

224
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:34,680
importance of this relatedness in relationships is that um the kindness

225
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:40,920
the friendliness the the M mutuality that can exist in relationships even

226
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:49,520
with strangers for many people is kind of like food for the heart that uh human

227
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:57,000
beings um in a big for many people not everyone but many human beings um the

228
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:04,520
really kind of who we are as a person how we live as a person how we grow as a person how we uh are happy as a person

229
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:11,000
has a lot to do with how we are in relationship to other people a lot of our unhappiness is also

230
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:18,119
how we're in relationship with people and there's often a uh over concern with

231
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:23,319
relatedness over concern what people think and and am I going to be rejected

232
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:30,000
I'm going to be elik and what can I do to have a good Rel relationship how do I get respect how do I get love from other

233
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,280
people and there's a lot of concerned activity and there is something we learn

234
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:42,400
through meditation about being unconcerned unworried

235
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,200
unopinionated un without neediness in their

236
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:55,119
relationship but open to establishing a healthy relationship between self and

237
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:01,000
other and the simplest healthy way is one of friendliness uh we don't want to have

238
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:07,599
too high a bar that we're supposed to love everyone that's a that may be nothing then that can be

239
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:14,160
interfere but just a simple friendliness or maybe even more simple maybe it's

240
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:20,760
respect to to establish a level of respect in that relationship between you

241
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:28,560
uh appreciation uh Attunement um and um awareness that

242
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:35,520
people thrive in being listened to and being seen clearly for who they are and

243
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,800
sometimes if we can see someone and stop and listen uh lo and behold that that

244
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:47,839
gives them the possibility of doing the same to us and then what happens the magic the

245
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:53,079
specialness that can happen between people even total strangers even seeing each other for 30

246
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:59,119
seconds of being kind of open and and to acknowledge to see and to know each

247
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:06,200
other where we meet with an open mindedness and open-heartedness and

248
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:12,079
open-handedness and we see each other in that openness we see each other in the

249
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:18,880
richness and the fullness without needing to Define without having needs without having

250
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:26,720
fears so compassion and action that where the maybe the part of

251
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:32,240
the compassion that thing that is most beneficial for everyone concerned is not

252
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:37,920
giving someone money is not giving them food not driving them to the doctor

253
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:44,480
that's the vehicle for some deeper movement of care and compassion that

254
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:51,880
allow creates a richer valuable connection warmth love between people so

255
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:59,200
what is the relatedness we're creating what are we contributing to it take someone to the emergency and they might

256
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:05,000
remember that for a long time but take someone to the emergency with a real

257
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:13,599
love and care and kindness and respect and that uh uh might be what has a

258
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:20,079
long-term benefit for them that might even be greater than whatever the doctor does for them in the

259
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:27,559
emergency um so compassionate action for the sake of

260
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:32,680
self and other is uh something uh to be concerned

261
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:39,119
about when we do compassionate action so that it becomes a more considered more

262
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,599
richer more there's more facets to what compassionate action is than the simple

263
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:49,760
thing of doing something for someone else and um and that's this UD of

264
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:56,400
establishing this good relationship or offering that um is why it's so important the second thing we talked

265
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:03,000
about yesterday which is um uh compassionate action which is for the

266
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:10,599
sake of oneself meaning we take care of ourselves we do it so that it nourishes us it supports us it liberates us it

267
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:17,079
opens us it to love and care and respect for others and then there's more

268
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:22,720
richness and possible in the relatedness between self and other so compassionate

269
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,400
action for the sake of self and other so if you'd like over the next 24

270
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:35,800
hours to uh explore this in your life daily life um you might no one needs to

271
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:44,119
know you're doing this but you might um uh give some attention to notice when

272
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:49,640
you're with other people what's the quality of that relatedness and what are you

273
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:57,680
contributing to the quality of relatedness relationship between between between you and and um and again it

274
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:03,400
doesn't have to be you know dramatic it doesn't have to be

275
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:08,559
love but is there something what's the chemistry what's the atmosphere what's

276
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:14,000
the Dynamics that's been established between you and others even strangers

277
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,440
like you know clerks in a store or or U people standing on line

278
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:27,119
or people you pass on the road is there relationship or do you just walk down

279
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:32,760
this down the road and ignore whoever's passing you by or are you available to

280
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:39,880
smile or say hello and and in a way that feels safe and appropriate what is the relationship you

281
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:45,079
have with the people what kind of relationship established and then if you do this exercise it's very interesting

282
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:50,559
to see how it shifts that relatedness in the course of a conversation or a time

283
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:56,200
together how the quality of conversation that what we say and how we feel and

284
00:44:56,200 --> 00:45:03,280
what we convey to others we can feel that the conversation opens the conversation connects us more or the

285
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,400
conversation closes us and creates more distance and we can sometimes see in

286
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:15,240
other people uh that the effect of what we're talking about that now now they're pulling away a teeny bit they feel more

287
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:21,559
closed they're turning away a little bit looking out or now they're really opening up they're present they're

288
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:27,200
delighted and it can be very subtle energetics that shift and change

289
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:34,200
but what happens if you start noticing the Dynamics of the relatedness and how does that affect how you want to be

290
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:40,680
compassionate caring um helpful for for other

291
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:46,319
people so um thank you very much and I

292
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:51,920
look forward to continuing this tomorrow
