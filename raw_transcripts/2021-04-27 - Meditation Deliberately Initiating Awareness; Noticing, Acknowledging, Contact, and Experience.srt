1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:08,399
so each time we sit it's very very helpful to

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:16,400
initiate awareness in a deliberate fashion if

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,119
you think about how awareness is usually interwoven

4
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:31,359
with all the things that come up in the consciousness all the attitudes all the emotions

5
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:40,960
the concerns and awareness is simply

6
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:49,200
attending to them and so especially in seated awareness

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:57,039
we we start in a very deliberate fashion it's it's almost like we're gonna give

8
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,879
ourselves a deep reminder of what

9
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:10,159
the request of awareness is that we're going to

10
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:18,960
initiate quite deliberately the process that calls forth awareness

11
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,439
you know we we're gonna attend to it with intention

12
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,240
we're going to attend to it with

13
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,520
a deliberate non-attachment to what arises

14
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:47,200
and along with that we're going to attend to it with a thorough acceptance of whatever arises

15
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:57,600
it's like we remind ourselves this is not manufacturing what's supposed to happen

16
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,799
it's simply creating a disposition that's available

17
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,840
for what's happening

18
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:19,440
and as we initiate we invite the positive factors of being

19
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,640
that will support the awareness

20
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,280
and this commitment

21
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,840
establishing this as we begin you know

22
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,319
sometimes called clearly knowing

23
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:50,560
but not so much unknowing simply as a cognitive process but including that

24
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,400
but more than that we invite

25
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,120
our mental disposition we invite our emotional disposition

26
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:10,480
we invite how we're holding the body we invite

27
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:18,720
how we're letting the breath happen

28
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,760
it's a combination of many factors [Music]

29
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,879
we don't really need to know them and list them and then

30
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:39,599
initiate them we we need to um or what's very helpful for us is to

31
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:47,840
establish a fertile ground that invites them to arise

32
00:03:52,159 --> 00:04:00,879
and so as we go through the the details

33
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,720
the details of posture the details of breath

34
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:16,560
the details of open awareness to engage it all very deliberately

35
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,840
it's like reminding something deep within you

36
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:38,000
that this is a commitment that

37
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,840
is part of who you are it's part of what you are

38
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,280
and we let that commitment do awareness

39
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,919
we let it simply connect [Music]

40
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:11,840
to what's happening

41
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,840
we let it invite a steadiness

42
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,800
and experiencing of what's happening

43
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:40,320
rather than being lost in fraud or thinking up what's happening

44
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:46,880
with the minds in charge and it will have a running commentary

45
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,840
on what's happening you know

46
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,800
can we invite the body and the breath

47
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,120
into a saddledness

48
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,840
that it starts to soften

49
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:19,199
that disposition of mind that wants to continue its narrative we're not suppressing it we're not

50
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:29,680
resisting it just inviting the state of being

51
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,840
the deliberateness

52
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:49,840
and then deliberately inviting awareness of the body

53
00:06:51,919 --> 00:07:03,840
noticing how it is

54
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:17,840
some part of the body feel creaky creaky or stiff

55
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:26,000
and then like a body scan

56
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,759
starting with where we make contact with our seat

57
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:46,160
and becoming aware of the lower back

58
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:58,319
opening the front of the body

59
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:06,800
letting the spine lengthened in uprightness and ease

60
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,840
letting the shoulders widen

61
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,400
like we're opening the heart

62
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:41,839
available to what may arise

63
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,200
and letting the head

64
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,839
well the tin made the chin the back of the neck may lengthen

65
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:09,839
the head is upright

66
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,240
in feeling the deliberateness of this

67
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:26,000
body sitting in the midst of everything

68
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:37,839
that's happening

69
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,399
and letting the breath happen

70
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:57,120
with each inhale and the tension that's inviting

71
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,360
maybe even in encouraging the chest the stomach the abdomen to

72
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:19,839
soften and open and receive the breath

73
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:33,839
and allowing a pause between inhale and exhale

74
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,839
and as we breathe out

75
00:10:49,680 --> 00:11:01,839
the quality of releasing

76
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,839
and as we tune into this rhythm of breath

77
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:28,160
can it be deliberate can it be steady in a way

78
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,440
that there's presence at the start of each inhale

79
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:43,839
present in the pause presence in the exhale

80
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:57,839
presence in the pause

81
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,560
it's not an imposition

82
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,839
it's not an assertion of control

83
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:39,839
it's the simple act of sustaining awareness of breath

84
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,200
and actually sustained awareness

85
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:07,839
inviting the clearing

86
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:21,839
it notices what arises

87
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:33,200
notices when the attention stays in the body and

88
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,839
the breath

89
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,839
notices when it gets caught up

90
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:58,720
in thinking or feeling or some combination of

91
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,839
thoughts and feelings

92
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,720
whatever happens

93
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:58,800
it's our being's effort it's our humanness expressing it's

94
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
aliveness

95
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,560
it cannot deliberate attention

96
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,440
can it can it offer a kind of

97
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,839
reassurance

98
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:31,279
good awareness is the close ally of being alive

99
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,720
it deeply nurtures

100
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:51,839
that cellular impulse to live

101
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:19,839
it understands the impulse to think and feel

102
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,400
and let the mind get caught up inside

103
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:33,440
can you quite deliberately return to the steadiness

104
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,840
of allowing inhale and pausing

105
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:53,840
and releasing on the exhale

106
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,549
[Music]

107
00:20:50,320 --> 00:21:03,600
and if the thoughts are constructing a reality

108
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,520
just notice and acknowledge

109
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:21,280
then that awareness

110
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,280
returning to the senses

111
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:45,840
physicality sensation of breathe

112
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:58,320
and even if the thinking is tending to draw being

113
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:05,200
up into the head

114
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,440
can the deliberateness of breathing

115
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:19,840
invite it back down into the body

116
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,840
so

117
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,490
[Music]

118
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,840
oh

119
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,720
there you are

120
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,840
um

121
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,679
so this deliberateness of being

122
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:10,720
it it finds its expression

123
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,679
in our body often

124
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:23,840
it has a kind of a centering feeling to it

125
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,360
sometimes we call it keeping us grounded you know

126
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:42,720
and then the very process of staying aware of the breath and keeping the breath soft and deep

127
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:52,640
helps the breath to become an ally in in how we're noticing

128
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:59,760
oh is that deliberateness and centeredness and the kind of

129
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,919
authority or trust that it has is that staying present

130
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:12,480
or is the body tightening in some way

131
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:21,518
either through fear aggression desire all sorts of ways

132
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:31,200
and the core teaching is that these are not something that we're doing wrong

133
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:39,120
these are not uh qualities of being that need to be suppressed or eradicated

134
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:47,519
it's more to come into a deep understanding of what it is to be human

135
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:53,760
that these are human tendencies and that each of us has our own version

136
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:00,000
of them

137
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,880
that when they fall into a reactive mode

138
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:16,559
they make our life mysterious and difficult when we go into reaction

139
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:24,720
we don't quite know what caused this reactiveness

140
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:32,640
and we don't quite know what it is to be reactive it's just a surge of energy

141
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,440
it has all sorts of assumptions within it

142
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,840
and when we can draw towards that deliberateness

143
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:52,159
the very same process can in the deliberateness can invite

144
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:57,840
what's called clear knowing oh

145
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:05,518
when that happened i had this fearful response

146
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:15,120
and my fearful response initiated aggression or aversion

147
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:27,679
and so in our seated meditation it's it's a wonderful opportunity for us to

148
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:38,559
discover the subtle details of what it is to embody that deliberateness

149
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:44,080
that it invites a kind of okay this is what's happening you know

150
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:50,799
it invites the kind of confident acceptance

151
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:57,679
okay this is what's happening it's pleasant it's unpleasant

152
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:03,279
um i'm feeling like there's a sensation of opening to

153
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:08,750
this person there's a sensation of closing away from this person

154
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:15,679
[Music] but with the deliberateness and the

155
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:24,960
clear knowing it it gives us a sense of agency

156
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:34,960
and as it does that something deep in us sort of recalculates you know

157
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:42,560
maybe this is not a matter of life and death that requires and a reactiveness

158
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,878
that that has an urgent immediacy

159
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:59,359
that this there's room to pause okay yes this is what's happening

160
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:06,880
the noticing and acknowledging become organic how else would you approach a

161
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,640
human life other than just being present for it

162
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:19,838
and letting what's happening register and be known

163
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:32,720
and it also it invites the very practice of awareness

164
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:39,440
it invites it as an ally to our well-being rather than an

165
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:49,119
imposition on something within us that's struggling to survive you know

166
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:56,960
we're struggling to survive and then we come along and say you should be aware this is not good

167
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:04,720
enough you're not good enough what you're doing is not good enough

168
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,839
it offers a different equation a different consideration

169
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:20,240
okay this is what's happening okay this is the response to it

170
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:27,839
okay this is the behavior that's coming up

171
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:37,359
we start to cultivate a very interesting factor for ourselves

172
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,880
the confidence the trust

173
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:55,839
to relate to life just as it is

174
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:04,319
we start to create the trust to allow ourselves to have the feelings for heaven

175
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,599
okay i'm really annoyed by that

176
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:22,320
and then if we embody that annoyance it has teaching it has a description

177
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:29,520
of existence it reveals in its clear knowing

178
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:38,800
what about that is annoying how in this moment does annoying feel

179
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:45,040
appropriate what kinds of

180
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:54,240
impulses does annoy being annoyed tend to create within me

181
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:04,640
and then noticing and acknowledging they ripen they become more possible of including

182
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,599
more of who we are

183
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:18,320
and then often we're quite surprised how generous and kind and thoughtful we

184
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:25,280
are it's like it's like it comes to us as a surprise

185
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,640
that often that very ne that negative emotion that annoyance

186
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:47,680
was associated with defending something virtuous

187
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:56,960
and then also the knowing allows us to also notice and acknowledge

188
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:03,680
the times when i say we heard some

189
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,720
very difficult thing

190
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:16,079
the surge of covered infections in india and the lack of

191
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,720
medical capacity to treat them

192
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:29,839
and something in us is hurt by that

193
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:38,320
something in us feels connected to the human race in all the countries

194
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:45,839
of the globe and doesn't want others to suffer

195
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:57,440
and we feel it and we discover often to our amazement

196
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,680
our kindness our concern

197
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:17,440
and then we hold all of that up our instinctive kindness

198
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:24,880
and our contractions

199
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,480
and in our deliberateness

200
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:39,599
it becomes less idealistic you know i'm practicing awareness

201
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:48,560
to be pure i will be unsullied by the stuff of the world

202
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,280
in fact we discover oh this human existence

203
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:06,160
is so multifaceted there's so many ways we're all responding

204
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,359
i don't know if we could say we forgive ourselves and we forgive the

205
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:13,680
world

206
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:24,160
i don't even know if we could say we accept ourselves and accept the world

207
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,760
until we also accept

208
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,720
the turmoil of it all you know

209
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,359
feeling pain by the lack of medical supplies in india

210
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,359
feeling grateful for something inspiring that you read

211
00:41:53,680 --> 00:42:03,838
for some exchange that you had

212
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:17,839
feeling uneasy by something that happened in your life

213
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:25,119
kind of deliberateness that each period of meditation

214
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:30,960
asks of us the deliberateness that it asks of us

215
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,078
moment by moment

216
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,760
can we stay close to that

217
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:50,160
can we find it in the simple activities of our daily life

218
00:42:52,240 --> 00:43:01,440
can we watch it resonate and respond to what arises in our daily life

219
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:14,720
and this is quality of shraddha confidence and trust

220
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,160
it's not that we we know we're right

221
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:27,680
or that we have a mastery

222
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,920
or a compelling agency it's it's more that we're learning to be

223
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,520
part of that we that in our awareness we initiate

224
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:47,760
something and and is as it blossoms

225
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:53,760
it reveals it expresses liberation

226
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:09,520
and and as we engage in this way

227
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:17,040
the what comes up for us starts to appear more as a teaching

228
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,839
even our own reactiveness hmm

229
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,280
look at the urgency with which i got caught up in that

230
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:38,400
we can feel the depth of the conviction

231
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,000
the determination of it

232
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:50,960
and even though we might not approve of it we might find it's harmful for ourselves and for others

233
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,640
we can have some compassion for it

234
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:05,839
and we're not so surprised when it appears that others are having their reactiveness

235
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:20,319
so this sense of deliberateness that invites and noticing and

236
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:28,400
acknowledging sometimes it can just be

237
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:38,319
almost factual but if we keep inviting it we start to see

238
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:43,440
the thought patterns we start to see

239
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:50,640
the emotionality of our responses we start to see

240
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,359
the unexamined insistence of a

241
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:07,040
reactiveness but we also we're inviting them into awareness

242
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,839
awareness is becoming our ally

243
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:29,040
awareness is becoming how we will live how we will nurture this life

244
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,760
okay thank you

245
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:40,318
enjoy your day
