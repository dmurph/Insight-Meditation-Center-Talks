1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:07,279
so welcome welcome to your meditation and our meditation

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,480
together and um

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,880
as a beginning now one of the concepts that i think is a synonym

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,920
almost a synonym for mindfulness is honesty and that in particular it's

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,239
honesty with oneself and there's a kind of a categorical statement that i

6
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,920
like i think i don't prefer not having categorical statements but

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:47,440
one that i like is that it's never okay to lie to oneself and so when we sit in

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,719
meditation and being mindful of our experience it is an exercise in honestly

9
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,840
recognizing what is happening and whereas many other times the

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,040
experience is pretty mundane you know the comings and goings

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,479
of breathing uh it is a training and just recognizing honestly what's happening

12
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,240
now directly here now and there are times when

13
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,159
it's difficult to see what's inside and sometimes self-knowledge is not good

14
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,640
news and so to be honest about that so the mindfulness practice involves

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,920
being honest but then we want to do that in a wholesome way in a skillful way

16
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,720
always the analysis in buddhism is how to do something wholesomely or skillfully and in a way that's

17
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,920
beneficial and healthy and so it's not simply being honest but

18
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:53,360
to do so in a way that is generous that is caring that is non-afflictive doesn't cause any harm

19
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,560
whatsoever it doesn't debilitate us or hurt us that

20
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:06,560
we the self-criticism or something but something that's open and kind and aware and

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,440
generous in its presence oh this is how it is and so this combination of

22
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,640
sitting in honesty can be helpful idea because it might

23
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,680
help you to step back from the immediacy of what's happening in terms of you know what you're directly thinking is happening

24
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,760
to seeing a little bit the bigger picture of your relationship and your reactivity your context of

25
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,080
what's happening to you as you're with your breathing as you're with your your body or your emotions or

26
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:46,160
even your thoughts oh this is how it is for me and uh and it's equally important

27
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,920
how we have that honesty how we do the mindfulness it is as it is to be mindful

28
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,080
and so we try to do it wholesomely or skillfully so

29
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:06,640
to begin to assume a meditative posture and

30
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,599
and then gently close your eyes

31
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,239
and to

32
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:32,720
take a few long slow deep breaths

33
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:39,280
kind of breathing into the very center of your being

34
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,680
including it all from the center

35
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,840
outwards

36
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,680
breathing in and breathing out and as you exhale to relax

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:15,840
settling into what is here for you

38
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:27,520
and then to let your breathing return to normal and take a few moments to honestly

39
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:35,040
recognize what's here for you how are you right now and

40
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:43,680
and to do that recognition in a wholesome way neither being for or against the

41
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,360
experience neither being celebratory or

42
00:04:50,479 --> 00:05:11,840
upset about what it is just a simple honest recognition this is how it is now

43
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,800
and as you exhale relaxing all the places in the body that's easy

44
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,000
to soften without losing

45
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:38,000
a posture that is alert

46
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,400
if you're sitting upright not giving up a posture which is energetic

47
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,840
relaxing the shoulders especially

48
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,160
relaxing the belly sometimes relaxing the belly if you do it kind of

49
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,960
a wide relaxation that allows relaxation

50
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,120
all over the lower torso

51
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:34,319
even the smaller the back

52
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:49,840
and then settling in with your breathing

53
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,280
this is

54
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:11,360
and perhaps sensing and feeling the inhales and exhales as if your

55
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,880
awareness is a soft feather that gently

56
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,720
brushes against the body that's breathing

57
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,840
so there's a care and a delicacy

58
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:45,840
sensing experiencing the body breathing

59
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,240
and softening relaxing the thinking mind

60
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,959
quieting your thinking with the idea that the simple

61
00:08:50,959 --> 00:09:01,519
mindfulness simple recognition and honesty is meant to be simple it's meant to be

62
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,560
kind of an honesty and recognition with what is obvious

63
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,880
no need to go digging and searching

64
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,120
we allow things to show themselves more clearly over time

65
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,440
but a simple recognition of how we are

66
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,160
and within it all to be breathing and

67
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:43,839
perhaps the simplicity of breathing supports you and not getting entangled

68
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,680
or caught up in the experience so there can be a wholesome skillful

69
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:56,240
attention to what is simple light

70
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:04,320
soft quiet breathing in

71
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:19,839
and breathing out

72
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,920
you

73
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:35,840
all right

74
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,480
taking a moment or two to step back

75
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,840
and check in with yourself how are you

76
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:58,000
and if you were going to answer that question as honestly and deeply as you could

77
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,440
what would be what would be the honest answer

78
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:10,880
and i associate honesty with a recognition that is

79
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:18,639
freeing that is relaxing opening

80
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:25,760
the very simple direct recognition of how we are

81
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:36,720
and then with that recognition perhaps it's best to return to breathing

82
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:45,840
maybe breathing with how you are breathing through it

83
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:56,320
or maybe the recognition of how we are supports us to return to breathing

84
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,760
and a little bit more of a fuller

85
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:13,840
engaged way settled

86
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,919
you

87
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,840
and then coming to the end of the setting

88
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,720
to again recognize how you are

89
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:01,679
and is their way of doing that honestly where it's meaningful that it's an

90
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,519
honest recognition of how you are

91
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:16,159
that's connecting maybe settles you or maybe

92
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,880
opens you

93
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:31,039
maybe adds some embodiment to your sense of being a fullness

94
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:41,840
and perhaps awakens a little self-care

95
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:50,480
good will and kindness to yourself a willingness to see yourself

96
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:59,200
through the eyes of kindness love

97
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:07,200
and then turn turning the gaze outward out into the world

98
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:16,320
and to be quiet and still internally but gaze upon the world

99
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:23,679
kindly gaze upon the world

100
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:30,320
maybe with the imagination that others have the potential to be

101
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:37,440
happy and well and to wish that for them

102
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:43,440
and to dedicate the goodness the value the benefits from this

103
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,559
meditation for their sake

104
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:57,840
may all beings be happy may all beings be

105
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:05,840
safe may all beings be peaceful

106
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:19,840
and may all beings everywhere be free

107
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:44,640
so good morning everyone and good day and today we're continuing with

108
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,480
the theme of kusala the pali word for either translated usually is either

109
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,320
wholesome or skillful

110
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,760
and partly what's defined as wholesome and skillful

111
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:08,720
is that which is non-afflictive meaning not doesn't cause harm and

112
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:15,279
doesn't cause pain and that combination of neither harm nor pain because some things are painful you

113
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:20,960
know like i'm today i'm going to the dentist and i think it's going to be a little painful

114
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,640
but it's not harmful it's actually beneficial so the things that are beneficial and bring

115
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,240
happiness or those things which are wholesome and these things come together very nicely

116
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:39,039
in a in a teaching the buddha gave to his son

117
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:48,000
the buddha had one child a son named rahula and he was

118
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:56,640
apparently joined his father lived with his father from the time he was about seven onwards i don't know what living

119
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,679
with his father meant when his father was a monk but you know in the he lived in the

120
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:07,039
monastic world with his father and was a novice monk at the age of seven

121
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:15,679
and um and this particular story seems to be um um

122
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:21,200
seems to be when the son was a teenager a young teenager

123
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:27,840
so maybe 13 or 14. and no no actually i'm sorry i'm confusing two stories so

124
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,679
was uh when when the son was supposed to be quite young maybe soon after he was became a novice living with his father

125
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:39,360
seven eight years old and um and it seems that uh

126
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:45,919
uh he was caught telling a lie and uh the buddha then sat him down and

127
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:53,279
said uh something like the the religious life the monastic life of

128
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:59,840
someone who tells a deliberate lie is about as valuable as the amount of

129
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,679
water left in this bowl of mine my eating bowl it turns it upside down after having cleaned it and

130
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:11,358
all whatever water is left in there kind of drips out and it you know so it's a kind of a

131
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:17,118
maybe somewhat indirect way to say to a young child that what he did was not val you know was

132
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:23,919
counterproductive or not good and then and then at some point he goes

133
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:32,399
on and tells his son the criteria for how to know what to

134
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:39,040
do physically with the body what what to say and even what to think and it

135
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,358
involves a reflection and so he begins the buddha begins by saying to his son

136
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:52,320
and what's the purpose of a mirror and the sun says it's for reflection

137
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,240
and the same way this is how you should reflect on yourself so this is a way to be a mirror for

138
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:05,359
yourself to really see what's going on and so it helped you guide you in deciding what you're going to do

139
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:10,560
so here is an act of attention of mindfulness not just for the sake of mindfulness but

140
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:17,760
mindfulness for the purpose of knowing how to act in the world what to what to say and do and even to think

141
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,960
and uh so in some ways this teaching that he gives his son maybe could be seen as being

142
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:29,920
simple teachings for a seven eight year old but uh there's a tendency in many buddhists

143
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,280
teach some buddhist teachers i know to really including myself to see this as a

144
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,680
this simple teaching is kind of encapsulate very clearly the thrust of the buddhist teachings the

145
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:47,200
center of it this is what he had to say to his son in a very simple way that all the rest

146
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:53,839
of the buddha's teachings in buddhism can flow from this in a very important way

147
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,079
so zoe so this is how he tells his son to

148
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:06,960
consider his his actions an action with the body

149
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,079
should be done after repeated reflection

150
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:17,920
action by speech should be done after repeated reflection and action by mind should be done after

151
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,040
repeated reflection in this way rahula

152
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,720
when you wish to do an action with a body you should reflect upon the same bodily

153
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,640
action thus would this action that i wish to do with the

154
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,720
body lead to my own affliction or to the affliction of others

155
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:48,960
or to the affliction of both and i think the word affliction here could uh equally uh be harm

156
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:56,240
does it lead to your harm someone else's harm or to both of your arm is it an

157
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:03,680
unwholesome bodily action with painful consequences with painful results when

158
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:10,400
you reflect if you know this action that i wish to do with a body would lead to my own affliction or to

159
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:17,920
the affliction of others or to the affliction of both it is an unwholesome bodily action with painful consequences

160
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,200
with painful results then you definitively should not do such an

161
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:30,800
action with the body but when you reflect if you know this action

162
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,560
that i wish to do with the body would not lead to my affliction or to the affliction of others or to the

163
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:44,560
affliction of both it is a wholesome bodily action with happy consequences with happy results

164
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,720
then you may do such an action with the body and then he goes on to say the same

165
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,640
thing for acts of speech and also acts of the mind

166
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:03,040
so even how we think there's a movement to reflect how i'm thinking right now the attitude

167
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,960
i have the bias i have the the desires i have the is this

168
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:17,280
um afflictive is it harmful to me to someone else or to both of us

169
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:24,400
is it unwholesome unskillful and does it lead to

170
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,400
pain to suffering and if it doesn't if it leads to what's

171
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:39,760
beneficial if it leads to what's wholesome if it leads to what's uh to happiness then uh go ahead and do it

172
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:46,720
and so that's what he says what you should do before you do something so this before doing

173
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,160
something reflect on it best you can while you're doing it

174
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:59,520
you should reflect he goes on to say same thing but you should also reflect while you're doing it have some self-awareness as you're doing something

175
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:07,359
and while you're doing it if you find out that it's afflictive and unwholesome then stop doing it if it's not then keep

176
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:12,480
doing it and the value of checking in while we're doing something

177
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,000
is we get more information about the situation uh we don't always know ahead of time

178
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,720
the impact our words our actions are going to have and so um only in the middle of doing something

179
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:30,000
do we say oh wait a minute i didn't realize that situation is different than what i thought

180
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,200
and actually for me to say this or do this right now is harmful to me or harmful to others or

181
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:41,200
something like that so to continue the reflection while we're doing and the buddha then goes on to tell his

182
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:47,920
son when you finish doing something to also be reflective about it

183
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,838
and same way and is what i did

184
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,079
harmful unwholesome painful if it is and it's interesting here he

185
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:05,839
says if you have caused harm this way then you should go find a wise person

186
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:12,000
that you know and let them know what you did in other words be accountable for it

187
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,160
and now there's something about letting someone else know what you did i think that uh really is a

188
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,680
real wonderful step of honesty and it's a way of uh

189
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:30,000
kind of work through something or to acknowledge it fully and to really begin the movement of no

190
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,520
longer being behind that no longer easily slipping into doing that kind of behavior again

191
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,800
because now it's known by someone else and so it's a little bit more i think it's more

192
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,480
likely your own mind is going to be a little more attentive and careful to not do something that you don't want

193
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,160
to do but you have the support of someone else so here the buddha is teaching a

194
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,599
reflective life that so mindfulness here being in the

195
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:04,240
present moment seeing what's going on is a is support for living a considerate

196
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:11,599
life and um and sometimes it might seem that uh to do so is a lot of work um you know

197
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:16,720
adding this whole layer of self-reflection about it or or self-reflection kind of

198
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,880
can slide into being self-conscious and self-critical and negative ways but the that's why

199
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:29,040
that third category to pay attention to what you're doing in your mind is it

200
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:36,880
harmful is it unwholesome is it painful if it is stop doing it so we are there's

201
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:44,000
a self-corrective mechanism in mindfulness where the very way in which we're mindful or reflective or

202
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,520
tracking yourself what's going on the way we do it should be beneficial the way we do it

203
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:57,760
should hopefully bring some well-being and happiness so it needs to be a movement of reflection which

204
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:04,000
is not critical it's not heavy it's not stressful to do but one

205
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,200
that has a light touch is generous to ourselves is kind to

206
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:15,119
ourselves is it has a nice feeling kind of like we're our own best friend

207
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:21,200
who's uh supporting us and and helping us see ourselves in a better light and and

208
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,720
wants the best for us and so to have your own best friend inside

209
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:32,240
that wants the best for you that cares for you and supports you and

210
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,839
who in a certain kind of way is not you know it's always going to see you in a positive light

211
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:44,560
but not let you get away with doing things which are harmful or unwholesome or

212
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:51,280
painful or cause of suffering so here we see this uh you know

213
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:59,359
inaction the practice of working with what's skillful unskillful wholesome and unwholesome

214
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:06,000
and what's interesting here one thing i find interesting these are not uh um commandments

215
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,359
of what you should with the things you should and should not do

216
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:18,240
they are what you should investigate how you should investigate

217
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,960
principles for finding out for yourself what is appropriate not appropriate

218
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,319
not external kind of rules that of morality or something

219
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:35,599
so so we see as wholesome and unwholesome

220
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:43,040
skillful and unskillful as being a valuable part of this buddha's teachings and i see on the chat

221
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,880
there someone asks where this is from and it's uh again and also in the middle

222
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,960
length discourses and it's uh it teachings to rahula

223
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:03,280
and it's um i think it's uh discourse number 61 in there so thank you and

224
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:09,920
we have one more day tomorrow to talk about this topic and um i appreciate the opportunity

225
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:17,280
