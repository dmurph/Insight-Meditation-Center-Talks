hello everyone welcome welcome to our

10
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,200

12
00:03:53,439 --> 00:04:01,280
the sense i'm having right now it's active we're all settling into a quiet

13
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,400
meditation hall

14
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:16,079
maybe a little bit of a gentleness and care is offered

15
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,359
as we settle in

16
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,560
arriving here gently softly

17
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:47,680
not joking ourselves around not forcing anything to happen

18
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,040
quietly settling in into a sitting posture

19
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:05,479
or whatever the posture you're taking for this next 45 minutes or so

20
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:32,000
arriving may be a process for most of us

21
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,560
take some moments to arrive

22
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,758
allow the body really sit down

23
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:02,000
maybe with some intentionality being deliberate

24
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,319
taking a sitting posture

25
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,360
now we make ourselves available

26
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,720
to however the body is sitting

27
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:49,639
making contact with the floor the chairs

28
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:14,560
when the arrival becomes full maybe we also feel

29
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,560
the support of the ground

30
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:28,440
and landing here and now

31
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,039
present experience

32
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,360
and our awareness is already here knowing

33
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:55,160
that we're here in this body this mind

34
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,000
receiving sound

35
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,719
sensations in the body

36
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,080
fleeting thoughts

37
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,600
may be ripples of emotions

38
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,920
we are available to this

39
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,839
not wishing something else to happen

40
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,120
being pulled by our preferences

41
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,519
available to this

42
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,440
from a stable ground we align

43
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:18,199
align our body heart and mind with our aspirations

44
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:25,360
values integrity

45
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,640
virtual inner virtual

46
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,560
we align with a wholesale skillful

47
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,440
and beneficial to ourselves and others

48
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:16,720
and sometimes the alignment is about as some kind of ease in the

49
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,519
body maybe in the heart

50
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,079
a heart is unburdened

51
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,680
whenever you're ready

52
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:03,079
open your awareness to receive the felt sense of earth element

53
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,480
the hardness of the bones

54
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,839
weight settling down

55
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,440
sort of a strange holding this body up

56
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,839
the bones are holding this body up

57
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,839
maybe a hint of stillness coming [Music]

58
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,839
along with the earth element

59
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,000
earth element is grounding

60
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,519
and relatively speaking unmoving

61
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:01,079
relatively speaking not totally unmoving

62
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,839
allows earthy body resting on earth

63
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:12,680
with the steadiness and stillness of the earth element

64
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:24,399
maybe you already are aware of the air element

65
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,399
movements of the breath

66
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:38,399
vibration bubbly sensations

67
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,720
in the body

68
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:10,480
there is a stillness in the earth element and there is a movement

69
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,839
in the air element

70
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,759
still moving body

71
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,079
water element may avail itself

72
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:22,480
feeling into the water element

73
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,438
moisture in the mouth

74
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:38,039
moisture around the eyes sockets and eyes

75
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:54,600
maybe you feel some sense of fluidity inside of the body

76
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,400
more than 70 percent of our body is water

77
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:46,559
the water element may settle along with the earth element

78
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:03,559
there may be a sense of sitting in the still pond of water

79
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:32,880
there may be waves in the pose on the surface

80
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,720
thoughts emotions

81
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:46,159
yet they can be held by stillness

82
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,320
quiet

83
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,440
my

84
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:14,919
letting go of any momentum trying to figure it out

85
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:22,240
matching some ideas we may have

86
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:29,120
in our head to let the body

87
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,080
speaks for itself

88
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,080
we are available to the without sense of the body

89
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,158
however it manifests itself

90
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:19,200
now if you wish maybe you can follow along

91
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:27,320
i'm becoming available to the fire element in the body

92
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:37,280
maybe there's some warmth in your palm

93
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:46,200
coolness and some part of the skin in the body

94
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,480
warmth of the out breath

95
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,760
maybe coolness everything

96
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,080
foreign

97
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:44,000
this body experiences different temperatures

98
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:55,039
you may even feel some heat in the belly or the chest

99
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:07,559
the coolness of the face the skin with the face

100
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:47,440
certain emotions may have an embodied fire element

101
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,919
in us

102
00:24:53,679 --> 00:25:01,080
anger and frustration may be felt

103
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:07,960
as some kind of heat inside the torso

104
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,600
without trying to push them away

105
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:34,799
or wishing them to go away resting

106
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:41,279
in the knowing of the fire element embodied

107
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,158
experience just as is

108
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:54,120
being kind and truthful to this experience

109
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:38,039
from here we make our awareness wide open

110
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,480
receiving whatever

111
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:51,720
is available to us

112
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,840
2

113
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:37,200
stay true to whatever arises

114
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,000
and passes away

115
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,200
the stillness of the earth element may be prominent

116
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:42,399
where the movement of the air element

117
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:49,200
is obvious or the heat

118
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,880
where the coolness is clear

119
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:08,158
however it is receiving

120
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,880
receiving the blessing of this life

121
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,638
okay

122
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:17,159
[Music]

123
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:02,560
i feel quite fortunate to be able to spend this morning sitting with you and

124
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:08,079
practicing dharma and explore drama

125
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:16,320
so today we'll continue continue our discussion around sila

126
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,880
and we're going to speak about the fourth precept

127
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:28,560
which is uh to undertake training of abstaining

128
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,839
from a false speech

129
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:42,800
i wanted to expand this a little bit because clearly in our modern day societies

130
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:49,280
this speech has kind of broadened out a lot more right with many different

131
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:56,160
modalities um with internet social media

132
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,320
emails you know lots of different devices that we use and

133
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:08,240
it's not the same as you know 2500 years ago where

134
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,480
a verbal exchange is mostly the only way to explore

135
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:20,160
the aspect of a communication and to now

136
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:26,240
we have so many modalities that we're engaging in communicating exchanging

137
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,079
information and so this preset in

138
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:37,200
our day and life now i would

139
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,240
i would expand that to include all of this modalities

140
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,839
so we undertaking the training to abstain from

141
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:53,839
false communication or lying through all these different

142
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:59,040
ways or miss um are

143
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,800
uh propagate misinformation miscommunicate communication

144
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:12,720
and this is under uh this training perceptive for our day in life here as well

145
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:19,359
and so again i wanted to explore this from the dimensions of

146
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:24,560
awareness and abstinence and alignment

147
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,920
and that's a triple a framework we've been talking about

148
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:38,079
all right instead of speaking about lies or lying

149
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:44,560
and today i wanted to start with truth

150
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:51,640
staying true dedicating ourselves ourselves to truth

151
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,920
in our guided meditation um i

152
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,440
guided briefly and for us to tune in

153
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:11,599
to the truth of our experience as we cultivate mindful awareness

154
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:19,480
we can become sensitive unto our own heart and mind and body

155
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:25,839
and we can begin to notice what is true what is the foul sense of truth within

156
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:33,480
us and what what is the felt sense of not being truthful

157
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:39,040
and so for me and the felt sense of the truth has some sense of

158
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,640
alignment in my body heart and mind that there are

159
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,760
um my body heart and mind are in harmony

160
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:56,320
with each other and not like a you know one wants to go one direction the other one goes to

161
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,720
another direction and cultivating clear awareness is very

162
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:10,799
important for us to begin to know what's true and what is untrue

163
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:19,200
without cultivation of a clear awareness often the state of a delusion

164
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:25,680
might cover cover up what might be true

165
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:34,880
so for me um i'm kind of very aware of a certain conditioning i

166
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:43,440
have um i'm an asian american and sometimes i would notice that

167
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:49,520
when i'm in a group with other people with people with other kind

168
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,560
of cultures and that i'm not familiar with and

169
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:02,240
if i'm the only person who's not in that kind of uh a culture dominant culture in the group

170
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,000
um when people say things and that it feels like everybody else knows what they're

171
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,720
saying they're laughing they're nodding and but here i am i don't know i have no

172
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,160
clue what they're talking about because i don't grow up with this kind of culture or

173
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:26,240
that the group is expressing and so there are moments that i would

174
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:33,119
notice but would i not as if i know um

175
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:39,599
or not and so for me this is a learning i learned that

176
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,280
when i actually not pretending that i know

177
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:53,760
there's something off inside of me something not aligned inside of me

178
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,280
and so i learned in situations like this

179
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,839
to not give in to the tendency of simply following

180
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:12,000
along um pretending or maybe feeling embarrassed if you know i don't

181
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,040
know something that everybody on everybody else seems to know

182
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,480
and so there can be all this little kind of self thing going on

183
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,680
that pull us out of um staying

184
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:33,119
true to what we know and what we don't know

185
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,960
and so for me i learned and that it's okay to say i don't know

186
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,560
and in fact many times the people are very happy to tell me

187
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:51,599
what they know and i learned something new and so rather than caring

188
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:57,280
and the burden of misalignment in our heart and mind and

189
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:03,040
our bodies when we really tune in to our inner being

190
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:09,440
in situations and begin to discern this kind of

191
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:16,880
alignment in this we can become clear

192
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:23,200
and we can practice this precept with a lot of lightness in our bodies

193
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:29,440
and heart and i i don't know if i i you notice

194
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:34,480
that this if you observe little kids um

195
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:39,680
especially for some uh maybe when they're quite young

196
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:46,480
if they tell deliberate lies sometimes you see that something is kind of off in

197
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:53,200
them they're not quite themselves and in the same way

198
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,520
and that may be true for adults as well

199
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:06,560
and so this cultivation of awareness is to begin to get to know this a felt

200
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:13,200
sense of truth truthfulness and a felt sense of untrue

201
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,520
dishonest and we when we can stay connected

202
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:27,839
with that sense of the truth we can then trust more and more what flows out of that place

203
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:34,800
our words and our actions and there is a teaching

204
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:41,200
in the maja manikaya sutra mn61

205
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,640
and that again is another suta that the buddha taught his son rahula

206
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,400
and this is the one rahula was about seven year old a very young monk

207
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:59,920
apparently had um had um made a deliberate lie

208
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:06,400
and so the buddha decided to give him a teaching and

209
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:15,040
i'm not going to go through the entire teaching here but the buddha ended

210
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:21,520
a section of the teaching to rahula by saying this and he said

211
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,280
rahula when one is not ashamed to tell a deliberate lie

212
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:34,079
there is no evil i say that one would not do therefore rahula

213
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,200
you should train thus i will not utter a falsehood

214
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:46,240
even as a joke that's quite a strong statement to a

215
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:52,240
young kid right so for me i kind of

216
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,440
you know made me pause just to reflect oh what is buddha

217
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,040
pointing at here what does it mean to tell a deliberate

218
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:09,920
lie without feeling ashamed of

219
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:17,440
so if it just kind of take a few moments to pass just right there

220
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:25,520
what might this be pointing towards and for me there was a vivid image of

221
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:32,000
piling mud on top of thick mud it's kind of layers of the dilutions

222
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:39,280
pining up and the the first thick layer of mud is the

223
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,839
deliberate lies and then not having moral

224
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:51,520
conscience it's kind of like a piling another thick layer on top

225
00:45:55,599 --> 00:46:02,720
now the truth is really far away a hard to get access to

226
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:10,079
and so i wanted to just say a few words about this having um

227
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:18,240
conscience and to know oh you know then you know i may have

228
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:23,599
an engaged in the action that wasn't wholesome

229
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:29,520
and this having a moral conscience in the classic teachings is said to be

230
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:34,880
the guardians of our heart and mind so we can reflect

231
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:40,640
about the consequence of unskillful actions and speech

232
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:47,040
communications and then we can begin to have a choice moving forward

233
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:55,040
from this point on without this moral conscience

234
00:46:55,040 --> 00:47:02,560
without something that we feel in our heart that isn't aligned

235
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:10,079
it's pretty hopeless right imagine that

236
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:15,200
can you imagine in the world where

237
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:24,400
people will behave and and um behave in unh harmful ways but there's

238
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:30,240
no protection of some form of moral conscience

239
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:38,599
i have a hard time imagining living in a world like that

240
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:46,400
and so this um having the moral conscience uh to know

241
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:53,839
and let this moral conscience also have a dimension of care and wisdom in it

242
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:59,119
annoying whoa this wasn't skillful

243
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:06,880
and now i'm going to make a different choice now and so now we have an opportunity to

244
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:14,960
train our heart and mind in a different orientation

245
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,599
and so i also wanted to kind of go back to the importance of

246
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:27,680
staying true because lies break trust amongst human beings

247
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:32,400
lies break our own inner integrity

248
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:40,720
and so we human beings live our lives we depend on trusting some levels

249
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:46,720
trusting of each other of each other right

250
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:53,680
so when we can really have that deep trust for our own actions and speech and our

251
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,558
activities and we can trust others

252
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:06,720
there is so much safety in us so much well-being that can come from it

253
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:14,480
and so because of this it's important to undertake this training precept

254
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:20,559
to abstain from false speech and false communication

255
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:26,319
and then we align we align ourselves with the truth

256
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:34,559
and we cultivate wise skillful speech that are kind unifying beneficial

257
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:40,079
conducive for creating safety and trust

258
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:45,839
and so i'll end by coating again this mangala sutra

259
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:51,119
suitor for blessings and it has this few lines

260
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,480
speaking to this he says education and the craft

261
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:01,680
discipline and training and well-spoken speech

262
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:09,200
this is the highest blessing may we all continue our journey of a

263
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:15,119
practice may our practice benefit all beings

264
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:22,720
and thank you all for being here today and i'll see you tomorrow

265
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:29,400
have a wonderful rest rest of the day wherever you are
