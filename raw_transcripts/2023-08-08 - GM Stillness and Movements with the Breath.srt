3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:29,039
sitting pasture that allow you to settle in it's almost like a creating a virtual

4
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:36,719
field virtual meditation field around the globe this way

5
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,940
and While others join us

6
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:53,420
so this week we are meditating with the theme of

7
00:00:53,420 --> 00:01:00,239
Stillness and the movement and so yesterday we started with

8
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:08,880
Stillness and a movement in the body and today we'll still stay with uh

9
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,939
the territory of the body um but I will bring a bit more emphasis

10
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:22,740
around the Stillness and movement with the movements of the breath

11
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:31,159
and so that's what we will be doing today so if you're ready

12
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:36,320
please join me and we'll begin

13
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:49,820
settle into a meditative posture

14
00:01:52,439 --> 00:02:00,780
whether you're sitting on the cushions or sitting on chairs or lying down

15
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:09,560
or even standing enter into the posture

16
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,940
as if you're entering into an ancient Temple

17
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:27,620
the Temple of this body this mind and heart

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,120
maybe just the word Temple already evokes

19
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,480
some foul sense in the body in the heart

20
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,099
maybe some reverence

21
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,720
tenderness and the quiet

22
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:23,540
making our seat Right Here and Now

23
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:31,400
in this body in this mind and heart

24
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,319
now practice happens Here and Now

25
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:04,459
and our lives happens Here and Now

26
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:18,739
taking a few moments to have a global sense of the body

27
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:37,759
and sense of this earthy body resting on Earth

28
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:09,560
initial moments of a meditation may feel like a lot of things moving

29
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:20,000
energy in the body still bouncy

30
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:30,360
and maybe the mind thoughts

31
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,500
are still bouncing around

32
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,080
no problem make space

33
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:05,180
to allow the movements

34
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:10,220
to move about and settle

35
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:34,520
donating to the Earth element in the body

36
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:42,440
enough about sense is the solidity

37
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:47,660
firmness of the bones

38
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,300
heaviness

39
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,120
no weight settling down naturally

40
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:15,440
giving to the wonders of a gravity nothing to do

41
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:24,199
simply allowing

42
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:50,360
the Earth element is grounding

43
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,500
stable

44
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,639
somewhat still

45
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:39,500
nature of the Earth element is to stabilize the body

46
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,180
and feel the whole body sitting like a mountain

47
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,060
quiet

48
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,459
and still

49
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,720
and Stillness of Earth element in the body

50
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:44,240
naturally highlights the movements of the wind element

51
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,740
that she

52
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,779
breath

53
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:12,560
air moving as we breathe in and out

54
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,779
and open the field of awareness to receive

55
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:35,300
the movements of the Bride

56
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:10,579
feel the movements since the movements in the body

57
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,279
torso expands contracts

58
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:40,519
Valley Rises and falls

59
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:05,300
you may also notice the broader field of movement in the body

60
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:21,560
vibrations tingling in the hands

61
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,140
legs

62
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,680
a life body

63
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:55,160
and dropping out of the concept the stories

64
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:13,279
healing and sensing the dance of the alive body

65
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:50,480
and feeling and sensing needs no words

66
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:00,560
there is a inner quiet

67
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,980
simply staying with a flow of movements

68
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,680
some Stillness may still be palpable

69
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:45,980
Pleasant

70
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:12,500
there is also the Stillness in the knowing

71
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,240
of the embodied experience

72
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:35,420
silent still knowing

73
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,880
no just the breath and shifts and changes

74
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:59,180
and Sensations shifts and it changes

75
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,000
there is a Stillness in the body

76
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,100
Stillness in the mind

77
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:09,500
and various movements in the body

78
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:18,080
and movements in the mind

79
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,500
the finto weather systems may come in

80
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:27,000
you know strong energetic field emotions

81
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,120
thoughts

82
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:44,840
receiving receiving with a kindness

83
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:54,500
wide open quiet field of awareness

84
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:19,100
present um Pleasant Sensations they're coming

85
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,039
and this is the part of the nature

86
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:04,260
being available to our lived experiences

87
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:09,740
or the kindness kind of attention

88
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,140
sitting like a mountain

89
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,658
a life Mountain

90
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:52,020
quiet still

91
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,960
are moving

92
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:06,200
while the sensations in the body in the body

93
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,360
comes

94
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,799
and dances

95
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:30,320
maybe there is a sense of all

96
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,799
a sense of openness

97
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,640
it's very body

98
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:00,240
nature

99
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,460
simply resting in itself

100
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,589
[Music]

101
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,840
okay

102
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:55,679
I'm so happy so happy to be with you so this week I've been

103
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:03,419
um reflecting about the great women Disciples of the Buddha

104
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:12,120
we started yesterday with um patachara so

105
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:17,899
someone who we feel um

106
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,539
I guess some kind of I feel some kind of affinity with

107
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:32,159
and today I brought another great disciple of women a woman disciple of

108
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:38,940
the Buddha and she's very different from

109
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:45,320
pattuchara and her name is

110
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:53,520
not particularly uh well known maybe in our scene

111
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:59,940
but I found her story quite interesting maybe fun and so I thought I'd bring

112
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:09,899
someone who's a little different today and so um bada is This Woman's

113
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:16,440
um birth name bada was also born out of somewhat of a

114
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:22,320
wealthy family and um this part of the story may be a

115
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,360
little similar to patachara when she was young

116
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:37,019
um she fell in love with um a thief may be very attractive Thief

117
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:43,500
and she was said it to be quite attractive as well so she fell in love

118
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:50,539
with the thief a Brahman thief and she insisted to marry the thief

119
00:33:50,539 --> 00:33:56,720
and even though out of a lot of Despair the parents I guess

120
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:03,659
she's very stubborn and so they decided okay all right and so they didn't get

121
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:12,440
married um but after not very long after the marriage

122
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,240
the thief husband has stealing habit

123
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:26,358
and so this came up again and so uh he's been scheming to try to

124
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:34,320
steal all of the jewelries and valuables from the bot from bada

125
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:39,898
and um bada probably didn't realize this would

126
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:45,179
happen even though they married into kind of a well-to-do family there's no

127
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:51,300
need to do that um so she didn't think this would happen

128
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:56,520
but one day um the young man

129
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:02,099
um decided to take on bada out to a top

130
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:07,680
of the mountain and his scheme was

131
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:14,640
you know he's gonna Rob all the jewelries of bada and then push her down

132
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:21,720
the mountain to kill her and she didn't realize that and so they

133
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:28,140
went to the top of the mountain um but she's a very smart young lady

134
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:34,320
when they got to the top of the mountain she realized something wasn't right

135
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:39,780
and she realized that her husband was going to murder her

136
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:45,440
and so I she was quite smart she

137
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,660
got to the edge of the mountain and just before

138
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:56,040
she handed off all the jewelries to her husband

139
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:04,680
she pushed him down the mountain and killed her husband

140
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:12,780
this all happened to kind of such a in a short few minutes and

141
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:20,220
that was a shocking and she didn't expect it as she would kill anybody and let alone her her own

142
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:25,859
husband and so this was too much she didn't know

143
00:36:25,859 --> 00:36:31,200
how to hold this and the burden of killing someone was

144
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:36,240
way too much and so she felt like she couldn't go

145
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:43,380
back to her lay life anymore and she couldn't go back to her family

146
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:51,720
so she decided the only way she might find peace was to join

147
00:36:51,720 --> 00:37:00,060
uh spiritual community and so she became a Wandering ascetic

148
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:05,700
and so in those days there is this wandering ascetic order called The

149
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:12,300
Legends and then um and this is still alive in India and

150
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:21,078
this tradition and so she became a Wandering ascetic in this order

151
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:29,640
and it was said because this is ascetic order so people lived in ways that may

152
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:36,540
be kind of challenging and when she first got ordained into this

153
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:42,980
um order and she actually pulled all her hair from the root

154
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:51,780
as the new hair grew they were very curly so this word that

155
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:57,839
she's known means curly hair and so she's known as

156
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:05,040
the bada who had a very curly hair

157
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:14,060
as a very intelligent woman [Music] she spent the next 50 years or so

158
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:20,520
wandering around the country as a ascetic and visiting or the spiritual

159
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:26,119
leaders learned about the philosophies and

160
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:34,920
gained a lot of knowledge in those days when one King's knowledge and

161
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:40,500
um they will begin to engage in debates and

162
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:47,400
so she was very well known apparently she won a lot of debates

163
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:54,660
and so she became kind of in some way a spiritual leader

164
00:38:54,660 --> 00:39:01,320
in that um she's knowledgeable and was able to

165
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:06,540
conduct a lot of debates and was able to win a lot of debates

166
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:13,380
now one day she was wondering around a place and that the Buddha Buddhist

167
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:18,480
Community was staying and

168
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:25,079
um she met sarepota sorry puta was a

169
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:32,160
a chief disciple of on the Buddha who was known to have a very analytical mind

170
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,980
very um I guess it's also means that he's

171
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:44,119
probably good at debates too and so um

172
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:54,180
got into a debate and during this debate

173
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:59,820
um asked all the questions and to sorry

174
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:06,119
Buddha and saripota was able to answer all of them

175
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:14,160
and she ran out of questions to ask in the end and this was kind of

176
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:19,920
I heard for her and so she didn't know what to do and

177
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:25,440
asare puto decided I'm going to ask her a question

178
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,619
and so sorry puta asked her this question

179
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:39,240
what is the one suppose this is one of those kind of

180
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,579
um quite maybe philosophical and Abstract

181
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:49,640
question and um

182
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:59,520
somehow uh you know she she does have this a kind of a sense that she knew the

183
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:07,859
standard answer like the god the infinite the Brahma just want to cut it

184
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:13,220
but she didn't know how to answer it she didn't have the answer

185
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:20,700
and yet through this question she had a sense that sorry Buddha might

186
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:29,160
be the one who knows and because at this time it's clear that

187
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:36,000
even with all this is 50 years of a wandering around being famous and able

188
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,820
to debate a lot of people she still hasn't really found a complete

189
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:48,599
peace in her heart so she asked sariputa whether saraputo

190
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:54,540
would be her teacher sorry puta pointed her to the Buddha

191
00:41:54,540 --> 00:42:01,020
instead and so she went to see the Buddha and

192
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:06,020
the Buddha preached the Dharma to her

193
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:14,339
in the recount of this part of the story in the Legends of the terries that that

194
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:22,800
I began to read yesterday and about Candela Kisa said this

195
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,859
Buddha preached Dharma to me that Aggregates the sense fields and

196
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:33,920
elements a Buddha taught unpleasantness

197
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:39,619
impermanence dukka and the not self

198
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:47,060
it was asserted that bada just like the other wandering ascetic

199
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:53,180
that's known as a Bahia who was the foremost among the monks

200
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:59,400
who was able to get to the Buddha's teachings very quickly and she was the

201
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:05,099
foremost among the female disciples with the same kind of quality

202
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:10,800
so just with this teaching she was able to understand something

203
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:18,359
deeply and very quickly and at the end of this encounter with

204
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:26,160
the Buddha and the Buddha concluded their conversation with this verses

205
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,180
and he said

206
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:38,640
though a thousand verses are made of meaningless lies

207
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,040
better the single meaningful line be heard by which

208
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,900
one is at peace

209
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:57,900
so that was the end of condolences debate career and she realized with all this knowledge

210
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:03,900
she had and all this debates that she engaged in

211
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:11,700
those are really not that meaningful anymore so she went forth to join the Buddha to

212
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:20,099
become a disciple of the Buddha and this teaching reminded me that so

213
00:44:20,099 --> 00:44:26,880
often we can miss that the teaching of the Buddha are not found

214
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:34,920
in the stacks of books um the analysis debates

215
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:42,480
or incessant thinking about them the concepts the ideas the stories

216
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:50,579
that we tell ourselves instead the teachings the point at the immediacy

217
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:55,940
of our lived experience Here and Now

218
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:02,359
the Dharma is visible Here and Now

219
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:07,859
immediate inviting to be seen for oneself

220
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:13,560
onward leading and to be personally experienced by the

221
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:21,000
wise and so she recounted her Awakening

222
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:28,920
through the slimes than being fully ordained this is into

223
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:36,900
the uh Buddhism monastic order I saw a little bit of a water

224
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:43,800
cleaning my feet Discerning that some water splashed up

225
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:52,560
some spilled down then at that time I realized all conditioned

226
00:45:52,560 --> 00:46:01,619
things are like that then my heart was liberated all together

227
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:07,560
without cleaning then the Buddha adapted me for most of

228
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:12,240
those with a quick intuition

229
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:20,160
I love this word intuition it has a kind of a rawness in it

230
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:25,440
it's not based on some kind of a speculative views

231
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:31,859
ideas each of us being human

232
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:38,180
has this kind of intuitive capacity to know things as simply

233
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:49,040
intimately and deeply and this is where dhamma becomes visible

234
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:57,420
and this kind of intuitive knowing is only possible when we drop out of the

235
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:02,640
layers of Concepts and ideas

236
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:07,220
and all of our claimings to them

237
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:15,200
I may says story

238
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:22,140
Inspire us to live simply immediately

239
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:27,960
with the rawness of our life here and now

240
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:35,579
thank you everyone for your attention and I will regroup tomorrow

241
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:39,140
deep bells to you all
