1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,919
okay so good evening

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,759
i wanted to talk tonight

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,920
about beginning well

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,360
so wherever you are in the world it's

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,080
clear

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,080
that this pandemic that we're all living

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,119
with

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,160
is entering a new phase there's an

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,119
increased

10
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,320
availability of vaccines and all the

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,800
complications that come with

12
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,760
different variants

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,440
but nonetheless it's clear enough that

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,040
things are starting to shift a bit and

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,520
sometime later this year will be will be

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,520
different

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,200
so as we move toward

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,120
whatever post-pandemic life looks like

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,160
it is helpful to consider

20
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,600
how to pick up new activities

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,040
well so in this case we actually have

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,320
the luxury of time of considering

23
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,400
what it is and how it is that we might

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,520
want to pick things up

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,439
as we go forward in some sense we don't

26
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,320
ever really have

27
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,280
this time it's just an illusion because

28
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,200
every moment right

29
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,240
experience is arising it's arriving and

30
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,520
arising

31
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,799
and we're meeting it and so there's

32
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,840
always beginning

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,640
every moment there's a continual process

34
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,840
of beginning

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,240
but nonetheless there are some times

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,040
when we can

37
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,680
imagine that we have a beginning that we

38
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,840
can think about or move toward in some

39
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,600
intentional way so it is worthwhile

40
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,280
when we have this time to

41
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,880
begin things well to begin things well

42
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,200
so when this is done when we begin well

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,159
then experience unfolds more naturally

44
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,360
and also we're in a better position to

45
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,759
learn from experience as it comes and

46
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,200
also to make

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,920
uh the necessary adjustments to to

48
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,360
staying on course

49
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,319
all of that a lot of that depends on

50
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,280
beginning well

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,599
in some way so what is this you know

52
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,200
what does this mean

53
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,840
what do the buddhist teachings say about

54
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,400
beginnings we hear a lot about endings

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,200
about

56
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,040
cessation and letting go and

57
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,400
being free you sort of imply something

58
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,920
dropping away maybe ending suffering the

59
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,720
end of suffering is the aim of the path

60
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,760
but what about the beginnings

61
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,640
the buddha did talk about beginnings and

62
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,400
how to do it well

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,040
and the teachings mostly focus in three

64
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,400
areas

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,080
our understanding our intention

66
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,159
and our effort so we'll talk about

67
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:05,840
those things tonight

68
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,200
i think it's no surprise that we are

69
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,159
instructed to pay attention to the mind

70
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,080
as we are beginning things you know

71
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,519
that's considered

72
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,040
a really important place to to notice as

73
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,480
we go forward

74
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,120
there's the well-known opening stanza of

75
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,680
the dhammapada that begins

76
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,720
mind is the forerunner of all things

77
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,080
so that's pretty clear that the

78
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,480
how we are in the mind is going to have

79
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,640
a major impact on what happens as things

80
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,000
go forward

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,599
and then more specifically there are

82
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,840
other teachings um

83
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,799
there's one in the major that says quite

84
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,000
directly

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,519
right view comes first right view comes

86
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,560
first so this is about our understanding

87
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,040
uh it doesn't mean let me unpack that a

88
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,319
little bit

89
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,680
the right view doesn't mean that we are

90
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,799
sort of

91
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,439
passively applying a view that we

92
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:06,000
receive

93
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,080
from the teachings or from our teacher

94
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,200
or something

95
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,599
um and just sort of sticking it on okay

96
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,480
here's the

97
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,040
here's the belief i need to apply in

98
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,799
order to begin

99
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,479
it's actually more subtle than that so

100
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,960
whatever view we're using and there

101
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,919
always is one

102
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,520
we always have some kind of a view

103
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,800
coming in that's going to provide

104
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,240
the context or the orientation for

105
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,759
what follows so then

106
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,080
what write means about right view is

107
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,199
that we should adopt

108
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,360
an orientation or a view or an

109
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,400
understanding

110
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,240
that is appropriate for the task at hand

111
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,000
for what it is that we're beginning so

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
in practice and this is the context for

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,720
that quote right view comes first

114
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,479
if the task is walking the buddhist path

115
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,600
to the end of suffering to peace to

116
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,520
liberation

117
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,360
then what we would choose is what is

118
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,720
called right view

119
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,600
which means an appropriate view for

120
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,080
doing

121
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,520
that and you know this generally has

122
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,639
two forms because it's this right view

123
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,800
is useful for whatever we undertake to

124
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,039
make it part of our path

125
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,400
so the two forms of this appropriate

126
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,600
or right view

127
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,280
the first one is the understanding that

128
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,479
actions have results and that we have

129
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,080
some choice about that

130
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,440
so we live in a world that has laws of

131
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,120
cause and effect

132
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,160
in going on you know they may be

133
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,479
more complex than we can exactly see all

134
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,479
the details of and they may operate in

135
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,680
different ways

136
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,360
at different times but generally

137
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,880
speaking actions will have

138
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,080
consequences and we have some choice

139
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,280
about that so

140
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,000
in particular actions that come from a

141
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,319
mind that's oriented toward

142
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,600
harm will lead to our own

143
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,960
suffering our own dukkha and

144
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,039
in contrast actions that come from a

145
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,120
mind oriented toward peace or toward

146
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,160
non-harm

147
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,960
will tend to bring happiness to us this

148
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,639
is one of these of these some of these

149
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,120
basic

150
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,400
laws of action and consequence so even

151
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,759
if we have kind of no

152
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,880
idea about the long-term

153
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,680
or large picture of what we're doing we

154
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,280
can at least in this moment choose to

155
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,280
do actions from an orientation of

156
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,720
non-harming

157
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,840
and that will be good in some sense

158
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,919
and so um people can feel great relief

159
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,479
at having this at a as a guide you don't

160
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,319
actually have to have it all figured out

161
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,840
in the whole big picture because things

162
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,840
are complex especially in

163
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,680
something like this pandemic or in a

164
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,160
complex interconnected world like we

165
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,280
live in

166
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,319
so we can you know make some attempt to

167
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,080
think about our views and our

168
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,919
orientation in the bigger picture but

169
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,479
what matters really is that right now

170
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,360
we come from a place of non-harming that

171
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,360
will have

172
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,120
good consequences for us for our

173
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,560
happiness and and those around us

174
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,599
so that's one wise orientation

175
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,120
wise view and then the second dimension

176
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,080
of

177
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,720
of right view or appropriate view which

178
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720
is actually not so different

179
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,880
is to see things specifically in terms

180
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,759
of dukkha

181
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,919
and its ant or suffering in its end

182
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,000
or stress in its end so we can notice

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,440
um in a situation what feels

184
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,919
stressful or tense or somehow

185
00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:51,360
unsatisfactory we can notice that attune

186
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,240
to that

187
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,360
and then move toward its release

188
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,440
so if i'm entering a room and i feel

189
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,319
some tension

190
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,479
in my chest i can notice that and then

191
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,639
take care of that in some way notice am

192
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,879
i feeling afraid in some way

193
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,520
or in what you know what might i do

194
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,520
maybe just being mindful of the fear

195
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,199
sufficient or something else but

196
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,720
tuning toward dukkha and its end

197
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,639
is a way of orienting toward the four

198
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,160
noble truths

199
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,680
toward what is it that's challenging

200
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,520
right now

201
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,879
how am i somehow holding on

202
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,800
wanting something in order that that's

203
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,080
coming about

204
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,880
how could i apply something i know from

205
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,518
practice

206
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,479
to somehow ease or release some of that

207
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,440
suffering

208
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,000
you know without making it complex but

209
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,839
this orientation of dukkha and its

210
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,720
release

211
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,240
is very much in line with what we're

212
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,800
doing on the path so that's

213
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,000
a good guide for our actions as we

214
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,200
as we undertake things

215
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,240
so even you know just another everyday

216
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,880
example

217
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,080
is if i'm beginning a work project with

218
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,040
somebody

219
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,440
and i'm going to talk with them about

220
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,640
this project so

221
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,920
it's a beginning how do i orient i could

222
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,519
orient toward cultivating kindness

223
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,080
active listening a healthy relationship

224
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,680
with this person that i'm going to be

225
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,360
working with

226
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,480
or i could practice mindfulness of not

227
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,640
drifting off into my own thoughts but

228
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,600
actually

229
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,200
staying on task and being clear about

230
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,680
what's happening in the conversation

231
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,839
those are both forms of this appropriate

232
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,519
view that i just talked about

233
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,080
and those are very different than say

234
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,680
orienting toward

235
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,800
okay i've got to convince this person to

236
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,040
do it my way i've got to get my point

237
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,640
across and make sure that

238
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,360
i stay in control of this thing as it's

239
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,480
starting

240
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,640
that's very different right so that's

241
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,519
going to have a major

242
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,279
impact on how things unfold so

243
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,360
and this works on the cushion too we did

244
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,120
it in the guided meditation he said if

245
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,680
we sit down and we orient toward

246
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,920
bringing some ease to the body some ease

247
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,120
to the mind

248
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,279
some sense of what we're doing that will

249
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,440
have a different effect than if we

250
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,519
don't do those things to orient at the

251
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,959
beginning of our sit

252
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,120
these simple acts can have very

253
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,360
important

254
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,320
results for how the meditation proceeds

255
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,839
so in general we're asking

256
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,120
how can this be wholesome or supportive

257
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,120
of the path as i go forward

258
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,760
now how can i reduce stuka through this

259
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,120
beginning

260
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,440
so all of this amounts to right view our

261
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,000
understanding and our orientation as we

262
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,680
begin a task go into something

263
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,880
so right view as you may recall from the

264
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,800
steps of the eightfold path

265
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
it feeds into the next step which is

266
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,720
called right intention

267
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,360
and that is actually the crux the sort

268
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,440
of key point the crucial point

269
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,440
of how we engage skillfully with

270
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,600
beginnings i would say that's

271
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,519
the key one so classically there are

272
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,720
three wholesome intentions that we

273
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,399
orient around as we go forward

274
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,399
each of which is set up to counteract

275
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,399
some kind of unwholesome intention that

276
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,560
we might have in the mind

277
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,079
some sort of tendency so the intention

278
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:26,000
the first intention is typically called

279
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,240
renunciation

280
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,560
people don't always connect with that

281
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,600
word

282
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,000
so we could also call it letting go or

283
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,959
even being at ease if we you know wanted

284
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:39,360
to

285
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,560
extend it a little bit so it counteracts

286
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,320
the unskillful pursuit

287
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,600
of sense pleasure you know just wanting

288
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,839
to grasp at the pleasant part wanting to

289
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,200
get things that are

290
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,560
good and pleasant and useful for me

291
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,880
you know these sorts of graspy kinds of

292
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,320
orientations

293
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,680
um the the intention of being generous

294
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,000
or renouncing the need for those things

295
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,120
is is this first orientation and it's

296
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,560
it has a an effect of coming in with an

297
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,480
open hand with an open heart with an

298
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,639
open mind

299
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,519
and then the the second and third of

300
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:20,560
these

301
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,680
right intentions or wise intentions are

302
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,320
stated

303
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,040
as clear counteractions so they're

304
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,120
stated as non-ill will

305
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,399
and non-cruelty so we also come in with

306
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,959
a mind that isn't oriented in a negative

307
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:36,839
or aversive

308
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,279
or oppositional

309
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,480
way as we move into things or if they're

310
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,040
named

311
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,399
more in the positive it could be named

312
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,519
as

313
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,639
good will or as compassion

314
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,120
so these are um essentially these three

315
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,320
set the tone of our engagement with

316
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:58,880
things

317
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,839
so um and the tone the tone that we're

318
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:02,800
setting in life

319
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,000
matters so much that's

320
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,519
worry that's based in our intention

321
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,959
so i guess i'm thinking about work

322
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,120
projects today because another i'm

323
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,920
thinking of another time that i

324
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,560
was beginning a work project and i was

325
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,519
sending an

326
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,959
email to one of my colleagues about

327
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,880
about the project and i noticed that um

328
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,839
i kept wanting to include some kind of

329
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:30,480
comment

330
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,600
about um

331
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,079
their experience with this and a little

332
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,839
bit derogatory like you know

333
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,519
i know you don't have so much experience

334
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,160
with this or something like that i

335
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,720
i don't know um but i noticed that there

336
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,880
was a slight feeling of tension around

337
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,839
that and i realized that i was kind of

338
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,079
trying to question my colleagues level

339
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,839
experience of experience in order to

340
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,360
elevate my own

341
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,240
and therefore show that you know i was

342
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,680
going to be able to

343
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,680
contribute very well to this project or

344
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,959
something so

345
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,519
but i i caught this you know luckily as

346
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,839
an intention of ill will

347
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,360
and i um instead changed what i wanted

348
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,519
to write to something that was more

349
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,839
inclusive more connecting at the

350
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,320
beginning of this project

351
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,720
not highlighting their lack of

352
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,320
experience or my

353
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,839
experience which was a little bit

354
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,079
delusional to think that way

355
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,399
and i'm certain that that set a much

356
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:29,360
better tone

357
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,600
than if i hadn't done hadn't made that

358
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,959
change

359
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,120
would have changed the relationship

360
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,639
right at the beginning of the project

361
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,000
we can also set the tone

362
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,279
in advance of an experience or a

363
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,440
situation that we're going into

364
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,399
and then just trust that it will carry

365
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:50,639
us

366
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,399
in so for example if we're about to go

367
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,120
into

368
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,440
a meeting or even a social encounter or

369
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
a party of some kind

370
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,160
we can as we're walking toward the door

371
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:04,480
or

372
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,040
sitting in the car before we go in we

373
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,959
can set an intention

374
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,079
of goodwill or of mindfulness

375
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,040
or something like that and just orient

376
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,240
the mind that way

377
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,600
and then you know you don't have to

378
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,199
constantly think about it and bring it

379
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,480
to mind and

380
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,320
be distracted by it during the counter

381
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,680
you just um

382
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,320
you just set it and then walk in and

383
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
trust that it will carry through in some

384
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,040
way

385
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,120
it may not carry you know entirely

386
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,560
through the entire

387
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,680
encounter or it may but

388
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,120
generally this is a good thing to do

389
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,120
with the mind just to orient it well

390
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,240
when you're starting i remember a

391
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,759
friend of mine went to practice in

392
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,959
asia and she was doing

393
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,360
intensive retreat practice but even in

394
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,480
that setting

395
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,360
the abbott of the monastery used to ask

396
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,839
the

397
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,639
people who were practicing there that in

398
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,920
the morning when they

399
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,360
woke up before they got out of bed

400
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,560
to start their day that they spend a few

401
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,360
minutes doing loving-kindness practice

402
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,240
and the way he said it was this will set

403
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,120
the tone

404
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,360
for everything else you do and then you

405
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,639
know the rest of the day they were doing

406
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,800
mindfulness practice vipassana

407
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,839
concentration you know sort of more

408
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,160
traditional

409
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,040
wisdom practices but he wanted them to

410
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,680
do this

411
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,240
loving kindness at the very beginning to

412
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,199
set the tone

413
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,920
for the for the rest of the day so you

414
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,120
might try this also

415
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,360
see what you can remember to do in the

416
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,240
morning

417
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,519
before you get out of bed just to meet

418
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,240
the day well

419
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,000
so in general we're aiming to

420
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,680
act and speak and even think

421
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,959
from a place of non-greed non-hatred

422
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,399
and non-delusion that's the

423
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,279
overall picture and so the three right

424
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,160
intentions

425
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,360
that i just named are

426
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,600
very clearly covering the first two of

427
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,438
non-greed and non-hatred

428
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,240
so renunciation for example would cover

429
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,678
non-greed

430
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,558
and non-ill will and non-cruelty

431
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,918
would cover non-hatred so it encounters

432
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:20,640
those first

433
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,959
two you know clear defilements of the

434
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:23,678
mind

435
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,640
but then we might ask you know where is

436
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,918
non-delusion

437
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,400
in terms of orienting ourselves

438
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,760
sometimes people have

439
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,520
questions about the second step of the

440
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,280
path because it doesn't seem

441
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,679
to include non-grade non-hatred where's

442
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,280
the non-delusion

443
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,039
it turns out that that is covered by

444
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,640
right view by what we talked about first

445
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,840
so um you know having the correct

446
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,480
view that we're moving towards suffering

447
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,160
in the end of suffering

448
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,120
and that our actions have consequences

449
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,559
and we have some choice

450
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,960
that is non-delusion knowing those

451
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,000
things

452
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,360
so this three-fold purity of volition

453
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,520
if you will non-greed non-hatred

454
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,039
non-delusion

455
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,160
is the fundal mental way to begin and

456
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,679
also to proceed and also to end

457
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,360
the buddha says very clearly in a

458
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,720
different suta that

459
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,080
volition or caitanya lies at the heart

460
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,120
of action

461
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,720
of kama so that strongly influences the

462
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,880
results that we experience

463
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,960
so that covers a lot of the territory

464
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,080
but um all of that is kind of the

465
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,120
prep in the mind and so there's also the

466
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,960
actual active beginning

467
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,799
you know what what else do we need to

468
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,160
begin well

469
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,960
the third thing that i area that i named

470
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,559
is that there's something to do with our

471
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,600
energy

472
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,360
as we actually engage with the

473
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,880
beginning of a task and so let's

474
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,600
let's talk also about this area of

475
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,039
energy

476
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,200
the buddha talks about the importance of

477
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,240
generating

478
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,440
wholesome energy or iberia

479
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,080
that's the word for energy or effort as

480
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,000
we undertake a task

481
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,400
so in particular this is a very stock or

482
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,559
standard phrase you'll find in sutas

483
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:16,880
like

484
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,720
it goes like this one generates desire

485
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,240
makes an effort arouses energy applies

486
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,280
one's mind

487
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,960
and strives so

488
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,480
i know that that sometimes sounds a

489
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,080
little too energetic for

490
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,240
those of us in the west who are a little

491
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,200
bit uh

492
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,360
action-oriented and result oriented in

493
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,760
some word we're told not to strive quite

494
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,799
so strongly

495
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,720
but that phrase is very common in the

496
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,320
sutures

497
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,799
one generates desire makes an effort

498
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,000
arouses energy

499
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,039
applies one's mind and strives so we

500
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,960
might just encapsulate all of that into

501
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,679
that middle

502
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,720
phrase arouses energy so that's uh

503
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,160
viria ar rubity that's the polyphrase

504
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,640
and arabity means to

505
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,960
engage with or to undertake in a sense

506
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,000
so we should be willing to put forth

507
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,799
some effort for things to go well as

508
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,200
we're

509
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,000
beginning so we orient our mind and then

510
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,240
we bring forth this kind of wholesome

511
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,600
energy

512
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,640
to get it going in a sense so instead of

513
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,159
being a little bit more passive or

514
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,559
lackluster about how we get started on

515
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,159
things

516
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,120
later when there's momentum then we're

517
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,880
encouraged to back off

518
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,919
and be a little bit more effortless you

519
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,600
might have heard that phrase effortless

520
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,400
effort

521
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,679
and we did that a little bit in the

522
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,600
meditation where at the beginning

523
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,480
we were a little bit more attentive and

524
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:44,960
then

525
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,559
at the end relaxed our effort and just

526
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:49,520
allowed

527
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,320
experience to unfold that's often a good

528
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,760
way to

529
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,480
think about the energy in a project so

530
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,360
wise effort

531
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,720
means the right amount of effort and

532
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,039
that's one aspect of it is to bring the

533
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,720
right amount of effort not too much

534
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,039
and not too little and at the beginning

535
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,960
when we're just starting things out

536
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,880
sometimes for beginnings a fair amount

537
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,640
of effort is needed because we're trying

538
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,280
to

539
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
generate momentum or else change

540
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,720
direction

541
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,520
of momentum that we already had so you

542
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
might think of beginnings as requiring a

543
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,720
little bit more

544
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,840
energy a little bit more focused effort

545
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,840
to get going in a good direction

546
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,320
so

547
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,240
considering beginnings i've been kind of

548
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,840
orienting us around

549
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,039
beginnings in daily life

550
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,039
in particularly also in this bigger

551
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,600
picture of beginning what's going to

552
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,840
happen as things start to open up and

553
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,960
people come into more

554
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,440
contact with each other and maybe we

555
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,320
start

556
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,000
interacting with more people than we

557
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
have been these things would be very

558
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,799
good to keep in mind but actually there

559
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,320
is um

560
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,480
quite a bit about beginnings that

561
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,679
happens on the cushion

562
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,960
too and i also alluded to this in the

563
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,159
meditation

564
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,440
there's a stage of inside practice where

565
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,159
we become

566
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,919
very attuned to beginnings um

567
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,880
i asked you to do it consciously during

568
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,919
the sit but it

569
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,880
there's a time when it just comes

570
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,760
without

571
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,080
needing to be deliberate about it so the

572
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,440
mind um

573
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,919
gets really interested in beginnings

574
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,600
it's a very it's an interesting

575
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,600
fun time of practice because mindfulness

576
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:36,640
gets really sharp

577
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,440
because you're you're catching the first

578
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,760
moment of things it's like oh

579
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,200
you see the the breath come into

580
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,240
being from a moment before when there

581
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,440
wasn't one

582
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,159
and you see uh you know the in-breath

583
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,600
tails off

584
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,200
and then the out breath begins we see

585
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,039
that first moment when there starts to

586
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:57,679
be

587
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,039
uh the air exiting instead of entering

588
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,159
and it's exciting and maybe we see um

589
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:04,799
the first

590
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,960
shift in a mood you know where we're

591
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,280
feeling angry or irritated and but we're

592
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,640
we're don't get caught up in it we're

593
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,600
mindful

594
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,280
and then there comes a moment when it's

595
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,679
like it's like the mind sort of

596
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,360
turns away from that and we feel

597
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,440
something else come in a sense of relief

598
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,240
or

599
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,159
or joy or peace or many other things

600
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,320
we see that first moment we know ah

601
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,840
there's the moment where the anger

602
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,840
turned and we might also see

603
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,760
um the first moment of a thought

604
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,000
you know we're sitting it's not that

605
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,760
there's absolutely zero

606
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,279
thoughts but we're kind of between

607
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,880
thoughts and we're not

608
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,360
really noticing thoughts at that moment

609
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,279
and then we'll see a little spark

610
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,320
like the mind starts to form an idea and

611
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
we see it kind of arising out of the

612
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,960
matrix of the mind this idea

613
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,400
we can see oh that's going to be a

614
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,159
thought in one more instant

615
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,159
it's going to break the surface and i'm

616
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,240
going to know what those words are

617
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,799
and every once in a while one of those

618
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,360
will come

619
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,880
and we'll be mindful of it and it will

620
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,400
just dissipate

621
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,120
before it ever forms into the image or

622
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,159
the word

623
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,480
and we wonder what was that thought

624
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,480
gonna be

625
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,760
you'll never know but it's a fun time of

626
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,480
practice

627
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,840
seeing these beginnings um

628
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,720
there's a lot of wisdom in this to see

629
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,919
and feel

630
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,120
beginnings means that we can also see

631
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,520
and feel the very first moment of

632
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,960
clinging

633
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,559
we were peaceful calm mindful

634
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,480
and then the mind started to

635
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,640
form an identity or attached to

636
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,159
something or hold on no

637
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,960
don't let that go and we see that we see

638
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,480
that little grip and we

639
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,159
can feel that the moment that we begin

640
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,480
to cling is the moment of the arising of

641
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,279
suffering

642
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,520
we see the second noble truth is that

643
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,880
clinging and suffering

644
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,480
are identical and we can only be sure of

645
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:06,880
that

646
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,159
if we see them begin and end together

647
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,120
so it's important and so then we can

648
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,720
start to get wise about

649
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,559
how we engage with beginnings because

650
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,480
stuff is coming every moment

651
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,159
we see if we grasp it we're going to

652
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,799
suffer so we learn not to we learn

653
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,000
to let it arise as it is

654
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,559
to let it be itself as it comes into

655
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,520
being

656
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,960
without grasping it as mine without

657
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,880
putting it in a box so i know what that

658
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,720
is and immediately

659
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,400
labeling it without controlling it

660
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
letting it arise and have its life

661
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,080
whether it's going to be big or small

662
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,120
can we just trust

663
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,400
that it can come into being as it is

664
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,320
so we start to we start to see this and

665
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,799
there's a lot of wisdom that comes from

666
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,000
getting intimate with

667
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,400
beginnings and with how we relate to

668
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,240
beginnings

669
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,320
on the cushion and then that will of

670
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,000
course feed into

671
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,799
how we do it in life also when things

672
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,320
come in that are surprising

673
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,240
as happens all the time our partner we

674
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,360
don't know what her partner is going to

675
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,480
say next

676
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,640
can we meet it can we just let that be

677
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,880
there

678
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,640
we turn the corner and see something

679
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,520
unexpected can we open to that

680
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,799
or do we close off or get scared

681
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,480
or try to control it or try to make it

682
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,000
what we want it to be

683
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,480
we'll see again and again how we're

684
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,919
relating to life

685
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,679
when we start to see on the cushion how

686
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,520
we relate to things coming in

687
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,600
beginnings coming into our mind and our

688
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,960
body

689
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,799
so this is an important area of practice

690
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:46,000
beginnings and as we learn to begin well

691
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,919
and engage in ways that are

692
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,039
open and connecting and

693
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,960
filled with peace good will all those

694
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,880
right intentions

695
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,440
that too will help us learn to end well

696
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,240
to let go

697
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,080
to let things cease to let them end

698
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,679
to not cling so

699
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,799
all of this is feeding into our wisdom

700
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,880
and our compassion so i wish you well

701
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,320
in exploring a very interesting area

702
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,039
and also with whatever is beginning in

703
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,720
your life beginning in

704
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,760
this springtime maybe it's autumn if

705
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,480
you're in the southern hemisphere

706
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,600
beginning with things opening

707
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,159
beginning with seeing more people

708
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,559
whenever that occurs

709
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,480
