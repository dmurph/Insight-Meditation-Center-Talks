1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:08,278
so good morning everyone and welcome can you hear me all

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:16,000
right so this morning I'd like to talk about a

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,920
very important kind of concept in mindfulness in general and and give a

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,199
kind of a Buddhist take on it and that is the difference between uh

5
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,760
stimulus and response and uh people teach mindfulness often

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,200
emphasize this distinction and that um and and so I

7
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,440
will as well with um emphasizing the wonderful opportunities that are

8
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,079
available in really knowing how to identify this distinction

9
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:57,760
and and kind of in what's in between the stimulus and the

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,040
response and in the process this discover something about equinity there an angle to understand

11
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:11,720
equinity and how to have it so as as I understand it the usual

12
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:18,600
teachings on stimulus and response is that response is different than a

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,240
reaction and uh a reaction is something that happens kind of as a habit kind of

14
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:31,560
an automatic pilot there's a stimulus and then without even any reflection any

15
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:39,200
consideration there's automatically um a some kind of um activity we do it's

16
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,479
called reactivity meaning activity that's in response to something with

17
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:50,200
acting so uh so that could be we say something that we later regret it just

18
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:57,439
came out of us like that it could be an expression of an emotional expression that comes out of us so quickly that

19
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:04,560
again maybe later we regret it and um it could be that it's a um

20
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,480
something that um in activity we do we you know we do something we do do

21
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:22,800
impulsively with our actions we push send on our computer uh when we had U we

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,040
saw that there was this lovely thing to buy and the fact that we don't have

23
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,440
enough money in the bank account for that doesn't matter just you know this is this is going to be the solution to

24
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,599
my and the world's problems and so you know it's a kind of automatic pilot and working on habit

25
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:49,000
addictions are often this way and um and sometimes the reactivity

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,560
is within ourselves that we our mind um reacts in such a way that we create an

27
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,760
interpretation a further thoughts further judgments further bias comes

28
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,959
into play um and so in the mind might spin out in stories and ideas and create

29
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:13,280
universes of interpretations that happen very quickly in Rapid succession and we

30
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,840
don't sometimes it can be so quickly we don't really even see the all little steps that go in go into this creation

31
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:27,159
of interpretations ideas and all that when I was in um practicing in

32
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:32,439
Burma uh I've been practicing on retreat for some time and there was this very

33
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:38,879
simple uh little experience that I had that was a big aha for me and that is

34
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,319
that um when I went into the the meditation

35
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,159
teachers uh Little House cabin that he had for my practice discussions with him

36
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,159
and meetings with him uh I had to pass go through the front door and on just on

37
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:02,599
the on the right going in there was kind of an Al Cove that was filled with Buddhas and stuff you know it wasn't

38
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:09,239
actually an altar to bow at or something it was just like I don't know why it just it kept a lot of look like Buddhist

39
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:15,560
kind of things there statues and stuff and so for you know many days I

40
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,199
just walked right by and gave it almost no thought at all and so I was been

41
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:29,880
practicing for I think a few months by that times my mind was very quiet very still mindfulness was very strong and um

42
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,560
and I walked in and I looked to my right and as far as I could tell I think there

43
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,680
was a new Buddha there I saw it as a

44
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,800
Buddha I saw as a very distinct movement of the mind that it was really Pleasant

45
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,000
to look at okay and then I saw as a distinct kind

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,880
of event in of itself I want it

47
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:09,039
and in the past uh maybe the I wanted would have happened so quickly that it

48
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,080
had Authority it had meaning it had like this was the way the universe should be or something I never gave in any thought

49
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,880
I just like that was suddenly there but to watch the sequence of recognizing

50
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,560
what it was and then having sense the experience of it being Pleasant and really what I

51
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:32,600
could see what I want was more of that Pleasant more than I wanted the Buddha

52
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:39,160
statue and um and so then I um I um I

53
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,199
said wow it's possible to have this freedom in this sequence it's possible

54
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:52,440
to see the uh stimulus reaction stimulus response so clearly that I didn't have

55
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,520
to respond I didn't have to act so usually in the stimulus response distinction the way I like to think of

56
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:05,840
it the one hand there's reactive responses and the other there's considered response there's wise

57
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,840
response and so the idea is there in that Buddha I just my response was

58
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,080
wow and I just left it and I didn't think about it again for

59
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,599
a long time and until I discovered that uh someone

60
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:29,400
had actually bought it for me and and uh and I'd left it there for

61
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,560
that Abit to bless or do something and um so then many months later was handed

62
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:41,479
to me I didn't say anything to anybody about this little event so I have it at home

63
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,759
now and um so um in the way that this funny way

64
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:59,280
the world works so uh so so mindfulness has a lot to do with

65
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:06,199
uh adding the pause between stimulus and reaction between stimulus and response

66
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:12,039
so if all you do is something happens say that it's it's something as

67
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:17,160
simple as your what happens is you breathe

68
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:22,199
in and maybe the inhale is

69
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:28,879
unpleasant and I've had an unpleasant breath and immediately had a judgment

70
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:36,599
about it so automatic this is the wrong breath I'm a bad meditator it shouldn't be this way and there's a whole Cascade

71
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:42,039
of these automatic pilot kind of thoughts which are kind of a drag to

72
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:48,199
have but I can be so caught in their mesmerizing

73
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:54,560
enchanting you know truth of these kinds of you know judgments that I don't even

74
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,680
feel that it's unpleasant but it's actually not unpleasant but it's continues to have

75
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,560
each of those steps and judgments uh is just kind of draining kind of little bit

76
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,879
kind of impactful in a negative way on me it's unpleasant to kind of experience each

77
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:19,840
step and um and so it just Mak it simple as as uh you know an unpleasant

78
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:30,280
breath alternative is to feel the unpleasantness of that breath and take time to be mindful of it

79
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,880
give everything time it could just be two seconds in mindfulness practice we

80
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,000
give everything time we give everything a chance to be there before the

81
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,920
reactivity before the Judgment so so I would we would train ourselves we would

82
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:52,880
develop the capacity to feel the unpleasant breath and really feel it

83
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:58,839
take okay this is an unpleasant breath let me just feel it before I judge it

84
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:07,760
let me feel feel it before I'm pushing it away before I'm trying to fix the problem so feel it or let me observe it

85
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,200
let me just observe what it's like to have an unpleasant breath and maybe because it comes and goes so quickly uh

86
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,200
that pause is extended where maybe for the next 10 inhales I keep looking at

87
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:27,440
what what is this like what is it like to have an unpleasant breath and become the world expert in tense breaths of

88
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,560
what my unpleasant breath is like I discover things about it I discover where it's unpleasant in my body I

89
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,000
discover maybe where there's a holding in my breathing and tension uh I might understand there's an underlying fear

90
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,040
that's operating that's part of that that holding I start discovering so much

91
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:53,240
by taking time to know it to observe it be with it and

92
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:59,880
um and then I can decide wisely what's my response to this and one respon I

93
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:06,440
have to noticing I have an unpleasant in in breath is I think of it you know it's

94
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,640
just a massage I'm just massaging the unpleasant I'm just massaging the place

95
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,000
where I'm feel held in my breath where it's tensed tight and um I'm little bit

96
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,160
contracted or up my chest it's just a massage let's just hang out let's just

97
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:28,760
let it be there let's not fix it or do anything about it I'll just every inhale I'll feel where the tension is where the

98
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:35,720
holding is and my inhale again and again and again and I found that this is

99
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:43,519
really a wonderful thing to do to not make it a problem but just to kind of meet it be with it care for it this way

100
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:51,440
um and to allow something inside to unfold relax unravel on its own

101
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,519
rather than me having to be the doer and sometimes the reactivity that I

102
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:04,720
have like just something as simple as the unpleasant breath is I'm I I'm operating kind of in

103
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,200
this automatic pilot that I'm the one who has to take care of everything I'm

104
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,800
the one who I'm the victim of everything and I'm the one who has to address everything every moment in my

105
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,079
life but I've learned slowly that I don't have to do that it's kind of a lot

106
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,839
of work to do that every moment of your life and it's good to kind of take a

107
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,920
vacation and uh and mindfulness meditation is a time for a vacation from

108
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:39,040
being the one who's in charge or thinks they're in charge of every moment of your life like you're the victim you're

109
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,240
the person experiencing things you're the person has to do things and fix things and make something happen and

110
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,279
prove yourself and have a good experience to show your neighbors look I

111
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,639
had a good experience in meditation I went on Retreat and boy did I have a good experience some people are

112
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,240
experienced collectors just just you know all these

113
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,839
things so so as we pause take time to be with

114
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:12,800
something uh it just nice in itself it makes room so the reactivity doesn't

115
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:20,600
ride so close to the stimulus and in that time there's time to discover something that's going on

116
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:27,680
find out deeper what's happening what's going on one of the things we might discover is the nature of the

117
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:34,760
reactivity so it might be it takes a while to discover that it's unpleasant

118
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,279
breathing and um and there's a second unpleasant thing that happens and that

119
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:48,639
is the idea that it's wrong to have it happen the reaction of this is like

120
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:55,000
California Buddhist California where there's so many Buddhists then to have it but good

121
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,120
breath looks looks like deep really

122
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,519
relaxed and shouldn't be controlled there should be no tightness and you know this is some an embarrassment to

123
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:12,480
Buddhist Buddhists everywhere and so so I'm right so I have

124
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,880
this unpleasant breath and the reactivity immediately in my mind is these kinds of judgments these kinds of

125
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:26,440
ideas so then the choice is let's take time with that pause let's hang out with

126
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:33,560
that let me see that operating let me feel what it's like to have those thoughts those judgments let me see them

127
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:38,720
operating let me see them Bubble Up and and maybe they maybe they're constant

128
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,639
but chances are they're not constant they might look constant chances are I

129
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:53,040
me they're happening for a while and then I'm thinking about lunch or I'm happening for a while and then I feel my

130
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,759
exhale which also is not right and so then I have different

131
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:04,160
thoughts about that and uh and so but after a while I

132
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:11,880
just see wow that's a judgment it takes a while to just see a judgment as a judgment and as I see

133
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,199
judgment as a judgment I no longer believe it automatically I no longer

134
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:24,240
think I I don't have to live under the Yoke of that judgment I don't have to invest so much importance in it let me

135
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,560
just let it float up maybe it needs time maybe needs to

136
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:37,360
maybe it's lonely and needs to be seen so let let it just float up that judgment come and go see it and I'm

137
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,959
leaving it alone and then slowly maybe that relaxes maybe slowly I see something

138
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:50,360
about that judgment maybe I see that that judgment uh comes comes from some kind of beliefs

139
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:56,279
that I have maybe so that judgment comes with a certain kind of

140
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:02,880
uh self- understanding that I'm carrying with myself but how I'm supposed to be in the world I'm supposed to be a

141
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,279
perfect Buddhist whatever that is and so there's a whole universe of

142
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:13,959
things that start being discovered in that pause in the taking time with

143
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:19,839
things and um and so mindfulness is the

144
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,000
practice of pausing not necessarily in the

145
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:33,040
activities you're doing if you're going about your da life but something inside of you giving yourself a little bit of

146
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:39,759
time to know to feel to observe what's actually happening without laying over

147
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:45,880
on top of it judgments reactions wanting it to be different fixing it just let's

148
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:52,360
get to know it let's be with it so just that it helps with equinity

149
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:59,000
just that allows you to not be equinity is the ability to be present without

150
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:06,120
being on automatic reactivity automatically kind of getting worked up and and and but just kind of have a

151
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:12,639
steadiness okay let's just be with this without getting caught in the

152
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:19,759
reactivity and um so I mentioned two things that are important I think one is

153
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:26,079
that we start seeing what's happening more clearly the second is we come to a place

154
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:32,680
where we can choose how to respond one of the responses is to choose to be

155
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:38,680
mindful of it rather than being reactive let's take time with it let's get to

156
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,959
know this let's get let's investigate this let's discover this

157
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:49,800
further so this is all very nice and uh it can make for much wiser life it can

158
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:56,839
make for much w a life that we really start understanding yourselves more and more deeply and one of the things I've seen

159
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:03,519
of people who do a lot of mindfulness meditation mindfulness practice they grow in self- understanding because they

160
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:10,160
start seeing how these things operate the operating systems and the more we can see and understand the less likely

161
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:17,120
we are to be working on automatic pilot more likely we we're able to kind of step

162
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:25,079
back and have more choice on what we act on and so Freedom has a lot to do with

163
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:33,200
having choice and so we're giving ourselves Choice by pausing and knowing and recognizing what's happening

164
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,360
inside and then there's a opportunity for wisdom to make wiser choices of how

165
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:47,160
to live and maybe this example of breathing unpleasant in breath is

166
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:54,400
so such a minute mundane silly kind of example but what i cho I chose it for

167
00:17:54,400 --> 00:18:01,000
that because it is a very small ordinary everyday kind of thing you most of you are breathing in all the time

168
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,360
regularly and so it's an ordinary thing but even right there there can be um uh

169
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:15,120
a developing growing the capacity to have this mindful pause mindful take

170
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:20,960
time to really know something and feel something but let alone when you're

171
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:28,840
driving uh driving is thing we're in the freeway is that not a few people have reactivity to what happens around you

172
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:34,520
some people are driving reactively because they've already

173
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:42,320
gotten in this mode have to hurry have to get somewhere they're already upset with everyone else and so the the very

174
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:49,600
way of driving is driving tense and so they're already kind of ahead of themselves by this force of

175
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,400
some reactive decision that they have and so even there we can say wait a

176
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,720
minute I'm tense I found it fascinating to watch

177
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:10,360
sometimes my right foot waiting for the red light to turn

178
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,240
green my right foot I I blame my

179
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:23,559
foot it has this kind of like Restless energy like you know let's

180
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:29,320
go judging my foot and blaming my foot is just one more way in which we don't

181
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:38,080
stop and look more deeply because it's not the foot there's something deeper in me that's that's gotten attached to or

182
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,760
afraid or eager or ambitious to get go somewhere need to get someplace quickly

183
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:50,200
so I'm living in the reactive mode and most people are doing that much of the

184
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,880
time what mindfulness does it gives us time to pause long enough that we can

185
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:02,960
think we can consider and we can see where there's Choice and then we can hopefully Choose

186
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,039
Wisely because we know something different so this is all fine and good

187
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:17,600
maybe this is kind of ordinary teachings on stimulus response but there's another

188
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,679
possibility that this allows and that is in that

189
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:31,039
space between stimulus and reaction and and even a a growing

190
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:37,799
possibility of a space between stimulus and response where we leave things

191
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:43,600
alone there's the opportunity for something to settle inside of us it's

192
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,919
opportunity to some begin to feel something deeper about ourselves that

193
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:57,080
arises from some depth inside that reactivity does not exactly where reactivity comes from

194
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:04,880
inside of us as may be different people experience it more differently uh I often think of it as

195
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:10,440
being kind of surface reactions sometimes it's from the neck up it has a

196
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:17,120
lot to do with goes on the mind and thoughts and ideas sometimes I think of it it has to do with the muscles

197
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:23,880
muscular system of who we are where reactivity is like want that get that push away that make something happen in

198
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:31,799
the world and um and so it's kind of more the surface and when reactivity is

199
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:38,200
strong it uh blocks our awareness of something deeper if we're constantly

200
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:44,640
living in reactive thoughts constantly living in a swirl of of thoughts and concerns and fears and angers and

201
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:52,960
resentments and betrayals and all this kind of world it it kind of

202
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,039
fills the attention so there's no space in the attention to

203
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:06,440
feel or sense something that's deeper that's Shyer that's not screaming for

204
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:13,320
attention so this opportunity to have a space between stimulus response allows

205
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:19,360
for some deeper connection to ourselves where in

206
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:26,679
Buddhism Buddhist teachings is the is the location out of which wisdom

207
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:32,919
comes it's location out of which Love Comes it's a

208
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:39,760
location out of which peace comes it's a location where a sense of well deep

209
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:47,320
well-being that's very nourishing can course through us coming from some deeper Place rather than these what I

210
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:55,080
call surface kind of places that and it takes time to settle in to relax some of

211
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:03,000
it has to do with relaxing the tensions we carrying in their muscle the tensions we have in our body I would

212
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:11,440
propose are all products of the reactive mind and the more tense we are the less

213
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,440
we can feel that which is below the tension Les we because or less we feel

214
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,919
how those muscles feel when there's no tension in them they might be totness in

215
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:29,000
them sometimes but there's no contraction no tightness they're not held in place

216
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:34,840
and the muscles then can start being part of a system of nourishment of

217
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,480
feeling nourished feeling goodness feeling warmth feeling kind of like the

218
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:46,520
these deeper wells Springs arise from within that feel like they're feeding us

219
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:52,640
supporting us in these good ways and this is one of the Miracles I

220
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:58,679
think of mindfulness is that that mindfulness makes room for some deep

221
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:06,440
sense of being alive to Bubble Up Inside that uh feels like just to be alive is

222
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:13,559
enough that feels like this is deeply satisfying in a way that a life of

223
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:19,960
Desire life of fixing it life of getting ahead a life of conceit life of trying

224
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,360
to prove oneself or get ahead or get behind or whatever we trying to

225
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:32,320
do it will never do for us because it those kinds of ways all too easily uh

226
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,760
are like uh are are um are never going to be

227
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:43,279
satisfying if we live always wanting something if that's the habit of

228
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:48,880
mind we can get something but the Habit is still there

229
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,840
as soon as we get it we want the next thing we want the next thing they want the next thing and it's kind of like

230
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:02,559
what I discovered sometimes if I stay too much surfing the web I'm just I'm minding my own business

231
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,440
kind of reading a few websites you know I'm

232
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:13,240
innocent but I've clicked on enough clicks that I can feel that now there's

233
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:20,159
a kind of a drive a desire and urge to click for the next thing I don't even know what the next thing is but there's

234
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:29,919
kind of an automatic kind of Wan thing to do do do so so it can be so even if we succeed

235
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:36,279
sometimes it can still be unsatisfying uh to build up uh to be

236
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:43,320
preoccupied with uh conceit is one of those things that limits this deeper

237
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:50,159
place inside that can well up that can't well up if we're somehow caught in the world of self-

238
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:56,159
preoccupation so this stimulus response allows for this upwelling of something

239
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,279
which I feel you can't really appropriate as your

240
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:08,279
own I mean it's not not anybody else's but the very movement this is who

241
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:14,000
I am you know let me show you who I am um that doesn't work because that is

242
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,600
this kind of uh suffocating or this tightening up or covering over of

243
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:27,480
something which doesn't really lend itself to being claimed as mine it's not anybody else's but you can

244
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:35,520
go along with you can be supported by it you can be guided by it you can choose to feel it and know it and tend

245
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:42,679
to it you can choose to know it and study it find out when it's wise maybe when it

246
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:49,720
doesn't seem wise when it's appropriate when it's useful so the stimulus response

247
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:56,399
distinction when it's really lived out in practice when mindfulness allows for

248
00:26:56,399 --> 00:27:04,279
these longer pauses before even a response something really precious can

249
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:11,919
happen and that's one of the things that can happen in meditation for example and one of the great values of

250
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:17,600
meditation is that in uh in the minutes that you're meditating it's one of those

251
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,200
few times in life when

252
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,840
hopefully you don't have to say anything to anyone

253
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:36,760
you don't have to decide what to buy you don't have to move your body decide that

254
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:44,279
you know you don't have to there's so many things you don't have to do you don't have to you know plan your

255
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:49,320
menu for your meals for the next month you don't have to solve The World's

256
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:56,519
problems you you just have to be there and uh and then and all that that

257
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:02,399
allows you the option to let the gap between stimulus and

258
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:08,080
response be forever and what that means we trust

259
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:14,000
just being mindful of what's Happening pausing and knowing it without needing to

260
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,679
respond so if I have my uncomfortable in breath um I would just feel the

261
00:28:20,679 --> 00:28:27,120
uncomfortable INB breath that's all I need to do if there is a thought this is a bad

262
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,519
in breath this is the wrong in breath I just can see let because

263
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:40,600
sometimes these reactions are some of these automatic parel things can just happen on their own anyway but I can just see that

264
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,399
oh and with time that ability to have this extended pause doesn't necessarily

265
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:53,159
stop some of the automatic ways in which the Mind might react to things but it takes the

266
00:28:53,159 --> 00:29:00,679
power out of it the strength out of it it's just like it just this thought bubbling up oh this is a bad breath this

267
00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:07,399
is a bad in breath just a it just like you know it has as much substance as a

268
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:14,159
hologram or something it doesn't really exist it just kind of comes and goes it's a cloud that comes and goes and

269
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:21,600
empty sky and uh and it feels like I don't have to get involved in it or do anything with it I just have this long

270
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,399
pause in which whatever happens inside of me uh doesn't require any response

271
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:35,600
doesn't require any judgments and has to be any different just let everything be liberated from

272
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,799
myself we free everything that happens within us from our reactivity our

273
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:46,320
judgments or what has to happen doesn't happen we just there if any but if there

274
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,440
is Choice it might be the choice of how to continue being mindful how to

275
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,120
continue to be aware to feel to sense what's happening as opposed to making an

276
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:05,720
anything happen fix anything without thinking about things and analyzing things just being present

277
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:11,159
just being there so meditation is a time to learn that and the more we can extend

278
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:16,919
that time the more there's a possibility to start feeling something deeper inside

279
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:23,360
show itself there's a deeper relaxation deeper calm deeper um subtleness that

280
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,480
happens that that brings us to a place that's below or

281
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,120
or very different from the place of reactivity the place of

282
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:40,679
automatic pilot that many people are living in Buddhism they glorify this

283
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:48,039
kind of way of being by calling it uh being awake uh and the other way they

284
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:53,519
sometimes call being asleep even though PE reactive people sometimes are hyper

285
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:59,240
awake hyper alert you know but you're not really they're not really here and

286
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:04,360
present for our life in a full embodied clear

287
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:11,039
way and uh it's a world of difference to live a life that comes

288
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:18,600
from this deeper response inside which is not the response of Me

289
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:23,639
Myself and mine there's this deep Wellspring inside

290
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:29,639
that can respond to the world that is not planned not thought out not

291
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:35,000
connected to our usual understanding of who I am not connected to our fears and our

292
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,799
Ambitions we have layers and layers of wise responses that can Bubble Up from

293
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:51,519
inside that can uh help us find our way a through this world that it helps us be

294
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:59,399
equanimous because we start seeing that the alternative to that

295
00:31:59,399 --> 00:32:06,559
is not so desirable the alternative to this resting or being with or connected to

296
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:13,080
this deeper Wellspring inside uh diminishes us it Narrows us it

297
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:20,279
brings tension to us it brings tightness it brings suffering to us agitation to

298
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:27,679
us and and probably not a very good basis for wise choices about how to live

299
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:34,080
this life but this but if we settled in this deeper place a place where it's almost

300
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,519
as if we're not the one responding but it's wisdom that's responding chances

301
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:47,360
are we make will make much better choices for how to go through our life and it'll feel much more much more

302
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:54,880
have much more Integrity to it much more sense of being connected something more holistic within us than we can ever do

303
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:02,519
from the surface reactions that we have so to end this talk with

304
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:08,200
the uh you know to again to say this there's this very important distinction

305
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:15,279
between stimulus and response and what we're doing in mindfulness at least in mind meditation

306
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:22,159
is letting that gap between stimulus and response become longer how long it is depends what

307
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:28,440
you're doing if you're driving in the freeway probably shouldn't be very long

308
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:36,559
but if you're sitting in meditation maybe you know that you can actually give a lot of time and that g

309
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:42,919
the advantage of that is then you discover more about the depths of you who you are that you can't if you're

310
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:50,840
always responding even if you think it's wise so those are my thoughts for today

311
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,480
and now it's your turn to

312
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,919
respond how would you like to respond respond do you have any questions or comments

313
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:22,079
or on now right okay so as usual you've been a fly on the wall in my house and

314
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:29,358
of delivering just what I need to hear I don't know how you do that um

315
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,878
because we're we're all in certain certain ways we're kind of the same yeah

316
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:40,839
we so much so so much of how we our minds operate is a lot of but I so much

317
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:44,879
want to be unique

318
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:52,760
um so H how does this work in a

319
00:34:52,760 --> 00:35:01,240
conversation because when I get triggered or reactive it's often when I'm talking to somebody else and I was

320
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:09,320
trying to imagine how to pause without looking like like I was uh not

321
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:15,599
understanding had gone to sleep rude whatever I just couldn't imagine how this works in a in a conversation

322
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:22,400
because that tends to be where I am frequently triggered I I see seems like an

323
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:29,640
important issue I think I'll have to think about that for a moment

324
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:38,720
[Laughter] let's could could you say that

325
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,359
again you know I'm a shrink we're always saying to people tell me more about that

326
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:50,599
but I'm not talking about those kinds of conversations no no I mean yes so maybe

327
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:58,079
for you there the danger for you is you start sounding like a shrink but uh but there are ways days of

328
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:05,480
slowing a conversation down that uh people don't feel like you're going slow and it's probably you know just just

329
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,800
just say even just a nod and say oh yes um and people will allow you a few

330
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:17,440
seconds and you can ask you know can I can I can I pause for a minute um and

331
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,000
then if you can't if you have to respond with something right away I don't know you say

332
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:31,119
something inconsequential so you have a chance to somehow your system to process

333
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:41,200
it okay I'll try I'll put in a plug for a mindfulness

334
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:48,000
teacher uh named orang Sofer um he wrote a book called say what you mean and he

335
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,400
has a couple of classes uh that you can do asynchronously but you can get a

336
00:36:53,400 --> 00:37:01,240
partner and practice the bringing the mindfulness the non-violent communication and things like that into

337
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:06,640
your conversations so great yeah so Orin Sofer is great what he does he's made a

338
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:13,960
real specialty of mindful speaking and um and probably one of the things that's been most it's very hard

339
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:21,960
to to practice mindfulness and speaking so that I think it's often very diff you know it's a difficult place and uh so I

340
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:27,599
don't want to give the impression that it's easy but the probably the one thing that's

341
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,800
been most important for me in learning to do it is to stay connected to my body

342
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,000
mindfulness of the body the uh just feel feel the impact it has in my body feel

343
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,960
the impact it has um in my emotional life my emotional body and give time to

344
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:50,839
really know that because um to speak without being in touch with myself is

345
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:58,280
often not so useful so a kind of thing General thing of how i' like to live my life is to

346
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:05,200
have 50 if I'm a conversation with people is to have about 50% of my attention on what the person's saying my

347
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:12,920
partner in conversation and 50% on myself and uh and uh I've learned that

348
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:19,520
if I have a 100% attention to the other person without tracking what's going for me I don't really listen that well or

349
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,040
I'm listening for sure but um I'm not processing it because I don't see what

350
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:33,319
my reactions are my emotions we I don't see the filter through which it's going and um and if I have 100% of

351
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:40,200
myself um which is happens more often I like to admit like I have you know someone's

352
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:46,800
talking and my mind goes off into thought then I I'm no longer have to say to can you repeat that please because I

353
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:53,200
wasn't tracking but the idea 50/50 to really be there and then to also to feel

354
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:58,520
my body to my emotional body to see what thoughts arise the belief Bel arises to

355
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:05,280
ATT track both at the same more or less at the same time I think has been invaluable for living a wise life so

356
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,720
this 5050 guideline I also want to share something

357
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:18,760
briefly my uh I taught a 4-week mindfulness course online as part of a

358
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:24,560
program and my cousin uh lives in Boston and drives for ride shares and was

359
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,599
saying he was struggling with get getting angry and reactive and driving

360
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:37,240
and so he was practicing some of these type of um mindfulness of of that and

361
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:42,720
non-reactivity and uh he said it was really great and that he saved a lot of

362
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,800
gas money

363
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:53,880
also I've got a yes uh Gil during your talk um I found

364
00:39:53,880 --> 00:40:00,800
myself remembering I cannot count how many times in the past I've um um in

365
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:08,720
conversation with other people when I feel like I've been at my best and when I feel like I I haven't been and um uh

366
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:16,040
and the ones the times when I haven't been I find myself going over and over and over those occasions so I how could

367
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:23,720
I have said that better or or been more um you know um more like an a mountain

368
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:29,200
posee instead of Leaning forward you speak a little louder you begin to f away oh

369
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:34,240
um thinking over and over again how how I could have uh said things better

370
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:40,720
instead of uh leaning forward or leaning back uh we're getting some feedback so

371
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:48,119
um and so uh but the one thing I want to say is when I've been at my best I'm a

372
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:54,720
lot happier and when I haven't been at my best you know I'm just not happy so

373
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:01,640
so maybe recognizing that kind of happiness will be is my um um my

374
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:07,640
teaching moment on on on how to be yeah it sounds great and uh mindfulness

375
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:13,599
practice has a tremendously important role for when you're at your best and

376
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:18,920
when you're at your worst both both are great times for

377
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:27,599
mindfulness okay thank you thank you and everything in between

378
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:41,560
so is this on can you hear me okay um so I find sometimes uh I get very reactive

379
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:50,920
as you say in daily life when you're interacting with people and when I sit I I don't feel anything and or there's

380
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:57,720
this big ball of stuff you know and I can't figure out what the under lying

381
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:05,440
thing is and you're probably going to just tell me to keep sitting with [Laughter]

382
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:11,960
it or not you know what you're raising is a

383
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:18,079
very important topic and it probably deserves more attention more

384
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:25,520
understanding than uh it's appropriate for me to give an appropriate response and uh you know to

385
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,800
say something that quickly just sit more seems to you know premature without

386
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:39,240
understanding a lot more what's going on for you but um generally uh the the kind of

387
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:46,119
generic kind of one generic kind of way of responding is that whatever it is including the big sitting quietly and

388
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:51,520
you nothing's happening the reactivity is not there but a big kind of swirl of something

389
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:57,800
Amorphis is um uh maybe there's something there for you to discover

390
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:04,559
so to bring a deeper attention to that or what's happening there and and it might be that if you feel your way into

391
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:11,440
the emotions that are present that that might be a doorway to understand something deeper about

392
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,640
you thank

393
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:27,640
you Gil thank you so much uh for this beautiful invitation and remind

394
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:34,599
Remer um I'm struck by how many times um

395
00:43:34,599 --> 00:43:43,000
I have heard or I have offered a teaching like this to um to sit with

396
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:50,559
reactivity to notice it to invite the opportunity for response and yet this

397
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:58,440
morning felt like so fresh like the very first time I'd ever heard this and um I

398
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:08,318
just I wanted to to say how beautiful that was and and to thank you so much great that's nice to hear nice thank

399
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:14,640
you thank you for that talk and I just have a question

400
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:21,040
um how so sometimes when when I recognize a

401
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:26,520
reaction uh emotion especially like anger for example I can sit with it and

402
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:34,079
and and and try to try to just be with it um sometimes it

403
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,920
becomes a rumination a what sometimes it becomes a rumination rumination yes so

404
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:48,119
how can what what kind of what suggestion do you have to to um to avoid

405
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:55,200
you know to to to be able to sit with the different reactions emotions but not turn it into a

406
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:02,200
rumination yeah so it's a uh I might not be responding to you in the way that you

407
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:07,400
asked the question or what you're hoping to hear but I was struck by your use of

408
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:13,720
the word rumination to me that's a very significant word it's what cows

409
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:20,400
do and for you to for you to identify it as rumination means that you have a

410
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:26,680
certain Insight you have some you have some clarity or some wisdom about the particular kind of particular kind of

411
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:34,880
thinking that you call rumination what is the wisdom what is the benefit of seeing it as

412
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,400
rumination because you seem to identify that's what it is so what benefit comes

413
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:47,040
from having that kind of clarity I'm going to have to think about

414
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:54,119
that one but but the futility is one of the things that came up one of the I think

415
00:45:54,119 --> 00:46:00,599
futility is one of the response that came up first ah so I I'll leave that for you to discover but I want to I want

416
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:05,960
to say that for you to have enough under self understanding to recognize it as

417
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:15,400
rumination you're seeing it as seeing that way of thinking is not not useful for you fule maybe even and um and

418
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:22,280
that's beginning of wisdom that's actually a good sign that you're seeing it that way if it's in fact not useful

419
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:28,160
for you and um and maybe to appreciate yourself

420
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:34,559
rather than focusing on the rumination as being the problem it is something to address and to learn about but begin to

421
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:40,960
appreciating yourself as the one who's now beginning to be mindful of it and beginning to kind of separate yourself

422
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:49,240
from it a little bit and beginning to see it and maybe we want to emphasize that movement in you rather than trying

423
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:55,920
to deal with the rumination which is what people want to do means you're still caught in it but just let's

424
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,200
appreciate for have you appreciate what's beginning to happen to you the

425
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:08,359
very fact that you can recognize it as rumination and recognize that you do it a lot and recognize that you're caught

426
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:14,079
in it you're beginning to separate out and becoming freeer let's emphasize that

427
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:20,760
movement so you begin feeling what that's like for you and do more of it and more of it and the day will

428
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:27,800
come two things will happen maybe can happen one is this the movement of

429
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:37,040
freedom of awareness the mind this this Clarity the freedom of mindfulness of rumination is so strong it's more

430
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,559
dominant more living thing in the moment than the

431
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:48,720
rumination and you in a sense you more you're living in the awareness now more than living in the rumination and that

432
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:53,880
feels good the other is if you use the metaphor of the hand for this movement

433
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:00,079
of you know first you were caught and then then you started to become a little bit separate separate until you were

434
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:05,880
free of it in a sense at some point you can go like

435
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:14,200
this and take that ruminating mind and just hold it gently and see what happens and maybe

436
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:20,079
then it begins to relax thank

437
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:25,880
you great so it's time to stop and I'm happy to stay up here and if you want to

438
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:32,319
come up and um if you're willing you uh it's you know you don't have to do this

439
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:37,520
but if you want to say hello to someone next to you that would be nice before you leave some people might be new here

440
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:45,078
today and uh and then you know but thank you for being here
