1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,080
so good evening everyone and welcome to imc those of you here and

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,400
those of you online welcome and

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,880
i hope it was nice for you to sit for the 45 minutes in quiet

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,519
that's how we used to do it here on monday nights for years for 30 over 30 years but then with

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,800
pandemic when you started doing online we started doing the guided meditations

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,680
and when i sat down to meditate i thought it was so nice and quiet in here they wouldn't disturb it with

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,840
words so um

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,320
i don't feel like i have a lot to say today but what i have to say i think is

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:59,839
important so we'll see where it goes maybe we'll have some discussion

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,880
and that is um let's start with uh there's a very famous story

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:14,240
or in a story exactly but a teaching from the time monk meditation teacher

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:21,119
named ajahn chah teacher of many people here in the west and he said something like

13
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,520
if you get let go a little you'll have a little peace if you let go of middling you'll have a

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,759
middling peace and if you let go a lot you'll have a lot of peace

15
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:40,000
and so the emphasis is on letting go and many people that do associate buddhism in buddhist practice with

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,479
letting go and there's a lot of wonderful words associated with associated words like

17
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,880
there's relinquishment some people sometimes talk about renunciation

18
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:59,119
and uh the um what's interesting if you look at the

19
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,799
teachings of the buddha about relinquishment or letting go

20
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,160
it generally not about relinquishing anything

21
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,400
but rather it's relinquishing the grip the holding

22
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,959
so it's re-releasing the clinging we're not necessarily releasing or letting go of the things of

23
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:28,959
our life now so some of us might be doing things which are unhealthy

24
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,440
and uh it's good to let go of things which are unhealthy unethical and wise

25
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,760
but for the buddha they i think he was just so assuming people were doing this practice or living an ethical

26
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,239
life and so their focus was letting just letting go of the clinging the grasping

27
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:55,920
and and so i'm about to say next is one of the reasons i wanted this the thing i almost wanted to emphasize

28
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,000
um it's possible to hold on to something tight

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,800
hold on to it so this if you hold on tight it might be useful in the wind to hold on to your umbrella tight

30
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,080
but but if you do it all the time even when it's not windy

31
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,480
and you have really attached that umbrella eventually your hands might get all knotted up or

32
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,159
start cramping up or you know you can't do a lot of other things with your hand

33
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:33,200
so it's nice to not be attached to umbrellas and put them down when it's not raining and leave them at home

34
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,280
and so we learn to let go or release though we're not holding on so much anymore

35
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,599
but there's uh in english we can say that

36
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,040
if you hold once you're not holding on anymore it doesn't mean that you've dropped

37
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:57,599
something no longer have it it can mean you still can hold it

38
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:04,080
without holding on you can have your open open hand open

39
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:12,400
and you can hold something freely and openly in the hand and that's a world of difference

40
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:19,199
you don't have to let go of something give it up but can you hold it lightly

41
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:25,280
loosely not you know just just holding it burying it

42
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,720
this way with an open hand so if you were holding on to a little bird

43
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,759
it would probably fly away that's what birds do but

44
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:42,320
if i'm holding on to the striker you know it's not going to fly away

45
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:47,919
but maybe you have one of you has a really good use for this and asks me for it

46
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,960
it's really easy then it's almost like this is holding it this way is almost like an offering here

47
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,479
take it holding it like this it's almost like a fist

48
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:05,360
that makes a very different impression so what i'm proposing is that

49
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,000
we can learn to let go of the grip and then hold the things in our life the

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,759
people in our life loosely lightly

51
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,120
without any restrictions on anything about holding tight to anything

52
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,800
and then things will take their course things will unfold it's a bird it'll fly

53
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,560
away if someone wants a striker maybe you're ready to give it

54
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,880
if something needs to be comforted well it's nice and warm and soft in the palm of the hand so you're

55
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:46,960
there and but we're not limiting anything we're not saying you can't go away

56
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,800
and we're not saying you have to stay here but we are welcome to stay here

57
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,759
i'm available here so what are what what ways do we

58
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,880
hold on rather than simply hold one of the ways we hold on is we

59
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:12,319
identify with it this is mine this is mine so it's my striker so you

60
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:19,120
can't have it it's my whatever so you have to protect it

61
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:26,400
maybe it's appropriate sometimes to protect your umbrella if it's raining on you but not in someone else

62
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:34,520
you know it's a very narrow little rainstorm when i was in hawaii they had very local rainstorms

63
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,280
but but what about living a life that somehow holds everything lightly

64
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,720
holds everything without restriction holds everything without

65
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:54,400
keeping it trapped in the fist of our clinging or grasping or holding on

66
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:02,319
is that is it appropriate what happens if we go around with an open hand always

67
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:08,080
pick things up we hold an open hand we're offered something and we hold it

68
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,240
with an open hand someone wants it do we offer it many years ago i was uh

69
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:20,560
spending time with a monk named ajahn amaro englishman who was an abbot of a theravada monastery here in northern

70
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:27,360
california this must have been the very early 2000s i don't know exactly when it was but

71
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,800
he had a cell phone that was uh maybe a smartphone before

72
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,120
there were smartphones you know before i really had that name he had this it did all this stuff i think he

73
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,800
could do email or something but he did all this stuff that he was amazing what he could do

74
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,919
and so uh and it cost something like a thousand dollars

75
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,120
and so i said to him uh what are you a monk doing with this

76
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:03,599
big expensive fancy phone aren't you supposed to be a renunciant

77
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:11,120
and he said oh someone gave it to me and i figured it was okay to have it

78
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,000
if if anybody who asked me for it i would give it to them

79
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,960
so i thought about it not so much that i wanted the phone but

80
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:30,319
i wanted to test him i want to find it this this for real but i i didn't

81
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,479
and um but this you know he was holding it i think he i think he was pretty probably genuine

82
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:43,360
he was holding it this way he was holding it loosely and

83
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,760
what about someone you're in conflict with what if you're someone's angry with you you're angry

84
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:56,160
with them so then the gesture might be you know like this stay away go

85
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,839
but what about if that if you go like that also with the person who you're angry with

86
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:08,160
don't push them away but like here what what what

87
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,920
what does that mean to hold someone who's angry with you or you're in conflict with this way

88
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:22,360
if you hold them this way hold on to something then it's not very friendly but with the open hand

89
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,200
the gesture of fearlessness in buddhism it should be that people have nothing to fear from you

90
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,480
is to hold your hands up like this flat no weapon just a flat and open

91
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,399
so this idea the open hand open mind open heart

92
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,720
so it doesn't mean that we have to give everything up

93
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,160
unless maybe they ask you for it maybe who knows what you want to do it doesn't but it doesn't mean you have to

94
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,200
give things up but you have to but in in the dharma what we're learning to do is something

95
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,120
different we're learning to not hold on hold but don't hold on if it's

96
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:11,760
appropriate to hold hold it but don't hold on because holding on prevents the natural

97
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,240
flow of things that happen things come things go this is the master in san francisco who

98
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,360
started the san francisco center shinrio suzuki roshi

99
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,560
he said renunciation

100
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,839
um is allowing things to go when it's their time

101
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:42,640
when things go when things have time to go then then we let go so it's like he was quite happy to hold

102
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,079
but when it was time to go then the renunciation was letting it go

103
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:54,880
i think parents have to learn that at some age sometimes the kids are ready to leave

104
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,399
before the parents are ready for them to leave alco in all kinds of stages okay you

105
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:08,640
have to go you have to go remember when my son was i don't know he was maybe five

106
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,560
and he came out of the bathroom

107
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:19,360
dressed like a 1970s disco king

108
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:25,360
i couldn't believe what i saw i mean where do you find those clothes and where did he he figured out how to

109
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,839
slick his hair and it was like he had some kind of gold necklace i don't know you know what in

110
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,279
our house what did he find and i looked at him

111
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,720
and uh and i thought okay i mean this was like represented

112
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,200
something which i don't stand for it just was so different than anything that i could you know appreciate really whatever it

113
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,320
was and i looked at it and said well this is what he's done

114
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,480
who am i to say that he shouldn't do that just because i don't have a good association with that

115
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,639
it's not my place to tell him that he can't dress up this way and to figure it out so

116
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,160
so i have to i have to keep my hand open and he's going

117
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,760
who knows what direction he's going to go in his life but you know he he gave it at five he's

118
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,639
making choices and you know it's not my place to shape him in every possible way parents

119
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:30,480
have a role of course but but you know there was a it was a moment of like oh okay

120
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,200
i have to i have to let him go in certain ways

121
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:45,279
so um so this uh freedom of the open hand

122
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,440
and but is that a freedom that you're comfortable with do you feel safe or do you feel like you

123
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,120
lose too much or you feel safer and more comfortable holding on

124
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:04,399
gripping no not that it's finding fine for guilt to say that but he doesn't understand

125
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,880
you understand what life is about the challenges and i have to keep my things so i'm safe and

126
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,839
it goes on in all the justification but is it really

127
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:25,279
what are we trusting what are we not trusting we're not being asked to let go of

128
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:32,920
anything we're asked just to hold it with an open heart open mind open hand

129
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,360
and care for it i love this gesture i mean if i think when you put two hands together

130
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:48,079
like this and hold things then it's really supportive then it's just that love i love this as a metaphor

131
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:56,000
for mindfulness we take our attention and come from underneath our sadness or anger or fear and just hold

132
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,079
it like this but again it's open so it can go if it wants i'm not holding

133
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:08,399
on to it not resisting it so just hold everything

134
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,240
and maybe if it's time to for it to go maybe it's

135
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:21,600
okay maybe it's okay because the biggest gift we have the biggest treasure we have

136
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:28,079
is the open hand is the open heart is that freedom

137
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:33,199
to lose that by clenching from a buddha's point of view is

138
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,920
impoverishment even if i think that it's so important to keep the striker

139
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:45,839
the fact that i'm gripping it is a kind of poverty

140
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,600
if i hold it like this it's a kind of a wealth

141
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:59,320
a huddle like that and it goes away i still have the wealth

142
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,160
the freedom

143
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,639
so holding but not holding on

144
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:18,399
i think it's a very respectful way to live for life it's kind of like the middle way

145
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,639
the middle way between clinging and throwing things away clinging and

146
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,839
letting go of things

147
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:38,480
the middle way between accumulating and getting rid of things

148
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,240
just hold it like this and things come and go people come and go things come and go

149
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:51,199
all kinds of things come and go in that openness and maybe

150
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,759
it's a phenomenal form of respect

151
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,079
reverence care generosity to hold other people

152
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:09,360
in that in that open hand to hold on to other people maybe is not

153
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,199
respecting them to discard people is disrespectful but

154
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:21,279
that middle way hold but don't hold on

155
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,440
hold but don't discard

156
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,079
so that's the the thing that i wanted to say today

157
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:39,920
what do you think of that do you have any comments about that testimonials

158
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,560
protests questions

159
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:06,640
hi it's nancy um

160
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:13,600
i have some possessions but i have some possessions yes

161
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:21,520
that are very dear and nostalgic for me and i realized that

162
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:28,000
when i pass away my nieces and nephews have no interest in them whatsoever

163
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,919
even though they're family heirlooms and so um i've been thinking about it lately

164
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:40,240
about what do i do about these treasured things that are so dear to me

165
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,480
and how do i let those go when they're really going nowhere

166
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,559
i don't have an answer to that but what occurs to me is that in that open hand

167
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,760
you might figure out how to let go how to give it how to do something

168
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,919
but they represent something for you and so what they represent

169
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:09,840
is different than what the object is and maybe if there's something that's

170
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:17,120
something some way with the open hand to preserve protect stay close to

171
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,799
what what they represent in your heart that

172
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:28,640
will actually better allow

173
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:34,559
these memories or whatever it is to live in you than the object

174
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,400
maybe it's easier than to figure out a good home for the objects

175
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:49,039
and so maybe doing a ritual that maybe transfers

176
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:55,960
the memories or the associations from the objects to your heart

177
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,600
what does that sound like sounds good

178
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,840
how do we adapt to this way of thinking to our day-to-day life like i think the

179
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,679
the idea is great but i think just living life it's kind of hard to understand when you are grasping to the

180
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:02,720
object or idea thought whatever etc versus just keeping it open as you've mentioned

181
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,880
i don't know just like this because it occurs as an example happened recently to me

182
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:22,159
that in the last months where i went to a restaurant and there was something strange about how the credit card payment worked

183
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,200
and i didn't get any receipt so i wondered about that what's that

184
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:33,360
about am i in trouble am i going to be charged a whole bunch you know

185
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:41,440
and i wondered about it and so i did check my eventually my checking my credit card account online

186
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,559
but um but i i didn't want to i did it didn't seem i didn't seem

187
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:52,640
necessary i didn't want to do the usual things i would have done years ago which got me get anxious

188
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:59,600
somebody can take advantage of me i was like okay well let's see what happens and

189
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,679
what happens if they charge me twice as much than they're supposed to

190
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,880
do do i need to get worried or upset or feel injustice of that and

191
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,240
what should be my role so i didn't have answers those questions but those questions existed with me feeling like

192
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:23,360
this very relaxed about it is that appropriate or should i have gotten anxious should i rush back and

193
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,039
said hey something's wrong here i didn't get a receipt then i don't you know what's going on i also didn't

194
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:35,919
sign that little slip here goes aside when you do credit cards like what's this is unusual what's going to happen now

195
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,200
so um so i don't know if that answers your

196
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,759
question but that's what occurred to me i think it's a very different way of living

197
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:56,000
maybe it's a in one point in my life i would have referred to it as living a life of trust

198
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,880
but now i don't think of it as trust anymore i just think of it as freedom

199
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:27,039
do you have any suggestions for if you feel like you're the one being grasped like the person being grasped if you're

200
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:32,720
the person being grasped yes oh by maybe your family or your friends and

201
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,520
they sort of hurt you sometimes what do you do then yeah

202
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,520
ideally in my in my world ideally for me at least is that

203
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,360
you would uh have friends or that you can talk honestly with and if you can't have an honest

204
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,120
conversation maybe it's that's to reevaluate the friendship and an honest conversation what would be

205
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,600
maybe look like this you know i've noticed for some time now that you know you're really attached to

206
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,840
me or grasping onto me holding on and we have a friendship and i value you

207
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,760
and i can imagine you have a need for companionship or need for something

208
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:19,120
but it's also hard for me i feel limited and boxed in i wonder if we can have a conversation

209
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:26,559
about this and find a way together to works for both of us so some kind of conversation like that

210
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:32,720
um and that would be my inclination because i i put a tremendous

211
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:40,880
value on honest communication how does that sound that sounds good that sounds helpful

212
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,320
yeah good it's hard not everyone wants to have that kind of honesty and communications

213
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:53,039
it's difficult for people so for people who it's a foreign idea to have such open frank conversations you

214
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:59,840
have to kind of come come at it a little bit slowly and carefully and work into it rather than like let's sit

215
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,480
down and be honest but uh and and to be able to learn the skill of these kinds of conversations is

216
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:13,200
one of the great things that was this was my introduction to the spiritual life

217
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:21,919
was it was witnessing these kinds of conversations with people i lived when i was 2021 at the largest

218
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,960
uh hippie commune united states it was about 800 people

219
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:34,000
and then tennessee they called the farm and it was but it was a spiritual commune of sorts

220
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,440
but there's uh they had they had gotten their start in spirituality through lsd

221
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:46,080
but when they moved to tennessee lsd didn't work so you know taking lsd didn't work so much there

222
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:52,159
so they had to figure out something different something as powerful as lsd and the powerful thing they discovered

223
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,760
was honesty so when i went there and stayed for a while i stayed there because i saw the

224
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,880
amazing honesty between people who were there and how they worked all kinds of things

225
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:09,360
out and it was so inspiring to me and because it was kind of a spiritual community that was i got a sense of oh

226
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,480
spiritual life could be this way and that inspired me

227
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,720
yeah yeah i think that's really helpful i i've always believed in the honest communication i think i need to

228
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,120
slow my delivery

229
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,080
great thank you thank you

230
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:56,880
your first examples of the beautiful imagery of an open hand were very clear

231
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,080
to me i believe the very first one you gave was an open hand with the

232
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:09,360
striker and that seemed very comfortable because that's a neutral object to me

233
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:15,039
i may have one i may have two i can get another one easily so certainly i can

234
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:23,360
do this and it it may leave my hand and similarly with the bird

235
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,960
it wasn't neutral but it was the nature of the object that i had so i

236
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:36,840
it was the right thing to do to open and let it go but if something is so

237
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:44,799
personal not even high value perhaps like nancy if i may refer to that that this

238
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:50,320
is such a treasure an actual object of treasure but

239
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:57,279
something so emotional like the anger you would feel with someone

240
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:03,600
and the thought of opening up and expecting that to just leave

241
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,120
certainly no one's going to take it from me it's not very valuable to anyone else

242
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:16,240
but why is that feeling so different than the bird or the striker

243
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:24,159
do you have any ideas because it's a very personal question so i see if you have any for yourself

244
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,440
it's just the intensity of the creation that it is

245
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:37,279
from me but it seems to have high value and it may be anger on one day but it may also

246
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:43,919
be something about my my my self image or my

247
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:49,919
something that again it just seems to be a if it's such so much about me

248
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:59,519
yeah yeah so i mean so there's a wonderful saying in buddhism i've learned from buddhism that if um

249
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:05,679
if there's a gap between the ideal and the actual a gap between what's what

250
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:13,120
we ideal about to be and what's actually going on study the actual

251
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,520
so you've heard this teaching today this ideas today and now you're asking about how did you have this intensity it's so

252
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:25,520
important for you and so valuable study why it's valuable maybe that means that you haven't you

253
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:32,720
haven't really studied you haven't really looked at yourself what's really going on why is it valuable what are you trying to do what are you afraid of

254
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:40,240
and um and then and then so that's where you find the answers to yourself rather than um you know that's that's

255
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:46,799
that's where the answers come by so if the ideal is to be like this

256
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:51,840
you can't do it in some areas of your life that's okay but that becomes where your

257
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,440
practice goes then you discover something i can't tell you what you'll discover

258
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,480
but something useful that's lovely thank you

259
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,960
i thought at the beginning when you were speaking that you're going to maybe ask something else and that is

260
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,320
what if what i have is really valuable and someone asks for it

261
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,480
what do i do then i take that like this this spell in the striker we've had it here for now almost

262
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,000
20 years i remember very fondly the person who gave it to us was a gift and

263
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
we came to satire and was sat in this room for years and all that and so so for me i have this wonderful

264
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,240
association it's important the connection to that person and all the years we've been here it has value

265
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,000
so if you came and said you know i think i'd like that striker i'd say oh

266
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,840
well let me tell you a little bit before i give it to you you know this is this is not any old

267
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:55,679
striker this is actually has a lot of value because of the memories associations and

268
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,880
kind of the background here and so i don't know i mean i'm happy to give

269
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,679
it to you happy enough but

270
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,880
what if i go buy you another buy you a striker a different one would that be okay

271
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:20,240
or i would just say i explained to you that yes but this is what it means for me and then you'd say oh and i didn't know that

272
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,159
okay well then i don't want it or many years ago i had a zen teacher

273
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,520
he um we were facing each other i asked him

274
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,960
for a time to meet with him to talk about practice or something and um

275
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:44,799
and his reply his res back then people had date books and so um so his response to me facing

276
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:50,880
him saying you know do you have time to meet with me was he came around shoulder to shoulder next to me

277
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:58,240
and brought out his date book and put his date book between us so he could see his schedule

278
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,600
and and it was like he wasn't going to tell me i can't meet you in the next week you have to wait

279
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:09,519
you know he said let's look at this together and then oh it's obvious he can't meet

280
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,799
with me right now and it wasn't me versus him it wasn't oppositional why doesn't he care for me

281
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:22,080
just why is he putting me off two weeks it was like oh it was it was done cooperatively

282
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:27,519
and this idea of of doing things cooperatively uh you know letting people know what's

283
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:32,880
happening for you this is striker is valuable you still want it

284
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,480
do you still want it something so so that i thought that's where that was the answer i was getting

285
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:45,039
very getting ready to tell you you know you went you went someplace

286
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:50,880
else i'll try to be more careful no no no it's great no no you don't have to it

287
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,320
was great what you said i've guessed

288
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:04,159
gil i'm wondering if you can talk about letting go of one's self-identification

289
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,320
with one's work or whatever one's doing moving from a place of

290
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,880
like you said identifying the task um to

291
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:23,279
a place of um aspiration so is this an identity that you um

292
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:28,880
keep like this 24 hours a day seven days a week or is it what does it kind of wane and wax

293
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,000
through the week probably wayne and wax

294
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,600
so what is it like when it's it what is what are you like when it's most not there

295
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,600
hmm

296
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,960
open to more possibilities a little more relaxed so rather than you

297
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,159
could you could study the identification but uh but

298
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:03,679
another thing you can study is study when it's least there and see what they're what you have to

299
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:10,240
learn from that and that might be enough yeah think you have to change it and

300
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,120
shift it yeah thank you i'll try

301
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,559
um so it's a horizontal

302
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:32,559
you're like yeah okay um i want to say just uh

303
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:38,080
it's a little off topic but i haven't been here for a couple years since kovit and i

304
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,039
really appreciate being here in this space and

305
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:52,240
i've um i'm usually the one that doesn't speak so i think for me i've been uh holding

306
00:33:52,240 --> 00:34:00,799
on to my it's interesting holding on to my fear holding my fear of not speaking and um

307
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:08,158
it feels good to say what i said oh fantastic and just and to describe your fear that's

308
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,398
here and do it and you're so i hear that you're holding your fear but not being

309
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:20,560
held by your fear to speak to speak this way yeah that feels accurate you're practicing what

310
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:27,200
i'm talking about already that was that was beautiful thank you

311

314
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:58,000
serious part of the pandemic of really being isolated is kind of over i'm still not actually spending a lot of

315
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,920
time with people directly like the way i used to and so anything like this i value and i think it's it's
