1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,000
well good morning everyone my name is May Elliott and this is day four of our

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,940
five day series on the five hindrances okay so the hindrances are known for

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:17,460
clouding over or obscuring the clarity of the mind so if we want to be able to

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,859
stay with the breath or stay present for our life getting to know what obscures

5
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:28,800
that present is really important like what is it that keeps us from being here

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,960
and now so today we'll zoom in on the fourth the fourth hindrance of

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,480
restlessness and the antidote to restlessness is calm so in the

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,579
meditation today we'll we'll invite in some calming factors

9
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:51,600
um then if you're ever having a hard time being present with restlessness or it's too overwhelming inviting in calm

10
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,660
can be really helpful so let's begin I go ahead and find your meditation posture

11
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,979
and that could be sitting standing lying down whatever posture works for you

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,159
and rather than go straight to our meditation anchor this morning sometimes

13
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,640
it can be nice to just take stock of what's happening in the mind uh the heart and in the body so that's how

14
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:37,560
we'll begin today so to start let's just take a an

15
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,939
inventory of what's the body feel like maybe starting with a global sense of

16
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,460
the body and its posture right now

17
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,380
I'm just seeing what you notice

18
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,680
you might notice that certain areas are tighter than others others more relaxed

19
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:36,300
or spacious you might notice different temperatures or movement in the body

20
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:43,220
just meeting what you find with a non-judgmental curious attitude

21
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:03,300
and having acknowledged what it's like in the body in this moment let's shift our attention to the heart

22
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:11,720
so what's happening in the heart this motion this morning is there a particular emotion present

23
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:19,760
maybe just a background mood

24
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,400
and it's okay if you don't have a perfect name to describe what you're feeling right now

25
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:45,739
just sensing what it's like is enough

26
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:58,319
sometimes people say oh there's nothing happening right now there's no emotion

27
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,840
there's no mood and if that's the case for you you might check a little closer

28
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,760
um because sometimes that means that there's just a little light sense of calm that's present

29
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,700
so you might see if that's true for you

30
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,940
and then shifting to notice what's happening in the mind what sorts of

31
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:02,220
thoughts might be present are there a lot of thoughts flurrying

32
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:08,759
around are they few and far between are they loud and captivating or maybe

33
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:15,660
soft and wispy I'll just take a moment to see what's happening in the thinking muscle we're

34
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:22,199
not actually going looking for any thoughts we're going to practice staying here in the body being still and maybe

35
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,240
no thoughts will Arise at all but if one moves through then we'll notice it as a

36
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,400
phenomenon in the present moment not getting captured by its story but seeing

37
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,159
that it's occurring and then we can let it go

38
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,720
so as we explore the present moment uh we're just meeting things as they are

39
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,639
without being in conflict with them

40
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:07,080
and now that we've taken some time to recognize things as they are

41
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:14,160
we can invite in some settledness so bring attention to your anchor

42
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,880
maybe the breath feeling the breath where you sense it most predominantly

43
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:28,919
maybe in the nose the chest or the belly or your anchor might be the soundscape

44
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,720
or a global sense of the body

45
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,860
so we're allowing the attention to connect with the anchor and then to sustain attention with that anchor we're

46
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:48,479
creating continuous attention and engaging in a samata practice like

47
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:54,599
this where we tune into our anchor this is one of the traditional ways of

48
00:07:54,599 --> 00:08:01,319
bringing forth calm sometimes translates as calm abiding

49
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:07,199
this is a calm abiding practice to allow the mind to rest on an anchor and return

50
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:14,520
to it again and again and the breath particularly while all

51
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,800
anchors will do the breath is particularly helpful as

52
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,599
as a tool for relaxation

53
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:32,279
so if the breath is your anchor you might try relaxing a little bit every

54
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:38,099
time you exhale just inviting the mind and heart and body to relax on each

55
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:44,399
exhale so we'll sit in silence together now for some time just doing this practice

56
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:49,100
allowing the mind and heart to learn to rest

57
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,860
um

58
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:22,500
and when the mind wanders we gently and kindly bring the Mind back

59
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:29,480
to our anchor sliding back to our anchor no need to

60
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,680
wince or judge ourselves for thinking

61
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:42,360
it's a natural outcome of the mind to produce thoughts instead when we notice it's happen we

62
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:49,440
slide right back to the Anchor back to the breath back to the soundscape

63
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,399
back to the body

64
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:32,579
as we begin to settle we'll now turn the attention towards any calmness that

65
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:39,600
might be present and this doesn't need to be an all-pervading Tranquility there might be

66
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,720
parts of the experience that aren't tranquil that aren't calm um then that's okay

67
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:52,980
um but as we bring awareness to our experience we might see whether there's any Tranquility or calm that's present

68
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:59,600
so the Mind might not be calm but the body might be

69
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,680
or the mind and body might not be calm but the space around you the room you're

70
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:14,760
sitting in might have a sort of Tranquility to it so we can lean on whatever Tranquility

71
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,800
is present whatever is not tranquil whatever is not

72
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:26,579
calm can slide into the background can shift into the background then we can allow our attention to

73
00:15:26,579 --> 00:15:32,480
recognize any Tranquility that's that's present um

74
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:39,620
and whatever Tranquility we find we can allow ourselves to be nourished by that

75
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:55,260
so go ahead and take some time to sense now how is it for you

76
00:15:55,260 --> 00:16:00,720
often the mind is anxious and racing and we don't really realize oh the body's

77
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,300
actually tranquil right now okay let's find some peace resting in

78
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,660
the body

79
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:18,180
or if you're in a quiet room allowing the mind to attune to the space

80
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:24,420
around you well there's there's something that feels settled in the space I'm in

81
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:32,420
so attuning to the Tranquility that's around you sometimes we feel this if we're ever sitting meditation in nature

82
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:38,240
so we can lean on that tranquility

83
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:48,959
so go ahead and take some time discovering now um where you might sense into calm

84
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:56,040
um where you might find calm in your experience right now and allowing yourself to really be present for that

85
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,079
the Buddha's guidance is to be present for wholesome states to really take them

86
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:08,938
in to be mindful of them so allow that to register if you come in contact with calm really

87
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:13,400
let that in be present for it

88
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,579
foreign

89
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:03,200
and at any time if it's supportive for you can return to your anchor

90
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:07,279
allowing the mind to settle there

91
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:15,500
and remembering that that practice is a calm abiding practice

92
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:29,419
inviting in relaxation foreign

93
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:40,880
softening

94
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:53,720
allowing yourself to be soothed by the breath

95
00:24:40,919 --> 00:24:45,960
if you're having a hard time connecting with the practices that I'm offering

96
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:51,320
this morning you might check to see what else is going on

97
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:58,679
it might be that one of the other hindrances is present so you might check to see if sense

98
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:05,460
desire is present or ill will aversion or sloth and torpor

99
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:11,580
sleepiness and if so you can do one of the

100
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:19,340
practices that I shared on the other days maybe recognizing and feeling what's going on

101
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:07,919
may be beneficial energy of our practice together today benefit all beings so

102
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,140
they may be happy healthy safe

103
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:18,140
and completely free from suffering

104
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:18,179
all right welcome back everyone here we are again

105
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:23,940
resuming our study of the five hindrances uh these habits of mind that

106
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:29,399
inhibit clarity I'd like to start by emphasizing that

107
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:35,279
the hindrances are no small matter the the Buddha compared the experience of

108
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:42,059
having hindrances um to a variety of very severe circumstances

109
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:50,100
um he said that the experiences or the experience of the hindrances is comparable to being imprisoned

110
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:56,820
he said they're comparable to being enslaved he compared them to being on a

111
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:06,179
dangerous Journey to having a severe illness or to be saddled by having a great debt

112
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:12,779
and perhaps more striking he says that when the the hindrance is abate when we're free from hindrance

113
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:19,080
um this is as good as being cured from illness or being freed from prison or being released from slavery or having

114
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:24,500
finally paid off a great debt or making it to safety on a dangerous Journey

115
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:30,720
so you can imagine like there's a tremendous amount of relief when any of

116
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,539
these things would happen connecting with the relief of making it to safety after a dangerous Journey or the sense

117
00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:42,720
of freedom of being released from prison or slavery or the joy of recovering from

118
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:49,799
illness like these are really dramatic most if not all of us are afflicted by

119
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:54,899
the hindrances with frequency so hearing these descriptions for what is possible

120
00:31:54,899 --> 00:32:00,600
when we're free from hindrance is pretty incentivizing so

121
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:08,039
um this practice can really allow for a tremendous amount of Freedom if we can really study the

122
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:13,200
hindrances if we can really get to know them and learn how they operate in us we

123
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:20,580
can learn to see the veil of the hindrances um so much Freedom can be possible

124
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:27,720
so today we'll talk about restlessness yesterday we discussed the third

125
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:34,200
hindrance sloth and torpor so the third and fourth hindrance have a strong energetic quality with Sloth and torpor

126
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:41,940
being low energy and restlessness often high energy it often kind of an over abundance of

127
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:49,380
energy sometimes this hindrance of restlessness is referred to as worry and flurry where

128
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:55,679
the mental representation of the hindrance is worry and the physical representation is flurry and so it does

129
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:01,940
manifest in these two different ways physically or mentally so the physical manifestation

130
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:08,520
might manifest as we can't sit still in meditation or we keep fidgeting or

131
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:13,620
shifting or itching of physical restlessness can arise also

132
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:19,980
it's the desire to bolt rush out of the meditation hall or off of our cushion

133
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:25,200
um for in daily life that physical restlessness might come forth as needing

134
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,740
to keep doing things getting home from work and racing around the house because we just can't drop the momentum of our

135
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:37,860
work day and all of these you may be sensing there can be a compulsive quality to

136
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:47,039
them the mental manifestation for restlessness is a mind that's agitated a

137
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,799
mind that's scattered lots of scattered thinking where the mind just won't won't settle

138
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:59,460
um where thinking is really persistent and while restlessness isn't always

139
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:06,899
based in fear often restlessness can involve anxiety or worrying and we might see this

140
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:12,060
anxious form of restlessness when we're rehearsing what we're going to say in a

141
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:18,599
conversation you may have noticed that happening in meditation or when we're engaging in excessive planning or

142
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:24,300
Imagining the worst um it might be ruminating over a concern

143
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:29,480
about one's self-image so all of these can have a Restless quality to them

144
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:37,200
and while restlessness can be fueled by fear it can also come forth as a product of a kind of stuck or frustrated desire

145
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:45,000
or constrained aversion um and so when we meet restlessness we can

146
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,040
do our typical one-size-fits-all approach to the hindrances where we recognize the

147
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:56,099
restlessness the restlessness is present so we know oh this is restlessness and

148
00:34:56,099 --> 00:35:01,740
Scattered thinking agitation anxious thinking um and then we feel what that

149
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:06,960
restlessness is is like in the body we feel the compulsion to move the

150
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:13,980
agitation high energy so this this is a classic way to work

151
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:19,079
with restlessness additionally one of the traditional approaches to

152
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:24,359
restlessness is to notice what caused it what triggered the restlessness

153
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:30,359
um so often when we're lost in thought in meditation there can be some form of

154
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:36,900
restlessness present if we discover that we're restlessness we so we recognize oh this is

155
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:42,599
restlessness we can then ask what's underneath this what am I feeling

156
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:47,820
right now as in uh what emotion is present right now and this can be part

157
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:54,000
of our two-part practice you know where uh we recognize then we feel the hindrance

158
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,099
um so first we recognize the restlessness and then we might ask okay what's what's going on here what am I

159
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:04,380
feeling um to recognize what's below the restlessness

160
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:10,079
um so um if we are able to identify what's causing it what's triggering the

161
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,619
restlessness then we can practice mindfulness of the underlying emotion then whatever we discover below the

162
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:24,000
restlessness say anxiety then we can really take care of that anxiety we can we can feel it

163
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,560
fully and sometimes practicing mindfulness of the underlying emotion can actually be even more skillful than

164
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:39,599
just staying with the restlessness itself so I happen to sit a two-month

165
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:46,800
Meditation Retreat just prior to my my wedding many years ago and

166
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:53,339
um just before the set just before the retreat I came across a meme with a caption uh the happiest moment of my

167
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:58,859
wedding was realizing the planning is over so uh if you've ever planned a wedding

168
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:05,280
you might be able to relate to that I certainly could um so understandably one of my top 10

169
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:13,800
hits during the retreat involved wedding planning thoughts so I would be rethinking details uh the expense the

170
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:20,280
invitation list what type of cake which dress you know all of the logistics so

171
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:26,060
I found myself caught in these kind of extended bouts of thinking many times

172
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:33,000
during the meditation on this Retreat before doing that first step of recognizing that restlessness was at

173
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,339
play where I was like you know eventually oh this is just restlessness

174
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:43,700
and even once I saw that it took a while before I learned to ask

175
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:48,839
what's beneath all this thinking like okay this is restlessness but what am I

176
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:54,839
feeling right now what's beneath all of this thinking um and asking this allowed for an even

177
00:37:54,839 --> 00:38:01,740
deeper recognition so often these these repetitive story lines are fueled by an underlying

178
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:06,900
emotion or physical experience as Gil would say it's as though there's a

179
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:12,420
factory deep in the body then it's the factory that's the source of anxiety and

180
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:18,839
it's the anxiety that's pumping out the thoughts it's the factory that's the source of the underlying emotion and

181
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:26,339
it's that emotion that's pumping out the thoughts so the thoughts are just the off-gassing from the deeper source so we

182
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:32,460
could keep sweeping the thoughts away from now until eternity but the underlying emotion is going to keep

183
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:38,520
turning them out until we give it the attention it's asking for so to give it the attention

184
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,560
it's asking for to actually address the thinking we actually need to go to the

185
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:49,740
source we need to go down into the factory and to go down into the factory that

186
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:55,740
means actually feeling what's happening in the body so we release the thoughts we go down to

187
00:38:55,740 --> 00:39:01,380
the factory we feel the constriction in the body the way that worry or anxiety

188
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:09,119
tightens the heart maybe sensing the raised shoulders or whatever other Sensations might be present

189
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:15,480
so when we return to this practice recognize and feel when we go down to

190
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,900
the factory you know this is when we engage the step of feeling our experience going down

191
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:28,680
into the factory um we sense what's happening through somatic sense

192
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,200
now this this allows us to address the felt experience at the source rather

193
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:40,140
than just sweeping away the thoughts over and over again which you know they're just like the thoughts are like

194
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:46,740
smoke coming out of the Smoke Stacks so we go to the source we recognize and then we go to the source go down to the

195
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:52,800
factory and we feel what's happening and as I mentioned earlier restlessness

196
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,500
can come from a variety of sources um which is one of the reasons it's helpful

197
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:03,540
to ask those questions of what am I feeling right now what's underneath this um

198
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:09,240
and with that said it is it is really common that the source is worry and

199
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,940
anxiety anxiety fueling the factory so knowing this it can be helpful to

200
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:22,260
remember that fear is such a natural part of Being Human we've been deeply conditioned to feel fear and we don't

201
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:27,480
need to be hard on ourselves about being fearful the Dharma teacher and author

202
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:33,180
Mark lesser reminds us that we're the descendants of the nervous Apes all the

203
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:38,599
chilled out Apes got eaten so it's the nervous Apes that survived and made baby Apes

204
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:45,119
anxiety is deeply conditioned in us um you know we've inherited

205
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:53,119
um a survival strategy um this capacity do you feel to feel fear which keeps us safe

206
00:40:53,220 --> 00:41:00,359
so if we're experiencing a fear-based restlessness it can help to do this with an attitude

207
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:05,880
of gentleness um so just to help bring forth that

208
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:12,119
attitude of gentleness we might take a moment just to imagine what it's like to

209
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:18,119
see a scared dog it might be shaking um it gets little ears are drooped way

210
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:25,680
back the Tails tucked the posture might be cowering now if this was your dog and

211
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:31,740
you knew that you could comfort it how would you be with that animal how would you greet it how would you take

212
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:38,339
care of it so you might be gentle or loving you

213
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:45,180
might hold it and keep it warm ensuring it feels safe so if you notice restlessness and

214
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:51,240
discover that below the restlessness there's some fear in the heart there's some anxiety

215
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:59,040
can you bring that same gentle loving attention to the anxiety um bringing that same care that same

216
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:07,619
compassion you'd bring to a little animal that's having a hard time ultimately can you help the fear feel

217
00:42:07,619 --> 00:42:10,039
safe

218
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:18,480
okay so now I want to talk about a slightly different and more subtle

219
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:25,619
manifestation of restlessness we've already talked about how restlessness can manifest physically and how it can

220
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:31,820
appear as mental emotional activity and agitation

221
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:40,680
I want to talk about how restlessness also points to a much deeper habit of mind the simple habit of um where the

222
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:47,460
mind is just moving out of the present at all so ajan Amaro and ajan pasino explain it

223
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:53,400
like this and this quote is from the island it's a book Island which is an

224
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,140
excellent book I highly recommend it

225
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:06,540
and it goes like this of the ten obstacles or Fetters that

226
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:11,579
stand in the way of Enlightenment the penultimate is restlessness

227
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:18,300
the restlessness to which this refers is not the fidgeting of the uncomfortable meditator

228
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:25,020
it is the subtlest of feelings that there might be something better over there or just in the future

229
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:31,500
a feeling that that which is Out Of Reach might have more value in some way than this

230
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:39,020
it is the ever so Insidious addiction to time and its promises

231
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:46,619
so as one nears full Enlightenment restlessness is one of the last Fetters

232
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:51,780
to be uprooted it's so deeply conditioned in us to lean towards some

233
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:57,000
better moment ever so slightly even just that forward lean and I love that line

234
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:03,300
the ever so Insidious addiction to time and its promises

235
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:10,740
so we can think of restlessness as manifesting at different levels of subtlety on a coarser level there's a

236
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:15,900
physical restlessness and then maybe a little more subtle than that mental

237
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:21,240
emotional restlessness and agitation and on an even more subtle subtle level than

238
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:29,599
that there's this ongoing sense that there might be something just a little better just Out Of Reach

239
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:36,359
Okay so if retinosis arises or go-to practice is

240
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:43,500
the mindfulness practice of recognizing and feeling but as I said in the meditation this morning and you can

241
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:49,859
apply an antidote and that antidote is um uh Plumbing or Tranquility so if you

242
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:57,599
feel restlessness you can return to your meditation anchor and do samata that calm abiding practice

243
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:02,819
um and what we're doing here is we're just allowing in in that practice

244
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:10,440
um the comma biting practice we're allowing the mind to gravitate around something that's simple and that simple

245
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:17,040
object can be a refuge for the mind that's racing it around and it's Tangled Up In all sorts of complex anxiety

246
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:23,040
producing storylines um if however focusing on the anchor of

247
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,260
meditation actually tightens the mind or increases the energy you can give the

248
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:34,800
mind a wider pasture to open up the attention um for example opening the attention to

249
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:42,000
sounds in a really nice wide way and that can bring in some calm so you

250
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:47,220
can make the the field of attention all wide so the Restless energy can just

251
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:54,720
kind of pinball around in the mind or body but we're not being jerked around by it because we're in this large field

252
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,180
um and as I mentioned in the meditation another way to connect with calm is just

253
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:08,040
to notice where where there's already calm that's present so for me it's not uncommon that I'll be mentally Restless

254
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:15,359
um but there might be an area of the body that's relaxed so I'll rest in that part of the body I'll allow that part of

255
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:21,240
the body to be soothing to the mind um and in the meditation in a meditation

256
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:26,280
hall or in nature or in a quiet room these spaces can bring forth calm as

257
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:33,540
well to tune into the calm that's around us so today

258
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:39,420
um see if you can identify a moment of restlessness um maybe it's physical or maybe it's a

259
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:46,619
mental feeling um and rather than acting out on the restlessness externally

260
00:46:46,619 --> 00:46:51,660
um see if you can just recognize the restlessness as restlessness I'm like oh

261
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:57,119
this is worry and flurry and then get to know it let them feel it bringing that

262
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:03,300
same kindness and care that you'd bring to an anxious animal a little puppy or

263
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:09,180
whatever it is that brings forth some sense of gentleness and compassion

264
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:16,140
so I hope you have a lovely day today and that you're able to stay connected to your practice thank you for being

265
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,818
here thanks
