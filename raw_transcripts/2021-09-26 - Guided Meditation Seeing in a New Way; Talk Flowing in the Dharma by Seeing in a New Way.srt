00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:09,040
hello everyone and welcome to imc in redwood city

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,679
and

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:21,920
and we're here to meditate together and i'm happy for this gathering thank

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,920
you

5
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,800
the word vipassana that's uh

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,600
the kind of word for the kind of meditation in which we do mindfulness

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:50,800
vipassana is is how we translate is the word it gives us the word insight

8
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:58,399
for insight meditation center it comes from the holy word pasana which means

9
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:04,158
to see and the prefix vi is a

10
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,840
intensifier and so to intensely see though i don't know if we want to use the word

11
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,680
intense so it's often used clear seeing to see clearly

12
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,960
to see well and in one of the little slogans

13
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,119
in this vipassanai insight movement is that vipassana is not about seeing

14
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:37,439
something new but seeing in a new way and

15
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,280
as a slogan it only goes so far but it does point to something important that

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,040
seeing in a new way and one of those new ways is to

17
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,479
be present for our experience breathing our body whatever aware of in the present moment

18
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,320
sent to ourselves in the present moment and do so without

19
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,840
referring it to our concepts of self

20
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,920
the ideas of identity that we might have about ourselves the idea of me myself and mine

21
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:19,440
the idea all the kind of orbit of ideas that circle around the central idea of self

22
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,760
what the self needs what it wants what's going to happen what it means to me

23
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:33,200
and then to shift and to see it see our experience some people talk about just as nature

24
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,319
as nature seeing itself and

25
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,000
i'm kind of fond of the idea that this idea of where nature is seeing

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,640
itself that out of the cosmic soup

27
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:56,000
the formation of the solar system and this planet and then out of the elements of all this

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,080
there arose life and life arose in such a way that at some point it became

29
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,319
conscious aware and and it's a the natural world which has

30
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:14,000
formed these conscious beings that can see that aren't part of nature that can see

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,599
nature so rather than seeing everything from the reference points of of myself and my

32
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,040
ego and things to see oh this too is part of the natural world

33
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:32,239
that rather than being caught up in responsibility and measuring everything about you know

34
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,840
point of view of my life today and what it means to see things perhaps as

35
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,760
our experience the thought we have maybe the feelings we have as the product of

36
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,879
5 billion 14 billion years of

37
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:54,799
development evolution tremendous amount of cause and effect had to come into play

38
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,840
phenomenal that at this particular moment you're thinking about what should i have for lunch

39
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,000
and it's not a simple thing that the universe organized itself so you could have the thought what should i

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,519
have for lunch and so to see in a new way

41
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:20,320
is to see kind of in amazement and with interest in this new way without

42
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,000
centering the seeing on what it means for me myself and not to

43
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,400
judge what's happening judge myself for what's happening just allow things to be and see them in

44
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,319
their particular it's just part of the continued

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:46,479
flow of life of experience of the universe that we just happen to be conscious of and it happens to be a lot

46
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:53,600
of the experience that is arising and passing in this psychophysical being that we are

47
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,919
and this is a new way of seeing and it's not the only way to see

48
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,680
but it's a certainly fascinating way to see and it it

49
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,960
gives us access to a different way of experiencing ourselves and the world

50
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:19,039
that is said to be liberating so to assume a meditation posture

51
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,800
that um with this body of ours

52
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:32,560
a body that's made up of 100 recycled material from this cosmic soup

53
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,759
probably been involved in many these elements of

54
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:45,039
our body have been in all kinds of other life forms and situations over these billions of years

55
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:53,080
and now they've come together here so to feel to sense the body

56
00:05:53,919 --> 00:06:00,240
perhaps get take a downward gaze and relax your eyes

57
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,479
and if it's comfortable to close your eyes

58
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,800
and take a few long slow deep breaths

59
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:22,319
maybe three quarters full and then exhale that's maybe

60
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,080
one and a half times longer than you usually do

61
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:36,240
relaxing letting go on the on the end of the exhale

62
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,600
and letting your breathing return to normal

63
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:56,479
take a few moments to relax this body

64
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:05,759
for whatever the causes and conditions that have come together maybe the shoulders are tight and tense

65
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,599
no need to make a story of it or define oneself by it

66
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:17,280
just tension and allowing

67
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,960
the tension to relax a bit

68
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:36,000
feeling the sensations of your belly the belt is tight or held in

69
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:46,639
perhaps you also don't have to make it about yourself and that it means something about you

70
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,919
it's just nature who knows why it's tight you don't need

71
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:59,840
to know it for the purposes of this meditation but if it's easy enough to relax

72
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,360
the belly

73
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,120
and to also feel the muscles of your face

74
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,720
either any tension or clenching or tightness

75
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,240
anywhere in the face see it

76
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,120
matter-of-factly like you're a naturalist in the wild you're studying

77
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,279
some fascinating plant that you've never seen before it's just nature

78
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:51,120
the tension and if it's easy enough relax the

79
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,839
muscles of your face

80
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,800
and if there's any tension pressure and your thinking mind

81
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,839
associated with thinking

82
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:20,759
to also see that as nature

83
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,839
no need to use it to make any commentary about yourself and

84
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,839
it's just phenomenal happening tension happening thoughts happening

85
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,720
nature unfolding but if the tension of thinking can be

86
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,760
relaxed on the exhale relax

87
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,320
the thinking muscle

88
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,120
and then centering yourself on your breathing

89
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,760
wherever the breathing the body breathing is most clearly

90
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,639
experienced known

91
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:30,680
center yourself there steady yourself there

92
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:42,560
and allow yourself to experience the rhythm of breathing in and breathing

93
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:50,279
out okay

94
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,440
creatures of all kinds many kinds breathe

95
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,600
breathing is a natural phenomenon and the rhythm of breathing is like the

96
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,800
rhythm of the waves washing up and down on the shore

97
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:29,079
it goes on and on to relax and simply observe

98
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,560
this also natural process of breathing

99
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:42,399
without needing to make any judgments or conclusions

100
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,600
about you yourself just the breathing

101
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:54,000
and if you do control the breathing that's also natural

102
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,920
let it be and just say wow this too

103
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,720
and then as we continue meditating see if you can do this seeing in a new

104
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,399
way without the overlay

105
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:22,880
of self and self concerns and if those concerns come up

106
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:30,959
maybe you can be amazed that five billion years of evolution

107
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:38,600
should somehow have given birth to self-concern

108
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:46,560
and maybe you can see for a few moments self-concern is just as much part of the nature

109
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:53,800
as everything else it's all nature

110
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,880
seeing in a new way

111
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,600
uh

112
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,960
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

113
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:57,840
a wonderful aspects of this natural world

114
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:04,480
somewhat like we are nature [Music]

115
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:12,080
looking upon nature so we can also be nature caring for

116
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:20,159
nature just as we have the ability to perceive

117
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:26,480
the world we have the ability to care for the world

118
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,039
and if we're relaxed at ease feel safe

119
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,760
and don't see through the filter of me myself and mine

120
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:45,518
there can be the simple wonderful

121
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,960
capacity to care for others for their welfare for their happiness

122
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:56,320
it doesn't have to be dramatic it doesn't have to be great compassion

123
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:02,399
and it can be ordinary care and support

124
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,679
valuing appreciating people

125
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:14,480
and it's useful at the end of a meditation to bring forth this part of who we are

126
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,839
caring for others to do so at the end of the meditation

127
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,919
it brings a much greater value to the meditation we've had

128
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,280
even if meditation has been difficult we benefit from practicing with the

129
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:41,040
difficulties if we practice seeing in a new way

130
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:49,200
and in our care for others let the benefits that we've had from this practice

131
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:55,520
may it be directed through our care into the world

132
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,839
simple ordinary care simple ordinary directed to the world around

133
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:07,200
us with a wish may all beings

134
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:13,520
be happy may all beings

135
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,839
be safe may all beings

136
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:26,240
be peaceful may all beings

137
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:33,440
be free and may it be that we have occasion

138
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:40,720
to help make this possible to help support others to be happy safe peaceful

139
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,880
and free

140
00:35:49,810 --> 00:36:03,530
[Music]

141
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,760
thank you

142
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:13,359
so before i offer this talk today

143
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,359
uh i think there's one announcement maybe a couple but

144
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:25,280
and that is that um we are beginning to make plans to begin

145
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,400
a slow opening for imc it's possible it could be as soon as in

146
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:37,119
a couple of weeks and it depends whether we can put together

147
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,560
the protocol that we would like to have to feel safe coming here

148
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,839
and we'll have more kind of care given to it than we were planning to during the

149
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:54,880
summer and so the next next sunday

150
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,480
after this 10 o'clock arma talk the plan is to have a community meeting

151
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,920
for the imc community and one of the things we'll do is talk about that a little bit and

152
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,960
describe the protocol and we'll start by opening small

153
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,640
probably on a sunday and maybe with 25 people coming and

154
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:23,680
and people who register ahead of time and and then we'll see how that feels and how that goes and then maybe

155
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:30,960
will slowly start to increase and maybe have more programs um so

156
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:38,240
so that's for next week a community meeting then there's and the zoom link will be up but

157
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:44,640
posted in what's new and then some days before and also i'll post it uh in the calendar for this

158
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:51,119
event for that event in the imc calendar and so those are the two places you can get it and i'll probably post it also

159
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,640
here on the chat so that um on youtube so if you're on youtube you can just

160
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,760
maybe just jump over

161
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:05,520
so

162
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:15,760
and then when we open on sundays we'll still do the sunday morning on youtube

163
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,480
we were doing that before the pandemic and we'll continue after

164
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,760
so

165
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:34,800
so to do vipassana the practice of clear seeing

166
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:40,640
is to see in a new way

167
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:47,440
and in a new way that begins opening up a whole other possibility for how we can

168
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:53,599
grow and develop and unfold our life can unfold and it's a marvelous thing to learn a

169
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:59,200
new way and then to give ourselves to that new way and let that new way really develop

170
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:07,599
and grow and and um and change us from the inside out in a useful way

171
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:14,480
and that's the uh um you know what the buddhist path involves

172
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:21,119
and initially the new way of seeing is learned initially it's maybe even provisionally that we hear something and

173
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:27,599
then we try it out okay we've heard that there's a new way of seeing um i get i kind of get a sense of it

174
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:33,200
i'll do my best and see how it is and then over time maybe we'll have uh

175
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:38,560
evidence that this is actually works really well it's actually a very useful framework for

176
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:45,200
living our lives and so that it grows and grows and this growing of the momentum around

177
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,640
a new way of seeing new way of living is

178
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:57,680
there's a lot of analogies that buddha gives that have analogies of movement

179
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,040
so movement of a stream entering a stream and being carried by the stream

180
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,800
or water rain water falling on a hillside and the mountainside

181
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,160
and then the drops roll down and become bigger drops and they flow into little creek lits

182
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,720
and and those little creek lits flow into little pools and the pools overflow

183
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,000
with enough water and they flow into little streams and the streams keep

184
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,280
flowing to larger ponds when they ever flow that flows further down into

185
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:38,000
becomes rivers and the rivers flow into bigger lakes and when those overflow the water just

186
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,839
keeps getting bigger and bigger and stronger and stronger and keeps going downhill until eventually it makes its

187
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:50,720
way all the way to the ocean and so this is a movement that we're entering in this movement of

188
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:56,079
growth and development and flow and the the rainwater analogy

189
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,839
is fascinating because it has two different meanings uh it points both to the growth

190
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:07,599
something's growing in strength and capacity and it's also flowing down waters

191
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,200
following gravity rather than resisting gravity following gravity in a natural way

192
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,480
all the way to the ocean where it it doesn't have to flow anymore it can

193
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:25,839
come to a rest of sorts and and this new way of seeing

194
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:32,400
uh that is encouraged uh one way of describing it is a very

195
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:38,319
simple mindfulness just very simple ordinary seeing things in their

196
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:43,359
own in how they are as they appear as they exist in the moment

197
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:51,200
without you know as we do mindfulness practice without reference to the past to the future and without reference to

198
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:57,040
um and this is more difficult without reference to the egoistic self without

199
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:04,079
refuge to ref reference to the ideas we build up around who we are

200
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:11,280
and what we need and who we aren't and the judgments we have about ourselves the ways we undermine ourselves with

201
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,720
negative self-talk the way that we have delusions of grandeur about how

202
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:21,839
wonderful we are and we just allow experience to just be

203
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:28,240
itself without any reference to itself but we see it clearly now this isn't necessarily how we're

204
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:33,760
supposed to live our life the whole time past and future are valuable and

205
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,520
enriched enriches life as well but in meditation that's not what we're

206
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:47,520
trying to do meditation is trying to really discover something very radically new and allow this stream inside of us

207
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:53,760
to get bigger and flow and to be carried along by it the dharma stream

208
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,440
and so uh it does involve seeing in a new way and um

209
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:06,880
and a fascinating way of presenting this is that uh it involves seeing our

210
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,920
suffering in a new way and some of you probably are tired of

211
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,280
buddhists always talking about suffering suffering this suffering that and maybe you even kind of

212
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:24,160
tune out a little bit as soon as you hear the word suffering it's repeated so much what's fascinating is that the word pali

213
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:29,680
word for suffering the literal meaning of it is not suffering

214
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:35,599
the literal meaning of it is pain and we often and

215
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:43,119
and it's by kind of by interpretation by application it involves kind of psychological pain

216
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:48,960
and emotional pain that we would like to call suffering

217
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:55,920
and um but it's useful to think of it as pain and what happens if we see

218
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,760
so-called suffering or the big sufferings of our life as pain rather than suffering

219
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:08,079
it begins to maybe take remove a little bit the hegemony of

220
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:14,000
self the ways in which self will

221
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:23,280
invest in the self in this we get invested in the pay in the pain

222
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:29,760
we get interested in pain we get infatuated with the pain we get

223
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:37,359
all these ways we get involved with the pain but one of the ways we get involved in it is we overlay

224
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:42,480
attachments and reactivity on top of whatever pain we're looking at

225
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:48,560
so that there might be emotional pain there might be psychological pain there might be physical pain existential pain

226
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:53,599
all kinds of pains come along with being alive and then

227
00:45:53,599 --> 00:46:00,079
we or we have we overlay our ideas on top of it it shouldn't be there this means that i'm living life the

228
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:06,160
wrong way i'm doing something wrong that i feel pain um i i need to be the one who now gets

229
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,280
rid of it who this is happening to me i'm the victim of the of it all

230
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,640
um there is um there's a pain of loss

231
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:23,040
and then we we refer that loss to all the ways in which

232
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:29,680
i thought i was going to live my life and build up my wonderful life is not possible now

233
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:36,960
it's sad and it's you know that this happens but there can be a lot of extra investment of self what it's in for me

234
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:44,960
myself and mine which is separate from the pain of the loss now it's the pain of losing a future

235
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,640
which is a little different that we imagined than just the particular loss we have

236
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:57,040
so the the grief sometimes can get quite complicated what it involves

237
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:03,280
there can be anguish over the pain

238
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,720
because we add so much meaning to it and so much

239
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:15,040
projections into the future this is always going to be this way it's always been this way i'll never make it never

240
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:20,400
figure it out this is too much for me and no one's caring for me no one's taking care of me

241
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:26,960
and i feel so lonely in my dismay and my despair

242
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:33,839
so i don't want to be little or how difficult it is to have human suffering it's quite challenging

243
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:39,280
but i want to try to get across the idea that there are certain layers

244
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:45,920
overlay over overlaying certain degree of extra baggage on top of it or

245
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:52,880
reactivity or commentary and maybe that's very maybe just a veneer on top of it and so maybe it's

246
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:59,119
not very much but for some people it's actually not so you know

247
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:07,280
the overlay is actually the primary quality of what makes the pain suffering

248
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:13,839
and so the suggestion is to see a new way and maybe it's a

249
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:21,599
outrageous suggestion is that to see our suffering whatever we have whatever we call it

250
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:29,280
but uh to don't not call it suffering not call it grief not call it anguish not call it dismay

251
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:35,119
or depression or or anxiety and all these things that we now

252
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:42,079
have gotten used to calling it um it's it's valuable to see it that way i'm not you know i don't want to

253
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:48,559
diminish the importance of seeing clearly but uh when we say to meditate it might

254
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:55,920
be a time in our life where we can let it be very simple and just see it as pain

255
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:02,640
and make it that simple and seeing it just as pain might help us

256
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:09,839
to begin relaxing the mental work activity of these

257
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:14,960
overlays we put on top of it the way we bill helps us build the story of me

258
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,319
myself and mine and we might start seeing that

259
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:26,000
that some of those layers lighten up the pain is still there but it's not as

260
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,680
intense it's not as debilitating it has a whole different quality of it

261
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:37,520
so i'll give you a simple example i don't want to again i don't want to belittle how difficult life is to give a

262
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:43,839
simple example but simple makes maybe clearer that that i learned was very powerful

263
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:49,040
learning for me so that's why i like telling it that when i first started meditating

264
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:55,680
i was practicing zen where you weren't supposed to move during the 40 minutes of meditation but my body had not been conditioned to

265
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:01,440
sit in this posture and so my knees were on fire they hurt a lot

266
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:08,000
but i wasn't supposed to move and and so i had a lot of intense

267
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,119
suffering around this i felt self-pity i felt fear i felt

268
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:18,559
upset i was angry with myself i was angry at others i was

269
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:23,599
feeling is impossible why me and

270
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:28,640
you know and very impatient frustrated all kinds of layers of things were

271
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:35,520
happening and and because i kept sitting this way i slowly began to notice

272
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:41,119
that there was a difference between experiencing the pain in and of itself

273
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:46,720
and experiencing the pain with the self-pity and all the different aspects of it

274
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:53,520
and if i was able and if i had all this extra stuff the self-pity the impatience the frustration

275
00:50:53,520 --> 00:51:01,040
then then it was you know intense psychological suffering emotional suffering

276
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:06,720
but if i drop the self-pity the pain remained but it didn't become

277
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:12,079
as bad it like had space had breathing room it eased up and

278
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:19,040
sometimes the pain would become quite manageable until i kind of

279
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:24,960
forgot about kind of putting aside the self-pity he would come roaring back

280
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:30,160
and the knee pain would get intense again and i saw over and over again

281
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:37,440
how much overlay i put on it and slowly began to kind of simplify and simplify and not add all

282
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:43,760
these layers on top so that to me was incredibly inspiring

283
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:51,040
and it gave or gave gave birth to a kind of

284
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:57,680
inspiration of faith trust a confidence

285
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:03,680
that this was a useful to shift how i saw the pain

286
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:10,160
and so the this radical idea from this talk today is whenever you have suffering and

287
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:15,760
you're going to try to do take a dharmic approach to it like in meditation

288
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:21,359
see what the shift is if you stop calling it depression

289
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:28,240
anxiety despair grief sadness without any diminishing of it without

290
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:33,680
any disrespect for it of how what's happening for you but simply shift the

291
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:39,599
orientation to see it as just as pain and then breathe with that and see if

292
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:45,599
some of the layers that are extra the baggage on it begins to settle

293
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:52,240
if you get inspired like i i i was by that or have trust or confidence in it

294
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:58,800
that gives birth that's similar to what the buddha said that learning to see pain

295
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:03,920
suffering in a new way through practice through the eyes of the

296
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:09,599
past not clear seeing in this way he said that gives birth

297
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:15,839
to faith to confidence a kind of inspiration if then you

298
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:22,480
don't just get inspired but with that faith that confidence to us okay now i'm going to start

299
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:28,400
practicing this new way of seeing i'm going to stabilize it i'm going to use it more

300
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:34,079
and really kind of give myself to develop this new way of seeing

301
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:40,240
that's when the stream begins to flow and at first it might be just a trickling little stream up in the

302
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:46,960
mountain but if we want to get this stream to be to grow and develop we have to practice

303
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:53,359
it and so then we keep start practicing we have this inspiration

304
00:53:53,359 --> 00:54:00,480
and uh and if the inspiration can fuel the practice the the confident confusion

305
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:07,760
fuel the practice rather than continually falling back into the old patterns

306
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:15,760
that can give rise to gladness to a delight that we have a practice wow this is cool

307
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:22,800
i didn't know that i could live this new way it's hard it's challenging i doubt it at times but there are times when

308
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:29,599
it's really great and i think i'm on a path so the buddha said that once that faith

309
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:35,760
is there and we and we continue to practice without the practice probably nothing will happen

310
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:41,599
then with the practice then there comes a delight a gladness or a

311
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:48,319
satisfaction or a feeling this is right as that practice continues

312
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:54,640
and you start getting more evidence that this works as we get into the flow of the stream of practice

313
00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:00,160
and it becomes we are feeling this stream getting bigger and the stream starts to have a little bit more

314
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:05,599
momentum and initially it seems like we're doing the work but with time it just seems

315
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:10,720
like oh now it's it's it's that practice is doing me i'm kind of flowing along

316
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:18,000
here and and um and that being involved and being really engaged having been able to put

317
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:24,799
aside a lot of the distracted mind and the undistracted mind is really into

318
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:29,920
doing this practice seeing in a new way there's a kind of

319
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:36,079
physiological delight joy that comes and the buddha said that

320
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:44,720
if we keep practicing with the light with the uh from the delight there grows a joy

321
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:51,200
as we keep practicing and settle into this and really start feelings the beginning the fruit of this is really

322
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:56,240
works this is good the practice begins kind of growing

323
00:55:56,240 --> 00:56:03,040
the stream gets uh lands into a large lake that's calm and

324
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:10,559
very tranquil and um and tranquility sets in it's like there's an ease a certain like oh

325
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:16,960
i have something here that really works i don't have to be so agitated or so anxious anymore because i have this

326
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:23,680
practice the practice really helps me to see in a new way i can't always do it but just knowing i

327
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:28,920
have the practice can make us less agitated

328
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,160
we keep practicing and that tranquility fills up it goes over the banks and beca creates

329
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:42,640
a different um river that's a smoother remember this big rivers get bigger and come down off

330
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:48,400
the mountain into the rivers and the plains they get big rivers can be very quiet

331
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:54,319
whereas in the mountains it's quite noisy rapids and boulders go over

332
00:56:54,319 --> 00:57:03,040
so it gets quieter it becomes something called uh happiness and a pleasure or a deep sublime feeling

333
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:09,839
it just feels so good to be in the flow that the buddha said gives birth to

334
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:16,480
concentration to really be present really be really here

335
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:23,119
that the buddha that the buddha said gives birth to seeing things as they are

336
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:30,160
which is now to get confirmation a real kind of qualitative

337
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:39,839
different kind of affirmation confirmation of the value of seeing in this new way

338
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:45,839
and now you see directly the evidence oh this really is significant

339
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:52,720
and uh to see things because things are constantly flowing and changing this natural world

340
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:59,040
to really see this flow and moving along and seeing how nothing gets stuck and nothing

341
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:05,280
nothing um gets frozen unless

342
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:12,079
we bring the baggage and the self and the attachments to it then things get solidified

343
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:18,880
but to see that without that baggage without that overlays that things just flow natural flow the

344
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:23,920
natural inconsistency of movement and so not only do we feel like

345
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:30,400
we're in the stream of practice but now we see the stream we see the flow

346
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:36,720
this feels so good so right so much clarity that there starts to be what the buddha

347
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:44,160
said gets more goats gets born is now a disinterest or a disenchantment

348
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:52,000
with the old way of seeing and now the old way of seeing through the ego egoist egoistically or

349
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:59,119
self-centeredly or with all the baggage and concerns and and or even some of the old cultural ways

350
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:05,280
familial ways we've learned to always see our life are seen you know maybe that's

351
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:12,480
not so accurate or not so useful to that lens and so we start becoming a disinterested

352
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:19,760
disenchanted with it and it begins to relax and fade away and that gives birth to the

353
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:24,799
further this fading away so seeing

354
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:32,720
things as they are gives birth to a disinterest a disenchantment which gives birth to

355
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:38,880
this movement of fading away of our attachments and when the attachments have faded away

356
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:44,000
enough then who knows when enough is enough but when they're enough

357
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:49,440
something lets go and we have liberation

358
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:57,599
liberation then flows further into a deep understanding of what this liberation is all about

359
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:05,119
and uh and one of things is about is now uh not just a confirmation

360
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:11,280
of the seeing in a new way but now inhabiting the new way of seeing

361
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,480
in a whole different like it becomes like who we are rather than something that we introduce

362
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:22,480
into our life so remarkably 2500 years ago

363
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:28,799
the buddha and the people around him who were practicing this you know really looking at their minds to understanding

364
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:35,920
their minds and understanding how to practice with these minds and hearts we have discovered this amazing

365
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:42,160
uh tools and capacities of the mind that then they described in i think

366
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:47,280
quite inspiring ways and uh and the

367
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:53,599
description i use today is something called liberative dependent arising

368
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:58,720
how liberation comes dependent on certain conditions being in place

369
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:06,160
and there's 12 steps and they are born on the basis of seeing suffering in a

370
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:11,200
new way that gives birth to faith

371
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:17,119
faith gives birth to delight the light gives birth to joy

372
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:23,119
joy gives birth to tranquility tranquility gives birth to

373
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:28,480
happiness happiness gives birth to concentration samadhi

374
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:34,559
samadhi gives birth to seeing things as they are seeing things as they are gives birth to

375
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:40,640
disinterest in attachments disinterest or this disenchantment gives

376
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:46,160
birth to fading away of attachments

377
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:52,160
the fading wave attachments is the condition that leads to the ending of attachments which is called

378
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:57,920
liberation and once there's liberation that's not the story doesn't end there

379
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:04,880
but then there's understanding what has happened and really understanding now we're living in the

380
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:09,759
world with new eyes seeing in a new way

381
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:16,480
and all this depends on itself the whole list depends on practicing

382
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:22,240
the practice we do is what uh that's the rain

383
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:29,760
uh that's and i love the analogy of rain because it's just drops little drops moment by moment that we're adding and

384
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:36,160
those drops are not inconsequential moments of mindfulness but the continuity of it

385
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:41,760
more and more over and over again so that it's you know not just the occasional drop

386
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:48,640
but it becomes a kind of a you know lots of rain falling on the parched ground

387
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:53,760
and uh and then overflowing and and building up the

388
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:59,200
the volume that allows the river to get bigger and bigger and bigger

389
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:05,920
so practice based on seeing in a new way

390
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:13,039
and so you might consider is there a new way to see

391
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:19,680
that you could try out is there a new way of seeing you'll do provisionally

392
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:25,760
meaning you don't have to accept it this is the absolute true way of seeing things but maybe it's just a different

393
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:31,280
orientation and different perspective and to see without any reference to me

394
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:37,280
myself and i without reference in past and future just see

395
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:43,839
pain see suffering just as pain very simply and see if that begins to loosen up the

396
01:03:43,839 --> 01:03:50,400
crust the solidification of all this extra baggage extra layers that we add on top

397
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,839
of the difficulties of this human life and if we

398
01:03:55,839 --> 01:04:02,400
those difficulties don't have all these extra layers maybe it's easier

399
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:09,200
and maybe we'll be inspired to practice because it's really worthwhile once we

400
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:16,480
get the start getting a glit glimpse of this new way of seeing it's really worthwhile to do what it

401
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:22,799
takes to let this glimpse become a bigger and more irregular part of our

402
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:29,920
life so um to see in a new way be passionate

403
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:35,760
may you see in a new way and may we as a community and uh

404
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:42,720
share that with each other and see each other in this new way and i think that

405
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:48,079
we'll end up with tremendous delight appreciation

406
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:53,960
for each other thank you very much
