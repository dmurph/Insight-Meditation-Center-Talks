00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:09,059
hello everyone and welcome happy to be here with you and

2
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:15,480
happy to read these chats those of you can read them there

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,060
lots of good mornings and lots of

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,279
warmth in those chat comments

5
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:34,860
and this is the theme of today is in fact to be happy or maybe to be

6
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:41,820
a little different word to be inspired inspired as a form of happiness

7
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,480
of delight of joy of gladness and it's inspiring to sit here with you

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,239
and to have the opportunity to appreciate

9
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,760
meditation the teachings community

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,299
that's so so widespread so thank you

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,760
and maybe to be a little provocative

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,720
for this meditation and I hope you allow yourself to be I don't know provoked is the right word

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,240
or evoked

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,479
and that is um to allow yourself to be inspired

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,000
and maybe the provocative question is why not be inspired

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,960
why hold back why

17
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:52,259
not recognize in spite of the challenges and by the

18
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:58,740
difficulties and the sufferings of yourself and your circumstance your world of our world

19
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:05,460
why not be inspired there is a tremendous amount of good in

20
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:12,480
this world there's a tremendous amount of people

21
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,319
in spite of also being the other who live lives of generosity

22
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:25,760
who support and help and do so much for others many of them are unrecognized and

23
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:33,300
unthanked even all the parents do so much for their children

24
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:39,780
to be inspired by the people who are ethical who are

25
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:48,480
honest who avoids sometimes at almost all costs too be

26
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,760
causing harm to others and to themselves to be inspired that

27
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,040
this is possible even if only a very few people in the world do it

28
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,099
wow it's possible the possibility is inspiring

29
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:13,040
but there's a lot of people who do it to be inspired by your ability

30
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:20,640
to be inspired by the almost divine

31
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:29,239
circumstance of being able to sit and meditate

32
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:39,680
regardless of how difficult again so much of your life is to have the circumstances sit quietly

33
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,640
to sit still in a place that has a modicum of safety

34
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:56,760
modicum of comfort and modicum of Demands perhaps on you

35
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,700
isn't there something about this that's Divine that's

36
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,239
the Heavenly just so different in ordinary life

37
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,799
and to be inspired to not be

38
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:24,720
chasing after desires of all kinds some people get up in the morning and

39
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,759
it just kind of going one way of analyzing a life is going after one

40
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,680
desire after another incessantly

41
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:44,400
so much of human Pursuit is the pursuit of comfort and pleasure

42
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,139
much more than people realize

43
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,440
so here to be inspired for these few minutes

44
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:05,100
here and inspired glad happy why not

45
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:09,800
why not be inspired in such a way

46
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:17,360
that you want to partake of this

47
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:25,699
potential this Heavenly capacity heaven like

48
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,440
to really appreciate it to really take it in to be nourished supported

49
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:39,360
in such a way that the heart can feel safe and contented and

50
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,160
happy your mind

51
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:53,699
the thinking mind is happy to be turned inward on this

52
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:59,220
experience here to become quiet and still

53
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,380
so that whatever the thinking mind is it can become quiet enough

54
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,560
that it really partakes of the goodness

55
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:16,139
that's here in you with you here

56
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:21,539
why not be inspired why not be glad

57
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:28,800
for what it for what is possible right now to be glad for to be happy for

58
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,940
to be happy with so to gently close the eyes

59
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:44,639
me and to feel here in your body

60
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,460
what is happening for you now after hearing these words

61
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:57,620
was anything touched was anything repelled

62
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:07,759
is there some is anything within that now you can take some time

63
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,460
to be glad about to be inspired

64
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,400
I like to think that the word inspired is related to the

65
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,080
Latin word for breathing

66
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,340
what is it that you can be

67
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,259
filled with gladness filled with the light happiness

68
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:08,120
in being filled with your breathing

69
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:31,860
and this idea of filling ourselves with every breath with presence with embodied awareness

70
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,760
and a gentle quieting inspiration to do so

71
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:44,360
where the path of practice is not linear

72
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,360
going down the path in a linear way to better and better

73
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:59,660
but the path is more like filling out filling ourselves more and more

74
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,160
with every breath

75
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:10,519
feeling out with awareness

76
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:16,100
embodied attention here now

77
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,120
with happiness riding along

78
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:39,320
inspiration riding along every breath

79
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:50,360
every movement of awareness of attention Here and Now

80
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:58,399
filled filling with peaceful inspiration

81
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:06,600
why not be happy inspired

82
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:14,280
why prioritize thoughts that are unhappy

83
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:22,500
that are nothing to do with Here and Now why prioritize feelings that might be

84
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,780
but other things why not

85
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:35,299
be happy with what is good right now

86
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:43,460
inspired by the Simplicity of being here breathing

87
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:13,919
and as we come to the end of the sitting why not be happy

88
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:20,880
even if the happiness is modest why not

89
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,880
be available to that modest inspiration or happiness

90
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,779
gladness Here and Now

91
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:40,620
and is there a kind of Happiness inspiration

92
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:49,460
that supports you in being more

93
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:57,559
receptive available now here

94
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:09,140
so you're not asserting yourself on the world or close down to the world

95
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:15,240
but in that happiness as modest as it is

96
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:21,500
more available to be present to be receptive

97
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:32,580
to discover how others are by stopping and being

98
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,880
available

99
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:47,240
maybe it embodied a pause to

100
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,840
receive register be available to others

101
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:06,840
where others the experience of others is received

102
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,278
in your happiness

103
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:29,840
and maybe from some even modest happiness Within

104
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:37,440
after having taken the time to know others to feel others experience others

105
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,059
to wish them well

106
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:53,340
May those who I'm aware of this day

107
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,960
may they be happy

108
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,880
May those who I take the time to know

109
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:10,880
may they be happy and safe

110
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:21,260
May those who I take time to have empathy

111
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,159
may they be peaceful

112
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,059
May those who take time to really register

113
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:38,159
make room for allow them to be here

114
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,440
in the fullness of my awareness

115
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:51,419
may they be free as they are free in my attention

116
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:56,460
without the hindrances without desires and resistance

117
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:03,200
they freely in my awareness may they be free too

118
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:13,860
may all beings be happy and may we contribute to the welfare

119
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:19,820
to the benefit and Welfare of the whole world

120
00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:34,559
[Music]

121
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:46,860
thank you so hello everyone and

122
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:51,960
continuing on the theme and I was thinking we're just this

123
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:58,020
morning that this theme of I call it ready for change

124
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:05,520
is um seemed perfect for the end of the year or getting ready for the new year

125
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:10,559
to look forward a little bit to the new year that we are preparing ourselves so

126
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:19,260
that we can be changed in a good way beneficial way with what comes in this new time

127
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:24,480
so how do we prepare ourselves and so for the Buddha he prepared people

128
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,299
for his liberating insights he would give Dharma talks that created certain

129
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:35,460
mind States for people or kind of created is the right word but inspired it in people

130
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:40,980
and so those there were five things that he when he saw were present in people he

131
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:46,620
would give them their his deepest teachings and those five things that uh that he's

132
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:52,020
recognized in people's minds was there was a Readiness a receptivity

133
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:58,740
there was there is a malleability a workability of the Mind

134
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:04,559
the mind is soft enough to really you know take something in and be changed by it

135
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,720
they're free of the hindrances and the usual translation for the fourth

136
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:16,260
one is for today is elated to be I think inspired is a good way of

137
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:21,659
talking about it and then we'll talk about tomorrow is

138
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:27,120
um as the usual translation is confidence I like the word trust there

139
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:33,720
and we'll talk more about it tomorrow though where it also means kind of voluminously bright

140
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:40,260
so um but today is elated so there's a way of being inspired that certainly can

141
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:47,940
be so preoccupying so we can lose ourselves in it that we're not available to the world

142
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:54,500
and to experience the teachings to be changed by it but it's also possible to be inspired or

143
00:32:54,500 --> 00:33:02,640
or gladdened or elated in such a way that the mind gets quieter still to

144
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,740
really now listen well to really take into really allow the experience of the

145
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:13,980
moment to really penetrate deeply and um and so that's the second type of

146
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:19,620
inspiration is uh what I think the Buddha was pointing towards

147
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:25,019
and so this word um to be inspired and

148
00:33:25,019 --> 00:33:30,600
um and uh or to be elated or to be happy

149
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:36,360
in a way so the Buddha uh would Inspire that in

150
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:43,559
people uh the classic Tech say that by giving a talk giving Dharma talks that

151
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:52,080
covered a range of of themes that I think were inspiring were really got people's

152
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,140
attention really they got kind of absorbed in a sense concentrated

153
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:03,600
in in the talk and these five qualities are all the qualities of a kind of absorbed

154
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:10,560
concentrated mind like really present and so he'd give talks about generosity

155
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,980
and I don't know we don't know what he says no they don't specify the text so uh you know what

156
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:25,080
exactly he said but so what that means to me is that when it's unspecified then it's up to us

157
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:31,080
for ourselves to understand to figure out how do we get really inspired

158
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:36,780
how do we become a better person by reflecting on considering the topic of

159
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:42,780
generosity for me I lived for years in you know

160
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:49,080
secluded from the world you know living in deep mountainous monasteries

161
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:55,020
um in in here in this country and in Asia and it was lovely it was uh fantastic

162
00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:00,380
for me and um no regrets having done that

163
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:07,320
and and it's quite wondrous to be in society here I am in Redwood City in a

164
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:12,359
in this middle of a city and to living the kind of the full life

165
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:17,760
of a householder here and uh and to see how much generosity

166
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:24,839
there is that I never knew when I was younger knew about and um and you know for example raising

167
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:31,680
children here and uh seeing all the adults so many who were putting on

168
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:38,400
sports events and coaches and um all kinds of things are volunteering

169
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:45,240
their time their generosity to make a rich life for the children growing up here and I think it's really something

170
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:52,440
to experience so much generosity for children there could have been more certainly but what I saw was you know

171
00:35:52,440 --> 00:36:00,780
inspiring and then uh caring for my mother as she uh aged and and then you know went

172
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:06,660
through her dementia and and died again I saw so much generosity the particular

173
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:12,240
care place where she was she was in it was phenomenal to me the

174
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:18,480
generosity the care the kindness of love that she received and there were so there also there were so many volunteers

175
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,640
who came to offer extra things for the people there the care home and musicians

176
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:31,020
who came and played and artists and all kinds of things that came and did things with people there

177
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:38,820
and then I live here you know I came here to this place in Redwood City right uh IMC is I think of as kind of like mid

178
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:44,820
in the middle of the city and um and it's become a wonderful

179
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:51,000
collection here of so many generous people I mean the IMC is completely run

180
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,460
by volunteers and volunteers volunteer out of the generosity out of their care

181
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:02,520
or their love their happiness and um and to be kind of experiencing

182
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:09,660
the growth this phenomenal kind of outpouring of generosity that's allowed this community to grow

183
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:15,000
and develop and we do so much here and and our at our Retreat Center so

184
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,400
inspired this there's a lot of generosity that's inspiring it brings

185
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:27,119
out the best in people and does something to my heart that just makes it kind of open and soften and

186
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:34,920
and then there's ethics to be inspired by people's ethics there's plenty of if you read the news of course there's not

187
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:42,300
the opposite of being ethical uh virtue doesn't stand high in front page news

188
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:49,320
but uh for every horrible story and in the news there are lots and lots and

189
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:57,119
lots of unsung heroes of Ethics people who have committed to to being honest to

190
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:04,980
be to not steal not kill not lie and you know a lot of this what

191
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:10,079
they people don't do is never seen because there's nothing to

192
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,119
see and so it's not celebrated it's not appreciated but there's a phenomenal

193
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:21,420
amount of of ethical people in the world and I see lots of little examples as I

194
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:29,339
go through my day and there's plenty of examples of the opposite of course but where does our minds settle on what

195
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:37,160
does it focus on what is the world we want to live in do we want to live in the world of of

196
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:44,099
uh unethical world do we want to live in an ethical world if we want an ethical World be ethical

197
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:50,339
love ethics love virtue love this kind of and um and recognize it see it

198
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:55,859
appreciate how much it's here to be inspired by it and then the

199
00:38:55,859 --> 00:39:01,440
absence of the hindrances is uh in the Buddhist teachings is a is

200
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:10,440
meant to be a source of gladness a source of contentment of Happiness wow finally uh I'm not uh in debt not in

201
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:16,500
prison not a slave to the hindrances something else I'm not now I'm here and

202
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:23,400
kind certain kind of way more in charge rather than hindrances and desires charge

203
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:29,480
and then the Buddha gave a part of this series of talks was he gave a talk on the first hindrance

204
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:35,099
an essential desire so as a hindrance it's clear it's a problem

205
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:43,200
and uh but I think he highlighted as being a particular characteristic of the human realm is

206
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:50,220
that people are very driven by sensual desire and sensual comfort and um and there's a way in which that

207
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:56,460
there's dangers in pursuing sensual desires lots of people make all kinds of

208
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:01,980
horrible mistakes and suffering in the world and harm others through the pursuit of sensual desires of different

209
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:07,020
types there's um uh he talked about the

210
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:13,079
dangers of it he talked about the vanity of sensual desires it's interesting to kind of think how

211
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:18,180
vanity or conceit is part of it especially when it hurts other people

212
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:25,980
and he talked about the the stain of sensual desire and in the modern

213
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:31,920
kind of English-speaking world but I don't think we like so much to think about that their stains but there's a

214
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:39,000
way in which we feel kind of you know if we really feel some of the ways that people act around sensual desire where

215
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,780
they objectify other people for example and it's all about their own pleasure and not about a human connection

216
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:52,680
um there's a stain there's a diminishment there's a contraction Within and to feel the benefit of the ethical

217
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:59,640
dimension of how to live with our sensuality ethically they can be inspiring

218
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:06,119
to feel this so to be inspired by this to feel goodness of it

219
00:41:06,119 --> 00:41:14,280
to feel the the what's going right in our life so that we have the right balance of

220
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:20,099
input into our hearts so that our heart is not weighed down or struggling

221
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:27,960
and how do we get the right input how do we get inspired enough not the Inspire inspiration where we

222
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,900
lose ourselves but you know uh you know but rather the inspiration that allows

223
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:39,900
for a deep kind of availability full presence for this world and for

224
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:45,540
experience and for here so that we're ready to be changed

225
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:50,700
we're happy the unhappy is to not the opposite of

226
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:57,540
being ready for change is to be maybe caught and tight and limited and

227
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:03,180
deflated and but to be happy in a way yes

228
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:08,400
I have the courage I have the willingness I have the availability of

229
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,520
trying something new of trying a new way and being a new way of letting go of

230
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:22,040
some places where I'm stuck letting go of some things I'm holding on to yes I'm available

231
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:28,338
so um the

232
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:35,220
so these are all wholesome qualities and Buddha said

233
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:41,400
it's possible to cultivate the wholesome if it's not possible to cultivate the

234
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,619
wholesome I would not tell you to do so but it is possible to cultivate the

235
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:51,900
wholesome and so that's my instruction and so here these are some of the

236
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:59,220
wholesome qualities that the Buddha kind of held up as being valuable in

237
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:05,640
preparing to be changed to be open to really let the full impact of this Dharma practice work

238
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:11,579
and um so to be ready

239
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:19,680
to be malleable a malleable mind to be ever ready it's all about the mind it says Ready mind a malleable mind a mind

240
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:28,200
free of the hindrances an inspired mind and then tomorrow it's the trusting mind

241
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:35,460
luminous mind so um so

242
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:41,280
for today if you'd like for your homework your life work

243
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:49,140
is to um see if you can be

244
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:56,339
not exactly happier but see if you can tune in to the parts of what's Happening Here in

245
00:43:56,339 --> 00:44:04,760
this life of yours that does make you happy glad inspired

246
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:10,380
don't give so much notice how much priority statistically you know in terms

247
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:17,819
of time uh how much priority you give to things which are the opposite of inspiring the

248
00:44:17,819 --> 00:44:23,640
opposite of making you happy because whatever your mind is involved

249
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,980
in think about does have an impact on our mood our emotions our hearts

250
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:34,079
and is your mind spending a lot of time with things which are not inspiring and not

251
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:41,400
uh happy producing and if and can you switch the the

252
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:47,700
percentage to have more percentage of the time not all the time but just maybe just you

253
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:55,440
know ten percent more focused on what's inspiring what's happy and good I love the word

254
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,480
good these days and what is really good what's the goodness

255
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:07,980
of the moment here so thank you I hope that this homework

256
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:13,500
life work of inspiration is good for you and good for the people

257
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,900
around you today thank you
