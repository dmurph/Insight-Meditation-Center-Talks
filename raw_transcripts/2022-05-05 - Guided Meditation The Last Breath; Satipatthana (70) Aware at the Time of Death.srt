1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:07,519
so good morning everyone good day and uh

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,599
we're coming now to the

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,560
we're coming now to the in the very end of this series on

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,920
on this and um

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,399
and it's uh there's a practice that is offered by the buddha

6
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,480
for the purposes of ending sorrow lamentation suffering

7
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:54,160
distress for the purification of beings for the attainment of

8
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,719
nibana or liberation it's uh designed to address some of the

9
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:08,159
most fundamental existential issues of that humans can have

10
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:14,880
and while it's sometimes taught in the modern world mindfulness at least is thought for stress reduction

11
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:22,159
this satibatana discourse is really being taught here for the highest

12
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:30,159
realization of the end of suffering and in this regard it's often

13
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:40,400
and traditionally this practice of sati patana is considered to be the

14
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,040
best practice to have as a person is dying so to learn this practice well and have

15
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,479
it close at hand and then to just as as we're dying to have this

16
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:01,360
available to know to value it to be able to do it with some yeas not

17
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,719
as a forceful practice but as almost as a natural expression of

18
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:13,440
life as we're dying and there's a teachings the buddha gave to his son

19
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:20,720
that he said that if someone cultivates mindfulness in this case he was talking about mindfulness of breathing

20
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,760
that a person will know their last inhale

21
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,720
and last exhale as it ceases as it ends

22
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,920
the tradition says that this means that the person will die calmly

23
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,920
but i believe it's deeper than that that there's something about being calmly present

24
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,879
for one and really present for one's last breath without being afraid without being angry without being

25
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,800
distressed is a phenomenal opportunity phenomenally

26
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,040
wonderful and important way to die and

27
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,879
and so the question for this meditation for you is that what is it

28
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,640
about being present for the end of especially the exhale but

29
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,120
the end of the inhale the end into the exhale as if it's once last exhale

30
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:27,120
once last inhale and that one follows it all the way out calmly

31
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,760
and what's available there in terms of letting go in terms of peace

32
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,799
what is it and that's kind of the question i'd like to leave you for here

33
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,560
for this meditation is that as you settle down and are present

34
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,760
what um what might there be there with

35
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,879
riding tracking the ending of the inhale the ending of

36
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,159
the exhale that is invaluable

37
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:07,599
at the time of dying the ceasing the letting go the releasing

38
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:13,200
and perhaps during this sitting with all that we've done now these months on sativatana and

39
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,759
being present for experience maybe there can be this question that you and did you engage in with every

40
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,120
exhale every inhale what is it

41
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,160
um what is it about that exhale what happens there what's available

42
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,720
there what's the possibility there what's what is it that is is uh

43
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,360
so important so valuable that the buddha is pointing to

44
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,639
and i suggest that if you take this up as a way of being present today this

45
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,320
question that you don't answer it analytically you don't answer it cognitively so much

46
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,360
that might come as a byproduct but rather

47
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:07,120
in the stillness of the mind the answer is in the stillness and the silence and the peacefulness

48
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:14,160
but have a question and see what what comes

49
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,280
and then we'll just sit here today quietly and you have

50
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,919
had lots of instructions here and guidance and today

51
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:43,560
you're left here with yourself and your own breathing

52
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,839
so

53
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:13,399
sitting here as if each exhale will be your last exhale ever

54
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,480
being there fully for the exhale

55
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,920
and the letting go

56
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,438
so

57
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,000
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

58
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:44,320
what place of quiet stillness is available for you

59
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:52,080
at the end of the exhale or any place at all

60
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:58,960
that be a valuable way to sit next to someone who's dying

61
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:05,200
to be present for them with care and

62
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:09,679
value and kindness with love

63
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,720
and as their about to take their last breath

64
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:34,000
and to use the analogy of the last breath maybe highlights the preciousness

65
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:41,600
of life the value ever present value

66
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:48,480
of showing up and being present for what is here for the people in our lives

67
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,039
not distracted not caught in the hindrances

68
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,480
maybe not caught up in judgments and projections

69
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,399
but to be able to be present really present with a quiet heart quiet

70
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:15,440
mind at times is one of the best deepest ways

71
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,240
to find our

72
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,720
deep connection to each other whether

73
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:33,760
we know it or not we are in fact deeply connected

74
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:40,960
and perhaps this satipatta practice can help us to

75
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:48,480
sit freely and peacefully intimately

76
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:55,840
with that connection free of clinging

77
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:06,799
and with care may we care for everyone

78
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:13,600
all the people suffering all the people going through this human life

79
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,039
may it be that they are happy

80
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:24,480
may it be that they find safety

81
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:32,960
may it be that they find peace

82
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,279
may it be that they find freedom

83
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:49,120
may we pray we live for the welfare and benefit and care

84
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,000
of everyone we encounter

85
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:59,229
[Music]

86
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:10,609
[Music]

87
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:30,760
so good morning and we're coming to the penultimate

88
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,840
talk on satypatana

89
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:44,640
and after all these months now over four months of going through it slowly

90
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,480
and coming to the end and we'll all come to an end at some

91
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,600
point and this sativatana practice

92
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:02,720
is considered to be one of the greatest practices to do as we're dying

93
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:08,159
and the

94
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:13,440
you know if we if we wait until we're dying to begin our practice

95
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,200
we won't have we won't have developed our practice we want to have the practice won't be there as a strong

96
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,519
resource for us at those times and

97
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,360
the what i've learned through this sativatana practice

98
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:38,398
um and been doing it doing this practice for now many decades

99
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:45,679
it uh generally gives me a very uh positive feeling about dying my

100
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:51,440
relationship to my death is if i'm lucky to die

101
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,360
consciously and without dementia or without too much

102
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:03,919
pain that um i just anticipated to be being one of the great

103
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:09,679
things to be present for and this letting go that undoubtedly undoubtedly undoubtedly

104
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,840
happens there as we're dying is one of the best things going really wonderful thing to do the experience

105
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:23,519
that i've had of letting go deeply and deeply deeply i now kind of associate that also with dying

106
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:30,480
and so i don't feel that dying is so much an end as it is a

107
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:36,799
a releasing and letting go and letting go into i don't know but

108
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:42,080
they uh i don't it doesn't matter so much to me what we're letting go into

109
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:48,960
um maybe nothing but just the letting go is so so wonderful so peaceful so

110
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,000
happiness so freeing

111
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,360
so to to consider this practice we've been doing all these months

112
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,559
that one of the purposes for it is uh to come to terms with find our

113
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:12,158
peace find our our center in our freedom uh in relationship to some of the

114
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:18,560
deepest and most challenging aspects of human life and this is why i think

115
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:24,320
you know this is kind of represented by how the text begins

116
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,440
and how it uh it ends in the end it goes

117
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,760
um so this so it was with re reference to this

118
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,599
that it has said this is a direct path for the purification of beings for the

119
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,878
surmounting of sorrow and lamentation for the disappearance of pain and grief

120
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:52,398
for the attainment of the way for the realization of nibanam namely

121
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:58,000
the four foundations for awareness and um

122
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:03,680
so in some terrible countries or you know temples or

123
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:10,320
often there's a practice of of reciting this as someone is dying or after they've

124
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,760
died because of its this associated there's a very close association with the practice

125
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:22,560
of satipatana as we're dying one of the ways to appreciate this is

126
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:29,280
that you know as we're as we're dying that all kinds of things no longer are

127
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,920
that important and uh when you know we're not in the last our last breaths we're not

128
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:43,040
uh concerned about whether or not we need to buy more socks or not or you know what are we gonna have for

129
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:49,440
supper what is all kinds of things that and

130
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:56,000
and you know and to be able to let go of concerns and thoughts which are not relevant at that

131
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,359
time to be able to let go of fears desires distress

132
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:07,599
to really kind of not have that get in the way of the fullness of the moment that

133
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,760
the opportunity of the moment and to this practice teaches us

134
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:20,880
that we have something better to do than be distressed something better to do than being afraid something better to

135
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:27,839
do than being lost in fantasy and thoughts and projections and ideas

136
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:35,040
not that we can necessarily put all those things aside but our our life and interest the energy the

137
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:41,599
attention doesn't go there anymore we can let go of it and and focus on this practice of sati

138
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:49,280
patana practice of being aware and being awake being present that that is the better alternative than

139
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:56,079
so many of the ways our minds can go and uh to practice at the patara this

140
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:02,240
practice of mindfulness a lot uh helps us to see over and over again in a deeper clearer way

141
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:08,720
how it's the better alternative how it's the this is where life is found freedom is

142
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:15,760
found peace is found more often than what else the other things the mind is doing

143
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,800
and the compulsion to uh of some certain

144
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,960
our thoughts and certain ones of our feelings and attitudes as much as they might seem important to

145
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,240
us through this practice we see that there's something better to do

146
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,880
there's something much more freeing much more peaceful some much more alive much more satisfying

147
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:44,240
to do than um uh thinking about our resentments

148
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:50,640
thinking about wrong how other people are wrong thinking about

149
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,680
regrets we have over our lifetime i mean all those things can have a place in

150
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:02,079
life but to realize that they're not the best alternative they're not the best place

151
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:07,280
the most valuable place to be do not invest so much in so many things

152
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:14,160
which are uh to our detriment that diminish us that our wind drag for us ourselves

153
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,200
and to know what where what's the best alternative to see that

154
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,720
being awake being aware being present is the best alternative going

155
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:31,760
even even at the very beginning i mean at the very end this last breath

156
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:38,320
that we have what's the best thing to do at that point would you would you know that do you

157
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,839
have a fa feel really feel this is how you want that last breath to be

158
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:50,480

159
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:56,880
i hope that it's uh you know there's really something there and then maybe there's a letting go of

160
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:03,359
the world around you even and the relationships at that for that breath maybe there's a letting go into being

161
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:09,680
awake into being aware letting go into release letting go

162
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,119

164
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,640

165
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:35,359
essential deepest aspects of our life and death represents that but there's all kinds of suffering that

166

human beings have um that the human realm is filled with suffering and

167
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,280
challenges and how do we meet it how do we address it

168

how do we find our way through it and for the buddha

169
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,160
