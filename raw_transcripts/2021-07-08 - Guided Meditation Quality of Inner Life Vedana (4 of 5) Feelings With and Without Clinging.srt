1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,960
so good morning good day everyone and

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,920
happy to have this time with you and to share the dharma and to meditate

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:20,000
together and um you know the topic this week is

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,199
the vedana the feeling tones of our experience

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,960
and there are layers of such within us or there's a kind of journey and practice to go in a

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,719
sense deeper and deeper to discover edina's feelings

7
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:45,760
of pleasant and unpleasant feelings which are reliable or supportive for us and to

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,199
not invest so much in feelings which are not reliable

9
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:59,280
and the idea is that this sensual feelings as valuable as it

10
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,119
sometimes can be can be are more unreliable they're not enduring

11
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:11,200
they need the senses need to be continually stimulated and there's something to be found deeper

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:19,439
inside and one way to access it is to or think about it is to

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,039
think of it as the

14
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,240
the quality of our inner being you know below the surface below our

15
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,200
concerns for what's happening with us in our daily life and our relationship to other people and the

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,119
comfort levels of our lives that as they occur in the moment uh

17
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:50,079
if we really kind of settle into the inner life what quality is that

18
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:57,200
what's what's the feeling tone of that and is it a place of comfort and warmth and

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,159
well-being or is it a place of anxiety and distress or anger

20
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,200
annoyance what is down there

21
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,640
and uh and then depending on how it is it's possible to see it as either being

22
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,720
pleasant or unpleasant and seeing it with that simplicity is meant to be a way of

23
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,080
kind of being a little bit free of it not not getting entangled in the complexity

24
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,160
of it just very simple that aspect of it that's pleasant or unpleasant or neither

25
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,879
to see that and what i'd like to propose for this sitting as you settle down and connect

26
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:45,840
to deeper and deeper within you that if what you find is unpleasant

27
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:54,640
is that uh you gotta tell yourself not that that's not that's not it that's not it

28
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:02,560
so you keep kind of stepping back or looking deeper because one of the places of

29
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:10,879
the wonderfulness is the awareness that knows what's happening

30
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,080
so we don't need to get entangled or caught in what is unpleasant

31
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:24,000
because we're we can keep kind of kind of going deeper or settling back more and recognizing that

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,159
simply being aware perceiving being mindful in there

33
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,200
there is some freedom from the unpleasant and that kind of freedom that kind of

34
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,239
clarity of mindfulness clear recognition has a kind of

35
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:47,280
pleasure to it kind of goodness to it that's where we begin tapping into something like well-being

36
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,720
within and if along the way before you discover

37
00:03:52,720 --> 00:04:00,400
that kind of freedom of awareness there are if you do find that the inner life has some pleasantness

38
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,519
warmth to it or goodness to it um that too is you know not it

39
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:15,599
no not this not this but to do it with no aversion with no sense of pushing it away but rather more

40
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:22,880
like as a way of keep opening to opening and opening to um

41
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:30,479
so we're not not stuck with anything so assume taking a meditation posture

42
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,560
that's supportive for you

43
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:43,840
and to take a few long slow deep breaths

44
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:52,400
kind of deep breaths of initiation that you're stepping into

45
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:02,560
a sacred dimension and you initiate yourself into this inner world

46
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:11,840
of awareness of here and now

47
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,520
letting go of thoughts and concerns of the day

48
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,720
as you exhale settling into your body

49
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,479
and then letting your breathing return to normal

50
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,840
and perhaps if you relax your body further

51
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,000
with the relaxation being settling in deeper and deeper into your

52
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,199
body your being tension is a way of being at the surface

53
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,639
of our body there's a tense surface tension relaxes

54
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:10,160
we can maybe settle in on the exhale relaxing the face

55
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:35,840
on the exhale relaxing the shoulders

56
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:49,840
on the exhale softening the belly

57
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,840
and then the exhale relaxing the mind

58
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:12,000
any tension associated with thinking let that soften quiet

59
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:19,840
relax any contraction associated with thinking

60
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:31,840
let that open up

61
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,479
and then settling into your breathing

62
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:55,039
and for a few breaths think of the breaths the breathing this

63
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:03,199
the rhythm of breathing as a guide inward

64
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:13,840
to your inner life your inner quality of your inner state

65
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,599
breathing with it letting go of thoughts enough so you can

66
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:41,839
sense and feel here and now how you are deep inside

67
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,839
and if you really feel yourself inside within

68
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:21,839
how are you how are you really

69
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:34,160
and notice if it's pleasant or unpleasant or neither keep it that simple and

70
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:41,680
rather than getting pulled into the complexity of it simply be aware

71
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,920
of how it's pleasant or unpleasant

72
00:13:47,360 --> 00:14:03,839
maybe that can be a perspective that gives you some freedom

73
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,639
feeling yourself deep inside and

74
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:36,399
maybe tell yourself not this this is not the heart of the matter

75
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:45,839
no aversion no desire

76
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,959
just freedom in relationship to how you feel

77
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:59,279
as you search deeper and deeper within

78
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:13,839
to a place of freedom

79
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:58,480
a freedom that's not separate from flowing along with the rhythm of

80
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,839
breathing

81
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:25,600
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

82
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:34,320
to whatever degree you're aware of having a inner life

83
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,840
or not an inner life maybe seems too complicated

84
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:46,799
you have an inner place where you feel the depths of life

85
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:54,240
the depths of yourself the places that are most

86
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,640
intimate and tender

87
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:06,400
the places inside which maintain the more enduring

88
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:11,760
feelings about just being alive and being present

89
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:21,840
and this is a part of ourselves to care for

90
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,240
to respect to love

91
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,039
to nourish and support

92
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:41,600
and just as you have such an inner life a feeling tone a place of depth that

93
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:48,000
inside where your greatest capacity for peace and

94
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,120
happiness reside

95
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,320
so do others have this and we know that this inner world that

96
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,279
we have can be in turmoil and be challenging

97
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,840
and that life challenges it in all kinds of ways

98
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:20,000
but if we realize that others have this inner depth this inner capacity potential

99
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,519
and this is where the greatest well-being and happiness resides

100
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:35,679
perhaps we can look beyond the surface behavior and activities of people and have some care

101
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:45,840
for them as so as a being of depth some attention some respect

102
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:52,720
maybe even reverence for the potential everyone has in the

103
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:59,440
depths of their inner intimacy and tenderness

104
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,880
and if they're not peaceful there they're suffering

105
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,200
and to be attuned to this depth in others

106
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,320
and from that connection to them to wish them well

107
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:27,840
to relate to them with compassion and kindness

108
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:36,399
and to wish for them the best may their inner life

109
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:43,278
be happy and find real welfare and benefit

110
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:51,360
may all beings be happy

111
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:58,960
in their core may all beings be safe

112
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:08,480
and so feel safe at the very core of the being

113
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:15,440
may all beings be peaceful deep inside

114
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:22,080
the core of who they are may they know peace

115
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:30,240
may all beings be free may their good hearts be set free

116
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:37,919
so they too can live for the welfare and happiness of others

117
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:45,440
may we all live for each other's care may we all

118
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,840
have it as our concern the welfare and happiness of others

119
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,600
for this fourth talk on vedana

120
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,919
feeling tones the

121
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:32,000
we have a capacity to recognize the

122
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,840
when things are pleasant when things are unpleasant and when they're neither

123
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:43,440
pleasant or unpleasant if we don't recognize it sometimes if we

124
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:52,799
do then there can be these underlying tendencies these habits of mind or um

125
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:59,360
drives of the mind that can pick up kind of almost automatically maybe even take

126
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:05,279
over so when there's in the presence of something that's pleasant

127
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:12,399
there can be strong desire there can be desire wanting in the presence of something

128
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:19,360
which is unpleasant there can be aversion there can be pushing away there can be

129
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:25,840
not wanting it and in the presence of what is neither pleasant or unpleasant

130
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:33,279
there can be confusion there can be delusion partly because if we're very oriented to

131
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:38,480
looking for what's pleasant and unpleasant and that's kind of you know for some

132
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:45,600
people a fundamental orientation to find their way in their world always looking for pleasure

133
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:53,039
in fact i think from some people who practice mindfulness and really start seeing what is operating in their minds in the

134
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,880
hearts when they go through the world it can be quite an embarrassment or a shock to discover

135
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,080
how much we're motivated by pleasant and unpleasant and how much we react to that

136
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:10,000
and search for it and then we can appreciate when things are neither pleasant or unpleasant

137
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,480
there can be confusion not sure which way to go or what to do or there can be delusion where we kind

138
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:23,279
of make up fantasies to fill in the gap for the kind of the vacuum the fantasies of

139
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:30,880
you know pleasant fantasies unpleasant fantasies kind of to fill it in and make it understandable

140
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:38,320
so these fundamental drives these underlying tendencies can get triggered can be awakened

141
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:45,840
or kind of waiting in the wing ready to step up if uh in the presence of

142
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:55,039
what's pleasant unpleasant or neither if we can be aware

143
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:01,120
of things being pleasant and unpleasant or neither really be aware how this

144
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,480
clear recognition talked about recently the clear recognition the clear

145
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,398
comprehension now this is pleasant it makes things a lot simpler

146
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,520
not to be simplistic or reductionistic but it gives us a very realistic and

147
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:26,240
helpful kind of kind of perspective that helps us to uh to to leave pleasant and unpleasant

148
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:34,480
alone and not have the automatic underlying tendencies kick in and move along

149
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,878
and so you know situations can be quite complicated and if we try to react and respond and

150
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:48,000
figure out the complication of it we might actually get pulled in and the desires and the versions kind of get

151
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,720
have it have the in in a sense to start operating by making it very simple oh that's an

152
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:01,359
unpleasant situation that's uncomfortable sometimes we don't get pulled in or

153
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:07,920
sucked in in such a way that the desires and aversions kind of maybe sneak in through the back

154
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,720
door and so oh it's it's unpleasant if we can see it clearly

155
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,560
then there's a way in which that seek clear seeing doesn't make room for the underlying

156
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,960
tendencies to come and get involved or if they arise it's so clear that

157
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:32,320
they're there that you know we don't have to do anything with that leave it alone there's a desire for more of some

158
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,440
pleasant and so you see it's just a desire or there's aversion to something

159
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,960
unpleasant it's just an aversion for some of us desires are a dime a

160
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,000
dozen for others of us aversions are a dime or a dozen but if

161
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,760
we're an automatic pilot or give ourselves over or give ourselves up or you know

162
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,240
just yield constantly to desire an aversion it's an exhausting life and it's not a

163
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,440
free life so to begin kind of um clearly

164
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,359
recognizing this is pleasant this is unpleasant and not me having you know not

165
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:17,599
having a back door open for desire and aversion or confusion or delusion to operate

166
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:24,320
to come in and sweep us away is one of the very powerful things about this

167
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:30,960
and um the um um

168
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:40,000
and as we don't get swept away as desires and aversions don't desires

169
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,720
desires here is more like compulsive desires don't take over then there starts to be

170
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:53,520
space for non desire non aversion

171
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,839
non-clinging non-grasping non-pushing away non-hostility

172
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:07,359
and that space that opens up is a pleasant space that space

173
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:14,079
is uh is a feeling is a place where the there starts the breathing room for

174
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,839
our inner life breathing room for other energies or forces or

175
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:24,800
sentiments to begin appearing and bubbling up

176
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:30,480
you know it allows for equanimity to be there and equanimity is not a neutral thing

177
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,680
it comes with a very strong sense of well-being when it's strong when it's strong

178
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:43,440
there's room for generosity room for kindness and love there's room for delight and joy

179
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,920
and appreciation there's so much more room for these good qualities in the heart

180
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,960
when there's no clinging and there's no grasping on things

181
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:02,079
and so the buddha made a distinction between those feeling feeling tones which

182
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:09,760
come along with this compulsive desires and aversions and confusions and delusions we have

183
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,119
that there's part and parcel of it you know if i win the california lottery

184
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:21,520
and i have a lot of greed for that i could be very happy or joyful or delighted for a while

185
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:28,000
but it's a joy that comes with a strong perhaps attachment clinging to wealth and all

186
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,400
the fantastic things i can do with it and um and you know i've

187
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,560
i've read that uh they've done studies of people who won lotteries and a year after the law they won these big

188
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,599
pots of money they're actually less happy than they were before

189
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:51,920
so uh how much how much do we uh hope to be put into

190
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,680
uh goes along with compulsive desire and aversion that is going to fix us and

191
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:04,079
do something and it doesn't so the um the alternative is to let go

192
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,599
and to this non-clinging and there is a joy and delight and pleasantness

193
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:15,920
pleasant experiences that come with that and um and so the buddha makes a distinction between these two kinds of

194
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:22,640
pleasantness and two kinds of unpleasantness the unpleasantness of letting go

195
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:28,480
is that to know that there is more letting go to do and sometimes they feel longing or feel

196
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:35,359
kind of like something's not quite right here it's a little unpleasant to still feel that i'm contracted and tight

197
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:43,280
because i know something now about freedom and and so making that distinction

198
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:48,720
is between the feeling tones that arise from

199
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,400
that are associated with clinging and the feeling tones that are associated with non-clinging

200
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,880
the buddha refers to into a few different ways one way is literally he says the first

201
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:07,599
is of the flesh and the other is not of the flesh and i think how i interpret that is that

202
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:15,359
of the flesh means that places where all our ordinary sense

203
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:24,480
apparatus are operating touch and taste and seeing and hearing that our senses are stimulated

204
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,240
and not of the flesh means that there's something that wells up from within that happens independent of what's

205
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:38,480
happening in our environment and independent of what's happening with our um you know what's feeding or or impacting

206
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:45,760
or conceit or the mental attachments we have so if our mental attachments are

207
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,680
challenged or supported there can be a kind of inner well-being that's not of the senses

208
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:57,839
but it's the mental sense then it's operating something's being stimulated like that

209
00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:04,000
there's a beautiful quality welling up inside it almost feels like that's not of the flesh

210
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,240
it almost feels like it's there for no reason it's just the natural kind of feels almost like the natural

211
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:17,200
wellspring of life or something it's there for causes and conditions but it has this feeling of being almost

212
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:24,000
um you know free of the ordinary cause and conditions of our life and so he would have called it of the

213
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:31,520
flesh and not of the flesh some translators will translate it as uh worldly and not worldly unworldly

214
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,480
which seems a lot some people do worldly and spiritual

215
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,920
but i like that they flesh the knot of the flesh another way the buddha's talked about it

216
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,960
is he talked about it as the vedana the feeling tones associated

217
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,960
with domestic life and that was associated with the renunciant life

218
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:58,079
and that usually doesn't work very well in english-speaking modern audience

219
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,440
but if we understand the domestic life is you know the surface of it perhaps is

220
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,960
often involved with um all kinds of sensual pursuits the most clear

221
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:16,960
association with sensual desire is sex with domestic life and um you know that there's a lot of

222
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:23,599
concerns of sexuality the renunciant life is not so concerned with sexuality and

223
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:29,359
um but then it's a pursuit of all kinds of pleasures and domestic life that keeps us busy sometimes keeps us

224
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:36,319
with so busy we don't have time to meditate whereas a renunciant life is not pursuing sensual pleasures

225
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:41,440
but pursuing something in deeper pleasure that's not of the senses not of the world

226
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,480
and the word renunciant has a kind of maybe negative connotations for some english speakers

227
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:54,880
but the pali word probably has a very different association in the minds of the ancient people and

228
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:01,280
and maybe uh we could call it a sacred life there's the domestic

229
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,440
life and the sacred life and maybe it's unfortunate to make a distinction between those two

230
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,880
there doesn't have to be a distinction to the kansas concepts the sacred life can be found in the

231
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:18,160
domestic life but the the real thing that buddha is pointing to

232
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:24,640
is the the pleasures that the pleasant unpleasant experiences we

233
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,839
have that are associated with clinging and those which are associated with

234
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:35,119
non-clinging non-grasping and those which are non-come out of

235
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:41,680
non-grasping are more reliable more enduring they're the ones that are more nourishing for

236
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,960
something deep inside they're deeply satisfying that

237
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,319
if you never tasted it it's hard to understand why they're so deeply satisfying

238
00:43:52,319 --> 00:44:00,079
and it feels so good to have access to something inside that is um not dependent

239
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:08,079
on the world being just right everybody behaving in the way that you think they should treat you

240
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:14,560
and um and to know something about the deep sense of freedom that can come with

241
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,839
non-clinging and the pleasantness of that where pleasantness seems just too

242
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:25,760
trite or too many that seems minimalistic or reductionistic for how marvelous or

243
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,440
wonderful the experience experience of inner freedom can be

244
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:38,880
so um so this distinction and to be attuned to this distinction

245
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:45,839
between pleasures that involve clinging and pleasures that involve non-clinging helps us to find

246
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:51,920
our way it's meant to be inspiring to help us find more and more freedom

247
00:44:51,920 --> 00:45:00,000
and not get caught in our clinging so thank you and maybe for the next 24

248
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,920
hours you might see if that distinction is something you can feel in your own experience

249
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:12,720
the pleasure of that comes with long with clinging and that which doesn't

250
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:19,119
so thank you
