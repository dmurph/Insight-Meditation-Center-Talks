1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:08,319
good evening good evening and a really warm welcome

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,799
wherever you are whenever it is you're listening to this or watching this a

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,920
really warm welcome

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,599
so we'll begin with a guided meditation

5
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:38,000
just arriving arriving at this moment

6
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:45,839
this place this occasion

7
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:10,000
and just feeling into this moment breathing into the body

8
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:19,840
feeling into maybe that general mood is there some anticipation

9
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:27,119
or maybe some lack of energy some dullness

10
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,640
maybe there's some brightness some uprightness

11
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,360
whatever it is can we welcome can we welcome it

12
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:55,840
include it

13
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,920
letting the attention rest in the sense of having a body

14
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:37,840
how do you know you have a body what does it feel like to have a body

15
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:57,120
and then rest in the attention on the parts of the body that are breathing

16
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,400
the movements associated with breathing

17
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,280
feeling in the chest or the belly

18
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,159
feeling the expansion then contraction

19
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,959
and then expansion contraction

20
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:47,840
feeling into the rhythm of the breathe

21
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:46,479
when we notice that the mind wanders as it's opt to do

22
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:57,840
apt to do we just very simply gently begin again

23
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,520
it might be that there are some sounds

24
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:07,840
maybe some uncomfortable sensation in the body

25
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:17,440
can we allow these experiences to be there

26
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:27,440
after all they are there can we not wrestle with them or push

27
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,560
them away just allow them to be there without

28
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,840
turning them into problems

29
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:49,599
there is sound it sounds like this

30
00:06:49,599 --> 00:07:02,319
there is throbbing stabbing in the knee perhaps

31
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,880
without trying to shove it away the

32
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,840
experience

33
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:29,759
but instead having an openness of spaciousness allowing

34
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:38,720
that experience to be there and it might be that with our allowing

35
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,240
allows something to shift maybe the ecosystem of the mind of the experience

36
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,800
to shift

37
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:59,840
and perhaps the problemness of the experience drains away

38
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:13,840
or maybe not

39
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,839
for the purpose of this meditation session

40
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,720
can we soften any sense of having to fix

41
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,160
things make them be otherwise

42
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:19,320
and instead to allow them to be as they are our

43
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:26,320
experiences not big conceptual ideas about the nature of

44
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,000
society but our felt experience

45
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:40,320
in this moment experiences of breathing

46
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,040
the experience of hearing

47
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,720
the experience of having bodily

48
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,839
sensations

49
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:35,600
allowing doesn't mean that we agree or approve

50
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:42,000
with our experience it means we're not wrestling or struggling with

51
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:57,839
the experience

52
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,960
to allow what our experience is

53
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:02,000
is to put down the the struggle the push

54
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,720
the pushing away that pulling closer that might be happening in an obvious

55
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,840
way or in a subtle way

56
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,240
instead can we just notice what is happening

57
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:41,840
and let it happen that the experience be there let it arise and pass away

58
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:51,840
in this way our practice can be more about finding the freedom in each moment

59
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,840
rather than trying to make the moment be something different

60
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:06,840
and with this orientation and this experience of finding the freedom and our meditation can support our daily

61
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,799
life recognizing that we don't have to fix everything we don't have to change

62
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,720
everything to match our preferences

63
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:26,559
so that we might have more freedom and ease and what life brings us and

64
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:32,399
so that ease might also be picked up on or experienced by others

65
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,679
around us so that our practice can be the benefit

66
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,720
not only for our ourselves but for those around us

67
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:51,840
and for all beings everywhere

68
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:00,630
[Music]

69
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:47,840
good evening good evening and a really warm welcome

70
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:57,360
so at imc sometimes we teach this practice i think gil franz doll and tonya wiser

71
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:05,760
um developed or i'm not exactly sure what the word is but it's r-a-f-t

72
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:13,279
it kind of has some tools to help if there's some difficulties during meditation some difficult

73
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:19,279
experiences difficult emotions physical experiences whatever it might be

74
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:26,159
r a f t recognize allow

75
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:33,200
feel in the body and tease apart the experience from

76
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,440
our reaction to the experience

77
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:46,320
so tonight i thought i would unpack a little bit just the second element allow that can be an integral part of

78
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:54,399
our practice mindfulness practice is allowing what's there but maybe to unpack it a little bit more and

79
00:32:54,399 --> 00:33:01,919
what does this mean to allow so part of what this when we use this

80
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:10,240
language allow what it's pointing to is distinguishing between what is happening in this moment

81
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:17,120
and our reactions our responses our ideas about what is happening in this

82
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:23,279
moment so instead of getting lost in our

83
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:30,480
response our reaction is to align ourselves with what is actually

84
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,399
happening that is to just be present with what's happening

85
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:41,919
there might be these ways in which we are subtly i notice i certainly have early in my

86
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:48,799
meditation practice i certainly noticed that i was doing this kind of like secretly hoping like if i

87
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:55,919
ignore it it'll go away or if i push it enough it'll go away

88
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:01,919
this whatever was unpleasant in my experience or if i wished it would go away hard enough it

89
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:09,520
would go away so to allow is to put that down

90
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,878
and instead to just kind of in some ways have some openness and some spaciousness

91
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:22,240
and recognizing oh yes okay that's sensation in my knee is

92
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:30,158
a stabbing sensation it's a little moving on this small range

93
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:38,240
maybe and it's not constant and sometimes it feels a little bit more stabby at other times or more acute

94
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,358
than other times or so not pushing or

95
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:50,560
pulling away from our experience but just to be there

96
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,240
just to notice allow the awareness allow the attention

97
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:02,079
to land if you will on the experience and to be lying about it

98
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:08,240
so when i'm talking about allowing i'm not talking about maybe i'll say this

99
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:14,839
i'll start this way i'm really talking about our experiences our moment-to-moment

100
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:22,720
experiences i'm not talking about societal constructs and the terrible

101
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,000
injustices and racism that happens and i'm not saying that we should allow this

102
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:35,119
no no no i'm talking about just allowing that next moment of experience

103
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:42,400
and then the next moment of experience whether it's a thought maybe an emotion a bodily experience

104
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:50,640
sensations of breathing whatever it might be is there a way that we can

105
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:57,280
not push it or try to shift it or shape it into something

106
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,920
different so allowing is to allow both the pleasant and the unpleasant often we

107
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,200
think about we have to allow the unpleasant but sometimes when something is pleasant

108
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,560
too there can be a sense of like oh yes oh yeah right right and this kind of wanting to

109
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:21,040
grab onto it but allowing is is permitting both the

110
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:26,720
pleasant and the unpleasant to arise and pass away

111
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,000
this natural movement that's natural with that rhythm

112
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,440
of course it happens at a different pace some experiences seem to be faster and some

113
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,480
seem to be slower but to permit them to just arise and

114
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:49,359
pass away at the in the tempo that is appropriate

115
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:55,040
and as i mentioned in the guided meditation it doesn't mean that we have to agree with it

116
00:36:55,040 --> 00:37:02,320
it doesn't mean that we have to approve of our experience right now of this

117
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,839
little uncomfortable experience in my knee i don't necessarily approve of it

118
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:17,039
but can i just allow it to be there yes this is part of the felt experience at this moment

119
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:25,359
so can we meet our experiences maybe that's another way of saying allowing

120
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:31,680
is to just be able to meet it like turn towards it in

121
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:39,040
some kind of way so often right in our daily life and in our meditation life things turn

122
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:45,680
turn out better if we are just able to meet it and turn towards it as best we can

123
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:53,119
sometimes we don't have the capacity at that particular moment we're feeling overwhelmed or

124
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,240
that can't we don't have the resources at that moment we're tired we're hungry

125
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,079
maybe we have a history in our background that makes us really sensitive to particular

126
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:10,000
experiences so we don't have the whole range of resources we might have if it were another

127
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,720
experience but to allow is to immediately as best we can

128
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:25,119
and so maybe at the deepest level this idea of allowing is to an invitation to bring an attitude

129
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:32,000
or a quality of liberation into our experience this attitude or

130
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:40,400
quality of freedom not getting tangled up

131
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:46,480
not getting

132
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:53,440
knotted up not getting attached so can we find a

133
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:59,280
bit of freedom in all of our experiences and not just those ones that match our preferences

134
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,960
but instead can we find the freedom or be with the freedom with all of our

135
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,800
experiences in some ways we might say that all of

136
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,480
the dharma is about non-attachment or another way to say that all of the

137
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:24,720
dharma is about letting go maybe another way to say that is all of the dharma is about finding freedom

138
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,720
maybe another way to say that is all of the dharma is about tuning into

139
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:36,640
the suffering right all of these are related and we might use different

140
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:44,640
words that are seem appropriate at different times to match our experiences

141
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:53,760
but one way we might also think about allowing is non-attachment

142
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:00,079
so attachment is we might say is when there's a lack of freedom

143
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:06,319
that is that for me i kind of feel like like when getting tangled up like

144
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:11,680
in a net somehow maybe that's sometimes it's not a nice

145
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,720
visual because i'm often sometimes with that comes suffering of some poor animals that are

146
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:25,838
tangled up in a net but just this idea of like it's not clear how to get out how to free oneself

147
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,960
um sometimes dharma teachers talk about like they're being a tar baby you know the the story i don't know that

148
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,400
where i can't bring to mind right now where this story is

149
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:45,760
but um like trying to push something away and it's really sticky so to try to free the hand you know put

150
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,520
in the other hand and then now both hands are stuck and then you know what the story is or it gets a

151
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:57,359
little bit ridiculous putting the foot to pull out the two hands thinking if you just push it away

152
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:03,920
and then of course the foot is stuck and then the remaining limb gets stuck and i can't

153
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,119
remember in this story if it's the head also but you get the picture

154
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:17,200
not a lot of freedom so with our mindfulness practice

155
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:24,240
we start to see that actually we can get attached or tangled up

156
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,520
with just about anything whether it is a bodily experience whether it's an

157
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:36,160
emotion whether it's a thought the thoughts about the memory about the future

158
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:43,200
some way thoughts about the future of this whirring and this um going around and around this

159
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:50,960
rumination and maybe playing out scenario after scenario in a way that's not helpful maybe it's

160
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,720
helpful at the beginning to do this to play out different scenarios so you can plan and be prepared

161
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:03,838
but then there comes a time when it's not helpful and instead it's just this rumination

162
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:11,520
so i would say that's a way of being attached or tangled so sometimes we think of this word of

163
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,880
being attached means that there's um affection

164
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:23,280
or you know some real bonding happening with uh something else but i'm using it in this

165
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:31,119
way attachment is kind of like being entangled or you know just an absence of freedom so

166
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,319
when we start to with our mindfulness practice we start to see

167
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:43,359
the fact that it we can get attached to just about anything and i would say even it's actually normal

168
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:50,319
it's normal to get a little bit stuck in our thinking and our experience

169
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:56,640
and as we gain skills and gain confidence and how to be with things

170
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,960
that are uncomfortable so we don't have to judge this when we

171
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,480
notice that we are finding that we're attached we find ourselves stuck to

172
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:15,359
something very sticky because that in fact would

173
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:22,160
be some uh getting entangled even more that's a kind of like judging ourselves

174
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:27,920
and then building a story all around oh i'm overly concerned with this

175
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:35,119
sensation in my knee i really diana you shouldn't be worried

176
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:41,599
about the sensation in your knee you're supposed to be meditation teacher and what does this mean that if you keep on thinking about

177
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:47,520
this sensation in your knee and so that is an example of just being

178
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:54,640
attached right kind of being entangled is even this response to initially maybe getting lost

179
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:02,160
in thoughts about it or concern about it and then having ideas about our ideas

180
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:09,119
papancha this mental proliferation makes story making

181
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,280
or we can be attached to our bodies the way our bodies are we can be attached to

182
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:20,640
our emotions some some of them trying to push them away

183
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:26,880
mental states wanting to only have some clarity and some steadiness

184
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,599
so allowing is the opposite of this

185
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,440
just letting experiences to rise and pass away

186
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:46,560
so to say a little bit more about attachment is and what whatever it is that we find

187
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:53,280
that we're tangled up with is um i've seen bell uh sorry i've seen

188
00:44:53,280 --> 00:45:00,720
um gill do this where this um demonstration of what is attachment is

189
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:08,480
to like really be holding on so tightly to this bell striker so i kind of have like a fist

190
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:15,119
in my hand with the bell striker in my hand and when the hand is gripping tightly in

191
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:22,560
this way it's not able to receive this hand is not able to create

192
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:30,839
it's not able to give it's not able to act it's not able to do it stuck and

193
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:35,920
gripping in some ways we might even say this kind

194
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,839
of gripping is um in a subtle level includes

195
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:47,040
this really deep very deep and perfectly natural

196
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:55,520
or maybe i should say normal maybe even natural way to push away that which is uncomfortable

197
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:01,920
that which is unpleasant but is there a way that we can hold things

198
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:08,240
with an open hand with the striker line just in the palm of our

199
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:16,400
hands but our fingers aren't gripping it so that we can hold things without

200
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,760
getting tangled up in them

201
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:28,160
and so how do we know what the difference is how do we know this difference between

202
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,760
holding certainly we need to hold all kinds of things in our lives our loved ones

203
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:43,200
our aspirations our skills and our practice

204
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:51,119
so what is the difference between attachment and holding one is that i is maybe

205
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:56,880
there's a felt sense about it this idea of gripping my fingers were getting a little bit

206
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:02,400
tired they're holding that striker so there's many different ways that shows up

207
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,880
but maybe a tail telltale way in which is we can notice when

208
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:17,760
attachment is there is when there is suffering sooner or later all gripping tangling

209
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:25,838
leads to difficulties dissatisfaction stress uncomfortableness

210
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:34,200
so to maybe continue kind of fleshing this out that i'm saying allowing is like

211
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:42,079
non-attachment but when we hear this word non-attachment i'm saying that to be as the opposite of attachment or gripping or

212
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:48,480
getting entangled but sometimes when we hear this word non-attachment we might be thinking

213
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:55,680
detachment that is it might have this cool aloofness we might think that it's

214
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:01,200
um it's not but we might have this idea like

215
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:08,000
non-attachment might feel like some disinterest or withdrawal or disconnection

216
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:16,000
either from oneself or from others so to be clear non-attachment doesn't

217
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:23,839
mean this standoffishness chilliness lack of engagement

218
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:30,240
but instead allowing has this quality of love and

219
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:35,839
warmth and care

220
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:43,599
right sometimes the greatest acts of love or to allow people to be exactly who they are

221
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:50,640
and so in some ways to allow our experiences to be the way that they are is an act of love

222
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:58,880
it's kind of and we can think of it for me it kind of feels this way with some respect and okay this is what's arising

223
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:04,640
it's arising because the conditions are there for it to arise

224
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:11,760
it's a rising so i can't make it go away at that moment when i

225
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:19,119
notice it so this non-attachment has a feeling of

226
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:24,720
love or warmth and openness spaciousness kind of like how i

227
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:31,760
talked about holding the striker with an open hand so it's this movement of

228
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:39,440
allowing is a movement of it's a not a tightness it's not a

229
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:46,079
contraction it's not a gripping sometimes attachment is born out of fear

230
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:53,040
this fear of something in ourselves that we'll experience or this fear of something out there in the world

231
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:59,920
but this allowing is not laced with fear it's instead it's

232
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,440
with us warmth

233
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:12,960
so to continue to unpack this idea and perhaps all of you know this but sometimes it's

234
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:19,200
i know for me and i think for a lot of practitioners sometimes it's helpful to hear a number of different words

235
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:24,880
associated with something that we already know

236
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:31,440
to remind us of what we already know and to maybe flesh it out a little bit and that is of course this idea of the

237
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:36,720
second arrow the simile of the second arrow goes

238
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,920
something like this i'm paraphrasing the buddha asks his

239
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:48,640
followers is it painful to receive a sec to be shot with an arrow

240
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:54,640
it's not a trick question so they answer yes venomous or it is painful to be shot

241
00:50:54,640 --> 00:51:01,760
with an arrow and then the buddha asks is it more painful to be shot with a second

242
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:08,480
arrow again not a trick question yes venerable sir it's more painful to

243
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:14,800
be shot with a second arrow so the first arrow is what life brings

244
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,839
us the second arrow is our relationship

245
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:28,559
to what life brings us so we might say that allowing is not shooting that second arrow

246
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:36,400
not filling ourselves with self-recrimination or not um

247
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:44,240
getting tangled up in whatever way that might be so not beating ourselves up

248
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:51,119
about what's happening or just noticing okay this is the next moment

249
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:56,559
because sometimes we have these ideas of what it means to be a practitioner that we should look a certain way or

250
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,640
only be having certain experiences

251
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,760
so one way that we might think about this kind of building on this idea of the second arrow

252
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:16,000
is allowing is a way in which we might shift our relationship with what's happening

253
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:23,440
soften our release relationship relax our relationship that can be another way

254
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:28,880
in which we might think about this because often when we think about we

255
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:34,079
have this ideas how can i let go of something or

256
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:41,760
how can i not be attached to something what we really mean is how can i get rid

257
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:49,040
of this how can i have this not be in my life so without really realizing it we have

258
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:56,800
some aversion there and as long as there's a version there that's a way in which we're entangled

259
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:04,880
so can we soften can relax can we let go of the particular relationship we

260
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:11,680
have to our experience as a way to allow

261
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:18,559
and maybe i should just um say one more time it's a normal human experience to become

262
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:23,760
entangled to become attached to not allow in maybe

263
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,960
some subtle way so the invitation here is just to notice

264
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,640
just to notice when this happens

265
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:40,720
so as to increase um some of the our

266
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:46,240
understanding about allowing is to talk what are some of the supports

267
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:52,400
for allowing right if it was i just got finished saying it's perfectly natural and normal

268
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:59,520
for us to have some attachment and to get tangled up and to not allow and with practice

269
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:06,960
are we can allow more and more and more but what else what is a support for

270
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:12,160
allowing and one thing that we could look at is

271
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:17,280
barbara frederickson a well-known psychologist she has this

272
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:24,319
idea of broaden and build broaden

273
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:32,079
and build it's kind of a little bit similar to what we're doing this idea of if we have some positive

274
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:37,119
experiences it broadens our capacity and then this

275
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:44,400
with this broad capacity we can build resources and the resources are more enduring than

276
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:51,119
just these positive experiences so for example

277
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:58,240
just being curious or having interest kind of um

278
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:03,280
creates the urge to play with having a sense of playfulness or you know this

279
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:09,200
curiosity kind of comes with a sense of playfulness or experimentation what happens if i do

280
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:16,240
this or what happens if this doesn't go this way or it goes another way or something like this

281
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:21,839
taking in some new information or just being playful with it

282
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:29,599
in the same way having joy creates the urge to

283
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:36,799
maybe explore or to otherwise expand out our experience

284
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:45,359
having some happiness so this when we're having these positive

285
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:53,599
experiences and we're more apt to do some other experiences explore or play and with that helps create some

286
00:55:53,599 --> 00:56:00,960
resources like maybe we might explore some other ways in which to practice with

287
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:06,480
um i'm a little bit uh distracted here

288
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:13,440
somebody just arrived here but maybe we um if we have this to explore

289
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:21,359
and play for example maybe we're a little bit more apt to um

290
00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:28,799
um yeah so now this word is escaping me but

291
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:37,440
our health might improve for example maybe we go outside more and go for walks and or maybe we are

292
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:45,200
more likely to do the physical therapy that has been recommended to us or to take that medication that was

293
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:50,640
um maybe uncomfortable to take or bothers him to take or something like this

294
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:56,880
we're more apt to do these things if we have some this idea of exploration or play for

295
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:02,799
example in our lives in the same way might help our

296
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:08,000
relationships maybe our friendships or our committed

297
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,599
relationships with our significant others might be enhanced and

298
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:20,160
then with these greater resources health relationships or maybe just a greater

299
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:26,079
sense of confidence or resilience

300
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:32,480
can help us to have this um create the capacity in which we feel

301
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:38,079
like we can allow things that are uncomfortable we don't have to push them away

302
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:44,960
we don't have to get so entangled with them so this idea of broaden and build

303
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:52,240
is to work to have some positive experiences curiosity joy happiness

304
00:57:52,240 --> 00:58:00,960
loving kindness and these experiences help to create durable resources that help

305
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:08,240
expand our capacity to be with difficulties which makes it easier to allow

306
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:15,680
things to be so maybe i'll just end with a little bit of some idea about

307
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:21,599
loving kindness part of barbara fredrickson's work has

308
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:28,960
spent to look at loving-kindness and its impact on practitioners and maybe when you

309
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:34,079
heard me say this you're like ugh really loving-kindness

310
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:41,920
i know a number of people have this experience and i certainly did too at the very beginning but interestingly

311
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:48,000
that um they measured um or they did a controlled study where some

312
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:53,599
practitioners were doing love and kindness some were doing breath meditation and some were doing

313
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:59,040
more like an open awareness meditation and they said that the

314
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:05,440
average likability for loving kindness meditation was lower than breath meditation which

315
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:11,599
might be your experience maybe not too however it increased significantly after

316
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:17,280
some practice as well as the perceived effort and the

317
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:24,240
beginning loving kindness seemed a little bit more difficult than meditation but decreased over time

318
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:30,319
and as you might imagine i also discovered that with loving-kindness practice there

319
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:38,240
was this greater sense of resource resourcefulness and this ability to be with difficulties

320
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:42,799
and we can translate that to allowing

321
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:49,359
so to allow to not be tangled up in to not have

322
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:57,680
attachment to bring forth the freedom that's the

323
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:04,559
liberation that's available in each moment is to allow and so

324
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:11,040
may we allow as best we can with what life is offering to us in such

325
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:16,720
a way that we can have some ease and so that we can allow others to be as

326
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:24,319
they are and what's happening with them out of care and love and warmth not

327
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:33,280
out of disconnection but out of respect and warm-heartedness

328
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:40,400
thank you
