1
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:10,639
hello everyone and welcome to this morning's meditation and uh for this week and last

2
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:18,480
week I'm somewhat uh connecting the meditation to be relevant for the Dharma

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,160
talk I give afterwards the 15minute talk on these 10

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:31,720
Reflections and uh so today the the reflection will be on community

5
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:37,800
and I had Associated Community with love as been the coraly that could go along

6
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,000
but as I prepared to sit down to lead this

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,800
meditation um I couldn't quite get myself

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:57,760
to get connected or to evoke this you know this

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:06,040
uh capacity or interest in teaching about or guiding you in love

10
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,119
or meta loving kindness because uh what superseded it

11
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:17,200
or what seems to be stronger uh as I bring this to mind is

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,720
happiness and maybe there's a connection I hope there's a connection between happiness and love happiness and

13
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:32,640
Goodwill and so and I don't know which is harder for us for you to connect to

14
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,680
your basic good will for yourself and to others or whether it's more difficult to

15
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:47,040
connect to a sense of Happiness delight and joy but when I think of community this

16
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,360
morning uh I think of my great delight and appreciation for others it just I

17
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,079
feel so fortunate to live in a world where I have encounters with wonderful people and

18
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:07,679
and as I've practiced over these years it seems like people are becoming more wonderful the more I get to know them

19
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:13,360
and the more I'm able to have opportunity to meet them

20
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:20,519
behind uh they more public Expressions what they reveal most

21
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:27,360
publicly and um their depths and wonderfulness and I assume in

22
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,400
everyone and the happiness maybe with oneself uh I think I become more and

23
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:40,760
more of a friend with myself or my mind is more friendly with me or I don't know

24
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:46,319
exactly what direction it is that sense of kind of certain kind of happiness

25
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,519
with to sit down to meditate and to be present it just

26
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:58,159
brings a sense of delight and joy

27
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:06,959
so you're welcome to to ignore my words if the topic of

28
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,120
happiness and the way I present it doesn't speak to you and there's all

29
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:19,360
kinds of reasons for that some are situational what's happening in your life these

30
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,200
days but to begin the meditation

31
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:35,680
to as assume a meditation posture that you

32
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,400
enjoy that's nice for

33
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,200
you whatever that might be that you enjoy and is nice for

34
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:57,200
you to help cultivate a sense of clear attention a

35
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,519
clarity about this moment here if we're too relaxed in our posture it

36
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:12,360
can be wonderful but it might not be bring the same kind of Joyful

37
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,280
Vitality of something where we're not completely relaxed as much as we can but

38
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:24,639
we're also not tense a nice balance of alertness in the

39
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,639
posture

40
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,479
gently closing the

41
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:48,199
eyes and Below or behind the

42
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:54,759
ordinary flow of your thinking the ordinary preoccupations and

43
00:04:54,759 --> 00:05:03,520
perspectives that are active for you behind it more deeply to

44
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:11,840
it is there some way in which you can feel a deeper kinship with

45
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:20,039
yourself a deeper positive regard

46
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:29,960
appreciation for this person who has accompanied you your whole life in a certain way

47
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:36,880
you yourself through ups and downs and struggles and

48
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:46,720
difficulties can you as you sit here in a simple maybe a nonverbal

49
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:55,039
way sit with an appreciation or

50
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:06,599
friendliness or a valuing of this person who is

51
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,919
yourself and that meditation is not meant to be punishment

52
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:21,120
or meant to be demanding of yourself things which

53
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,120
you are not but meditation Beginning by

54
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:33,440
appreciation and allowance of yourself to be as you

55
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,520
are appreciating

56
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:47,199
this is there a

57
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,160
way to feel some

58
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,639
happiness of accompanying yourself being in touch being connected

59
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:11,800
here and now to your

60
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,840
breathing to your

61
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:30,120
body to not only your emotions right now but for your capacity to feel

62
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:37,160
and have emotions even difficult

63
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,680
ones and for your mind your

64
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,319
thoughts and so then to

65
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:09,759
in the midst of

66
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:23,000
yourself as if it carries with it a wave of appreciation a wave of

67
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:32,960
Happiness feel the experience of breathing as it moves through your

68
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,680
body breathing with a light

69
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,200
touch or mindfulness with a light

70
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:01,000
touch maybe with a small half smile

71
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:09,800
that reminds you that

72
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:19,880
happiness Delight appreciation is allowed as you meditate

73
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:16,640
and this happiness of the Dharma it's not something you create or

74
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:25,250
drive from the control tower in the head but rather it's like a refreshing

75
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:31,279
[Music] pool that you gently

76
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:37,480
lean back into to relax and to

77
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:49,120
feel to breathe with a gentle wave of breathe

78
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
breathing

79
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
for

80
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
for

81
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
for

82
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
for

83
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
for

84
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
for

85
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
for

86
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
for

87
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,959
for for

88
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:23,959
sometimes there can be a certain happiness or it may be

89
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:35,160
contentment from the opportunity to practice

90
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:43,720
meditation even when it's difficult it's a phenomenally worthwhile

91
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:50,550
and valuable thing to do in the big picture of things

92
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:58,279
[Music] maybe better than the alternatives

93
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,120
and maybe there's a contentment or inspiration or

94
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,600
happiness with this opportunity to

95
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,438
practice that guides you into the present

96
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:29,480
moment here now

97
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:37,960
and a quieting of the

98
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
Mind

99
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

100
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

101
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
for

102
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
for for

103
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

104
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

105
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
for

106
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

107
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

108
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

109
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

110
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

111
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,278
e for

112
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,240
and then as we come to the end of this meditation

113
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:41,360
are there people in your life that you're glad you

114
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:52,919
know are there people in your life that bring you a sense of delight and

115
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:02,279
joy and can you can you imagine taking that Delight

116
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:08,039
Joy appreciation and spreading it outwards

117
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:13,960
to others so it's not specific or limited

118
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:21,720
to any individual but something that spreads outwards to all

119
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:30,480
beings may all beings be

120
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:39,360
happy and may I may I share my happiness with all

121
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:45,480
beings may all beings be

122
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,080
safe and may I contribute safety to

123
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,559
all may I be safe for others

124
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:02,840
may all beings be

125
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:10,480
peaceful and may I interact peacefully with

126
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,039
others and may all beings be

127
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:25,039
free and may I free them from my judgments and

128
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,120
expectations even my needs

129
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:37,720
allowing everyone an

130
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,080
opportunity to be appreciated and to appreciate

131
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:49,080
themselves may all beings be happy

132
00:28:52,460 --> 00:29:01,258
[Music]

133
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,880
thank

134
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
you e

135
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:11,080
so today the topic for reflection is

136
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:20,320
community and to restate what I've said before that these 10 Reflections that

137
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:27,559
we're exploring this week this week and last week uh were inspired by orientations

138
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:33,960
that people like Hospital chaplain spiritual caregivers who offer

139
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:39,200
Interfaith care meaning that they're not prati but they're trying to understand

140
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:47,360
the people they're with and how they're suffering where their challenges are and that these 10 areas are places where

141
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:56,000
maybe fundamental needs that many people have and so chaplains will listen for uh

142
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,679
where is it that something is broken or ruptured or challenged for

143
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:09,799
people and one of those places is community and a community that a person has felt

144
00:31:09,799 --> 00:31:14,880
part of there's a strain there's something that's broken there's a a rip

145
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:22,919
in the community and it can be very difficult and sometimes people uh who

146
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:31,000
are chaplains will meet with people who are dying and sometimes the final thing that uh they want to do is to repair

147
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,519
their relationship to others or to their Community or to their family or to a

148
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:44,760
friendship and um I was surprised many years ago to go visit be with someone on their

149
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:51,399
deathbed and um you know I I knew that there was a

150
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:58,399
their death was going to be any hour and I went to visit and the person was still alive enough and clear enough that the

151
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:06,360
person asked me to be involved in marital counseling in my kind of maybe naive was

152
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:12,279
surprised that in such a crucial moment the last you know hours of a person life

153
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:18,519
that that's what they wanted to do but I shouldn't have been so surprised that often the community connections

154
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:24,960
relationships are so important for people that repairing them um helps us

155
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:31,200
feel complete or feels like there's no loose ends or you know apologies have been made or

156
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:37,960
repair has been done so Community begins with

157
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:47,279
um you know with probably with gestating in our our mother's

158
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,440
belly uh where everything of who we are is really connected and involved with it

159
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:59,039
a single person and then we're born and and the community is usually fairly

160
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:07,360
small and um often immediate family and often children are very primarly bonded

161
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:14,639
to their parents to their siblings to a small group of people and then as we grow up the sense

162
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:20,039
of community can expand to become the neighbors to become the friends in the

163
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:26,679
neighborhood to become expanded Network maybe of cousins or it can be an

164
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:31,919
expanded network of uncles and aunts can expand outward into our

165
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:37,039
schoolmates to uh the um and so it

166
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:43,600
expands and expands to be at some point it's maybe the town that we have a sense

167
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,760
of community with the town that we're in and we don't realize it so much until we've moved away and we meet someone

168
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:59,600
from our town and we feel and how delightful it is to have so much in common culturally and experientially

169
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,679
and then as this process of growing up expands then the sense of or develops

170
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:12,720
and so Community can become larger and larger and sometimes the community can include people that we don't know and uh

171
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,638
or don't know yet that we have enough in common enough appreciation much value

172
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,480
that we feel like we have a connection to them and we meet them we feel that connection that we have something in

173
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,960
common and um you know someone who went to our same high school who we didn't

174
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:39,720
even know but when we meet them they feel we feel kind of a sense of connection um sometimes I've been in

175
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:45,000
communities like monasteries where I felt it was more like a

176
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,679
village and and I didn't have deep friendships with everyone in the

177
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:59,359
monastery but everyone I felt like were part of was part of my Village and so there there was a kind of a of

178
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:06,040
a benefit of the doubt or appreciation or valuing or a willingness to kind of

179
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:12,920
hold them in a wide open heart um with acceptance that um from living the

180
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:18,240
shared life together so exactly what community is is

181
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:24,040
maybe not so easy to Define different thing for different people and that the

182
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:29,119
need we have for Community varies from person to person but it is a fundamental

183
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,480
need for a human being um we don't even develop as a as a

184
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,640
human being without the mirroring the relationships we have with others like

185
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:46,480
our parents and I for me the representative uh the representation for

186
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:53,359
that is language that we uh only learn language in community in connection to

187
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:58,440
others if we decided that enough of this kind of you know you know communal

188
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:03,880
language we're going to now start speaking our own language and no one else knows then the very function of

189
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:09,760
language to be able to communicate between people disappears and we learn much more than

190
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,119
just language from other people we learn uh gestures and forms of other forms

191
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:22,359
non-verbal forms of communication and values and ways of relating and

192
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:28,480
um customs and a lot of things comes together that uh adds up to what we're

193
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:35,280
familiar with what we enjoy what we like what we feel at home in and um and so

194
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,760
Community is a a place where many people uh a close Community the kind of

195
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,800
community that really has a lot of value for people often involves a sense of

196
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:52,240
belonging that now we belong and Community sometimes there's

197
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:58,760
an expectation that we Community should be easy we should just have it automatically we should be made other

198
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:04,359
people should help us feel like we belong one aspect of community it has

199
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:09,720
goes back to the earlier reflection on agency Community is a place where we can

200
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:15,119
act where we have some agency like we can contribute we can do something and

201
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:22,240
if it's only one way the community the community takes care of me then um uh I

202
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,160
think that it's much more fragile much more maybe not quite the same feeling of

203
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,760
belonging that has when we feel like we have a role we can

204
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,720
contribute so uh uh so to be a contributor to the community um to give

205
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:46,480
gifts one of the most classic ways of supporting healthy Community is gift

206
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,560
giving and it can be very small forms of gifts but uh giftgiving helps create

207
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:57,960
Community um uh acts of listening to others

208
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:03,800
volunteering doing small acts of kindness um here at

209
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:09,200
IMC uh one of the ways that uh many people feel really a strong sense of

210
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:15,839
community is when they start becoming a volunteer um there's other ways of feeling a strong sense of community for

211
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:21,839
sure it's quite special to just be together and share a practice and the teachings with others who are interested

212
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:28,640
in it but uh when we can kind of invest ourselves and offer part of ourselves and feel we have that ability that

213
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,079
agency that capacity that's one of the ways that some people help create a

214
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:41,440
sense of community for themselves rather than being passively waiting for Community to happen uh we are the

215
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:47,880
Builders of community and um and Community is

216
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:56,839
difficult social relationships are hard so part of uh being in a community is to

217
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:02,160
again not expect to everything to go the way we want or everything to be easy but

218
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:08,960
again to contribute to what does it take to reconcile what does it take to find

219
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:15,480
harmony with differences and what does it what does it take to um to work

220
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,400
together with uh the challenges we have in community and I've seen over and over

221
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:28,040
again that sometimes uh uh um community

222
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:33,359
and sense of connection to others and warmth and friendship and depth of kind of

223
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:40,160
connection um uh is facilitated by healthy involvement with

224
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:46,400
the challenges of community life the conflicts that we can have and to really stay there and get to know each other in

225
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:53,119
relationship to the conflict understand people and understand ourselves and find our way through

226
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,480
it um this is a way of deepening uh sense of investment to a

227
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,839
community sense of value in community a sense of really kind of being

228
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:11,480
understanding and and and developing a healthy uh sense of belonging because the belonging comes from the work of

229
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,680
helping to create the community and keep it together so of course we can't do that

230
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:23,480
with everyone but uh it involves many many layers of what we mean by the

231
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,599
community and um you know this year there's an uh in the United States

232
00:40:28,599 --> 00:40:33,720
there's a national election and so what does it mean to be in community with a

233
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:40,240
whole nation and how do we relate in a way that uh we contribute and support

234
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:45,880
and work with the differences that we have um rather than shutting down or

235
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:52,880
creating opposition automatically or US versus them uh because when we have us versus

236
00:40:52,880 --> 00:41:00,040
them we limit the possibility of community of communion of meeting together in Norwegian my

237
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:07,160
language I grew up with uh the word Community is samun and uh that uh means

238
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:12,839
meeting together and uh so where do we meet others together whether is there a

239
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:19,000
meeting of mutual Care mutual support and how do we contribute to that care

240
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,359
contribute to that support so

241
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:29,560
um um one of the for some people one of the

242
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:36,079
most fundamental needs and maybe even spiritual needs is a sense of community

243
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:41,920
and um the sense of having belonging a sense of having

244
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,839
um things in common sense of having a place where we can act and make a

245
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:57,280
difference a place where we um we um are willing to be in conflict and

246
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:03,359
find a way it's not uncommon to point out that that sometimes the people we

247
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:09,800
have the most difficulty with is the people have most in common with somehow our differences and stand out and

248
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:16,440
highlight and in such a way that small differences uh Loom really big and

249
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,839
sometimes there's you know great Wars between people for you know very slight

250
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:27,880
differences that from people from far away they can't believe that that's what they're fighting about

251
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,960
and so uh so rather than

252
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,640
fighting uh I kind of one of my definitions for a healthy Community is a

253
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:46,839
community in which um uh uh the community I want to be in if

254
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:51,960
I'm going to be involved in conflict and um if there's going to be a

255
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:58,599
conflict I want to be connected to these people because these people I feel like we can find a way no matter how

256
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:06,359
difficult the CH the personal and social challenges are that these are the people who whom I I would like to kind of help

257
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:12,839
find a for us find a way and have the honesty have dedication work work at it

258
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:20,480
and that doesn't mean for me that it's always the other people want to work things out but uh I have this desire oh

259
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:28,480
this is the people I want to be in conflict with if I'm going to be in Conflict I hope I don't have to be

260
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:36,280
so that way uh conflict doesn't rupture the community that actually it's part of the

261
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:42,119
work of strengthening it developing it making it

262
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:48,640
grow so um um so for you if you're interested

263
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:55,359
now you might spend this next 24 hours reflecting on what community has meant

264
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:01,079
for you what are the challenges what are the ruptures what are the healings what

265
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:07,480
are the benefits that have that have lived for you in your life and how is

266
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:14,680
the sense of community your sense of community expanded as you've gotten older has it expanded or has it gotten

267
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:22,440
smaller and smaller I believe and just my maybe it's just my belief that as people develop

268
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:28,839
spiritually the sense of community how we hold people in our heart as our

269
00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:34,559
community as our fellow uh humans expands wider and wider

270
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:41,280
and wider until we have a certain kind of sense that everyone is part of our

271
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:47,079
community we include everyone no divisions and uh so how does that work

272
00:44:47,079 --> 00:44:52,160
for you has Community for you become narrower has it become bigger in what

273
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:58,119
ways have you discovered a greater sense of community and greater sense of

274
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:04,720
receptivity to everyone being part of your community is community something that

275
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:11,319
you create by how by the quality of your heart or is it something you're

276
00:45:11,319 --> 00:45:19,000
expecting that others create for you provide you I think that um the former the ways

277
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:25,599
in which we contribute to a sense of community we see and feel as in community with others communion with

278
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:31,160
others this is characteristic of spiritually mature

279
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:36,599
people and so what do you think of that so I hope that uh this very

280
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:41,720
important topic of community his few words has giving you

281
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:47,520
something to think about and reflect on and uh and I hope as you do it that you

282
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:54,200
appreciate there are many ways of being a community some of them very unique to individuals so not to have someone

283
00:45:54,200 --> 00:46:01,240
else's idea of how it should be for you but really reflect deeply how it is for you and maybe you'll have an opportunity

284
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:06,280
to talk to others about it and be mirrored and hear others and and uh

285
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:11,559
explore this really important topic

286
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:18,040
community so thank you for this community that we have and my sense of

287
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:24,359
connection to all of you and and how it creates a sense for me of community

288
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:31,440
with a wide world out there far beyond Redwood City it brings me great Delight

289
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,640
thank you
