9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:01:01,519
few words about it afterwards so so with that let's sit together let's go into

10
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:10,719
start practicing together so so arriving arriving into your sitting

11
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,939
posture whether you're sitting on a chair or a [Music]

12
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,840
cushion

13
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,820
feeling your feet on the earth feeling your sit

14
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:46,079
[Music] Bones on the

15
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:52,759
chair feeling this body sitting the sense of presence of this body

16
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:59,479
here this body sitting and breathing all these various Sensations let them

17
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:05,038
support and ground you in every

18
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,440
breath and as you start sitting in this community together see if there's

19
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,840
something you need to let go of first you need to put down something some thoughts some

20
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:38,440
rumination something from the day this residue of emotion perhaps entanglement with

21
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,000
something that has happened today can we put it down just for a moment you can

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,040
pick it up later but right now can you put it

23
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:54,159
down it is possible to put it

24
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:02,799
down just for this period of time to take refuge in this

25
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:10,840
practice yes you can yes we can having

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,440
trust and connecting with the breath with the body just to

27
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,799
settle relinquishing everything

28
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
else

29
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
e

30
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:40,560
and if you try to put something down and take refuge and somehow it's very sticky and it keeps coming back then turn

31
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,160
towards it fully and get to really see it in capital

32
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,280
letters not losing your seat but seeing it

33
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,639
clearly maybe you're annoyed or upset or sad or afraid or whatever is

34
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:14,240
arising and then try to see the self sense how it relates to you the way you

35
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:23,280
think of yourself the way you're perceived how it might feel unjust to you how it has to do with yourself the

36
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,479
self this self-conception and see

37
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,360
how we feel more contracted more tight when

38
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,360
the sense of self

39
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,680
is more solid me me

40
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:49,319
me my perspective my thoughts my

41
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:57,160
needs and see if you can relax a little bit relax that just soften your body

42
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:01,479
relax your body

43
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:09,639
maybe imagine your self sense the sense of this being who's you kind of

44
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,840
floating being a little amorphous yeah there's a being here that is breathing

45
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:24,319
and sensing in this moment just the raw sensations of feeling and touch and

46
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:35,160
knowing but can we soften let our identity be a bit of bit

47
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,919
light a gas or or or like smoke or it's kind

48
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:46,880
of light not so substantial not so

49
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:53,000
solid Vapor Vapor like light

50
00:06:53,000 --> 00:07:02,240
dissipating just staying with the raw sensation of breathing in sensing and

51
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
hearing

52
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,560
F this breath in breath and out

53
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:27,560
breath Simplicity of this moment here without a sense of identity and

54
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
story

55
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,600
and can we have can we bring a sense of kindness compassion for this being for

56
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,360
this being who is me who has this sometime has this tight sense of

57
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,519
self the sense of identity this clinging this tightening

58
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:08,600
around an identity or what we need or who we are how

59
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:16,360
overseen all of that that whole gamut how painful that is how painful it can

60
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:24,240
be can we have compassion oh dear heart dear being who me

61
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,959
okay as we hold this this Folly this

62
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:38,760
this Folly of sense of self that we cling around and tighten around become

63
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:45,959
self-righteous holding what's called ignorance in Buddhism not knowing how

64
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:52,160
much suffering really holds this tendency of the mind to do that holding it with

65
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,639
compassion not with judgment not kicking ourselves for doing

66
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,760
this but with compassion so sweetheart this hurts it's not [Music]

67
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,480
helpful and and it's hard it's painful I know it's okay it's

68
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:14,680
hard I hold you with care I hold you with compassion this this tendency of the

69
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:21,680
heart in mind let it soften some more let these

70
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,880
Tendencies soften some more as they're held with compassion and

71
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,639
kindness comp passion helps them not become so solid

72
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
solidified

73
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,480
same way would have compassion towards a child that throws a

74
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:41,040
tantum causes so much harm to themselves by screaming and crying and

75
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:48,720
being tied about something about a toy seeing ourselves in that way with

76
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:56,560
compassion yeah it's okay it hurts not needed and this is what children do this

77
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:00,759
is what the sense of self does

78
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:08,240
by seeing it holding you compassion can soften it loosen it instead of adding more insult to

79
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,279
injury or more self-

80
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,480
recommendation to our

81
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
selfing

82
00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:00,800
and bringing kindness compassion with a heal like a healing sve wherever it it's

83
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,680
needed on your

84
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
own

85
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:09,120
and can we have compassion kindness for our self as if you

86
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:16,360
could perhaps separate out and see step out of your identity and look at your

87
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:25,000
identity the way you take yourself to

88
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:33,880
be step out of and have compassion for this self this sense of selfing me my

89
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:42,278
needs my thoughts my priorities my my my step out of that and have compassion for

90
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:50,400
it sense of tenderness because someday you will step out of

91
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:59,120
this we're wearing our identities like a cloak and we will leave them behind someday all of us do of course

92
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,760
can you step out of it right now with your perspective and have compassion for

93
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,960
it oh dear being who is

94
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:18,679
me who will not be someday in this

95
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:25,400
way this perspective might help you have more compassion hold it more lightly

96
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,960
it's not so solid

97
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:21,080
as we bring this meditation to a close

98
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:28,000
together having compassion and kindness for this being who is you who tried

99
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:35,080
their best with being present with having kindness with seeing the sense of self and the Suffering The tightness it

100
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:40,960
can bring if any judgments are arising because you were distracted the mind was

101
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:47,720
distracted and sleepy whatnot it's okay let that go because that too is part of

102
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,520
selfing self judgment it's right there it's in the term let that go have

103
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,480
compassion kindness self self self oh dear dear

104
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:06,039
being who is me ah relax have lightness around it and

105
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:11,240
may this practice we have engaged in together wholeheartedly bringing our

106
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:16,640
heart our intentions our goodness together may it be a cause and condition

107
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,480
for freedom for happiness of all beings

108
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:31,240
everywhere may all beings be happy may all beings be free including

109
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:48,760
myself thanks everyone ah thanks for your

110
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:54,520
practice so practice I invited you to consider

111
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,600
today after we settled a bit and the body with the

112
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:05,440
breath was to uh try to settle to try to

113
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,240
to sit to let go of if there was something that was bothering you you're

114
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:17,600
ruminating on know some some something that was kind of sticky and then and

115
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,760
then if that was impossible if it was really sticky to actually come back to it and see it very clearly like really

116
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:30,799
see it in large capital letters and by the way this is a practice you can anytime anytime it's very

117
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:37,679
powerful and then seeing how that that thing that is bothering us oh seeing the

118
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:43,159
sense of self seeing this sense of personalities the self sense the selfing

119
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:49,200
like I'm annoyed this person did that because it made me look bad oh look at that I'm concerned about how I looked

120
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:56,159
bad or or whatever it might be right just hearing your own seeing your own stories it's we all have them you know

121
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:02,039
no shame it's it's just a part of Being Human and yet seeing how this this self

122
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:07,159
sense can make us tight it really makes our perspective really really narrow and

123
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:13,080
then I invited us to to relax to relax the body as a way to relax the mind and

124
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:19,679
then to relax the mind the self sense like a gas kind of let it be a little fluid and just come to the present

125
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:26,279
moment Sensations just present moment without a sense of self without a story really cuz that's another way we can

126
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:32,360
practice with this to release it and then finally I invited us to bring a sense of compassion and kindness for how

127
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:39,120
this self sense the story uh that we make about various things this this

128
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,520
entanglement brings suffering makes us tight brings brings more suffering and

129
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:51,559
to hold it uh hold it all with kindness and compassion so that was kind of the arc that we

130
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:58,919
did and um yeah can see the empty of Self in

131
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:05,200
this way it's so so fluid you know these stories the and we can change and shift

132
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,120
our perspective anytime so I'd like to invite us now to to engage with one

133
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,600
another in small groups to support each other to explore this further so the way

134
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:23,720
we're going to engage is again for our own sake we're not speaking out loud for

135
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:31,159
the benefit of others educating them informing them telling them we're just exploring for our own sake and letting

136
00:27:31,159 --> 00:27:38,960
them hold witness kind compassionate Witnesses um and and and there's a lot

137
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:47,440
of value to either journaling or or speaking out loud something that you're working with and you can offer a nugget

138
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,279
Let's Go reverse alphabetical order according to first name you offer offer nugget explore for your own sake this

139
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:59,840
practice tonight not something happened today or yesterday or this past like here tonight in this or this morning

140
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:07,039
depending on your time zone um uh this so exploring it when I did this when I

141
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:13,039
explored something that was I was upset about and I saw you the sense self that

142
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:19,360
what it says about me and how I'm seen or it's always happens to me it's like me me me like I saw that and I chuckled

143
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:26,200
like oh that's interesting so exploring for your own sake and when or maybe when I relax my body oh yeah that that sense

144
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:32,559
of self relaxed a little bit so exploring out loud how this practice might have worked or not I have no idea

145
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:38,279
what she was talking about I don't know I was distracted the whole time I fell asleep that's fine too you can explore

146
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:46,039
it and then the next person will offer one nugget then the next person again offer explore not offer explore a nugget

147
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:53,960
then I'll come back to you you can explore some more we'll go round and round and please don't ask questions don't um direct the conversation you are

148
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,320
exploring for yourself and if somebody said something you did not understand don't ask a question they're exploring

149
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:06,159
for their own sake it's not your responsib your duty they're exploring forther so be really be real respectful

150
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,480
caring caring for another and just holding compassionate presence not an

151
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:17,440
inquisitive presence but a compassionate patient presence Let Yourself Go that

152
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:26,480
self that wants to be a be seen in a particular way can you let that go in this exchange try to be seen as smart or

153
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:33,880
be seen as this or be seen as compassionate or just let that go just just just be just be just be yeah this

154
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:40,120

158
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:02,519
something while you were in the small groups and also I'm opening up chat so you're welcome to put your Reflections

159

161
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:20,679
what's up well um thank you uh Nikki it's

162
00:30:20,679 --> 00:30:31,840
always a pleasure to be here and I was commenting in my group that I had been away uh uh from my home doing work uh in

163
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:38,080
the capital of Canada Ottawa and uh I was not able to be here last week and I

164
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:43,200
felt a deep longing for the nurturing that I get here so a big shout out of

165
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:51,080
thanks for that and it really was quite helpful because um I was when you said just let

166
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:57,519
go of whatever you're doing uh just for an hour and then you

167
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:03,240
book ended it at the end with well there will come a time where you let go of

168
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:11,519
everything death and so it became a very powerful way of sort of wow uh I did

169
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:18,679
enjoy letting go for an hour and then I thought really there's nothing to hold on to and it was quite freeing so thank

170
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:25,559
you so much ah thank you so much for Reflections Jerry first I really appreciate you you um yeah speaking

171
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:31,039
about the nurturing of the the nourishment that happy AA provides for

172
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:37,679
you and for so many thanks for naming that and bringing that into the space and also for how the um the invitation

173
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,720
to put it down for an hour and then the reflection of yeah you're going to put all of this down this personality this

174
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:50,000
being who that is you all that just ah that that how that provided a sense of

175
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,080
lightening for you thank you for saying that as beautifully and as clearly as

176
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:03,158
you did yeah beautiful trans transmission from your experience thank you

177
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:10,440
Jerry yeah um see Bill says I've been wanting to

178
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:15,639
work on the I me mind really enjoyed this thank you Nik you're welcome this

179
00:32:15,639 --> 00:32:22,039
is great Bill I'm delighted this this practice uh was uh supportive to you na

180
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:27,320
says I love the idea of identity as a coat we wear and one that we will gently

181
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:34,279
put away when the time comes indeed yeah exactly and then a couple more

182
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:40,559
Reflections requests actually let's see um one person says I struggled deeply with selfie today I've been worrying

183
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,919
someone will get mad at me for a mistake I made it has been extremely painful and

184
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:54,720
I wish I could just leave it behind like you said yeah um interesting to see

185
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:02,679
the I invite the person who wrot wrote this and others who might have you know this might make sense for is to see this

186
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:10,720
you know if you're upset if you're afraid that somebody might get mad at you because um and then see more clearly

187
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,880
that it has to do with this this this fear is is perhaps in a way self-

188
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:23,760
protection of self- protection protecting this self this identity the way this person is SE seen or the person

189
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,480
is perceived or the way he so so try try to see that try to see you don't have to

190
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:35,760
leave it behind because leaving it behind is like trying to push it away I'm not suggesting that that that

191
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:42,320
becomes aversive that's not what I'm suggesting here I'm suggesting that you just see it clearly that's all you do

192
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,320
you see it very clearly how that self sense is stuck is kind of the Lynch pin

193
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:54,159
and and relaxing your body not trying to push away the self sense so so it can be

194
00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:00,000
tricky and yet um there there are ways gently gently

195
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:07,679
gently another reflection I recently ended a long-term romantic relationship as I navigate this major life change

196
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:15,320
I've been trying to find my independent sense of self again how could I approach this in a Dharma compatible way is there

197
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:23,250
a way to go about this kind of transition without selfing so hard yeah what a great question yeah it's

198
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:28,878
[Music] um yeah you know

199
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:37,560
the maybe I will use some different words I think the independent as as the

200
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:43,158
person who wrote this trying to find your independent sense of self maybe

201
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:49,240
maybe what what comes to me is that in the Dharma there is a sense of after a while when we're practicing in the

202
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:55,040
Dharma we become really really mature in the Dharma and we grow a sense of trust

203
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:01,640
in ourselves and Trust in the Dharma and it is said that we become independent in

204
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:07,680
the Dharma the sense of Independence so it's not self-independence but independent the Dharma which comes from

205
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,000
a sense of self trust trusting in ourselves so that's how I suggest the

206
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,720
person who wrote that question a sense of trust in yourself sense of care for

207
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,040
yourself that land there so it doesn't feel like so hard to try to come up with

208
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:30,960
an independent sense of self and Kevin says there was quite a bit of

209
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:37,160
selfing throughout but coming back to the main group I realized the final minute of discussion was so loving and

210
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:43,599
wholesome there wasn't any sense of self in that minute yay yay oh that is so

211
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:49,280
beautiful that makes me so happy because when we experience that for one minute

212
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,400
the sense of love and care this expansiveness of that can be so opening

213
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:01,720
and so healing it doesn't have to be the full 30 minutes of the meditation it's just that that minute or that second

214
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:07,079
when something is just loosens a little bit thanks for that Fred I see your

215
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:12,359
hand thank you Nikki um I want to ask if I'm understanding correctly that there's

216
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:19,040
a there's a paradox inherent in the stepping away from the self or

217
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,359
self-consciousness I guess is the way I'm thinking of it and

218
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:30,000
to to leave a state to leave a state

219
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,720
where I'm viewing myself with any number of qualities you

220
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:42,280
know that then have some you know some veence in the world

221
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:49,200
in terms of what other people think or what I'm thinking about it the best route to leave that is in fact to just

222
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:55,680
be in my body to to the first step is just to sit in what

223
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,880
is physically present in respirating and digesting and all of those things um I

224
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,760
mean it does seem paradoxical to me but that's that is what you're saying isn't it that's one of the things I'm saying

225
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:15,359
exactly Fred that is one of the things I'm saying so one way is to to loosen

226
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:23,359
that get away from that if especially if there's proliferation proliferation just to come

227
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:31,599
to the Simplicity of bear awareness what's called bear awareness here and now the breath the sensations just this

228
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:38,440
being here that's one of the things I'm saying exactly and then there's another thing I'm saying

229
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:43,800
also I'm also saying that when you bring a sense of compassion and kindness

230
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:49,520
instead of this the self-loathing or fear or whatever it is this this

231
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:57,319
tightness that's another way to shift to shift our perspective with a sense of self that also loosens and opens it

232
00:37:57,319 --> 00:38:04,560
so there's a couple of multiple methods but these are two I'm highlighting thank you thank you friend

233
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:11,359
thank you so much for helping highlight it so clearly beautiful so this can be a practice of a

234
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:18,640
lifetime it's it's um this is a practice of a lifetime

235
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:25,480
um and hopefully maybe it it showed itself to you perhaps for a millisecond

236
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:33,480
that oh yeah I could see this maybe through coming to the sense of presence here can loosen a little bit the selfing

237
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:39,960
and and and just say there's no there's nothing wrong with having a self-concept

238
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:46,280
we're not saying that here um but we're saying that when that sense of self becomes contractive

239
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:52,000
contracted really contracted it causes suffering that's all we're saying here

240
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,440
that's all that's the the teachings so there's so much G here um m i see your

241
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:05,720
hand and this is the last reflection we're going to take before we end um that really help me Nikki thank you for

242
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:10,800
this evening um it helped me when you said um if it because it was sticky and

243
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,800
I was laughing so hard because I it wouldn't leave me alone and I couldn't Let It Go um but the moment you said

244
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,440
turn to it I could see the self that helped break it the minute I turned it

245
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:27,720
it was as if it was shattered glass like it all and I thought how many times did

246
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:33,920
I cause the suffering because I don't see the selfing I'm not and this is going to help me tremendously so I want

247
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,400
to thank you for that yay oh thank you so much mimo that
