1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,679
so good morning and i think i have the technology set up a

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,920
little more complicated today

3
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:39,600
we're going to be working with the breathing that's what the anapanasati is where the simple rhythm of breathing

4
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,520
in and breathing out is used as the through line

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:53,039
as the thread that goes through uh all our experience it's kind of like the the um

6
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,719
the beat of the song that's always there or it's the kind of like the ballast of a boat that

7
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:05,119
keeps the boat steady it's a the breathing is a

8
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,960
the rhythm of breathing and the coming and going of breathing so can support the mind to both have

9
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,400
developed a stability and also not to hold on to anything

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:24,240
and in fact this part of the stability of the mind it comes maybe seems like a

11
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,079
paradox comes from not holding on to anything it's when holding on

12
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:37,439
to things being preoccupied being churning away ruminating on things that

13
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,960
the mind becomes more unstable because it has an unstable basis on the

14
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,479
unstable foundation and and so the rhythm of breathing

15
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,159
coming and going it's a con there's continuity there there's a constancy there that supports

16
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,399
us it's always there for us and because the inhale disappears the exhale disappears

17
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,680
it's like a wave like coming and going it's you can't really hold on to the

18
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,440
breathing and so it both provides us with this constancy this stability

19
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,239
and a kind of massage or support to not get caught in anything we still might have thoughts there might

20
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,239
be sensations all kinds of things might happen and we can be aware of them but with the

21
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,520
breathing kind of at the center or the breathing as support as a foundation

22
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,879
it comes and goes they it's a little bit more difficult to mind get fixated

23
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:41,440
or caught on its preoccupations and whatever's going on the emotions that are happening

24
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,280
and so it can be very it can be a gentling effect it can be a nurturing effect it can be a

25
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,720
tranquilizing effect to do this and for this meditation

26
00:02:52,720 --> 00:03:00,720
i'd like to offer you something a little bit extra to pay attention to with the breathing particular quality of

27
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:08,239
it and that is the transition between breathing out and breathing in

28
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,599
the transition between breathing in and breathing out

29
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:20,480
and this is a place where um

30
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,400
just a little extra attention to and there's different things that might happen there

31
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,840
and so this is where you can literally pay attention to how it is for you and it might change over time

32
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,640
that on the in that uh the end of the out uh exhale uh

33
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,920
there might be just a very s automatic quick automatic um

34
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,760
transition between breathing out and breathing in just just boom boom breathe out and then

35
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:03,200
immediately the in-breath begins and that can be noticed how it happens one happens immediately after the other

36
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,760
it might be a the transition might be not so quick it might feel more like

37
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,639
it's gradual the exhale gradually ends and the inhale gradually begins

38
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:23,919
or it might feel like there's a sense a pause between the exhale

39
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,120
and then the beginning of the inhale and each of these has its advantages each of

40
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,040
these is part of the you know you know part of what we can notice but there's something about noticing

41
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:42,720
that transition in a relaxed and open way without expectation that completes the cycle of attention of

42
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,918
breathing in and breathing out and so

43
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,919
and so we'll bring some careful gentle attention to this as we go

44
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,120
through the breathing so to take a comfortable

45
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,199
alert posture and

46
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,840
gently close your eyes

47
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,840
and perhaps taking a few long slow deep breaths full breaths three quarters

48
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:30,400
full and then as you exhale a little longer

49
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,360
exhale than you would just on your own

50
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:42,080
breathing in deeply deeply and then relaxing on the exhale

51
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:53,840
releasing and letting go

52
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,400
letting your breathing return to normal

53
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:40,000
and on the exhale you go through the

54
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,039
little almost like a ritual of relaxing the body

55
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,880
and as you relax see if you can feel

56
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:00,840
some quality of tranquility or peacefulness in the area that you're

57
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:07,840
relaxed so as you exhale relaxing the muscles of

58
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,400
the face

59
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,840
around the eyes

60
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,440
the cheeks jaw

61
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,840
and if it's you're able to relax those muscles

62
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,759
is there any evidence any little even partial sense of tranquility

63
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,840
as part of that

64
00:07:53,599 --> 00:08:00,560
then as you exhale to soften the shoulders release the

65
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,039
shoulders

66
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:13,440
and as the shoulders relax in the shoulders is there any sense of

67
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:27,840
greater calmness or tranquility

68
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,000
as you exhale relaxing the chest

69
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,839
the area around your heart

70
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:49,040
and even if there's agitation in that part of your body if you're able to relax a little bit or

71
00:08:49,040 --> 00:09:09,839
soften are there any even hints of tranquility calmness

72
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,240
and then on the exhale relaxing the

73
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:29,279
belly letting the belly hang forward or

74
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:37,839
settle down deeper into

75
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:51,519
sometimes when we exhale sometimes when we relax the belly

76
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,079
they can also support a relaxation of

77
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:05,440
other areas of the body and you might as you exhale both relax

78
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,760
the belly and see if you can relax at the same time

79
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:19,200
release the shoulders the hands

80
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,839
arms

81
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,839
release the whole body

82
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:42,320
and then feel is there any physical tranquility or calmness

83
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,959
that you can pick up in your body as a whole

84
00:10:50,560 --> 00:11:00,000
even if you do feel some thing opposite to calmness

85
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,360
see if you can be attuned to that which does feel tranquil and calm

86
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:29,839
and as you exhale relax with that calmness

87
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,839
and then becoming more centered on the experience of breathing

88
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:58,800
and in relationship to breathing itself is there any tranquility or calmness

89
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:07,519
or maybe around the experience of breathing underneath it behind it

90
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,079
some feeling of calm or peace

91
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:19,040
that's there associated with the breathing

92
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:39,839
and as you breathe breathe with that calmness breathe with the tranquility

93
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,079
and very calmly without thinking about it too much

94
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:08,240
appreciate or notice how the physical experience of inhaling

95
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,560
is different than the experience of

96
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
exhaling

97
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,480
and then letting go of noticing the difference between them

98
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:49,839
let the inhale just be the inhale allow the exhale to just be the exhale

99
00:13:51,519 --> 00:14:03,839
as if it's the only thing that's here

100
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:53,120
and notice as you inhale the inhale inhale has an

101
00:14:53,120 --> 00:15:00,240
end an end that fades away or an end which

102
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:07,920
comes abruptly and don't just notice and

103
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:27,839
feel the physical experience of that ending of the inhale

104
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:40,800
and then observe the transition to exhaling

105
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,320
maybe a little bit like you're

106
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:54,240
driving in a car and on a flat road and then there comes

107
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:01,519
a little hill a little bump that you gently lift up and then over the the crest and you go

108
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:08,480
down kind of ride

109
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:16,800
the end of the inhale to the beginning of the exhale the

110
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,839
releasing

111
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:39,120
and then the same thing for the end of the exhale beginning of the inhale

112
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:48,480
maybe like driving along and there's a gentle dip in the road in the car it goes into

113
00:16:48,480 --> 00:17:04,480
the dip and then slowly comes up

114
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:12,079
or maybe the transitions are sudden almost like a switch

115
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:21,600
that goes on and off switching from inhale to exhale exhale to inhale

116
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:33,840
both ways are fine gently observe how it is for you

117
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:07,520
and perhaps in doing this careful sensing observing

118
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:18,480
maybe you can feel a quiet intimacy with the experience of

119
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,840
breathing

120
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,559
feeling whatever calmness or tranquility that's here

121
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:53,840
a tranquility that allows breathing to be as it is

122
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,840
comfortable or uncomfortable

123
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:09,440
but you just follow along in this rhythm

124
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:25,840
of breathing

125
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:21,520
seeing if you can feel any tranquility or calmness

126
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,280
associated with any part of the

127
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,840
breathing

128
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:50,240
and perhaps you can notice any calmness might be there in the transition

129
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:57,600
between breathing in and out between out and in

130
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,000
a calmness that's closely related to allowing

131
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,360
allowing that transition to do itself

132
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:31,840
with an intimacy with awareness breathing in breathing out

133
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,080
calmly receive the inhale

134
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,679
in the body

135
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:19,840
calmly release the exhale

136
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:33,039
and ride along in the transitions between these

137
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:40,799
a continuous intimacy tranquility

138
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,840
with your awareness of breathing

139
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:06,559
if you find yourself involved in thinking what happens to your thinking

140
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:23,840
when you place the rhythm of breathing back in the middle of your experience

141
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:54,640
and for these few minutes we have together trust your breathing

142
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,240
more than you trust your thinking

143
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,840
center yourself on breathing in the body

144
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,398
releasing into tranquility as you exhale

145
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:47,840
receiving the inhale in your calmness as you breathe in

146
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:45,839
so

147
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:13,839
[Music] so

148
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,960
and before bringing this to an end

149
00:38:53,040 --> 00:39:00,800
scan through your body to notice what is it and where in your

150
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:07,599
body is there some tranquility calmness

151
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:17,119
even if there's places that are agitated notice the places that are calm or quiet

152
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:26,559
for a few minutes here breathe with that tranquility breathe through it

153
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:34,480
breathe along with

154
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,880
tranquility calmness

155
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:43,839
peacefulness

156
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:57,599
as if it's a gentle vapor that you can

157
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:04,480
blow through your body spread outwards throughout your whole

158
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:11,838
body as you breathe

159
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,000
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

160
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,838
perhaps in a world that's so agitated

161
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,599
our calmness

162
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:07,759
can be so that we don't fuel that agitation further

163
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:13,359
may it be that we don't add to people's anxiety

164
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:22,160
may it be that we don't contribute to restlessness

165
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,839
maybe that we don't reinforce

166
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,560
agitation of any kind

167
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:47,839
and may it be that whatever goodness benefit that we received from this

168
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:55,040
sitting may we dedicate it

169
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,838
to the benefit of others

170
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:09,839
may in our calmness may our benefits and merit

171
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:18,400
spread out across the lands so that all beings be happy

172
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,839
so that all beings might be safe

173
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:35,599
so that all beings might be peaceful

174
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,240
so that all beings might be free

175
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:51,680
may all being everywhere be free of all that oppresses

176
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,838
may all beings be happy

177
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:13,359
