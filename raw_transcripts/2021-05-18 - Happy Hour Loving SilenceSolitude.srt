1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
okay great so now a formal hello formal opening of our time

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,599
together and happy hour so

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:20,160
so for the theme for today's practice um i'd like to invite us

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,720
to explore love and silence

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,599
love and solitude as a theme for our exploration today

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,399
so

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,680
a lot of times we might think that this idea of love is only relational it's

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,800
only when we're in relationship with others whereas actually

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:58,000
when we come together or say or on our own when we practice cultivating

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,920
meta loving kindness friendliness we take refuge in seclusion

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,040
we take refuge in silence we take refuge in our hearts

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,360
away from the busyness of our lives interacting with other people in order

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:27,920
to really tap into the sense of goodness kindness both for ourselves and for others so

14
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:35,439
this seclusion this silence is not a negative it's not

15
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,040
a um uh

16
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,159
a challenging it's it's not a dearth but it's actually rich with possibility

17
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,680
the seclusion the silence this this taking refuge

18
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,439
in the simplicity so for us to really bring that into the forefront because

19
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,600
yes of course we know that and yet to really honor this taking time

20
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:13,200
away in seclusion of our minds um in solitude giving our heart to

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,000
it with loving it not just because oh i have to be in solitude and i have to

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,360
be alone but actually relishing it what a beautiful what a beautiful

23
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,959
amazing opportunity it is to do this

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,879
and i'll share with you that this theme is quite relevant for me and and

25
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:45,040
maybe i'll make the announcement here at this point because for the next couple of weeks i'm going into personal retreat

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:52,160
um embracing solitude embracing um silent so there will be a host of

27
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,080
wonderful uh teachers for my wednesdays and fridays

28
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,720
and um so i'll be embracing a sense of solitude and to cultivate to

29
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:12,480
cultivate as out of love really cultivating love and and wisdom in

30
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:19,040
this beautiful container of of solitude

31
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:26,480
and i also want to bring this in because after a year of isolation more than a year of isolation

32
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:34,799
many of us might not have a very friendly relationship to solitude um anymore thinking oh

33
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,879
isolate we might equate it to loneliness or isolation or as it's a

34
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:47,440
beautiful thing solitude silence and again i might be

35
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,640
preaching to the choir you may already know this and yet to embrace that

36
00:03:52,640 --> 00:04:01,439
and really embrace the juiciness the juiciness of taking refuge in silence and solitude

37
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:08,400
even if it may not be a couple of weeks but it might be just for 30 minutes together

38
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:18,079
taking refuge and before we start i wanted to share a quote by let me pull it up here we go

39
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,880
um a quote uh by thomas merton the well

40
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:31,759
known um priest and um and mystic

41
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,080
maybe one could call him so this is the quote

42
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,199
from vocation to solitude a vocation to solitude

43
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:50,320
so he says to deliver oneself up to hand oneself over to trust oneself

44
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,560
completely to the silence of a wide landscape of woods and hills

45
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:03,440
or sea or desert to sit still while the sun comes up over that land

46
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:10,400
and fills its silence with light to pray and work in the morning and to labor and rest in the afternoon

47
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,960
and to sit still again in meditation in the evening when night falls upon that land and when

48
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,759
silence fills itself with darkness and with stars this is a true and special vocation

49
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:30,320
there are a few who are willing to become complete who who belong completely to such silence to

50
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:37,039
let it soak into their bones to breathe nothing but silence to feed on silence and to turn

51
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,080
the very substance of their life into a living and vigilant silence

52
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:48,880
so in praise of silence again even it may not be complete the whole day but even in 30

53
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:56,720
minutes of silence of bringing ourselves this vocation this giving our hearts to

54
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:04,000
solitude to silence as a cultivation as a beautiful thing as an honoring

55
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,960
so plenty of words let's embrace more silence so i like to invite

56
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,160
us to get into our meditation posture

57
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
landing

58
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,840
landing in silence

59
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:49,199
embracing precious solitude

60
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,400
of solitude

61
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:17,840
calming comforting like a whisper revealing secrets

62
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,120
taking refuge in silence in our hearts

63
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,840
as much silence as available in our minds

64
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,840
letting the breath be the lullaby

65
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,800
of nature calming

66
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
soothing

67
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,839
relishing the deliciousness of solitude

68
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:23,839
of silence

69
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:04,000
noticing if your mind rushes to fill

70
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:15,839
the spaciousness of silence internally

71
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:29,120
notice if that's the case

72
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,240
as if teaching a beloved pupil

73
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,600
a beloved youngster that is your mind

74
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,880
instructing teaching pointing out

75
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:57,839
expansiveness the ease the nourishment

76
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:11,839
of silence

77
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
uh

78
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:48,160
notice how within [Music] the silence solitude

79
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,160
inherent in it can be a sense of ease

80
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,639
acceptance being accepted just as you are

81
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:16,720
you don't have to do anything or be anything or anybody

82
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,639
ah the heart can relax

83
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,839
be accepted be loved

84
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,429
put down the burdens of doing [Music]

85
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,839
and be nourished

86
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:50,000
the spaciousness of silence of solitude

87
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,839
how healing it can be

88
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,600
notice that your mind has a choice

89
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,960
you have a choice in the way you see

90
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,880
solitude and silence

91
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,160
your mind can choose to see it as unwelcome

92
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,960
as lonely as empty

93
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:05,200
unwelcome your mind can choose to see the beauty

94
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,279
the grace the spaciousness

95
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:19,360
the ease the healing nourishing loving

96
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:33,200
dimensions of silence precious

97
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,639
precious solitude

98
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,080
you have choice more choice than you realize

99
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:57,840
than you give yourself credit for

100
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:25,840
the beauty the grace

101
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:43,039
letting yourself be held the safety nourishment of silence

102
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:55,840
in the meta friendliness of silence

103
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:17,679
now if you wish within your solitude

104
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:26,080
silence if you wish you can invite

105
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:34,640
someone who's dear to you their image their sense felt sense

106
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:44,559
if you wish or you could invite yourself as you have in here the only one

107
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:51,840
as a beloved other or you could invite the whole world if

108
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:58,840
you wanted to within this silence the solitude of your

109
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,840
heart

110
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,200
it's a safe nourishing place

111
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:16,960
to offer generosity of love and care good will

112
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:28,080
maybe just inviting if you're relatively new to the practice

113
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:34,640
or if it not just inviting one being who's easy

114
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,240
maybe a pet a child

115
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,400
someone for whom your good will and care flows with ease

116
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:51,679
dividing them into your solitude

117
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:59,440
to this expansive safe castle of silence in your heart

118
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:11,840
and hold them dearly offer good will care

119
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:26,960
in silence or if you wish with words of meta or maybe just silently today

120
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:39,760
with a smile with a gesture of generosity and care

121
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:53,840
maybe a hug

122
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:17,520
maybe your silent expression of love and care for this being

123
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:31,840
is serving something for them to drink or eat

124
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:04,960
thanking this dear being who has joined you

125
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,720
in your silence your solitude bowing to them

126
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,360
allowing them to take leave

127
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:25,200
and in your heart the spaciousness of silence

128
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:33,840
showering yourself

129
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,679
with good will

130
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,840
with friendliness

131
00:31:50,480 --> 00:32:01,840
holding yourself with kindness

132
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:11,679
and if judgments arise or busyness of thoughts

133
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,840
or non-deserving thoughts

134
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,600
let them fade into silence they don't have to be believed

135
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:43,840
let them drop into the silence lovingly engulfed in the silence

136
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:44,480
for the last couple of minutes see if there is a

137
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:53,360
sense of gratitude appreciation for this expansiveness

138
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:59,679
of solitude silence quiet

139
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,840
reigning in your heart and mind

140
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,839
and as i ring the bell i invite you to listen

141
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:20,079
to the silence the expanse of silence

142
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:30,240
between the notes and then maybe your mind will open up to

143
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,400
the silence expansiveness of silence within the

144
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,838
notes within the sound

145
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,519
[Music]

146
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,030

151
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:08,880
and seeing how solitude silence

152
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,800
is this beautiful castle where we can expand where we can cultivate

169
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:12,640
sometimes uncomfortable thank you bill for sharing that and for noticing that

170
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:20,720
this tapping into the silent solitude relishing that ah i'm delighted to hear

171
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,480
how that brought in more ease for you so know that that's always available to

172
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,599
you when you practice on your own also tuning into

173
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:39,760
tuning into these dimensions that are available yeah and lovely i'm delighted bill

174
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,079
yay

175
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,880
other reflections what was surprising what was challenging

176
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:58,079
i also wonder uh austin says not sure how to raise my hand ah okay

177
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,200
i will find you austin and i'll ask you to unmute yourself and taryn says i love the phrase

178
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:12,800
expansive silence thank you you're welcome terence thank you austin please

179
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:19,359
hi yeah oh everybody um

180
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:26,000
so yeah this really spoke to me um i think i'm on my eighth day of 10 days

181
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,319
off right now from work which always sounds really nice and then

182
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:39,520
there's a lot of free time and then and i run out of things to do and um

183
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:46,240
people aren't as available as i am so i have a lot of time to myself and

184
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:54,240
and i've known like i'm i would i usually tell people i'm like 100 extrovert i love being around people i

185
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:00,880
feel the happiest i'm around people and i know that i need this solitude

186
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:08,079
to kind of reflect also be to be productive and get things

187
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:13,520
done and be creative i i need that time to myself

188
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,880
but i feel like just this last week i've had a lot of time to myself

189
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:28,800
and i've just noticed that i get less clear there's less clarity

190
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:35,280
when i have so much time with myself then it's like more thoughts come and almost a little

191
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,440
bit of rumination and i feel like i have the most clarity

192
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:47,680
and i'm the most happiest when i have like a few hours of solitude per

193
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,760
day where i can kind of reflect and be productive and get things done and create

194
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,960
and then i can kind of be social and

195
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:05,119
have that dialogue with people and get feedback from them and yeah

196
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,480
yeah yeah thank you for sharing that lovely thank you austin so appreciate the

197
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,680
wisdom of knowing that your heart needs solitude and silence in

198
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:22,560
order to nourish itself and be creative and and you've observed that a few hours

199
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:28,000
of solitude in silence and some interaction and feedback is is helpful

200
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,359
so one one invitation you can explore this and i know you've done silent

201
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:41,119
retreats right i i tried i i remember you have where there's a lot of silence and and

202
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:48,480
you know one is with other people but there's still a sense of solitude so um yes to honor

203
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:56,960
what you know about yourself what you're discovering about yourself this balance and not to completely believe it have

204
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:03,680
a little bit of question mark also about it too might be interesting to explore like oh

205
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:10,880
is it actually is it really really true that after some um solitude and silence then my mind

206
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,119
guess gets restless and gets um

207
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:22,079
rumination happens do you just take that for granted you see what i'm saying so taking that

208
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:29,119
like oh this is just what happens this is who i am might actually be limiting more

209
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:37,680
more wisdom more silence more even deeper nourishment to happen i don't know maybe be curious about that

210
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:44,079
who knows maybe might be true may not be but who knows

211
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:50,640
and again you can just let this go if this doesn't land for you at all austin

212
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:58,560
yeah thank you a few other reflections before we go into groups america says

213
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,920
was empowering how we can bring love and ease to our inner world by connecting to

214
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,960
silence yes thank you and another reflection

215
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,960
i also feel benefit from just the quiet rest of it beautiful thanks for that

216
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:22,319
reflection nicholas says exploring how silence can hold the thinking mind i tend to assume that

217
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:29,359
silence is threatened by thinking but it seems silence has plenty of space for a busy mind oh

218
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:35,200
beautiful nicholas i love what you said and i i especially

219
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,960
um what austin said about the ruminating mind i wonder if silence this is another

220
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:47,599
way to explore silences holding that instead of oh now i need to attend to the ruminations beautiful

221
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:54,400
one more reflection um just to me i noticed how i got attacked got

222
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:00,000
attached excuse me how i got attached to the silence i didn't want you to talk

223
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,200
yes exactly sarah isn't that interesting our heart gets touched like no i want any more talking

224
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:14,880
now let it continue that's sweet oh jamie says the contrast

225
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,000
this uh the contrast this practice provided with the incessant mental

226
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:27,280
chatter that fills most of my waking moments was breathtaking thank you thank you jamie really

227
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:34,160
appreciate your astute observation and and your your comment your

228
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:40,079
observation is breathtaking so so thank you dear ones

229
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:46,800
for taking this journey into silence one last comment i was noticing how

230
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:53,040
solitude is relational when listening to the rain falling outside there was no solitude there was

231
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:59,680
just experience ah nice interesting thank you david

232
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:06,560
so dear ones now let's take the sense of solitude invite a couple of other people into our

233
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,760
solitude wholeheartedly with meta with care for ourselves and

234
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:19,839
for others and see how this can work after some solitude opening up opening up to this relational

235
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:25,520
field and practicing with others so creating the breakout rooms and again

236
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:34,880
we'll always start we'll start with um 15 seconds of meta silent meta

237
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,200
for each other and then um you can share as little or as much as

238
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:52,319
you wish so here we go i'm opening the rooms

239
00:47:52,319 --> 00:48:00,400
hello everyone welcome back so we have a couple of minutes

240
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:07,920
for final reflection or comment what you noticed they're about to practice or after

241
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,119
connecting with others

242
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:26,318
is please of silence connecting to others through silence

243
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:35,839
solitude

244
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,599
you're all silent you've taken the instructions well i see people nodding

245
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:57,200
and smiling [Laughter] oh that's sweet and heart that's great i

246
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,559
love it yes silence is delicious so

247
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:08,240
so dear ones um oh neil has something to say here we go

248
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:13,440
neil so so it

249
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:20,400
you know it doesn't directly relate to tonight's um small group but you know i find that

250
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,640
sometimes i'm in a group with you know people who tend to be quieter you know

251
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:32,160
and there's like you know awkward silences or potentially awkward silences

252
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:39,200
um you know and other times you know there are people who are very chatty and you know ask about the weather and you know about

253
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:44,720
the what's behind me you know and things of that sort you know and you know i

254
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:51,359
almost always find you know that you know the people who like lean to the silence you know i i feel a

255
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:59,040
deeper connection with them um you know yeah

256
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:06,640
thank you neil what you said in your experience is profound is profound i mean sometimes

257
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:13,920
there could be genuine curiosity about what's in the background where you're sitting and yet if if it feels like it's just a

258
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:19,440
rush to fill the uncomfortable silence it doesn't it doesn't feel

259
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:25,680
very connecting whereas just sitting in silence with another being and by the way in in

260
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:33,040
meditation circles we don't have such a thing as an awkward silence it's just silence it's delicious silence it's

261
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,720
beautiful silence so that's maybe that's one thing i'll invite from now on as we go into groups

262
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:45,760
for us to consider the silence is just precious as a time to be so really appreciate the awkward chatter

263
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:51,119
oh there you go that's it it's delicious silence awkward chatter i love it neil i

264
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:56,800
love it i love it maybe we'll add that to the like um we should come up with the

265
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:03,599
uh google groups here like things to consider when you go into to break out groups so

266
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,800
maybe this will be one of them neil so dear ones thank you all

267
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:15,680
