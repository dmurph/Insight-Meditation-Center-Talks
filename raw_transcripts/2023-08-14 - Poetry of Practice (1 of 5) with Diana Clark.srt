5

6
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,200
so welcome welcome everybody we'll wait a few minutes before we begin

7
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,560
good morning good morning everybody well I'm saying good morning it's morning from me but of course it's not working

8
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,840

for those of you who are just signing on again I'll say welcome we'll begin here maybe

11
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:46,459
less than a minute or so

12
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:34,259
okay I think we'll begin now again welcome it's nice to be practicing

13
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:39,300
with you all here on this side of the camera for those of you who don't know me I'm

14
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:45,479
Diana Clark I teach at the Insight Meditation Center usually I'm teaching there on Monday nights

15
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:50,820
so often I'm teaching in the evenings rather than

16
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,280
here in the mornings and as you can see from the title of the

17
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,820
video that I turned out this morning this week I want to do the Poetry of practice

18
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,820
and as the days go on this week I'll unpack that like what are the different ways we might understand that

19
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,280
but I'll begin by saying there's a way in which we can engage with practice

20
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:21,300
that is concerned with technique make sure the should we be mindful of the breath here right on the upper lip or

21
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:28,440
should we be mindful of the chest or the belly or there's some way like we're really concerned with the technique or

22
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:35,400
maybe there's a way where practice that we're concerned with the Buddhist lists like wow okay now what was the 17th step

23
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,820
of uh or I know there's ten parmies but what are all the ten or

24
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:47,220
something there's might be this way in which we have this real concern with am

25
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:54,000
I doing it right what are the whole lists and do I have everything all the information that I need

26
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,600
and that is a valuable way to practice and that certainly has its place and it's been a real support for me

27
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,660
in my practice but it's not the only way

28
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:15,479
and it can be a trap if we think like it is the only way that we just have to learn all the lists and know all of the

29
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:22,440
techniques and try to get their exact right list for the exact right technique so I'd like to point to this other way

30
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,539
today there's other ways that invites an

31
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:32,940
another type of knowing that maybe a type of knowing that

32
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:41,240
encourages an opening of the heart or maybe a tip of coming home

33
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,979
that type of practicing that recognizes something true and pure

34
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:53,759
inside of us something that feels like really maybe clean and beautiful

35
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,660
inside of us and that allows us to like soften this continually

36
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:06,600
grasping or evaluating or looking for the next moment that sense of am I doing this

37
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:14,460
right and then of course is practicing with verse or poetry

38
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:19,740
that in language touch us in a different way

39
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:28,620
I don't want to devalue the lists and the techniques I just want to add or maybe broaden our understanding our

40
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:35,400
appreciation the ways that practice can show up and so rather than just consuming

41
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:41,819
information and trying to adapt to the information that we learn instead

42
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:47,280
allowing ourselves to be nourished by the words

43
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,780
to be touched and fed by what we hear

44
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:01,800
and many of you will know there is plenty of verse in the poly Canon so this is something that practitioners for

45
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:07,259
the throughout these Millennia have been practicing with first and we'll be doing some of that

46
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:13,620
and today during the guided sit I'll drop in a verse

47
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:19,620
a short poem and then in the short talk afterwards um

48
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:27,120
talk about it and maybe provide some other poems okay so with that as an introduction

49
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,000
Let's uh take a meditation posture

50
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:51,140
and taking a moment to really settle in

51
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:57,500
like to sit and know you're sitting

52
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:09,260
bringing an aliveness of attention to the experience of sinning

53
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:23,040
breathing the sensations of touch with the floor so the feet

54
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,720
touching the floor or if you're sitting on the floor the legs

55
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:40,100
the buttocks sitting on the chair or the cushion

56
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,480
bench couch maybe even the bed however

57
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:51,080
you are this moment whatever posture you're in at this moment

58
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,959
maybe your back is supported feeling the pressure the touch with the back

59
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,279
to the back of the chair

60
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,160
bringing this aliveness of attention this mindfulness

61
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:21,319
into the body into that bodily experience

62
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:29,060
inhabiting the body with aliveness with presence

63
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:46,200
and then setting the sense of direction uh movement we're going

64
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,240
the rest of this meditation period can you set their intention as one of

65
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,600
kindness is it possible to have a sense of this

66
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:04,459
moment holding yourself in care

67
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:12,620
within yourself with a kind attitude in warmth

68
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:28,579
putting aside any Notions of this being a self-improvement project

69
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:39,060
and through this meditation period return into this orientation

70
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,899
kindness

71
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:03,120
and then connecting with the anchor whether that's our breath for many of us

72
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:10,880
it will be the breath and feeling the sensations of breathing

73
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:15,320
in a relaxed easy way

74
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:22,860
but not a Cavalier way a way that has some

75
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:29,640
intention or commitment to being the sensations of the breath

76
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,500
or whatever your anchor is

77
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:08,279
and when the mind wanders that might be a time to remind ourselves

78
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:14,880
of this orientation towards kindness and just very simply gently

79
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,700
Begin Again no need to make stories

80
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:25,740
doesn't mean anything about us as meditators it just means the Mind

81
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,500
wandered and then we just come back

82
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:02,180
really feeling the sensations of breathing

83
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:08,480
the beginning middle and end of an exhale

84
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:28,339
in the beginning middle and end of an inhale

85
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:05,720
and the transitions between inhales and exhales

86
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,879
foreign

87
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:42,000
nowhere else to be nothing else to do

88
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,259
we're just here with the experience of breathing

89
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:59,000
in a simple and complicated way

90
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:13,340
foreign

91
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:30,620
I'm going to drop in a short poem

92
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:40,820
you don't need to do anything with this poem

93
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:49,880
just allow it to be heard

94
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,600
maybe it touches something maybe it doesn't

95
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,460
the poem goes like this

96
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:30,539
while walking along the river after a long day meditating

97
00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:37,919
on vulture Peak I watched an elephant

98
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,340
splashing its way out of the water and up the bank

99
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:49,740
hello my friend a person waiting there said scratching

100
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:56,600
the elephant behind its ear did you have a good bath

101
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:05,220
the elephant stretched out its leg the person climbed up

102
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:10,919
and the two wrote off like that together

103
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:21,659
seeing what had once been so wild now a friend and companion to this good

104
00:23:21,659 --> 00:23:28,919
person I took a seat under the nearest tree

105
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:35,059
and reached out a gentle hand to my own mind

106
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:43,460
truly I thought this is why I came to the woods

107
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:59,220
seen what had once been so wild now a friend and companion to this good

108
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:05,880
person I took a seat under the nearest tree and

109
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:12,320
reached out a gentle hand to my own mind

110
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:20,780
truly I thought this is why I came to the woods

111
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:04,580
thank you

112

122
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,858
hello again

123
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:51,919
so this poem that I read during the guided meditation

124
00:34:52,919 --> 00:35:00,480
maybe it's written by a poet who was inspired by the poems of the terrygata

125
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,000
some of you might know the Terracotta are the poems of Awakening poems of women

126
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,599
from the time of the Buddha and this poet was inspired by them and like

127
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:19,140
reinterpreted them and I wrote new poems which I think are lovely which I think are really lovely

128
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:24,319
and maybe I'll just quickly repeat the poem here

129
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:32,520
while walking along the river after a long day meditating on vulture

130
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:40,020
Peak I watched an elephant splashing its way out of the water and up the bank

131
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:47,400
hello my friend a person writing there said scratching the elephant behind its ear did you have

132
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,680
a good bath the elephant stretched out its leg the

133
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,960
person climbed up and the two rode off like that together

134
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:04,800
seen what had once been so wild now a friend and companion to this good person

135
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,740
I took a seat under the nearest tree and reached out a gentle hand

136
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:17,099
to my own mind truly I thought this is why I came to

137
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:24,180
the woods so sometimes meditation practice is not

138
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:31,440
befriending our mind but instead there's a certain type of beating ourselves up or berating ourselves or speaking

139
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:39,119
disparagingly about ourselves about our practice and so what would it mean for us to make

140
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:47,220
friends with our minds what would it mean to soften this inner critic that sometimes

141
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,920
shows up with the meditation practice and so this inner critic we might think

142
00:36:52,920 --> 00:37:00,599
of it as something like this sub personality inside of us a certain dynamic or constellation of experiences

143
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:08,579
that puts us down belittles us as this judging blaming nagging

144
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:14,700
and it has this quality of harshness and it kind of creates this inner

145
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:20,460
climate or this inner environment of harshness and when this inner critic is

146
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:27,000
up and running there's this pervasive sense of inadequacy of being enough

147
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,680
whatever I'm doing is not quite right or somehow insufficient

148
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,560
and so when there's the inner criticus

149
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:48,420
really allowed us authoritative or really present

150
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:55,140
there's a sense of that we just don't accept things like it's not good enough

151
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:00,660
it's not okay I don't accept it you know whatever whatever our experience is this

152
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:06,240
shouldn't be happening and the four noble truths of course

153
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,900
recognize that the first truth is there is suffering

154
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:18,560
and then the second Noble Truth is there's something that's underlying that's suffering

155
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:26,820
and so instead of asking a question like what is underlying this what is supporting this and the inner critic is

156
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:35,780
really up and running we often ask by doing it right

157
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:43,020
we might have this feeling that we're not doing it right so can we as one way of making friends with

158
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:48,240
the mind can we change the question

159
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,700
instead of am I doing this right I'm sure I'm not doing this right

160
00:38:53,700 --> 00:39:01,760
can we change the question to one of how am I

161
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:08,280
how am I right now and this question is very different it

162
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:15,300
has this question of kindness rather than meeting demands it's a

163
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:22,020
question of care so when we notice that the inner critic is really up and running can we make

164
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:28,140
friends with the mind and one way to do this is to just ask

165
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:35,060
how am I how am I in this moment

166
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:43,140
and so there's another poem that points to this

167
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:49,020
points to this orientation of kindness and friendship with oneself and with

168
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:56,220
one's mind with what's happening at that moment this is by the same poet whom I'll say at the end but right now I'll

169
00:39:56,220 --> 00:40:00,980
just read the poem the poem goes like this

170
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:07,680
after 20 25 years on the path

171
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:14,520
I had experienced almost everything except peace

172
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:20,700
when I was young my mother told me that I would find true happiness only in

173
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:27,720
marriage and remembering her words all those years later something in me began to

174
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,760
tremble I gave myself to the trembling

175
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:41,640
and it showed me all the pain this little heart had ever known how countless lives of searching

176
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:47,339
had brought me at last to the present moment

177
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:53,700
which I happily married and can you imagine

178
00:40:53,700 --> 00:41:00,260
we've been living together ever since without a single argument

179
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:07,800
I love this poem right it kind of has this little twist in there that we're not expecting

180
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:15,960
and the poem starts with it seems as if this practitioner had a difficulty with practice practitioner writes after 25

181
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:22,859
years on the path I'd experienced almost everything except peace

182
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:30,619
sometimes this is a way in which the inner critic shows up it's like 25 years you know however long 25 minutes

183
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:36,060
20 weeks or whatever however long we're been practicing sometimes we have this

184
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:43,820
feeling like I should get it by now I should be having different experiences

185
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:49,079
I've been having an experienced everything all this terribleness except

186
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:55,020
peace there might be some way in which the inner critic shows up telling us that we should have different

187
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:01,940
experiences than what we're having and then in this poem The practitioner

188
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:08,820
allowed herself to tremble but some of you might know that

189
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:15,599
trembling it's kind of like a compassion sometimes described as quivering of the

190
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:22,680
heart so what if this trembling that that practitioner here this poet is pointing

191
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,619
to is this quivering of the heart this compassion

192
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:35,040
and showing the pain that she'd had like all these years being met with

193
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:42,740
compassion and then she marries the present moment

194
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:48,180
and then she said can you imagine let's see what was we've been living together

195
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:55,320
ever since without a single argument and I kind of like this idea of that uh

196
00:42:55,320 --> 00:43:02,460
like marrying the present moment because there's a way right in which there's a commitment there's a loyalty

197
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:08,640
but with no guarantees it's always going to be fun and easy like we know this we

198
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:13,859
know this in our relationships with everybody you know whether friends

199
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:19,859
family members spouses Partners kids right we know this with all of our relationships that sometimes there's

200
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:27,359
some ease and sometimes there's some difficulties but we can have this commitment this loyalty to staying

201
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:34,200
and here she's staying with the present moment so what would it mean to stay with the

202
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:42,318
present moment even though it's not always easy not always Pleasant

203
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,720
and then maybe I'll bring in a third poem written by the

204
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:55,140
same poet and it goes like this

205
00:43:55,140 --> 00:44:03,480
I had said you know of course the same theme I was forever getting lost

206
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:10,140
until one day the Buddha told me to walk this path you will need seven

207
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:17,160
friends mindfulness curiosity courage Joy

208
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:22,760
calm Stillness and perspective

209
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:29,099
for many years these friends and I have traveled together sometimes wandering in

210
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:34,920
circles sometimes taking the long way around there were days when I thought I

211
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:40,800
couldn't go on there were days when I thought I was finally beaten it's scary

212
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,020
to give all of yourself to just one thing what if you don't make it

213
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:52,400
oh my heart you don't have to go It Alone

214
00:44:52,880 --> 00:45:01,220
train yourself to train just a little more gently

215
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:08,780
oh my heart you don't have to go It Alone

216
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:15,380
train yourself to train just a little more

217
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:24,000
some of you might recognize that the list of the seven friends at the beginning of this poem are the seven

218
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:29,700
factors of Awakening here this poet is uh interpreting them

219
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:37,260
as mindfulness curiosity courage Joy calm Stillness and perspective

220
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:45,000
it's fantastic can you imagine if we have these as friends as companions on our path and then the poet is adding a

221
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:50,640
few more things to this list this confidence or maybe some conviction or

222
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,680
some Trust let me have some antidotes to doubt this

223
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,960
idea the poet writes it's scary to give all of yourself to just one thing what

224
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:07,680
if you don't make it imagine this is certain way the inner critic shows up it's like what if you

225
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,900
don't make it I better like hedge my bets and maybe I'll do a little bit of this a little bit of that or I'll be

226
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:20,160
present only sometimes when it's Pleasant or not other times or something like this but instead is

227
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:27,060
pointing to this gentle persistence at the end with this emphasis on gentle

228
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:33,660
making these seven factors making some confidence or conviction part of the

229
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:38,760
companions on this path rather than something we're supposed to

230
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:44,160
do other than something that we're supposed to do to make ourselves better

231
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:52,740
or somehow fix something what would it be like to just have these companions on our

232
00:46:52,740 --> 00:47:00,359
path in the same way that we make friends with the mind

233
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:05,460
friends with the present moment what would it be like to be friendly

234
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:12,380
with the seven sectors of Awakening to invite them in as companions

235
00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:20,339
so these three poems some of you might have heard of them some of you not perhaps

236
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:27,260
um or by Matty winegast last name is spelled

237
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:34,260
w-e-i-n-g-a-s-t Matty wine ghost and these are poems that are collected

238
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:40,260
in this book that's called the first free women poems of the early Buddhist

239
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:46,740
nuns and these are Maddie's interpretation of

240
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:52,079
some Awakening poems of some women and they're really beautiful I love them

241
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:58,619
they bring in a certain amount of Whimsy they bring in something that seems so relevant in the way of describing

242
00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:04,200
practice in a I don't know coming from a different angle instead of this is what we should

243
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:10,980
do or something heavy or but instead kind of fussy for me it just makes my

244
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:18,660
heart sing in some kind of way and I feels like there's some openness and ease a real invitation to bring this

245
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:24,319
singing this openness this ease to our practice

246
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:32,579
so this week we'll be exploring different poems but like maybe point to practice but in

247
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:40,140
a different way in a way that hopefully is a way that maybe nourishes

248
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:46,560
and warms the heart and then allows kind of like an invitation to all aspects of

249
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:52,400
ourselves including the inner critic they're invited to

250
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:58,380
and bring this full-heartedness to our practice

251
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:05,960
so thank you and I'll see you tomorrow foreign
