1
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,339
good evening

2
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:36,620
many of you are already meditating

3
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,779
just to say that we'll sit for 45 minutes

4
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,060
a little Derma talk

5
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,680
so I'll see you in 45 minutes

6
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:22,380
good evening hello can the volume be just a tiny bit louder

7
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:27,660
because I feel I'm stressed or I feel like I'm making

8
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:34,559
my volume a little bit better and I'm just saying words so the volume okay

9
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:41,160
there we go thank you thank you otherwise I feel like at the end I'm

10
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:45,619
really straining so thank you sveta

11
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:58,140
so welcome welcome so tonight I'd like to talk about

12
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:04,680
this phenomenon that happens sometimes around the end of January or February or

13
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:09,839
March somewhere in there where we have maybe these ideas that

14
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:15,180
we're going to begin a meditation practice with uh we have a lot of enthusiasm

15
00:55:15,180 --> 00:55:20,640
we're gonna sit more or sit longer those of you who are here right

16
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:26,940
I already have a practice but sometimes we might have this idea that

17
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:32,760
we have this great resolve and we're going to meditate every day or we're going to have compassion for all beings

18
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:38,160
all the time we're we're going to follow the precepts exactly and never tell a

19
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:44,339
white lie again or all these types of things it's not uncommon at the beginning of the year the end of the

20
00:55:44,339 --> 00:55:51,960
holiday season to have these ideas I think it's pretty common in fact

21
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:59,220
but then something happens and we lose Steam

22
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:04,260
we lose kind of the momentum or the motivation

23
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:12,480
and then what we earlier had been so committed to and yes this is what we're going to do then it just turns into a

24
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:20,400
chore and something that we don't really want to do and we find ourselves feeling like

25
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:27,780
I'm too tired I'm not going to do that I'm not going to get up early I'm not going to drive to IMC I'm not going to

26
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:33,119
stay up late or it's too hard everybody else seems

27
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:40,140
like they can do it but I don't know I need to find something easier for me or I don't know there's like this Untold

28
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:45,660
number of little Expressions that we can have for ourselves or

29
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:51,359
can be telling ourselves if why we're not getting to the cushion

30
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:56,460
and maybe we completely abandoned this whole idea and kind of gets put on the

31
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:02,520
in the pile of other things that we thought we would do but hadn't quite got around to or

32
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:09,300
or maybe we spend some time kind of beating ourselves up

33
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:16,800
there's this quiet little voice saying well you said you were gonna sit longer or sit every day and you're not and it's

34
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:25,220
just like that other thing you were going to eat will exercise more you know all these things that we say we often do

35
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:33,480
so I'd like to kind of describe this using this word of resistance like there's

36
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:39,599
some resistance uh maybe I'll say specifically like getting to the cushion

37
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:47,280
cushion being some meditation practice so this resistance or maybe there's a

38
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,980
way in which we sometimes I like this word I feel like I'm in a tussle with myself this little you know little

39
00:57:52,980 --> 00:58:01,020
wrestling match kind of there's a part that's come on Diana now they're probably like no I don't want to

40
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:07,680
I think it's not so unique to me but I think this is part of the human

41
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:13,500
experience but there's a way in which there's can

42
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:19,680
be resistance to even just getting to the cushion or if that is not something that's a problem maybe it's already a

43
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:25,020
habit to sit regularly this idea of resistance can come up or

44
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:32,280
even this idea of a tussle or a struggle can come up even if we are on the cushion and we don't want what's

45
00:58:32,280 --> 00:58:38,400
happening to be happening and we're struggling or pushing it away or

46
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:44,520
resisting it so if resistance shows up in all kinds of different ways even for us to not get

47
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:49,680
to the cushion but if we are there to not be with what's happening

48
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:56,099
and so I'd like to talk a little bit about resistance is just a natural part of

49
00:58:56,099 --> 00:59:04,500
practice and how to just work with it in a way that doesn't ask

50
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:10,559
us to no longer be resistant it's not asking us to be somebody that

51
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:16,200
we're not or to completely maybe I'll word it this way the practice

52
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:22,140
meets us where we are and if we're filled with resistance then that's how

53
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:29,760
it is but it's a natural that the mind I'll say this Rebels when we're trying to

54
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:36,180
train it when we're trying to you know try to keep on coming back to the present

55
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:43,500
moment or the sensations of breathing it's natural that sometimes when we're

56
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:50,460
meditating and we notice that um are lost in thought and there might be this

57
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:56,400
sense of oh yeah I'm supposed to get back to the sensations of breathing or whatever the anchor is

58
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:01,500
but then there's this other idea of like no I want to keep on thinking this this

59
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:10,020
is interesting or I'm going to solve this problem finally or this is entertaining or something like this

60
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:15,299
right our minds are used to kind of wanting to be destructed and entertained

61
01:00:15,299 --> 01:00:20,460
and it's going to there's going to be some resistance to training

62
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:25,859
I think this is true not only for humans but for all creatures

63
01:00:25,859 --> 01:00:30,140
when we want to train them to do something

64
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:36,480
but part of the function of this practice of

65
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:42,420
coming back to the present moment or if you're doing loving kindness practice to

66
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:48,299
keep with the loving kindness or if you have a chanting practice or we don't do a lot

67
01:00:48,299 --> 01:00:53,520
of chanting here but if or if that is part of your practice part of all of

68
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:59,700
these practices is to help us learn something about

69
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:06,599
ourselves because how else would we notice the

70
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:11,640
resistance things don't show up only in meditation

71
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:16,859
right they're a part of our experience so this resistance is showing up in our

72
01:01:16,859 --> 01:01:23,339
daily life but maybe we're just not noticing it because we're distracting ourselves or going on and doing the next

73
01:01:23,339 --> 01:01:30,900
thing or um providing a justification or rationale why we need to stop doing that

74
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:36,839
and start doing something else or something like this but part of the function of this practice of like okay

75
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:44,099
just keep on coming back whether it's the breath or whatever practice it is loving kindness or chanting whatever it

76
01:01:44,099 --> 01:01:51,599
might be is to notice resistance

77
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:58,338
and to notice how it feels to get familiar with it

78
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:06,619
and as best we can to stay with it to stay with the practice

79
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:12,119
and if we didn't have this and I'll talk a little bit more about that but also if

80
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:18,480
we weren't trying to like bring our breath back to the sensations of breathing

81
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:24,420
then have what's might we realize that we have these attitudes

82
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:30,180
and they mind these maybe These Quiet attitudes that aren't so obvious that

83
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:37,338
are our resistance is causing harm to ourselves or maybe causing harm to others

84
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:43,460
in a subtle way maybe we wouldn't even notice

85
01:02:44,819 --> 01:02:51,359
I'll say for me that um I mean if you look at me right I'm kind of like conservatively dressed and I

86
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:59,579
like appear as a conservative person and for the most part I am like if you think of my life story right it's pretty

87
01:02:59,579 --> 01:03:04,859
conservative for the most part but I didn't realize Alice and I started

88
01:03:04,859 --> 01:03:12,720
to realize oh I have this rebellious streak I don't like it when somebody tells me what to do and I just really

89
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,819
hadn't noticed that so much until I started to sit and I realized you know

90
01:03:17,819 --> 01:03:25,980
okay now bring the Mind back and there was always this no I don't want to kind of attitude that would flare up

91
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:32,040
and then I started to notice oh yeah that's um I can see how the profession that I

92
01:03:32,040 --> 01:03:37,680
chose was one where I could have a lot of autonomy where people don't tell me what to do you know I was trained as a

93
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:45,780
Scientists scientist is all about questioning Authority right you don't just go with the received wisdom but you

94
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:51,960
would discover things that are new so there might be something to learn

95
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:57,660
to discover about yourself just to recognize what role resistance has for

96
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:02,780
you not only in your practice but in your life

97
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:09,660
so what do we do when resistance arises

98
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:16,559
I'm gonna offer a few things that we can do and one is

99
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:23,339
maybe without you know let's say we have this resistance we don't want to go meditate

100
01:04:23,339 --> 01:04:32,160
okay so we're not going to meditate what if we just investigate right there

101
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:37,200
what is it why don't I want to go sit which is probably exactly what you don't

102
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:43,440
want to do but I want to offer this as a a reflection because if there's some

103
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:48,720
resistance that means that there's really just one

104
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:55,079
thing usually I would say and this one thing is that there's

105
01:04:55,079 --> 01:05:01,440
something in our experience that we aren't accepting or there's something that we don't want to look at are there

106
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:08,040
something that we're trying to push away or ignore or not to be with and whatever

107
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:13,799
way we can do that because if we were kind of like just letting

108
01:05:13,799 --> 01:05:20,579
accepting things or being with how things were then we would just go sit and that would just be the next thing

109
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:25,799
that was arising but there's a way in which not

110
01:05:25,799 --> 01:05:31,859
being with not accepting what's happening is fueling the resistance is showing up as

111
01:05:31,859 --> 01:05:39,000
resistance so instead of resisting this resistance or struggling

112
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:45,780
with the struggle or getting all tangled up there's a way that we can just ask the

113
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:51,599
question just ask the question it's the activity of asking

114
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:57,720
that is the step forward not finding the answer

115
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:04,040
but asking the question and so what question is this

116
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:10,559
what is happening right now that I'm not open to

117
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:16,440
what is what is happening right now that or what do I imagine will be happening

118
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:20,000
that I don't want to open to

119
01:06:22,619 --> 01:06:29,599
and maybe just feel into that without the idea that you have to find an answer

120
01:06:30,539 --> 01:06:36,660
and that right there is such a big part of practice just to have that activity of investigating

121
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:43,740
investigation is the second factor of Awakening it's a real it's an integral part of practice

122
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:49,680
so of course mindfulness meditation has a role but so does investigation

123
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:55,880
but we have to be careful when I'm using this word investigation this is not

124
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:00,900
an exploration of why

125
01:07:00,900 --> 01:07:07,140
why am I resisting it's because it reminds me of that thing that happened I was eight years old and then my brother

126
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:12,839
did this and I really should have done that you know that's not what we're doing here it's just having this

127
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:20,339
question of what would happen that I don't want to open to or what is happening right now

128
01:07:20,339 --> 01:07:24,200
that I don't want to open to

129
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:34,980
and maybe something bubbles up maybe something doesn't but asking the question is a way of

130
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:41,420
being here and now in the present moment and that's the practice

131
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:48,059
so in some kind of way you tricked yourself into practicing you're not on the cushion necessarily but you know so

132
01:07:48,059 --> 01:07:54,420
much of practice is not on the cushion so it can be a trap if we think that it's you know older or not that we have

133
01:07:54,420 --> 01:08:01,140
to be on the cushion or not so once we become

134
01:08:01,140 --> 01:08:07,220
maybe aware of like oh yeah there's this difficult emotion or I feel

135
01:08:07,220 --> 01:08:13,260
embarrassed or ashamed that I didn't do that thing I was supposed to do I was late with that I didn't send that email

136
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:19,738
to that person or I keep on rehashing this painful conversation I had or

137
01:08:19,739 --> 01:08:26,640
rehearsing in a difficult conversation I need to have but as soon as we become aware of that

138
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:32,460
then our relationship to it shifts and so much about this practice is about

139
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:38,040
just becoming aware of and shifting our relationship to what's happening

140
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:43,440
because all of us know we don't get to control what's happening even though we would like of course

141
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:51,540
but instead just to maybe get in shift our relationship to kind of uh

142
01:08:51,540 --> 01:08:57,778
not looking at it to like oh yeah that's what I don't want

143
01:08:57,779 --> 01:09:04,500
and maybe maybe it ends there but maybe also there can be some

144
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:09,359
kind hearted adjustments

145
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:15,020
some kind-hearted adjustments

146
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:21,199
so what's a kind-hearted adjustment

147
01:09:21,660 --> 01:09:27,380
maybe is to recognize the difficulty

148
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:34,920
and recognize the humanity of that experience

149
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:39,738
like learning to do something new

150
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:46,620
never easy never straightforward if this is a beginning of a meditation practice

151
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:54,179
takes time but isn't a linear experience that you know just get better better non-stop of course not

152
01:09:54,179 --> 01:10:01,140
in the same way if you ever learned to play a musical instrument learn to swim learn to play tennis learn to knit all

153
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:07,800
these things right it's oh it takes time and not every and there's mistakes that get made and put

154
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:13,980
it down and maybe pick it up again so

155
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:21,659
same as a whole other experiences but also recognizing that being present

156
01:10:21,659 --> 01:10:26,719
for uncomfortableness is not easy

157
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:33,120
and if we're anticipating that there's going to be some uncomfortableness or even right now in the moment when we

158
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:40,040
think like oh it's time for me to go meditate but I I feel lousy

159
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:45,540
it's hard it's hard to be with uncomfortableness

160
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:52,739
so maybe this one of these kind-hearted adjustments is to recognize the humanity

161
01:10:52,739 --> 01:10:58,800
all humans have this experience it's not easy to learn something new to change a habit

162
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:04,100
and it's difficult to be with uncomfortableness

163
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:10,320
and there's a way in which that might soften a little bit some of the inner

164
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:16,500
critic that might be that's associated when we're not have when we're not getting to the cushion when we have this

165
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:21,719
resistance I'll talk a little bit more about the

166
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:28,940
inner critic in a moment but if all of this were easy

167
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:36,900
then just think there wouldn't be so many self-help books there wouldn't be New Year's resolutions how many podcasts

168
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:43,080
are about you know getting better or doing something like this right there's this whole kind of like societal push

169
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:50,940
right okay we need to do something better so just recognize that this is part of

170
01:11:50,940 --> 01:11:57,780
the human experience and maybe that's a way in which we can

171
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:03,060
have a little bit of compassion for ourselves

172
01:12:03,060 --> 01:12:09,500
for others everybody else who's trying to make a change do something different

173
01:12:12,179 --> 01:12:17,460
when there's a sense of like oh I I really should be meditating or if you

174
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:23,820
are meditating there's this resistance like um I like I don't want to do that like if the mind is like keeps on

175
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:29,480
bouncing off of the object of the breath and chew is off and uh

176
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:34,520
fantasies or planning or whatever it is

177
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:41,520
another kind of inquiry to can be a real support for this is

178
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:46,980
just to notice the sense of self

179
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:51,980
that's present and what I mean by that is

180
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:58,980
usually when we have this sense of like I should be doing something that sense

181
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:04,580
of I should that's often accompanied with a strong sense of

182
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:11,640
me here and the whole rest of the world there it's a little bit of Me versus the

183
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:18,420
world is this kind of a subtle feeling but it's really has this sense of me versus

184
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:24,840
the world or if it's not quite like that it's the feeling of it's up to me I have

185
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:31,800
to make it happen if I don't do it it's not going to happen

186
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:39,179
and so there's I don't want to there's a way in which that's true and

187
01:13:39,179 --> 01:13:46,440
not true and if we get really stuck in the sense of it's all up to me and it's me against

188
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:52,679
the world then that's a place that's really tight and constricting and

189
01:13:52,679 --> 01:13:58,739
there's not a there's not a lot of freedom there there's not a lot of ease there instead

190
01:13:58,739 --> 01:14:04,320
it's a real sense of tightness and

191
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:09,840
sometimes it can just feel despair comes from this kind of place

192
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:16,679
and this isolation and shame and all these kinds of things are

193
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:23,060
associated when we start to get this really constricted I should do this

194
01:14:24,179 --> 01:14:30,960
so to kind of like make this point I'd like to contrast this when we have this feeling

195
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:36,900
like I should be meditating more to contrast it when you're doing

196
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:42,239
something that you really enjoy one of your favorite hobbies

197
01:14:42,239 --> 01:14:49,860
cooking at the kitchen sometimes I kind of like to cook this is kind of a

198
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:55,199
I don't know if other people have this as well maybe I'll use the example at first some

199
01:14:55,199 --> 01:15:01,260
of you know that at IRC The Retreat Center the teachers make the breakfast

200
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:06,840
and I do not have experience cooking for 50 people right so

201
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:12,840
so for me when it's my turn to make the breakfast you know there's very clear uh instructions

202
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:19,199
but you know there's just a lot of stuff to do and and while I'm doing it there's this kind

203
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:24,360
of like a focus like okay this but oh wait okay that has to be done so that this gets done on time but then take

204
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:30,780
care of this and you know the coffee you have to make sure the coffee is the butter has to be a little bit melted and the peanut butter don't forget the

205
01:15:30,780 --> 01:15:37,739
peanut butter you know like all this kind of stuff but um there's a way in which I kind of love it there's this uh

206
01:15:37,739 --> 01:15:45,300
you know just making things happen in a sense that it's also it's like an

207
01:15:45,300 --> 01:15:51,719
act of generosity it makes me happy to think that I'll be uh serving others you know that what I'm doing will benefit

208
01:15:51,719 --> 01:15:56,940
and support others and so there's a kind of like a delight

209
01:15:56,940 --> 01:16:03,600
in it so maybe there's something like this for you if it's not cooking maybe hiking

210
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:09,239
being out with nature and being amongst the trees the redwood trees

211
01:16:09,239 --> 01:16:15,840
for me I would say especially the redwood trees or knitting drawing whatever it is

212
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:22,140
notice or remember bring to mind how you feel when you're doing those things

213
01:16:22,140 --> 01:16:28,980
versus how you feel when you have the sense of I should meditate more

214
01:16:28,980 --> 01:16:35,100
when we're doing these pleasurable things these uh these Hobbies the reason why they're

215
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:42,480
pleasurable is because there isn't such a strong sense of I and we have access to both of this this

216
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:48,000
really constricted I must do it it's all up to me and then just this flow of

217
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,219
making things happen or getting lost and just the knitting

218
01:16:53,219 --> 01:16:58,560
whatever it might be and we can watch during the day how we

219
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:04,679
kind of like go from this really tight sense of I should to some um they call

220
01:17:04,679 --> 01:17:10,380
it a flow we might say this like Flow State dancing singing knitting whatever

221
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:18,179
it might be and throughout the day we were going back and forth so when you have this sense of like I

222
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:23,580
should go meditate is there a way that you can maybe like

223
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:29,040
shift over to like open up and realize oh yeah

224
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:35,880
yes I'm here but I'm also connected to all kinds of things it's not completely

225
01:17:35,880 --> 01:17:43,380
up to me I need to have heard about these teachings or even knew about this idea

226
01:17:43,380 --> 01:17:49,080
of meditation to begin with there is that former self that had the

227
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:56,520
idea it was gonna try to sit regularly or maybe there's a app that you listen

228
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:04,020
to or a dermatuck you listen to or a book so there's these other people that are supporting you and maybe there's the

229
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:09,600
you sit on a cushion or you have a favorite chair and maybe there's the manufacturer of that cushion or that

230
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:15,120
chair or that also helped make that cushion come to being and can start to

231
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:21,960
think about like all the different conditions that are coming together to

232
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:28,920
support sitting and this can be a little bit of a mental list and this is one way that can help this

233
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:34,679
shift from I should it's all up to me to something that's a little bit more

234
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:39,719
relaxed and open and kind of like going with the flow of the process and sitting

235
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:45,600
is just the next thing that happens so that's something else that can be a

236
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:52,380
support for practice when there's this resistance and if it happens that you still don't

237
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:59,360
get to that cushion but just going through that exercise enormously valuable

238
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:05,940
enormously valuable just to be remember that we're connected

239
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:12,659
everything in the sense maybe I'll say it this way we are not as isolated as we

240
01:19:12,659 --> 01:19:18,480
often feel it's not all up to us in the way that we are imagining

241
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:25,040
and instead we can feel into all the other conditions that need to come together

242
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:33,300
so simply notes that might be part of the resistance of not finding way to the

243
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:39,179
cushion is there might be the sense of well I'm not sure like what practice to

244
01:19:39,179 --> 01:19:46,140
do is this really the best practice and maybe if I just found the better teacher

245
01:19:46,140 --> 01:19:51,239
it would be easier what if they were just a better practice

246
01:19:51,239 --> 01:19:57,780
or you know seems like the those people are doing the Tibetan practice they look like they're having fun they have a more

247
01:19:57,780 --> 01:20:06,000
colorful things and or maybe I should do that right you know so there's these ideas that well maybe if I just had the

248
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:14,520
perfect teacher or the perfect practice then it'll be easier and I'll wait until they find that

249
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:19,920
I like this story that Jack cornfield tells

250
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:27,300
I think it's uh yeah it's very I think it's very helpful he talks about this very thing about this idea that we have

251
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:34,140
about our teachers and practices and he said uh some of you may know Jack

252
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:41,400
cornfield is that Elder in this whole tradition and he is one of the primary

253
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:47,820
people who brought it from Asia to America and so he was a monk in Thailand in the

254
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:52,940
1970s and he practiced with ajan cha who

255
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:58,020
recognized as one of the greatest Buddhist living Masters I don't know at

256
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:06,239
the time right I've never met ajanta of course but he's highly esteemed so Jack was a student of ajanta and Jack

257
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:12,600
tells this story how he was one of the very few westerners who were

258
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:17,880
in Thailand in the 70s in these monasteries he might Jack might have been the only one

259
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:24,120
and he and Jack tells a story about where kind of this you know American hubris

260
01:21:24,120 --> 01:21:33,560
says to arjon try this esteemed meditation master he says you don't seem very enlightened

261
01:21:34,980 --> 01:21:42,960
I guess because ajanta would I like I don't know what he would do but and so ajanta responded

262
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:49,260
it was good that he didn't seemed enlightened because then you'd still be looking for

263
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:57,179
enlightenment outside of yourself was pointing to you're looking for

264
01:21:57,179 --> 01:22:03,480
something outside but it's inside you're thinking that if you just look at

265
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:08,820
your teacher that somehow you'll get everything that you need and Jack tells

266
01:22:08,820 --> 01:22:13,860
how this was a really important teaching for him because he realized how he had been

267
01:22:13,860 --> 01:22:21,120
doing that right he had moved to Thailand formerly he was in the Peace Corps if I remember correctly and

268
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:26,460
that's how he found himself there but this idea that enlightenment's not out

269
01:22:26,460 --> 01:22:31,800
there it's not really for the perfect teacher or the perfect practice right so

270
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:39,840
much of it is us what we are doing and that it's helpful for us to see and

271
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:45,420
to recognize that we can take the beautiful teachings that make sense to

272
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:53,940
us that make our hearts sing that are really important for us and moving for us

273
01:22:53,940 --> 01:23:01,020
and we are welcome to leave everything else behind we're not saying this isn't All or

274
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:06,600
Nothing proposition we're saying take what is helpful and useful

275
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:12,140
and you can leave what everything else behind

276
01:23:12,239 --> 01:23:18,300
it's also helpful to see and Jack tells this that you know some teachers

277
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:23,699
are he's when you write in the history of Buddhism in the west there's

278
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:29,460
certainly been lots of scandals you know some inappropriate behavior

279
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:34,940
and jacket says you know there are definitely some teachers who get really

280
01:23:34,940 --> 01:23:41,280
compartmentalized so they might have some freedom in one area of their life and they're

281
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:48,480
maybe able to help people support them with their practice but maybe they're also harming people in

282
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:54,060
some other areas so he's saying because people have teachers have harmed it doesn't mean

283
01:23:54,060 --> 01:23:59,520
that they haven't also helped some people and this was helpful for me to hear

284
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:05,880
because Jack went on to say he said this happens in all areas of our of humanity

285
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:11,940
that Nobel prize-winning physicists might be completely disconnected from

286
01:24:11,940 --> 01:24:19,440
their bodies may you neglect their bodies so they have some real skill and one area of

287
01:24:19,440 --> 01:24:27,540
what it's like to be a human but not so much skill in another area in the same way some Olympic gold medal winning

288
01:24:27,540 --> 01:24:35,400
athletes might not have in touch with their horm or emotions and be able to express their

289
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:41,179
emotions so this idea that

290
01:24:41,179 --> 01:24:47,159
teachers that we are welcome to take what's helpful and to leave behind

291
01:24:47,159 --> 01:24:53,940
what's not helpful and maybe to put aside this idea that we have to wait until we find the perfect

292
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:58,980
practice for the perfect teacher until we really kind of like commit to

293
01:24:58,980 --> 01:25:05,600
practice commit to showing up for ourselves on the cushion

294
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:13,080
and maybe something else that can be a help for resistance if we have resistance

295
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:18,239
is notice if there are any beliefs

296
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:24,060
sometimes we have these hidden beliefs that have this idea that there shouldn't

297
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:30,360
be any discomfort in practice like so often we come to practice

298
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:35,699
because we want some ease we want to relax we might have this idea that we

299
01:25:35,699 --> 01:25:42,300
could Bliss out or something like this and so it feels like if there's any discomfort whether it's physical

300
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:48,420
discomfort sitting or emotional discomfort emotions are arising that are difficult

301
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:53,699
or just to see how our mind is sometimes is a little bit astounding and

302
01:25:53,699 --> 01:25:58,520
uncomfortable to see what our minds do

303
01:25:58,860 --> 01:26:04,620
so just notice if we think that we should only be experiencing peace and

304
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:11,520
ease all the time it wouldn't be surprising if we had that idea because certainly

305
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:19,620
Society leads us to think that anything that is uncomfortable is a mistake

306
01:26:19,620 --> 01:26:26,400
and something has gone horribly wrong and we have to blame somebody this is kind of like the message that we get but

307
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:32,219
have you noticed pain is part of human life

308
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:39,239
pleasure is part of human life too inescapable and so there's this way in

309
01:26:39,239 --> 01:26:46,500
which this kind of message it should all just be happiness and rainbows and unicorns kind of idea that I mean I'm

310
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:55,860
saying that it's kind of silly and exaggerated but there might be these underlying beliefs that it we can't

311
01:26:55,860 --> 01:27:01,380
do anything except really Pleasant experiences on meditation and there's no

312
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:06,659
value in being with some of the difficulties when I say that out loud I think all of

313
01:27:06,659 --> 01:27:14,340
us recognize that there are difficulties but there might be these like I keep on using this word hidden beliefs

314
01:27:14,340 --> 01:27:21,120
so notice maybe I'll say one more thing about this

315
01:27:21,120 --> 01:27:27,719
that because the if having this idea that there

316
01:27:27,719 --> 01:27:35,280
shouldn't be any discomfort puts us in contention with reality

317
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:40,739
because there is discomfort being a human being

318
01:27:40,739 --> 01:27:48,120
maybe there's a little bit of discomfort in the way you're sitting right now but part of the resistance that we might

319
01:27:48,120 --> 01:27:53,639
have to get into the cushion is because we're anticipating it's going to be uncomfortable

320
01:27:53,639 --> 01:28:00,179
and it may be but is there a way that we can say well

321
01:28:00,179 --> 01:28:08,100
okay that's just the way it's going to be today maybe increase our capacity to tolerate

322
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:10,940
some discomfort

323
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:19,800
and then maybe the last thing that I'll say I have a

324
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:25,980
I'm trying to decide here which what what's the last thing that I'll say here

325
01:28:25,980 --> 01:28:32,520
's what I'll say if you have resistance of going to the cushion or meditating

326
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:38,280
or even if you are meditating in your in a meditation posture but your mind is

327
01:28:38,280 --> 01:28:43,579
doing anything except meditating

328
01:28:43,739 --> 01:28:47,840
do another type of meditation practice

329
01:28:49,020 --> 01:28:55,820
do walking meditation walking meditation be fantastic

330
01:28:56,040 --> 01:29:01,620
you can even do this in the whole way in your house I do this sometimes I go from the kitchen to the bedroom to the

331
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:08,840
kitchen to the bedroom I don't know it's you know it's kind of nice actually

332
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:18,500
do some love and kindness practice while driving

333
01:29:18,659 --> 01:29:24,360
through some loving kindness practice while you go for a hike for all the beings that you're saying

334
01:29:24,360 --> 01:29:29,400
there because remember the purpose of meditation is to

335
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:35,040
transform our minds help us see clearly in these other practices support that

336
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:40,380
too but what can happen is if we are resisting going to the cushion and then

337
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:47,460
we don't go to the cushion then this whole story gets created like oh I haven't done it for four days and what's

338
01:29:47,460 --> 01:29:54,780
the use I shouldn't do it again or something like this but that's not helpful but just do what you

339
01:29:54,780 --> 01:30:00,000
can okay I'm gonna be mindful while I'm washing the dishes after dinner

340
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:07,920
okay I'm gonna be mindful while I'm brushing my teeth whatever it might be so just to do

341
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:13,739
another practice and maybe you do that other practice for a while

342
01:30:13,739 --> 01:30:19,380
days weeks whatever it is and but it might be a bridge to get back

343
01:30:19,380 --> 01:30:26,520
to the cushion because if we have this All or Nothing idea then it just starts to get harder

344
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:32,760
and harder to get back to the cushion but instead if we have this idea that well there's lots of different ways of

345
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:39,199
practicing and I'll say a little bit about

346
01:30:39,199 --> 01:30:44,940
loving-kindness practice because I did a whole series some of you

347
01:30:44,940 --> 01:30:52,440
may know that it I was teaching what we call happy hour twice a week for years I did this and I

348
01:30:52,440 --> 01:30:59,460
just ended this week actually but I did um for a couple months this I'm working

349
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:06,420
with the inner critic on how to do this and it turned out to be really impactful and helpful for a

350
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:11,520
lot of people or so they tell me right so you know I

351
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:18,300
only hear the nice things there might be things out there there are people like that's terrible I wish Diana would stop but you know they don't tell me that so

352
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:24,719
I don't want to make it seem like everybody loved it but

353
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:30,719
there's a way in which we can do some

354
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:36,540
practice specific to work with the inner critic and maybe I'll talk some more about this in a

355
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:41,900
later talk but I'll just introduce the idea

356
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:48,120
is first it's kind of like just soften the heart in mind

357
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:55,860
and to do some loving kindness practice where it's the absolute easiest this is

358
01:31:55,860 --> 01:32:00,960
critical easy easy easy for some people this is imaginary

359
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:06,060
kittens puppies and babies because right we don't have there's you

360
01:32:06,060 --> 01:32:11,400
know it's imaginary right so it's easy to these cute things whatever it might

361
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:17,880
be for all of you meditation mustard some very esteemed

362
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:24,000
meditation Masters Jean Brahm he describes uses a kitten imaginary kitten

363
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:29,179
for this so to spend some time with this

364
01:32:29,179 --> 01:32:35,400
softening the heart this could be 10 15 minutes just imagining The Lovable being

365
01:32:35,400 --> 01:32:41,940
and doing some loving kindness practice with them and then after you've done that sometime and you

366
01:32:41,940 --> 01:32:48,420
feel like there's a a little bit of softening or opening

367
01:32:48,420 --> 01:32:54,239
then to bring to mind a minor difficulty that's happening in your life

368
01:32:54,239 --> 01:33:01,500
a minor difficulty on a scale of one to ten two or a three

369
01:33:01,500 --> 01:33:08,760
just some little minor irritation because we don't want to yeah I'll just

370
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:15,000
say we're going to start where it's easy and if we start where it's hard then it's just too hard and we doesn't we

371
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:20,340
don't do it start where it's easy bring to uh

372
01:33:20,340 --> 01:33:25,739
a minor difficulty and that's often where the inner critic

373
01:33:25,739 --> 01:33:32,219
starts to arise this what I talked about this idea that we feel like we should never have any pain or difficulties when

374
01:33:32,219 --> 01:33:39,780
things are a little bit difficult there's often this little voice like um you should have done this or

375
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:45,420
yeah you're not so good at this and when are you going to get it together or you

376
01:33:45,420 --> 01:33:52,139
know something like this so in the same way that we would do loving kindness practice where we would

377
01:33:52,139 --> 01:33:59,120
repeat phrases here's if some phrases we can use

378
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:07,760
may this difficulty be held with kindness and ease

379
01:34:08,699 --> 01:34:14,280
Shifting the relationship again may this difficulty be held with

380
01:34:14,280 --> 01:34:22,940
kindness and ease I'm doing the best I can right now

381
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:30,000
I'm doing the best I can right now just to like say this like to oneself we

382
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:37,440
are at that moment we're doing what we can or I'm in the process of learning new ways

383
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:42,500
and this takes time

384
01:34:43,440 --> 01:34:49,940
I'm in the process of learning new ways and this takes time

385
01:34:50,699 --> 01:34:57,120
can you feel like there's a little bit more space there and the kind of like the inner critic gets quiet and you can

386
01:34:57,120 --> 01:35:03,540
feel like there was a shift in relationship and sometimes it might be helpful to kind of like speak directly to this

387
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:09,540
inner critic this voice inside of ourselves it's putting us down

388
01:35:09,540 --> 01:35:18,500
speak directly to it and say I know you're trying to help but that's not helpful

389
01:35:18,659 --> 01:35:24,500
I know you're trying to help but that's not helpful

390
01:35:26,340 --> 01:35:32,520
so these are some different ways we can work with resistance to get into the cushion we can just turn it into

391
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:39,000
practice can investigate well like what it is there something I'm trying to avoid or

392
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:44,520
that I don't want to see right now form of practice

393
01:35:44,520 --> 01:35:50,159
we can notice if there are any beliefs that we have that there shouldn't be any

394
01:35:50,159 --> 01:35:56,520
discomfort that's part of practice to help us understand ourselves better

395
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:02,639
we can make some kind-hearted adjustments maybe doing a little bit of this practice for the inner critic maybe

396
01:36:02,639 --> 01:36:09,120
that's your practice it's no you're not going to do mindfulness then you're just going to do some of these kind-hearted

397
01:36:09,120 --> 01:36:16,139
adjustments work with the this inner critic practice or maybe have some compassion recognizing the humanity

398
01:36:16,139 --> 01:36:25,800
that it's not so easy to do new habits or to be with difficulties

399
01:36:25,800 --> 01:36:31,199
and then also to notice this sense of I we have this sense of like it's up to me

400
01:36:31,199 --> 01:36:36,540
I need to do it it's really tight is there a way that we can soften and

401
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:43,139
move to where it's a little more looser and softer and part of the way to do that is to recognize that so many

402
01:36:43,139 --> 01:36:49,638
conditions have to come together and are coming together

403
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:57,600
I offer this as a way of what there's resistance to practice of how to work

404
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:05,120
with it or just to turn the resistance itself into practice without actually having to get to the cushion

405
01:37:05,699 --> 01:37:11,100
and I didn't leave a lot of time for questions but maybe there's time for one

406
01:37:11,100 --> 01:37:16,638
or so I'm sorry about this but I wanted

407
01:37:23,639 --> 01:37:29,100
to hi thank you

408
01:37:29,100 --> 01:37:34,739
um I'm trying to remember exactly what my question was I know I remember the first

409
01:37:34,739 --> 01:37:41,940
half which is um when you spoke about the voice of I should it was kind of you described that

410
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:48,420
it's kind of like this me versus everything could I hear you re-articulate that a bit it really

411
01:37:48,420 --> 01:37:53,639
resonated with me but I'd like to just sort of hear it again yeah it shows up

412
01:37:53,639 --> 01:37:59,520
often as me against the world this idea or kind of like being isolated

413
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:06,659
there's also the it creates the conditions for so many things get glumped on top of that

414
01:38:06,659 --> 01:38:13,560
I don't know if this is what you're talking about I was talking it's um yes so what what that's where what are

415
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:20,940
my notes do I have oh it's not only me against the world but also everything is up to me like I have

416
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:28,560
to make it happen [Music] um and and so and so then I understand this

417
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:35,580
idea of being able to practice with this voice identifying where there's resistance and perhaps

418
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:41,340
our relationship to this voice being a form of practice um

419
01:38:41,340 --> 01:38:47,840
how do we how do we evaluate the part of the voice that's that's that's

420
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:54,239
holds some truth or some value or some realness like I should do my taxes when

421
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:59,820
they're due you know but maybe there's resistance to that but I actually should do my taxes

422
01:38:59,820 --> 01:39:05,880
you know how do we how do we balance um this like

423
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:12,300
opening to it but also listening to what it has to say yeah I guess yeah so this

424
01:39:12,300 --> 01:39:19,739
is the part of the art of practice is can we do our taxes with ease right so

425
01:39:19,739 --> 01:39:26,639
and this is part of the practice is to really find okay can we find ease when things are uncomfortable

426
01:39:26,639 --> 01:39:33,900
because if we're always finding wanting them to be useful right we're going to have some resistance and not want to do them maybe we don't want to do our taxes

427
01:39:33,900 --> 01:39:41,880
but is there a way that we can open up to them so instead of there's I have to

428
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:47,880
do the taxes it was just it's kind of a subtle thing in language but to kind of say

429
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:54,840
um taxes are being done sure okay I like that thank you

430
01:39:54,840 --> 01:40:00,600
thank you okay so we're at the top of the hour so

431
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:06,719
thank you all for your attention and if you'd like you're welcome to come up and talk to me otherwise I wish you a

432
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:13,080
wonderful evening and I'm leaving this weekend for a month-long Retreat so I won't be here

433
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:18,900
for the next few weeks I'll be happily I don't know if I'll be happy right we never know what happens on
