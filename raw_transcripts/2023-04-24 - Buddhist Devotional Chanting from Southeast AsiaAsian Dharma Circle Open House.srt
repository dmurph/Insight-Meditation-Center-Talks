I want to say a few words about today's open house open house event

31
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:41,299
um so we don't have a long history but we did start this last year

32
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:48,440
where Our intention was to allow the Asian

33
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:56,460
Sangha in IMC to meet with the broader IMC community in some way that may be

34
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:05,220
meaningful and supportive of the overall community and the last year I waited this and now

35
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:11,340
we also had our guest guest teacher and speaker and

36
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:18,240
joining us at Chen Xing Han who shared a bit about her book

37
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,000
and um being The Refuge and we had a good

38
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:31,919
time discussing the book and its relevance in our broader community

39
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,860
and she's here today those who are online and you will see her hopefully in

40
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:43,740
the course of this event and then today we're so fortunate to be able to have

41
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:50,220
Trent Walker here with us um Who Will Be Our Guest teacher and

42
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:56,240
guest speaker who I share a deep

43
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,760
practice and history in the Asian Dharma

46
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,320
and so we'll be doing some chanting together and learning about the book

47
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:29,360

50
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,720
and some question and answer time

51
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:54,299

the parking parking lot of IMC well

57
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:32,039
we'll have time for some tea and some snacks and and so just kind of informal

58
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:38,640
connecting and so that will be happening out in the

59
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,799
parking lot and so with that I'm gonna pass it on to lilu

60
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,419
thank you Ying it's just such a pleasure to be here in person

61
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:02,640
um there's kind of an energy in coming together that I'm really

62
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,160
um appreciating right now and for those joining online I'm just loving that this

63
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:14,580
is happening here but also happening in Prada broader scale across across the

64
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:22,919
world wide web um I'll say a little bit now about our group The IMC Asian Dharma Circle

65
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:28,440
um I think it's been it's been two years maybe a little bit more than three

66
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:37,020
three and a half years that we've been going for and um the the uh the group kind of

67
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:43,559
just sort of happened to come together in a way I think I had come to a point

68
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:50,159
in my own Dharma practice where I almost accidentally started sitting with people of color sanghas

69
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:56,100
and noticing how in those environments something

70
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:02,220
dropped away that I wasn't I didn't know was there something relaxed that I hadn't been

71
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:08,220
aware of that was a holding and there was a wish that the benefits

72
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:13,559
that I was receiving could could continue for others and for myself and

73
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:19,679
so I wanted to see if MC could have something like this could offer

74
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:26,460
something like this for practitioners and fortunately Ying was also happy to

75
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:32,580
join and Lead it and so we sort of started this and we've been going since

76
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:40,140
the pandemic and it's just been such um such a gift actually for my own

77
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:45,480
practice and for all those who I've met who seem to have benefited a lot from

78
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:53,340
this group as well um we meet twice a month on the second and fourth Sundays at this time about

79
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:59,280
one to three one to two thirty actually and um it's a usually pretty intimate

80
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,380
but kind of casual group we have some regular people we have some people who come

81
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:10,860
um and they're new and we offer a guided meditation and a short Dharma talk and I

82
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:17,820
think what's really rich is because it's a smaller group there is a lot of time to ask questions and interact and kind

83
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,860
of share of each other and connect in a way that's really rich that I think has

84
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:29,340
been very helpful for our own practices so that's a little bit about Asian

85
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:37,679
Dharma Circle at IMC and we have this tradition this is our second time of Hosting this open house once a year and

86
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:44,159
um it's a way to acknowledge that the boundaries of what is constituted as

87
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:51,539
Asian if they're not you know firm and hard and that many of us have family members friends

88
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:57,240
um the practice of what is constituted as Asian Buddhism is also kind of porous

89
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:03,900
um and to just explore and appreciate this together so today we have Trent and I'm so happy

90
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:09,240
to have him coming to share a little bit more about chanting practice in our

91
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:15,440
group there has been a lot of interest in kind of chanting as a practice and

92
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:21,240
I don't know if it's coming out of kind of growing up hearing chanting or just

93
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:28,200
being in cultures that are more amenable to this practice but wanting to share it and bring it to the whole community

94
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:37,320
and I'll say a little bit to formally introduce Trent so Trent researches and teaches about

95
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:43,440
Southeast Asian Buddhism literature and music he is currently a postdoc fellow at the

96
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,159
host Center for Buddhist studies and lecture in religious studies at Stanford University

97
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:55,200
and Trent received a ba in religious studies from Stanford and a PhD in

98
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,140
Buddhist studies from UC Berkeley where his dissertation focused on

99
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:06,600
Cambodian chanting manuscripts and you can visit his website where

100
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:12,419
there's lovely audio recordings of him chanting many of the pieces from his

101
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:18,419
book it's trentwalker.org and I just feel like

102
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:23,880
it's such a treat to be able to be here in person and hear you share about this

103
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:30,840
work and just be able to be part of this this like auditory experience so thank

104
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:34,340
you so much for joining us today

105
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:13,140
thank you so much Ying thank you so much Lulu for inviting me here it's such a

106
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:18,960
pleasure to be here on this special day for the Asian Karma circle on this

107
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:27,419
sounds like second annual open house and to see both new and and familiar faces

108
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:34,220
so um thank you for for making this this possible

109
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:43,140
I just wanted to say a few things about chanting about the book that some of the

110
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:50,460
translations I've put together in this packet are coming from and how I came to

111
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:57,539
this particular mode of practice and and study but mostly what I'd like to do in the

112
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:03,600
time we have together is make time for us to chant and that's what the the

113
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,760
packet here is for it's just to allow us to

114
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:14,400
sample and experience a couple of different types of chanting together and

115
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:21,539
many of you I'm sure have experienced a whole wide range of of chanting Styles whether in your own practice or things

116
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:27,679
that you grew up hearing or things that you've encountered in Buddhist practice or other kinds of practices in your life

117
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:34,200
and for that I'm also grateful that ying and Lilo will facilitate some reflection

118
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:40,799
and discussion both about sort of what we've experienced today and then also

119
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:46,460
tying that into your lives and your practice more broadly

120
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:55,220
and thank you to everyone joining online as well it's a real pleasure to be here

121
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:03,299
I'd like to begin just by passing around a few things if that's okay I don't have

122
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:10,760
a PowerPoint but I just want to give you a few images if I may and maybe we could pass them in different directions

123
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:17,419
so this one here that I'll pass around this is one of my main teachers of Chan

124
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:22,500
I just wanted you to be able to see a picture of her when I when I speak of

125
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,600
her and this next one is of my other main

126
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,640
teacher I just just so you can see a picture of him

127
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:41,279
and I'll just pass this around as well because you can see in this book

128
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:46,440
um some Cambodian Banner Banner paintings of scenes from the Buddhist

129
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:53,580
life that are connected to some of the chants so just so you have a sense of what might be happening visually in

130
00:28:53,580 --> 00:29:00,740
context with some of the chats so I'll just just pass those around foreign

131
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:11,640
maybe I'll keep passing things around is that okay can I pass these around too these are just two examples of chanting

132
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:17,279
books in the Cambodian language or Khmer or Kumai and I just

133
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:23,039
especially so you could see the cover the covers show a scene of some of the

134
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:29,898
ways this chanting one of the particular styles of chanting that I'll talk about more is used

135
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:39,600
my interest in Buddhism and Buddhist practice and music really grew up

136
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,899
together when I was in high school I started to practice at a couple of different

137
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:52,860
Buddhist centers in San Francisco at Gold Mountain Monastery in Chinatown and also at the San Francisco Sun Center

138
00:29:52,860 --> 00:30:00,539
and in both of those contexts I was drawn to silent meditation but also to Ritual

139
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:06,240
and chanting practices in particular I had also grown up

140
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:13,320
here on the peninsula studying music trumpet and voice these kinds of things so I was really curious about this

141
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:18,480
interaction this intersection between the Dharma between the teachings of the

142
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:25,200
Buddha between the practices that we engage in and sound what what might be

143
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,200
happening at this this intersection and that Drew me after finishing high

144
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,140
school to go before going to college to work for a year in Cambodia with an

145
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:44,600
organization called Cambodian Living Arts and doing research for them on this intersection between Buddhism and music

146
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:50,580
and through through that organization I became connected to the two teachers

147
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:57,679
whose images I've I've passed around so you can see

148
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:05,460
who became my root teachers in the Cambodian harma song or thought tradition which is this particularly

149
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:11,299
melodic style of chant that we'll get to explore together

150
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:18,120
and that that experience and then also studying chant in a monastic setting I

151
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,520
spent about half a year ordained temporarily as an office in Cambodia

152
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:29,700
um made me really curious both in my own practice and in my academic

153
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:35,039
life to continue thinking about and trying to understand what's what's

154
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:40,320
happening in this relationship between a particular Buddhist teachings and ideas

155
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:47,480
and the way they're lifted into music or Sound or a chant

156
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:02,640
if it's okay I thought I might mix up the portion in which I'll I'll say a

157
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,840
little bit more about the Cambodian harmasan tradition but I would like for us to chant together a little bit first

158
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:15,539
then we can get a feel of some chanting in our bodies

159
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:22,760
and I'd like to begin with a chant that actually isn't in your packet but just something very very very very simple

160
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:29,820
and this is coming out of the Cambodian tradition in which certain forms of meditation

161
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:35,580
practice involve concentrating on syllables these may be repeated silently

162
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:42,000
sometimes repeated aloud and that's somewhere in between might think of chanting as a practice that takes place

163
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,659
out loud and meditation is a practice that takes place silently in the Cambodian Buddhist context and this is

164
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:55,279
similar in Thailand Laos other places as well this word this poly word bhavana

165
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:01,260
that we might think of as meaning mental cultivation or meditation

166
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:08,279
in many cases really refers to chant I often chant done silently in this way

167
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:12,799
here I would like to take these three syllables

168
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:20,340
these are syllables that in the Cambodian tradition can stand in for the Buddha the Dharma and the Sangha they're

169
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:26,760
syllables that can stand in for the virtues of our mothers our fathers our

170
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:32,820
teachers and other kinds of symbolic meanings within the esoteric theravada

171
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:38,640
context but for now I just like for us to explore them as as sounds

172
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,059
so the the syllables again are MO

173
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,880
ah and uh and so

174
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:55,500
let's chant just uh we'll begin with MO

175
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:03,600
and I invite you I will start on a particular note don't feel you have to do that note you

176
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:10,560
can pick any uh one sound that feels comfortable to for

177
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,720
you and your vocal register and then we'll just do that for one

178
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:22,020
breath then we'll move on to ah and then we'll move on to ooh so I'll

179
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:27,658
start each of those and then you can join in just hold it for one breath and we'll

180
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:32,820
pause take another breath in go on to the next syllable and ending with u make

181
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,139
sense okay

182
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:42,898
more

183
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,440
foreign

184
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:10,799
[Music]

185
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:21,110
[Laughter]

186
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:24,510
[Music]

187
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:34,260
now let's do the same thing but for each syllable whenever you come to the end of your

188
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:42,960
breath just take a breath again and rejoin everyone else so we'll continue on more until I ring

189
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:51,320
the bell then we'll pause to all thermopods and then do ooh make sense

190
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:10,920
[Music] more

191
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:27,060
[Music] more

192
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,720
more

193
00:36:44,330 --> 00:36:52,929
[Music]

194
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:59,250
[Music]

195
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:19,140
[Music] oh

196
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,320
oh

197
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:32,960
[Music]

198
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,510
[Music]

199
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:03,409
[Music]

200
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,720
oh

201
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:32,599
[Music] oh foreign

202
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,150
[Music]

203
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:54,500
[Laughter]

204
00:38:55,850 --> 00:39:18,860
[Music]

205
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:45,380
now I'd like for us to continue that same

206
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:50,760
approach to sound but extend it to this first chant here

207
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,859
on the top of page one as

208
00:39:55,859 --> 00:40:01,079
you might be aware the Pali language is pronounced in many

209
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:07,920
different ways depending on the particular linguistic or cultural context in which

210
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,500
it's used so there is a so-called indic or

211
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:19,380
International pronunciation of poly it's similar to not exactly the same as the

212
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:26,000
Sri Lankan pronunciation and for this first chant it would be something like

213
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:35,160
and then there are also depending on the phonetics of local

214
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:42,180
languages all kinds of other ways Bali might be pronounced so for instance in the Cambodian context that same phrase

215
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:46,078
is pronounced yeah

216
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:57,000
so let's try this chant one thing that I wanted to highlight

217
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,820
here is in Gray those are the syllables that are longer

218
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,280
and the ones that aren't in Gray those are the syllables that are shorter

219
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:15,420
um in many styles of chanting that distinction between short and long

220
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:21,960
syllables when chanting in Pali determines the rhythm of the chant this isn't true in all styles but in many

221
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:27,900
styles particularly in Cambodia Thailand Laos to less extent in Sri Lanka and

222
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:35,820
Burma but particularly in those three contexts that distinction between short and long syllables determines the Rhythm

223
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:43,020
and the long syllables are exactly twice the length of time as the short ones

224
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:47,480
so it leads to this rhythm of

225
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:55,320
gluten so slow down yeah

226
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:12,599
so let's try that we'll try it in this International pronunciation of first

227
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:18,300
and then like before just breathe when you feel

228
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:25,920
comfortable and you don't have to breathe at the end of the phrase so in some styles of chant

229
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:32,180
one might recite yeah [Music]

230
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:40,020
but here let's just continue without a breath there but take a breath

231
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:47,640
whenever you would like to because we're chanting in a group and then join back in wherever the group is so for instance

232
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:52,680
if I'm if I was chanting by myself in this way I might go

233
00:42:52,680 --> 00:43:00,320
foreign [Music]

234
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:08,389
[Music]

235
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:16,619
[Music] make sense

236
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:23,119
so let's try that all together this simple phrase just means

237
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,040
um foreign

238
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:53,909
[Music]

239
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:17,979
[Music]

240
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:29,150
[Music]

241
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:34,200
alone

242
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:52,920
let's continue with that same style but we'll add the my pronunciation just so

243
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:59,599
you can feel what it's like to chant in a different pronunciation of poly so instead of

244
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:09,599
here yet so let's just repeat each syllable first

245
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:16,200
nah mole yeah

246
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,900
more but here yeah

247
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:31,619
great so we'll do the same thing and feel free to experiment with what

248
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:38,220
pitch you're chanting on it doesn't in the in Cambodian styles of

249
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:44,579
chanting that sounds monotone sounds like each individual chanter is usually on one pitch

250
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:51,300
generally speaking in a group people take on many different pitches whatever is comfortable for them and it creates

251
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:57,800
this interesting layered kind of sound so feel free to experiment

252
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,740
foreign

253
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:16,719
[Music]

254
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:38,369
[Music]

255
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,650
[Music]

256
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:59,459
[Music]

257
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:14,949
no more [Music]

258
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,318
can I get a time check on how much

259
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:37,140
okay wonderful thanks so much so let's do maybe just one more uh chant

260
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:43,380
in this simple Style of uh just chanting on one pitch and

261
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:49,859
then I'll transition and we'll explore some of these this more melodic style of Cambodian chant

262
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:53,359
of course yeah

263
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:04,200
just a curiosity really in the top line where it has the Khmer script poly which

264
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:09,359
I can't read nonetheless it says that there are only two long syllables

265
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:14,760
compared to the three below is can you say about that sure sure so if you look

266
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:21,780
at that second long syllable you'll see that the second part of it

267
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:31,440
looks a little complicated so there are actually two syllables in there in other words the the ha is

268
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:40,079
written kind of below the so it's like namo yeah

269
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:46,800
and many scripts that are used to write Pali have similar kinds of principles

270
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:52,980
so that's why it happens to look like that sure

271
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:58,880
so let's look at this second chant here that many of you might be familiar with

272
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:07,440
this one that in the international style of pronunciation would be this

273
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:26,540
or in this Kamai style pronunciation

274
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:38,160
maybe we'll do it just in this International style but just want you to just invite you to be aware of these

275
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:44,520
other kinds of pronunciations and often when this is chanted the

276
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:52,339
individual words might be separated with a pause on my chance of thing like

277
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:09,000
that would be one style but let's try this other style where there's no break between words

278
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,940
and the only thing determining the rhythm is this difference between the long and short syllables here the long

279
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:20,119
ones again are highlighted in Gray so we get this pattern of

280
00:50:22,590 --> 00:50:26,900
[Music] um

281
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:37,680
[Music] so let's just do that once I

282
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:43,319
altogether three times again without a pause at the end so all

283
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:46,220
together three times

284
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:56,480
[Music]

285
00:51:13,450 --> 00:51:17,780
[Music] thank you

286
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:24,300
so we can if you'd like and we if we have time we can explore more about

287
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:31,020
different uh other chants in this often than this monotone style if you turn to

288
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:36,420
the second page now I just wanted to offer some other uh

289
00:51:36,420 --> 00:51:42,900
approaches to chant so this distinction between long and short syllables and The rhythms behind

290
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:49,140
that are part one part of the aesthetic joy and beauty of chanting in Pali so

291
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:54,480
for instance this one at the top which is often used to recite prior to

292
00:51:54,480 --> 00:52:01,680
reciting Buddhist texts to invite local spirits on Earth and in the Heavens to

293
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:10,380
come listen to a recitation of Buddhist chanting the uh the the pattern of these

294
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:15,540
syllables repeats each line and that's how poetry in Bali works there's these

295
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:22,500
patterns of short and long syllables that repeat each line so this is a slightly more complicated pattern but

296
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:30,000
when in recitation we can hear the pattern very clearly of sage

297
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:40,339
um foreign

298
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:50,280
having this same kind of rhythmic pattern but sometimes in a Cambodian context it

299
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,440
might be recited in that way like

300
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:05,119
um

301
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:20,670
[Applause]

302
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:28,200
or sometimes a Melody would be applied to it it's these Melodies that I was

303
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:33,720
really drawn to in encountering this Cambodian Dharma song tradition so I'll

304
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:39,960
just give you one example of a melody of this and then we'll turn to some of the other texts in this tradition via

305
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:45,359
English translation so one Melody that could be used here I'll just give you an excerpt of it

306
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:51,780
would be some games

307
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:08,920
[Laughter]

308
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:18,169
[Applause]

309
00:54:22,339 --> 00:54:28,740
oh man anything

310
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:40,500
and when I first encountered this tradition through I was really curious about

311
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:48,359
what's this relationship between the sound of the chance and the texts what

312
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:54,180
what's happening in this relationship and kauran in particular really emphasized

313
00:54:54,180 --> 00:55:00,660
that some texts and The Melodies that go with them are designed to bring about

314
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:06,119
this experience of Samuel some Vega being this Bollywood that means this

315
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:11,819
experience of shaking or being stirred particularly being stirred by the

316
00:55:11,819 --> 00:55:18,660
encounter with impermanence so when Buddhists texts narrate the life of the Buddha and describe him leaving the

317
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:24,240
palace and encountering the four sites of an old person a sick person a dead

318
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:31,920
person and a renunciate this is the feeling or the experience that's described and some Vega in this

319
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:39,359
Cambodian tradition as in elsewhere in taravada Buddhist context is sometimes paired with this experience of basada

320
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:49,020
Assad that literally means this sinking down or this just as a glass of Muddy Water if it's

321
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:57,079
allowed to sit the mud will sink to the bottom and the top part becomes clear and bright so it has this sense of clear

322
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:03,540
bright faith and Clarity in the mind that can be paired with some Vegas so

323
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:10,200
some other kinds of chants in their Melodies and in their texts might be crafted to bring about this kind of

324
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:16,440
experience so if you turn to page four on your

325
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:21,599
handout this this this is a very simple melodic

326
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:27,020
style chant if it was that here would be trans

327
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:32,940
chanted in Cambodian and Kumai in the language of Cambodia

328
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:36,558
um would sound something like this

329
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:47,780
[Music]

330
00:56:54,210 --> 00:57:00,480
[Music] and because our time is short

331
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:06,359
let's just try chanting we'll just take one stanza of this and and learn it in

332
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:11,700
English together and let's learn the fourth one the one that says here no joy

333
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:18,480
equals that of peace nothing else can end suffering here in this world and Beyond peace is the cause

334
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:25,980
of true Joy and I've made this little space in between the lines here so that each line

335
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:33,359
is divided into a group of four syllables then a group of three syllables and in Cambodian chanting in

336
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:40,680
not in poly but in Kumai often are almost invariably The Melodies

337
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:46,500
are structured based on a certain number of syllables for one part of the melody

338
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:52,680
a certain number of syllables for another part of Melody you know very analogous to when we're singing a song

339
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:59,819
that has multiple verses usually there's approximately the same number of syllables in each verse so that we can

340
00:57:59,819 --> 00:58:07,200
put the same words to that same Melody so the same practice is happening here

341
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:14,520
so let's just try this one this one is one that's associated with this experience or this feeling tone of

342
00:58:14,520 --> 00:58:20,839
basada of of clarity or bright faith

343
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:26,760
so I'll I'll recite a short bit and if you could repeat after me that would be

344
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:31,160
then we can experience this one together

345
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:39,480
[Music] oh

346
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:47,099
no joy equals

347
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:54,920
[Music] that of peace

348
00:58:55,880 --> 00:59:01,579
that of peace [Music]

349
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:06,780
nothing else can

350
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:14,599
nothing else can and

351
00:59:14,599 --> 00:59:18,599
suffering suffering

352
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:27,078
here in this world

353
00:59:27,319 --> 00:59:33,500
hear me in this world [Music]

354
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:39,740
and behind [Music]

355
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:45,280
and be yond

356
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:51,859
[Music] peace is the call

357
00:59:51,859 --> 00:59:59,119
s peace is the calm

358
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:05,880
s of true Joy

359
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:13,200
[Music] true Joy [Music]

360
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:19,799
let's try that one more time but we'll just do it all together I will chant along with you don't worry if you can't

361
01:00:19,799 --> 01:00:24,900
remember what the melody was just listen to those around you and we'll we'll make

362
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:34,520
our way through it no joy equals

363
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:41,579
[Music] that of peace

364
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:48,599
nothing else can

365
01:00:48,859 --> 01:00:55,339
and suffering [Music]

366
01:00:55,339 --> 01:01:01,940
here in this world foreign

367
01:01:07,770 --> 01:01:11,270
[Music]

368
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:31,460
[Music] let's just do one last one here

369
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:40,700
let's just do the one in the next page

370
01:01:42,359 --> 01:01:47,579
and uh I think we'll have time just to do this

371
01:01:47,579 --> 01:01:55,579
in column response and let's let's say let's skip to the

372
01:01:55,579 --> 01:02:03,020
third stanza this is one that's associated with some Vega and the story here is this is

373
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:10,619
recreating this moment after the Buddha has been born and his mother is in these

374
01:02:10,619 --> 01:02:19,460
texts described as dying seven days after his birth and this is Maya Queen mahamaya

375
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:26,160
offering her guidance to mahapajat to be called me who as the Buddhist Aunt takes

376
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:31,680
care of the Buddha after Amaya's death so this is Maya's guidance then to go to

377
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:40,400
me so if we just take the third stanza here in Kamai this sounds something like

378
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:51,140
[Music] um

379
01:02:55,319 --> 01:03:02,099
and so we'll apply a version of that same Melody for this line what can I do when we are born only to be destroyed

380
01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:07,380
Etc what

381
01:03:07,559 --> 01:03:11,579
can I do

382
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:20,300
what can and I do

383
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:25,910
[Music] when we are

384
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:32,000
[Music] when we are

385
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:39,960
going on me too

386
01:03:40,619 --> 01:03:46,740
born only two

387
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:53,180
[Music] The Stride

388
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:57,980
be the strong

389
01:03:58,579 --> 01:04:04,099
all humans and [Music]

390
01:04:04,099 --> 01:04:08,099
all humans

391
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:23,268
[Music]

392
01:04:28,579 --> 01:04:33,680
by Nature [Music]

393
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:41,119
by Nature thank you

394
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:48,420
so I think we're going to transition now to have a chance to discuss and reflect

395
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:53,940
uh you're welcome to um

396
01:04:53,940 --> 01:05:01,740
take a look at any of the other chants that we didn't get to the other ones on like Pages five six seven eight those

397
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:09,319
are just examples of other ones in this Karma song style they have Melodies of their own that might be recited for

398
01:05:09,319 --> 01:05:17,099
when someone is passing away sometimes for a funeral sometimes for the consecration of a Buddha image sometimes

399
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:24,380
just for a ceremony in gratitude for parents so many different occasions

400
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:29,460
and the book that they're coming from until Nirvana's time the this book just

401
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:36,020
has more translations and essays that try to um

402
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:41,400
for me try to fulfill what my my teachers promote and gauran wanted to do

403
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:47,640
which was to share this particular Cambodian tradition uh with the world

404
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:53,700
um first to Cambodian American communities those particularly younger Cambodian Americans who are maybe more

405
01:05:53,700 --> 01:06:00,420
familiar with English than Kumai so that they can access this part of their Heritage and their tradition but also

406
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:06,540
for people who are not Cambodian but want to appreciate a this particular

407
01:06:06,540 --> 01:06:12,420
window on the Dharma that's offered through the Cambodian dimersang tradition so thanks for your attention

408
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:17,298
and I'll turn it back over to the two of you

409
01:06:25,099 --> 01:06:32,579
thank you well thank you so much Trent I feel like I could sit here and listen for a while

410
01:06:32,579 --> 01:06:40,200
and feel this hmm we have a chance and to um

411
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:46,859
for those who are here in person to get into a small group of three or four

412
01:06:46,859 --> 01:06:52,200
uh to share a little bit about what this experience is

413
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:58,319
chanting listening to the sound of the chanting and maybe

414
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:03,720
um um what might have evoked in your heart

415
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:10,520
in your mind in your bodies and I would invite

416
01:07:10,520 --> 01:07:19,140
folks to mingle a bit so maybe go to the people you may not know much at all and

417
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:25,859
we can spread out in the hall and maybe even outside on the deck if you like we

418
01:07:25,859 --> 01:07:33,599
have about 10 minutes or so um and once you settle into a group

419
01:07:33,599 --> 01:07:42,559
um um maybe just take a moment and uh

420
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:48,960
to kind of collectively recognize that you're in a group and um

421
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:54,660
find a way you know whoever might to wanted to start first and then go around

422
01:07:54,660 --> 01:07:59,819
the circle and to say one thing at a time so as we

423
01:07:59,819 --> 01:08:08,280
get together I kind of also are learning from each other and uh this is not a chance to

424
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:13,859
um comment about other people's experience but really allow this to be

425
01:08:13,859 --> 01:08:19,980
something that we're sharing together collectively sharing together

426
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:25,560
and receiving the gift of sharing

427
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:30,660
and so um maybe we can just

428
01:08:30,660 --> 01:08:36,900
um uh stand up and form the groups and for those who don't find the group so maybe

429
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:42,540
you can come to the center of the hall and we'll find you a group

430
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:45,318
thank you

431
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:03,360
some somehow it wasn't test test

432
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:07,820
oops test test test test

433
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:13,320
there

434
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:12,900
so welcome back I hope you all had a good small group experience

435
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:18,179
um we'd like to just take a few moments now to share with the larger group

436
01:22:18,179 --> 01:22:23,699
um if there's anything from your small group that um you know

437
01:22:23,699 --> 01:22:30,980
that felt important for you or kind of resonated for you that you would like to share now with the rest of us I think

438
01:22:30,980 --> 01:22:37,500
Ying Trent and I had a little group of ourselves and it was just wonderful to

439
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:43,320
hear each of our experiences and to share that I think the richness of this

440
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:50,600
chanting really comes forth in the individual experiences so we'd like to hear from you

441
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:08,960
together

442
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:31,620
it was a very rich and moving sharing I'll just say one thing that really um

443
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:37,260
came clear was how much depth and richness and dimension as a Buddhist

444
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:43,199
practice this has mindfulness concentration

445
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:50,420
heart heart practices all of it so that's just one small piece

446
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:06,960
thank you for that I think in our group um there is just so much attention that

447
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:13,980
could be paid paid to all the experiences within our bodies and in the

448
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:19,800
group interacting individually and with the group and um

449
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:26,760
yeah for me it was where the chanting was coming from like in my belly and

450
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:33,179
noticing that this wasn't something I could do half-heartedly that that it really called for a full engagement

451
01:24:33,179 --> 01:24:39,140
especially in a group Live felt very

452
01:24:39,140 --> 01:24:46,620
used used some Vega and Posada and I I think I felt qualities of that in in the

453
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:55,920
in the experience of chanting together we also remarked this about the space how it felt to be doing it in this space

454
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:59,000
um it's very special

455
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:10,460
any other comments anyone want to share anything else

456
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:24,199
I'm just accustomed to hearing the monotonic uh

457
01:25:24,199 --> 01:25:30,300
chanting which I think I think we talked about in our group is it seems very it's

458
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:38,520
kind of um conducive to a meditative state right it's a very

459
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:48,480
kind of calming um whereas the melodic is so evocative of

460
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:55,820
of emotion and devotion which I really love

461
01:25:55,820 --> 01:26:02,340
and I was really curious about the different sounds or the different

462
01:26:02,340 --> 01:26:08,460
quality of The Melodies I mean early on I'm in the chanting trying to sound it

463
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:15,659
to me I I mean not that I'm very well versed in any kind of world music but it

464
01:26:15,659 --> 01:26:22,500
sounds a little uh like Pacific Islander like even Hawaiian and then I heard then

465
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:28,800
later on it almost sounded like a gory enchants and I was just so curious about

466
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:34,620
um yeah we're all that and they're so different I was just interested in learning more

467
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:37,159
about that

468
01:26:51,719 --> 01:26:56,940
thank you so the melodic chants within the Cambodian

469
01:26:56,940 --> 01:27:03,060
context are often following the

470
01:27:03,060 --> 01:27:10,980
musical Theory and practices of broader my secular music as well

471
01:27:10,980 --> 01:27:18,300
and so the the scales that is the musical notes that are being used are

472
01:27:18,300 --> 01:27:23,820
ones that we might see in other kinds of Cambodian and musical context as well

473
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:30,179
and those you know like any kind of musical tradition in the world it's always in conversation with other

474
01:27:30,179 --> 01:27:36,420
musical Traditions so and then there's also just all kinds of parallels whether

475
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:42,060
it's the particular notes that are used or the focal technique that we might see between

476
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:47,639
vocal Traditions that are geographically quite separate from one another

477
01:27:47,639 --> 01:27:56,820
so just to give a specific example for your question the second chat we did this one the

478
01:27:56,820 --> 01:28:03,300
second melodic one we did Maya's guidance for go to me on page five I put

479
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:09,780
this is not meaningful for everyone but for those who for whom this Western

480
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:16,380
musical Theory context is Meaningful I just put the imagining c as the

481
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:21,719
fundamental pitch and putting out the other notes in the scale

482
01:28:21,719 --> 01:28:29,699
in relation to that pitch and the particular scale that ends up being used

483
01:28:29,699 --> 01:28:34,139
is something like uh

484
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:46,020
and this this scale is quite there are other musical Traditions that use that

485
01:28:46,020 --> 01:28:51,300
scale but it's one that's very particular to Cambodian music as well

486
01:28:51,300 --> 01:28:57,239
um and sometimes when people are chanting in a Cambodian Temple say here

487
01:28:57,239 --> 01:29:05,040
in the United States people are chanting together they have different natural vocal ranges sometimes people will end

488
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:12,960
up settling on particular notes of that scale just in the monotone chanting because it fits within music that people

489
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:18,120
might be familiar with and so that someone with a lower voice might settle

490
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:23,480
on a note like oh and someone might tell them they're like

491
01:29:23,719 --> 01:29:30,540
something like that um this not consciously but just as an

492
01:29:30,540 --> 01:29:36,780
expression of this connection between musical Traditions outside of a particular Buddhist tradition and within

493
01:29:36,780 --> 01:29:42,840
that Maybe

494
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:48,719
maybe we have time for one more question or comment did you

495
01:29:48,719 --> 01:29:51,620
okay Amy

496
01:29:54,060 --> 01:30:01,080
yeah thank you so much for being here and offering this um the session um I was attending online I just got

497
01:30:01,080 --> 01:30:07,860
here that I basically was listening and participating um yeah I've um I've had the opportunity to

498
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:12,900
actually stay in different kinds of Buddhist monasteries including technohans and monasteries and the style

499
01:30:12,900 --> 01:30:18,900
of chanting there is very melodious like this I've also stayed in Sri Lankan monasteries and Thai Forest monasteries

500
01:30:18,900 --> 01:30:24,360
and something that I really miss um when I kind of you know started practicing more in this tradition the

501
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:30,120
Insight Meditation tradition was that there isn't really much chanting and I was wondering why like you guys don't

502
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:36,540
have to answer but it's kind of like a question for IMC leadership and IMC teachers like why is chanting kind of

503
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:43,440
almost intentionally left out that's what it feels like because I actually feel kind of sad about it I feel quite sad about it because I feel there's so

504
01:30:43,440 --> 01:30:48,480
much um uh there's so many functions and purposes to chanting like first of all

505
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:53,639
as someone mentioned it evokes this quality of devotion for me um especially as I go along the practice

506
01:30:53,639 --> 01:31:00,300
and also it's a way to memorize the teachings the matasuto the mangalasuta has a lot of important teachings and in

507
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:06,480
the monasteries when we chanted it on the full moon and New Moon nights I mean it's a way to kind of reaffirm Community

508
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:11,520
too a sense of um building community and strengthening the bonds within the

509
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:18,500
community so that's my question it's not you don't have to answer but like why is it left out

510
01:31:21,659 --> 01:31:26,880
could I ask a question back to you I don't I don't have an answer to this

511
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:33,300
this question but I'm curious since you because of all your experience and encounting encountering and

512
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:41,820
participating enchanting in different settings are there certain kinds of settings say at IMC or

513
01:31:41,820 --> 01:31:48,659
other centers you may participate in where you you would like to see more chanting and if so what what kind I'm

514
01:31:48,659 --> 01:31:55,880
just trying to imagine what might be most meaningful or important to you

515
01:31:56,460 --> 01:32:01,920
people would be like you know at certain dates that are very significant in the Buddhist calendar like for example vsoc

516
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:07,020
you know or something like that but also just like you know um Sunday mornings

517
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:14,340
are the most attended events just including something simple like um like what was that the

518
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:21,300
Reflections on universal well-being that's in the Thai Forest tradition or you know it's something that people can't even take home with them and

519
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:28,199
practice on their own and anyway just just ideas I mean there's no you know events of significance but also just

520
01:32:28,199 --> 01:32:34,500
something like a regular you know something regularly done maybe once a week

521
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:40,560
once a month even I don't know thank you thank you so much

522
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:45,659
I think um how about now

523
01:32:45,659 --> 01:32:51,480
okay well um I'm glad you brought this up Amy and I'm hoping that this event

524
01:32:51,480 --> 01:32:57,239
today can kind of stimulate that for us and maybe allow us to begin reflecting

525
01:32:57,239 --> 01:33:03,840
And discussing whether this is something we'd like to and can offer here I I myself also feel that I would benefit

526
01:33:03,840 --> 01:33:09,719
from some sort of regular chanting practice done at IMC so we can we'll

527
01:33:09,719 --> 01:33:16,739
look into it and I'm glad this event actually is stimulating these kinds of conversations as IMC is reopening and

528
01:33:16,739 --> 01:33:21,960
we're having more and more in-person events the other thing I really appreciate about chanting is that it's

529
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:28,159
in the moment in person is so rich in those qualities

530
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:37,260
so um we're almost at the end of our formal time together and I want to again thank

531
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:44,280
Trent Walker for all that you bring and are sharing and from this lineage and

532
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:50,960
what you've spent time studying and really refining so that you can keep this tradition alive

533
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:56,880
and I also want to recognize tension Khan here who has a new book one long

534
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:02,219
listening so if any of you want to check that out conversations in chaplaincy and

535
01:34:02,219 --> 01:34:10,620
I don't think I got the subtitle quite right but um and I'd like to invite her to come up here and Trent attention are

536
01:34:10,620 --> 01:34:15,619
going to help us close with a dedication of Merit

537
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:29,060
so if you could turn to page two in your handout and then there's this

538
01:34:29,060 --> 01:34:35,880
dedication of Merit chant this is just a translation of a vernacular command

539
01:34:35,880 --> 01:34:41,540
language chant um that chant goes something like

540
01:34:47,460 --> 01:34:53,340
et cetera and uh we'll do a similar melody in English

541
01:34:53,340 --> 01:35:03,440
something like let's try to find a pitch that's good for for you maybe you could start us off

542
01:35:05,320 --> 01:35:08,489
[Music]

543
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:22,429
and cross to reach [Music]

544
01:35:22,560 --> 01:35:28,380
so this isn't it as an example and we'll do it all together now so that with that

545
01:35:28,380 --> 01:35:35,520
same rhythm of essentially short short long short short short long for each of

546
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:41,699
the there's seven short lines per stanza and so we'll do it from the beginning to

547
01:35:41,699 --> 01:35:48,120
the end uh again don't feel you need to be wedded to the notes that we're starting

548
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:53,600
on and you can find what feels

549
01:35:53,600 --> 01:36:00,179
most resonant and true to your particular embodiment at this moment

550
01:36:00,179 --> 01:36:06,020
so um may we

551
01:36:06,020 --> 01:36:15,600
dedicate this Merit of of being here together of practicing chant together to for all

552
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:20,760
beings and then also for exactly how it's expressed here in the chat we'll do

553
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:30,970
