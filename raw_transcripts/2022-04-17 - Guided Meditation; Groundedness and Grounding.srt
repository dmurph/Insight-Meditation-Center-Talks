1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,860
so hello everyone good to be with you on this

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,639
[Music] sunday um

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,400
we'll do a meditation offer some

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,359
light guidance for us to begin and then followed by a silent sit

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,199
together let's enjoy each other's company

6
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,239
and practicing together

7
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,559
arriving

8
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,759
arriving arriving here and now

9
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,079
taking a few generous moments to arrive

10
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,240
not rushing through this arriving process

11
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:11,360
coming to your meditation cushions cheers

12
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:23,840
maybe just take a few moments to allow your feet to really settle on the ground

13
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,400
maybe the bodies still need to move

14
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,640
riding with the movements of arriving

15
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,360
so

16
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,560
so

17
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,640
when you're ready allow the contact of the body with

18
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,599
wherever you're sitting

19
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,480
to be in the forefront of your awareness

20
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,760
noticing that you have arrived here

21
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,000
and you have arrived now

22
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:43,800
feeling and sensing into the contact of the body with a floor and earth underneath of you

23
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,840
grounded supported

24
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,080
by earth

25
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,320
what's the felt sense of a grounded here and now

26
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,080
in this body with this breath

27
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:02,880
maybe the bubbly energy that you came with

28
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,600
settles down ever so slightly

29
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:30,840
maybe the movements of the breath become more visible

30
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:30,199
let yourself savor in the sense of groundedness

31
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,039
centered

32
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,759
from this grounded place

33
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,680
open the awareness to receive

34
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:59,840
whatever is present right here and right now

35
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,599
movements of the breath

36
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,400
sensations in the body

37
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,400
wavy emotions

38
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,840
lingering

39
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,560
thoughts nothing excluded

40
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,199
being with the ever-changing experiences

41
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,320
if the breath is prominent

42
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:13,040
resting grounding in the movements of the breath

43
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,959
being with the breath

44
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,120
nothing to do nowhere to go

45
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,920
just to hear was the movements of the breath

46
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,240
strong sensations in the body arise

47
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,120
no problem

48
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:28,839
open the space of awareness to be with the sensations in the body

49
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,560
just as they are

50
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,519
are learning to be

51
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,920
to be with what is here

52
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,399
whatever is here

53
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,320
we're learning to be with

54
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:30,380
[Music]

55
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:45,400
yeah so good to be here with you all

56
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:51,280
very delighted i'm aware that day you're probably all

57
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,640
sitting for a while for those who are online or in person

58
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:03,599
if you need to move uh feel free to do so just allow the body to shift and change a

59
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:09,119
little as we shift and change in a different mode of

60
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,880
practicing and learning learning dharma

61
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,960
so what's on my mind on today is a couple of words that i like to

62
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,960
share my reflections upon and these are the words

63
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,680
grounding or groundedness

64
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,040
i have introduced this couple of words in our meditation

65
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,240
and just slightly and so those two words um grounding

66
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,920
groundedness may evoke something in you

67
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:56,560
and even now as you're sitting or lying down standing

68
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:03,040
and just checking to see what is the felt sense of grounding or

69
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,599
grounded being grounded

70
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,160
for me there is a immediate sense of resting down

71
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:24,320
settling down be a sense of a safety

72
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:31,040
sense of a trust feeling secure here

73
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,480
not worried that somehow the ground will disappear

74
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:42,320
underneath of me so you may have

75
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,440
words and phrases images of your own

76
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,799
in this sense of grounding or being grounded

77
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,480
and so for me what i'd like to share today is

78
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,800
a reflective question where do we ground ourselves

79
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:19,520
where do we ground ourselves as human beings and one way or another

80
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:25,200
we're always finding ground to settle in

81
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:31,599
consciously unconsciously ever since we were born and when we were babies

82
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:37,359
the parents arms are the nice comfy grounds to be in

83
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:45,040
and they're resting there as we grow up on lots of different grounds open up for

84
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:52,078
us relationships with the friends family

85
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:59,520
relationships in communities maybe coming together here

86
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:06,480
feels a sense of a grounding and their sense of trust and safety

87
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:14,800
as we are in specific kinds of communities and our heart and mind and body can rest

88
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:21,520
feel some sense of settling in in those kind of grounds

89
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:29,760
and there are also other kind of grounds and some must find

90
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:37,280
grounds in jobs work we do the careers

91
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:43,200
and they offer certain kind of a fulfillment excitement

92
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:49,920
certain sense of security in different ways maybe

93
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:01,520
and grounds of hobby and grounds of

94
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,960
entertainment that's where we are kind of feeling

95
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:15,520
okay you know a sense of okayness may come in a sense of resting and coming when we're engaged in

96
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:22,079
those activities and the list can go on you know lots of

97
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:29,520
these grounds can open up as we go about living our lives

98
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:39,599
and some of these grounds [Music] as we begin to get a sense of kind of

99
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,359
them emerging we may also notice

100
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:55,200
many of those grounds involve a pattern of activities and doing

101
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:02,079
in relationships we have to find relationships maintain them

102
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:08,240
jobs and careers that offer our fulfillment had to really work at it and

103
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:14,160
and be in it and uh

104
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:22,319
for me i remember when i first came to this country more than 30 years ago

105
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:30,240
and as a college student i immediately realized that

106
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:37,040
that there was absolutely no security in any form

107
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:45,280
no financial security no relationships and i just immediately got very busy

108
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,560
doing trying to get a degree as fast as

109
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:58,160
possible and just so that i could feel a little comfort in achieving that and

110
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,839
and um getting a part-time job while doing that

111
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:11,760
i remember days when i would have spent all night in the computer graphics lab working on my

112
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:16,880
project and this um

113
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,640
this is all okay i think we all do this in our lives from time to time

114
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:29,119
and um and little did i know though

115
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,960
as i engage in this pattern and this can become

116
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,319
a habit a habit of doing achieving more

117
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:47,200
accomplishing more acquiring more and uh so

118
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:52,560
you know they uh i got a degree and got a job

119
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:59,760
and in the in my job i could do this or i could climb the

120
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:05,440
corporate ladder and so it doesn't stop

121
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:12,480
and so we all know that as individual engaging this way

122
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,520
and if many people engage in the same way

123
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:25,359
before we know it there is a culture began to evolve around all of us

124
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:32,079
there's a culture of a doing culture of busy doing endless doing

125
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:38,480
accomplishing achieving and once the culture is emerging

126
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:45,520
all around us that can become a norm we don't even know other

127
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:52,799
possibilities exist and so we just keep engaging in this

128
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:59,520
and sometimes um i recognize that even even

129
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:05,839
when a retirement comes the doing doesn't stop

130
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:13,119
because we just shift from one kind of a doing to another i remember at my

131
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:20,560
work and there was someone who retired uh i think a close to 80 years old but

132
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:26,319
after retirement uh he still shows up in the lab

133
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:33,599
and i was wondering wow this really goes on and on

134
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:39,359
and um we can begin to kind of uh

135
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:48,200
let this habit force kind of take over us continue in this mode

136
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:59,200
i want to offer an image and well before i do that i want to

137
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,400
point out maybe that on

138
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,560
it's not to say that all of this is our problems

139
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:16,839
well what i wanted to point out is as we began to um

140
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:22,160
reinforce this pattern in our lives

141
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:28,800
we began to engage in a unconscious in unconscious

142
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,319
dynamic and often and this is driven by the

143
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:41,359
forces of wanting desires and greed hatred delusion

144
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:48,720
but as we kind of continue to engage in this pattern we lose sight what is

145
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:54,480
driving underneath of us the image that i have

146
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:02,960
in this mode of operation is that of constant dancing on tippy toes

147
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:11,440
that's kind of before one foot landed completely on the ground the next foot had to move and i guess um

148
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:17,920
that the next foot the next landing is where we can finally

149
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:25,440
stabilize and ground and rest but as we know when this pattern began to engage on it

150
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:32,240
on its own kind of have his own life we just typical dance

151
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:38,240
not knowing the resting is even possible

152
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,240
and so we can begin to find the difficult um

153
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:52,720
to know what's possible to really ground

154
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:58,240
i remember that my teacher gail fransto sometimes

155
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,920
pointed out that maybe human beings it should be called human doings

156
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:12,000
because we really do we do a lot and is very fortunate for me it's not

157
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:17,200
until i encountered a dharma practice and dharma teachings

158
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:25,200
that i realized that there is a different kind of grounding that we can rest in

159
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:31,760
the ground of being being with what is happening here and

160
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:41,920
now unlike putting the two feet on the ground really solid on the ground

161
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:50,400
and even for all of us right now just you know as you settle in your chairs and the floor and

162
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:58,400
just allow yourself to feel the feet on the ground

163
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:07,040
sitting on the cushion not on the tears lying down wherever you are standing

164
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:13,359
what is that felt sense of a being being with what is happening here and

165
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:18,960
now being with listening

166
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:24,880
being with the breath moving crossing through us

167
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,240
being with the seeing

168
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:36,720
being with the sound inside and outside thoughts

169
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:43,520
nothing to do nowhere to go

170
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:51,359
for me that sense of a being often immediately evoked a sense of

171
00:48:51,359 --> 00:49:00,400
resting down that sense of groundedness that we were speaking about and practicing with

172
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:07,920
opening and receiving receiving what is happening here now

173
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,279
being contented with what is here

174
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:19,520
not wishing it to be any other way we don't have to be towed to the next

175
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:24,319
step but here here is enough

176
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,680
maybe the pain unpleasant sensations are here

177
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:37,359
unpleasant emotions are here but it's okay to be

178
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:45,640
to be with to be with this is enough

179
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:52,240
for me there is a sense of a contentment coming along

180
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:58,960
and maybe also sense of a centeredness all right here rooted right here right

181
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,200
now

182
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:14,160
being grounded in the way things are not what i wanted it to be

183
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:19,280
but the way things are and the pali term

184
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:25,119
that gets translated as the way things are is that of a dharma

185
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:28,480
grounded in dhamma

186
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:38,960
and this is not to say that somehow we'll just have a magic way of simply stopping not together and

187
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:45,440
stopping the doing stopping the momentum stopping the wanting doesn't happen there's no magical button

188
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:50,078
to push right we all know that

189
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:56,960
and yet as we engage in the dharma practice from

190
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:03,760
time to time we may discover the moments where we can be

191
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,800
with what is happening

192
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:15,040
and it offers an opportunity to know and to see

193
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:21,240
that there is a different possibility for us

194
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:31,200
and as we engage in the dharma practice we may also learn oh there is a different kind of a doing

195
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:36,640
that allow the being to come about

196
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:42,559
to be in our experience and this is the kind of a doing

197
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:48,559
and that i um [Music] that in our dharma

198
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:56,640
world referred to as walking the dharma path it involves certain kind of doing

199
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:02,720
and you all come here today and practice meditation together

200
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:11,040
learning the dharma learning the dharma together there is a form of doing engaged

201
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:17,280
and yet to this kind of a doing are conducive to settling

202
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:24,079
and resting conducive to an establishment of a sense

203
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:30,079
of a well-being i love the term well-being it's kind of

204
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:35,040
a being that has a goodness to it

205
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,599
kind of a being that we can trust

206
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:50,800
that's very fortunate and that this is possible this is available to us

207
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,839
and walking the dharma path is a form of doing that one can engage

208
00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:03,800
in that allow a different ground to emerge

209
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:20,160
i uh pointed out early on the kind of activities that we're engaging the kind

210
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:27,040
of doing that we engage in involves involves maybe sometimes a lot of physical activities

211
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:32,880
and i also want to point out that there is a kind of a doing that happen

212
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:38,880
in our mind and so we discover this as we begin to sit on the cushion

213
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:44,640
and oftentimes when we began our meditative practice

214
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:50,400
even though our bodies settled down immediately would discover how much we

215
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:56,400
think right and boy they're loud and

216
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:02,480
persistent and knowing that this is also a

217
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:08,640
long-term conditioning that happened maybe from very early on i'm aware that

218
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:16,240
my teenager is on and you know needs to figure things out a lot

219
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:22,880
you know i'm fond of these terms and figure things out sorting things out in our

220
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:30,559
mind because we never read out we always keep figuring continue to figure but never really kind

221
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:37,839
of out of it maybe out of it momentarily the next one will come pretty quickly

222
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:44,000
we're kind of aware of this kind of uh doing as well internally

223
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:50,079
internal chatter for me i never realized how much i talked to myself

224
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:57,440
in meditation constant yeah we have inner inner chatter going on

225
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:07,280
and our culture and there is a culture norm and that supports this conditions this right and

226
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:13,599
the more knowledge we have and the more information we accumulate somehow

227
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:20,480
we will be okay you know we'll be able to figure things out and and so we get to stimulate stimulated by

228
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:27,119
constant feeds into our being and

229
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:33,440
social media emails and internet and what have you

230
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,720
and our this thinking machine is constantly fed

231
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:42,799
with lots of resources

232
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:52,240
and so figuring things out sometimes can be become a belief an idea that we have we

233
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:58,400
hold so even if our physical bodies are settled down

234
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:06,000
and that belief may still continue to feel kind of feel the momentum

235
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:13,119
in our patterns of thinking patterns patterns of planning

236
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:22,240
yet walking the dharma path we begin to learn

237
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:30,680
what is a different possibility what is a different possibility here

238
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,880
that's great you know we are offered with

239
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:45,200
mindfulness practices allow us to begin to see the patterns

240
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:50,640
exist in us allow offer tools

241
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:56,839
for us to begin to settle into our

242
00:56:56,839 --> 00:57:02,160
experiences the mindfulness of the body of our breath

243
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:07,440
invite us to begin to settle in the experience that's happening here

244
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,599
and now

245
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:19,040
and sometimes maybe sometimes you may have this experience yourself

246
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:26,720
as you settle into the rhythm of the breath sensations in the body

247
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:33,200
our beliefs about having to think through everything may soften

248
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:38,960
we may have momentary experience of

249
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:46,559
silence even the silence in between my words

250
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:55,640
space some momentary stillness

251
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:02,799
however small it may feel like and this might be the pointers for us to

252
00:58:02,799 --> 00:58:08,040
say oh there may be a different ground

253
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:11,599
that's possible here

254
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:23,078
again i want to invite you to just chucking in your body however it is

255
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:39,040
maybe in the midst of the movements in the body there can be a sense of silence

256
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:46,079
kind of a stillness that's not rejecting

257
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:52,559
all the things that are happening but just being with

258
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:59,520
just being with listening to the sound

259
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:05,640
and yet the silence can be in the backdrop of it all

260
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:13,839
i'm fond of this story of mother teresa

261
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:20,160
from the book uh civility this is an interview with the mother

262
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:29,599
teresa there is interviewer asked the mother teresa what she says to god when she prays

263
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:36,160
i don't say anything she replies just listen

264
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:43,200
and so the interviewer asked her what god says to her

265
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:51,040
he doesn't say anything said mother teresa he just listens

266
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:58,400
and before the astonished interviewer could press her further she added

267
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:05,119
and if you don't understand that i can't explain it to you

268
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:14,079
so quietly listen listen to the vibrations within us

269
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:20,440
vibrations outside quiet still

270
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,359
when we're more and more grounded ourselves in the way things are

271
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:43,720
not wishing it to be in any other way grounded in being

272
01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:51,760
actions can arise spontaneously out of wisdom compassion

273
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:59,440
and so this form of a being is not some form of idols and simply kind of giving

274
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:04,880
up doing nothing but rather it's a deep trust

275
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:11,838
of the inner wisdom and compassion that's available to us

276
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:19,599
and the kind of trust that allows the kind of doing that emerges

277
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:25,040
not based on the wanting and the aversion or the

278
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:34,000
delusion but based on the big field of compassion and wisdom

279
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:40,079
and so this form of being is a rich

280
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:47,839
and potent field and not a barren field

281
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:54,160
i want to offer a poem from

282
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:59,359
and which is written by a chinese philosopher laos

283
01:01:59,359 --> 01:02:04,400
and translated by stephen mitchell

284
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:11,119
and it says this is the chapter 15.

285
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:20,480
the ancient masters were profound and the subtle their wisdom was unfathomable

286
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:28,559
there is no way to describe it all we can describe is their appearance

287
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:37,760
they were careful as someone crossing an ice-covered stream alert as a warrior in enemy

288
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:45,520
territory courteous as a guest fluid as melting eyes

289
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:50,640
shapeable as the block of wood receptive

290
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:57,440
as a valley clear as a glass of water

291
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:05,039
do you have the patience to wait till your mud settles

292
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:12,480
and the water is clear can you remain unmoving

293
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:17,838
till the right action arises by itself

294
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:24,319
the master doesn't seek fulfillment not seeking

295
01:03:24,319 --> 01:03:32,880
not expecting she is present and can welcome all things

296
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:44,880
so there is a kind of doing that's a field by

297
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:50,880
wanting delusion that leads to more doing

298
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:56,000
tipito dancing [Music] and there is a form of a doing that

299
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,960
leads to being well-being

300
01:04:01,119 --> 01:04:08,000
and this being [Music] is a rich potent flexible

301
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,039
as being as shapeable as a block of a wood

302
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:19,280
can be a stick for someone who needs a stick to walk around

303
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:25,558
can be a pillar holding the structure of the building

304
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:38,160
and so there is this a form of a being that offers the potential of doing

305
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:47,279
for the benefit of all beings for the well-being of all beings

306
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:54,319
but this happens when we have the patience to wait

307
01:04:54,319 --> 01:05:00,318
for the mud to settle and the water to be clear

308
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:06,640
and so this practice we're engaging in [Music] is to learn to be

309
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:15,920
to settle to allow the mud to settle and so our heart and mind become clear

310
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:24,960
and the right actions arise by itself

311
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:33,280
and so may we all trust um trust the holes i'm doing that allow the

312
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:40,400
well-being to emerge and trusting the doing that arise out of

313
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:47,359
a deep sense of well-being and may all beings be benefited by this

314
01:05:47,359 --> 01:05:51,240
so thank you everybody

315
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:06,640
so we have a few minutes maybe anyone who have comments and

316
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:12,400
protest questions welcome yeah

317
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,720
are your own reflections

318
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:36,799
being that must have been a good dharma talk because during it i realized how

319
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:41,760
unsettled and antsy and restless my body was

320
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:47,039
yeah yeah that's noticing it it has a lot of power

321
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:54,000
yeah yeah thank you it wasn't pleasant to notice it but it was kind of wonderful in a way because

322
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:00,880
oh yes you know i've got this body and i'm alive yes yes that's right yeah

323
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:06,559
yeah so that there's one behind you

324
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:15,520
thank you ying that was so beautiful um i have i have a request and then a

325
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:20,880
question my request is if you could read the poem one more time

326
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:26,319
and then my question is about that um you know waiting for the

327
01:07:26,319 --> 01:07:31,920
what was it the mud if you could talk about

328
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:37,839
how that process might unfold that would be great yeah beautiful thank

329
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:43,440
you thank you for the question um let me read the dev poem one more

330
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:50,000
time and then maybe we'll unpack a little see how we get the mud to settle

331
01:07:52,400 --> 01:08:01,359
the ancient masters were profound and subtle their wisdom was unfathomable

332
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:08,960
there is no way to describe it all we can describe is their appearance

333
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:14,720
they were careful as someone crossing an ice-covered stream

334
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:21,758
alert as a warrior in enemy territory courteous as a guest

335
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:28,480
fluid as melting ice shapeable as a block of wood

336
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:35,199
receptive as a valley clear as a glass of water

337
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:41,520
do you have the patience to wait till your mud settles

338
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:48,159
and the water is clear can you remain unmoving

339
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:56,080
until the right action arises by itself the master doesn't seek fulfillment

340
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:01,278
not seeking not expecting she is present

341
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:06,198
and can welcome all things

342
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:13,520
yeah so and here it offers the words and patient

343
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:19,520
patients have the patience to wait till the mud settles

344
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:25,359
image evoked in me is that of sitting right here

345
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:30,880
being in the midst of what's happening here and now as

346
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:36,238
bill was pointing out sitting here noticing

347
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:41,838
the unease that may be in the body in the mind

348
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:47,718
do we have the patience to be with this

349
01:09:48,239 --> 01:09:54,400
is so often when unpleasant uh experiences happen we immediately

350
01:09:54,400 --> 01:10:00,560
wanted to tip it over to the next step you know i gotta get rid of this one and

351
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:07,199
and what this invites us is to be with this

352
01:10:07,199 --> 01:10:13,440
i'll allow this experience to unfold on its own terms

353
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:20,480
not based on what i believe it should be or um

354
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:27,600
i would rather that's not happening to me you know there are lots of agendas that that our

355
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:34,080
habitual mind can have and wanted to wiggle out of where we are

356
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:41,520
and we've offered um in the dharma practice lots of tools to establish that kind of

357
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:47,679
a sense of centeredness being with and for example

358
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:52,800
mindfulness of the breath being with the breath

359
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:59,360
as the breath unfolds on its own being with the body

360
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:05,520
in the body of the body not us of my belief of what the body is

361
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:11,360
supposed to to be and so a lot of those

362
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:17,760
things that you've been practicing is pointing to this direction

363
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:23,360
and part of it this is and the trick is to begin to notice the various patterns

364
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:28,880
that emerge in us that wanting to wiggle this way or that way

365
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:34,960
and so when we cultivate mindfulness we begin to see those momentum

366
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:41,840
and we just look at them and smile can i be with this

367
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:50,000
and let the flow so the mud will settle

368
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:57,280
but if you know we can try if we you know want to get rid of this and want to hold on that

369
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:02,480
um we can see what impact that has

370
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:09,760
and does that lead to settledness or does it lead to more spinning around

371
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:16,000
and so this you know as as long as we begin to open our awareness

372
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:21,040
to see this we will begin to see and

373
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:27,920
kind of inner functions of this and i want begin to see the

374
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:34,400
i don't like to use the word logic because it doesn't feel logical sometimes they're pretty chaotic

375
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:40,560
but we will begin to see certain patterns and we'll begin to know

376
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:47,199
what will actually support a sense of well-being and what doesn't

377
01:12:47,199 --> 01:12:52,320
does that seem to land yeah okay thank you

378
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:58,480
maybe the last one if there is one

379
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,480
otherwise

380
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:12,880
well then we can stop right here thank you so much everyone for your practice

381
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:19,840
and um may you continue take good care
