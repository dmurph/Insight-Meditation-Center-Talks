1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,800
so good morning everyone and welcome or good day for those of you on other time

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,639
zones and um

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:21,880
so in this ex exploration of the

4
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:29,359
the first of the three major insights of insight meditation

5
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:36,680
I'll continue talking about inconstancy change

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,320
and impermanence the coming and going of experience

7
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:49,120
and for meditation one of the really important milestones in meditation

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,280
is coming to a really clear understanding clear insight

9
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,680
if you may if I may of

10
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,840
how much time we spend thinking

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,760
how much time we spend viewing our experience ourselves what's

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:20,000
important through the lens of thoughts and thinking most thinking is about

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,600
something and so we live in a world of aboutness

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:34,079
rather than living in a world of immediacy a a world of sensation sensing

15
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,920
and even if we are sensing and more or less in the present moment and feeling deeply what's going on even there

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:50,000
there's subtle conceivings valuing prioritizing

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,680
selecting of the experience that goes on even sometimes subvocally or sub

18
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:05,759
subconsciously almost in us that gives us a kind of kind of uh holding on to

19
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:16,080
experience a kind of momentum of of preoccupation momentum of of um

20
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,959
raifying or solidifying some concern that we have

21
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:31,360
and uh and the most extreme versions would be to um be lost in thought about

22
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,440
something that just seems insurmountable seems permanent seems like this is the

23
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,400
way it's going to be forever and it's terrible or wonderful or something

24
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:53,920
and so to see how much the time we spend there so that we could can experience our life

25
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:01,440
in meditation in a very different way it's almost like a paradigm shift

26
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,280
from see looking at our life through the lens of our concepts

27
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,640
to feeling our life through the flow of

28
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,560
changing sense experience

29
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:25,360
and uh and to relax the thinking mind to soften the tension that is behind a lot

30
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:32,000
of thinking we go we do the momentum to settle and relax the body relax

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,280
what's going on so we're not forcing ourselves to enter into the world of

32
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,879
change but we naturally settle into it and feel

33
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:51,519
it and become it and one of the insights that's possible

34
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,439
as we stay close to the world of the phenomenal world the world of direct

35
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:07,000
experience of everything including thoughts is to appreciate how much

36
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,040
under the surface of our projections and raifications

37
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,439
how much

38
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:26,919
Things change arise and pass and in the passing

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:34,479
there is a hint of freedom

40
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:41,199
a freedom from preoccupation a freedom from being

41
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,600
entangled with experience reacting to experience

42
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,080
a freedom of simplicity a freedom of a heart and mind

43
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:02,680
that is unpreoccupied and that when something ends

44
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,199
that absence of something is overlooked in the dharma we don't overlook the

45
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:20,400
absence that follows the ending of something we appreciate the spaciousness

46
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:27,360
the peacefulness the stillness that might be found there so in this

47
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,160
meditation notice endings

48
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:41,919
and the absence of what just ended not because it's sad or because it's you

49
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:48,160
miss something but the experiential in the moment

50
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:55,479
space silence openness stillness

51
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:02,240
silence that might be there even if it's momentary momentary

52
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,918
so assuming a meditation posture

53
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:19,520
and right as you close your eyes there's a ceasing an ending

54
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,680
of being involved in the visual world of sight

55
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:39,360
in settling into a meditation posture there's the ending of a certain degree

56
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,719
of movement and moving around

57
00:06:51,280 --> 00:07:00,160
breathing and settling into your posture there's the ending of certain

58
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:07,919
large tensions or holdings maybe if the shoulders relax

59
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,639
the belly relaxes

60
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:27,560
can you readjust your arms and hands to allow something to relax and soften

61
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:52,720
feeling the rhythm of how the body expands and contracts

62
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,199
as you breathe

63
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:07,400
the movements of the belly and diaphragm as you breathe

64
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:25,560
maybe the movement the tingling of air going in out through your nostr nostrils

65
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:44,000
and kind of with a gentle massage of that rhythm of breathing

66
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,800
on the exhale relax your thinking mind

67
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,839
soften

68
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:30,720
Maybe as just quiet your quiet your thinking mind calm it in a quiet

69
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:37,600
way of thinking it's a way of letting go of all other

70
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,120
thoughts gently on the exhale

71
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:50,760
quietly on the exhale whisper to yourself the word yes

72
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,639
yes to letting go of thoughts

73
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,160
yes to letting go into the body

74
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:37,680
and as we're sitting here meditating

75
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,519
a lot of things are no longer happening for you in this

76
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:50,160
moment there's more things that you are not thinking about

77
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:58,200
more things than you're not clinging to than you're preoccupied with

78
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,079
they appreciate the absence

79
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:24,600
when something is not present a degree of freedom is found there

80
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,880
peace spaciousness

81
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:01,440
gently calmly stay close to the comingings and goings

82
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,240
of sensations thoughts feelings

83
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,079
appreciating the moments of absence

84
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:38,040
when awareness is not feeling or sensing

85
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:43,880
something that was being experienced

86
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:31,200
At the end of the inhale There's a momentary absence

87
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:39,560
of the inhale that allows the beginning of the exhale

88
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:50,680
but between the inhale and the exhale there's a momentary

89
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,639
absence stillness spaciousness

90
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:04,440
being free of any sensation of breathing

91
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:15,880
the end of the exhale same thing

92
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,959
when you're very quiet you'll see that thoughts are not

93
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:23,959
continuous

94
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:35,120
there's little gaps and pauses and little moments when the mind is

95
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,040
distracted by sound or sensations

96
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:50,920
moments where awareness is free

97
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,160
of what we were thinking feel

98
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,000
those moments

99
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:43,880
in the coming and going of sensations experience

100
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,200
with a going of it you might feel

101
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:59,799
how the then there is a non-involvement with what was

102
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:12,759
at any given moment there's what the mind is involved in

103
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:18,400
and there's a vast spaciousness

104
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,360
of all the things it's not involved in

105
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:36,720
expand your sense of awareness into the spaciousness the peacefulness

106
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,120
of non-involvement

107
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,200
at any given mo moment

108
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:37,919
there are things that have passed sensations and sounds and thoughts

109
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,240
were shifted

110
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,799
we're no longer the center of attention

111
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,280
let go of what was

112
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,960
let go of what is not in the direct experience

113
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,360
of the moment

114
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,799
so there is more space and openness

115
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,279
for what comes next

116
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,919
and as we come to the end of the sitting

117
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:01,200
maybe you can appreciate the opport opportunity that endings

118
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:08,559
provide as much as there might be a loss

119
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:16,960
in the dharma there's a greater benefit in the freedom in this peace

120
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,400
in the openness freshness

121
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,480
that's there with the absence of what was

122
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,919
if we can let go of what was a moment ago

123
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:45,960
endings provide an opening into freedom

124
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:55,080
and as we in and openings and endings

125
00:27:55,279 --> 00:28:03,840
ending of preoccupation ending of projections and agendas

126
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:13,039
even if it's temporary allows us to meet others in a fresh way

127
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:20,480
open way may it be that this practice we do shows

128
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,960
us teaches us how to be present for others

129
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:37,320
with a fresh awareness an open awareness a peaceful awareness of what is

130
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:44,159
so we're not preoccupied by what was or what we carried with us

131
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,760
into the meeting

132
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:56,000
may endings support deeper connection deeper care

133
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,640
for this world because we know people better

134
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:11,640
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

135
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,919
may all beings be peaceful

136
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,360
may all beings be free

137
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:35,279
[Music]

138
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:38,600
thank you

139
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:44,399
so hello and welcome to this 15th talk on insight

140
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:50,520
and this week has been a um

141
00:30:51,120 --> 00:31:00,320
a exploration of the topic of anicha the poly word a n i ca

142
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,480
and it's usually translated as impermanence which tends to emphasize the ending of

143
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:12,480
things that things will stop and cease and no longer be there the poly word

144
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:22,159
more literally means inconstancy meaning that uh things are not constantly there but they come and go

145
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:29,440
and some things are obvious the um meals come and go days come and

146
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:37,120
go daytime comes and goes mornings come and go uh meditation sessions come and

147
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,159
go all kinds of things come and go and they return the next day they return the

148
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:48,480
next hour the inhale comes and goes but and it's but it's always there in a

149
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,440
sense so it's in constant and um and a lot of the deeper insight

150
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,960
of meditation a lot of the wisdom ordinary wisdom of being a human being

151
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,120
appreciates that things are impermanent that things do sooner or later stop and

152
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:15,200
disappear and to learn how to be wise about that compassionate about that

153
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,640
and there's also this deeper truth that's not seen as clearly is the

154
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:26,080
inconstency of things one reasons we don't see it so obviously

155
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,120
or live in it so much is we tend to be focused so much on one thing there's a

156
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,480
tremendous raification tremendous preoccupation that mind has

157
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:44,159
the preoccupation of the moment can can um can feel like it's constant

158
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,480
the And the uh the metaphor that's used for this kind of illusion of constancy that

159
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:57,519
involves a very busy and active mind is um it's called monkey mind and this is

160
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,960
the mind that is u a monkey is swinging through from branch to branch in the

161
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,440
forest in the jungle and um before it's let go of one branch it's already

162
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:15,200
reaching to grab the next one so it's always one way or the other involved in

163
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:22,880
grasping reaching for and take holding on to and um and it might let go but be

164
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,159
uh of one to grab you know in grabbing the next but the preoccupation is

165
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,760
already in the grabbing of the next doesn't notice the letting go

166
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,880
and uh and so what the in a sense what the mind is involved in is always with a

167
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:45,120
grasping so grasping can seem like it's constant but in fact it comes and goes

168
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,880
and when we sit down in meditation and start and calm ourselves and get clear

169
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:58,320
and clear with the mindfulness we start seeing um among other things uh the grasping

170
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:04,640
mind and how it reaches and wants but we see the gap between it we see the

171
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,839
arising of a thought rather than seeing thoughts as continuous we see that

172
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,679
thoughts come and go we see that sensations come and go and with a deeper

173
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:22,000
and deeper calm samadei of meditation there's a shift to in the direct moment

174
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,919
of being just here in the direct experience now here just here and and

175
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,440
it's we start entering into the river of change there's the river of inconstancy

176
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,040
and that can be very satisfying and it can be very absorbing to be in that

177
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,960
but there's a pos an opportunity there that we see moment to moment things are

178
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:55,919
coming and going and um moment to moment uh in that stream things arise and pass

179
00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:03,440
and seeing the passing of things seeing the ending of things uh gives for all

180
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,480
the loss it might entail also provides opportunity

181
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:15,440
and one of those opportunities there's number and that is that uh the mind

182
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,560
unless we're involved with memory and caught in it the in the moment what's

183
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,800
not there uh creates space and openness in the mind unless the mind reaches for the

184
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,960
next branch and um so

185
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,359
as you're thinking about something and a particular

186
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:46,000
thought ends And before the next thought begins

187
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,240
between the ending of one and the beginning of the next

188
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:59,599
without using thoughts to answer the question who are you

189
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:08,920
what is awareness like between thoughts what is awareness like

190
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:17,200
between ex beginning of the end of one experience and the beginning of next

191
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:24,320
there might be if you might feel a degree of peace a degree of spaciousness

192
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:32,160
stillness a degree of non-clinging non and so at some point in practice we

193
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:39,280
start be beginning appreciated appreciating the ending of things

194
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,960
or we appreciate the endings and it can be disorienting because in the ending of

195
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:52,240
something we're so used to having something that we're orienting ourselves to or holding on to or some way of being

196
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:58,160
that we are this is who I am but in the flow of arising and passing and uh some

197
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:04,000
people then get disoriented well I'm if I'm not there you know if if I don't have a thought

198
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,520
telling me who I am then who am I if I'm not holding on to something or

199
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:17,440
preoccupied by something then how am I going to be safe and so there's a kind of a beginning of

200
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:25,760
exploration a beginning of of uh of um finding a certain kind of peace comfort

201
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,359
letting go in the the the the certain

202
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:36,960
kind of freedom that's there with the absence with things it's kind of like as

203
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:43,920
things arise and pass we see in the passing that right there there's the

204
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:52,000
opportunity not to cling right there there's nothing to cling to there's nothing to resist nothing to do

205
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:57,440
nothing to push against nothing to be

206
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:04,160
and so part of the emphasis part of the what comes along almost in a natural way

207
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:10,000
nothing we have to do about it is as we start settling more and more into the

208
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:15,359
impermanent inconstant nature of direct experience

209
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:24,800
and the I'm going to underline direct experience not uh um thought about experience

210
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:32,640
if we're if we're thinking about experience the thinking gives all kinds of other uh impressions of what's

211
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:39,280
actually happening it can give an impression of more constancy more solidity

212
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:47,040
so it's not the continu continuity of thinking about experience it's the continuity of the direct experience kind

213
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,960
of under underneath the thinking level and we start to see there's freedom

214
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,440
there there's freedom in floating along in the current of change and there's

215
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:07,599
freedom in the spaciousness and the openness of um when when things end

216
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:17,040
and um so in the teachings of the Buddha there are some places where uh he emphasize that when something uh uh when

217
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,560
the hindrances for example when greed or hatred aversion desires

218
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:29,920
when um doubts when anxiety and fear when these things kind of uh come to

219
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:35,839
some kind of end um uh don't just go on to the next

220
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:40,880
branch don't just go on to the next clinging take a few moments to feel the

221
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,720
absence of that feel the goodness of that feel the

222
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,160
spaciousness or some of the characteristics of that absence

223
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:59,280
so monkey mind doesn't take the time to feel the simplicity of being

224
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,320
when we certain things have been put down we just go on to the next thing to

225
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,920
cling to and be involved in and meditation is one of those times where

226
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,440
we're beginning to appreciate very deeply all the things we've put down all

227
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:21,680
the things that we've let go of in meditation settled away relaxed into and

228
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:29,040
the absence of those things uh is a freshness the absence of those things there's a kind of freedom there and one

229
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,880
of the things to appreciate one of the things that's remarkable in

230
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:41,119
how it leads to greater and greater freedom is to appreciate the ending of

231
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,320
things the absence of things how things are not there even if it's momentary or

232
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:53,760
maybe it's more extended um and and then it gives you the opportunity to be careful

233
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,119
not to reach for the next branch not to fill yourself with more presence of

234
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:06,000
things but appreciate the absence and ab and so absence is a little bit

235
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:13,280
can be more expansive and spacious so that when we go through our lives

236
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,640
and we are we do know something we do feel something and sense something we're

237
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:25,520
not locked into it but rather we feel it in a wider

238
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:33,520
uh field atmosphere of calm of peace of freedom of non-clinging

239
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:39,280
and so rather than being a monkey swinging grabbing one branch up to the

240
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:46,319
other we come become more like a graceful soaring bird

241
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:56,400
where the vast empty sky holds our wings up as we float fly through and see

242
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:03,839
all the changing things in our life from the vantage point of all the space that's here as well

243
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:11,440
so I hope this um discussion about um seeing endings seeing the absence of

244
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,119
things seeing the uh is understandable to you and it gives

245
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:25,760
you an appreciation of of u not just uh the

246
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,760
the negative part of absence not just the the beginning of something new but

247
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:36,800
something in that ending of something that allows something expansive to be

248
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:44,560
there and as that expansive freedom is there then it's much easier to be with

249
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:53,760
the challenging parts of impermanence and change and this life human life

250
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:01,599
so thank you and um so we'll continue with this uh series on insight in a few

251
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:09,760
weeks i'm going to be away on vacation uh for this next week

252

253
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,720
