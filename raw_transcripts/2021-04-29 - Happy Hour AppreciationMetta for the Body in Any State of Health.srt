1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:08,160
great all right so hello everyone hello and warm-hearted welcome

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:16,240
wherever you are and however the weather is either internally in this

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,600
moment or externally so so for

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,640
today's practice for the theme for our exploration

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,960
i'd like to invite us to explore the theme of this wish for for health wish for

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,239
health and as a part of

7
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:48,160
the phrases of methods we cultivate loving kindness for ourselves for others

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:55,920
as we tap into the good will that we have for others and ourselves

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,160
the four phrases of meta just to review the first one has to do with safety and

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,720
we talked about safety last week the second one has to do with um

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:16,000
happiness mental happiness and we explored that on monday so today

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,400
we explored the third phrase kind of linger a little bit here today may you be

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:30,240
healthy may you be healthy and strong so let's explore that wish maybe

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:36,400
on friday we will explore the last wish which is for ease or maybe

15
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:44,200
there will be more of health to explore we'll see so this third wish the third

16
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:50,560
metaphrase um may you be healthy may you be strong may

17
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,600
i be healthy may i be strong and wishful for physical well-being

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,119
so let's sit with that let's explore that so first to consider that these

19
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,920
different phrases of meta they try to explore these different aspects of well-being

20
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:17,920
mental well-being e safety etc as we've discussed so this physical well-being health yes as human

21
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:24,480
beings we have a body we all have a body of course we do

22
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,599
and we all experience lack of health because we have a body

23
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:39,840
there's we have been sick or we will be sick or maybe we are sick right now we all age

24
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,440
of course we do it's a part of part of life

25
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,840
so this wish for for well-being

26
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,680
the sense of physical well-being

27
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,599
it's a wish it's an offer it's it's it's a generosity it's a gift of generosity

28
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:12,319
regardless of how much health we have or other people have in this moment

29
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:19,200
so so actually today it's kind of interesting that i'm talking about this thing because today i

30
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,319
haven't been feeling well all day in horizon horizontal and i'll

31
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:30,959
be all horizontal probably after teaching so it's actually perfect i realize

32
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:38,000
there's no irony but actually there's this perfection of talking about this wishful for health where they can

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,879
be well-being holding lack of physical well-being so there can be a sense of well-being in

34
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,920
the heart and the mind both holding lack of physical well-being

35
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:57,760
that's one aspect i'd like to invite us to explore that well-being is is

36
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,120
greater is this greater is more pervasive the sense of well-being that

37
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:09,599
you can say you could be sick you can not feel well but there can still be a sense of

38
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:16,799
well-being overall well-being that holds that holds that lack of physical health

39
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,000
in that moment so that's one thing to kind of drop in as a possibility

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,919
as a possibility another theme to explore is that

41
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:35,680
um when there is

42
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:43,199
health or lack of health you know there's it's always relative it's not binary as long as

43
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,479
we're alive there's some level of health there's some level of something that's

44
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,240
working the heart is beating we are breathing so there's always some

45
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,759
level of health so so for example if you're wishing yourself may i be healthy or may you be

46
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:06,240
healthy wishing someone helps someone you care about and they're not fully healthy so it's not an

47
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,919
irony to wish oh i want may you be healthy oh may you be healthy as much as possible as much as available

48
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:21,199
so not to try to push reality and and fight with it not to be in conflict

49
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:27,440
but to offer this wish again another aspect of this cultivation

50
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:34,560
with meta with friendliness is we cultivate our heart in goodness and generosity

51
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,560
for ourselves for others with this offering this wish may you be healthy

52
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,840
may be healthy as much as possible as much as is available to you may i be healthy may i have good health

53
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,919
as much as possible and oh there's a delight in that just as i say that

54
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:58,960
and again today as i'm not feeling well oh yeah there's a generosity

55
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,000
may i be healthy as much as it's not all may i be healthy and i'm not healthy and

56
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,680
this is terrible it's not fighting reality it's actually there's there's a grace there is a beauty

57
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,919
even when there is lack of health to to have this wish for ourselves and

58
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:23,520
for others there's this generosity of this gift

59
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:31,360
and one last thing i want to bring in as a contemplation today is that

60
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:38,080
there is there's actually um you know of course there is

61
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,199
there's a lot of gift in being healthy we already know this that's that's

62
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:50,319
that's obvious that's kind of that's the um that's the apparent but

63
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:56,639
many of us don't open up to the grace and beauty

64
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,000
and actually the value of not being fully healthy

65
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,680
because there is a place where we can actually open up it we become we we go inside we can

66
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,120
open up to the inner world as long as again we work with the second arrows i

67
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,800
don't want you know the teaching of the first era which is say lack of health second error is what

68
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,199
what we add ourselves oh i don't want to be here this is terrible i'll never never be well i have a lot of things on

69
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,400
my to-do list so as we work with those and actually

70
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:40,319
allow the relishing of going in of relishing of letting go

71
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,879
and actually this quietness this quietness of mind the solitude the sense of peace and

72
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:54,400
and um [Music] quietness that is is forced and yet it's

73
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,639
an opportunity in fact on on many retreats i've given the instruction to people

74
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:07,120
um practice as if you are sick right now because then that sense of grabbing

75
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,759
grasping clinging wanting when you're sick it all kind of drops away there's the ease the

76
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:21,599
mind doesn't have the energy to to fight too much so just there's a

77
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:29,520
sense of ease that naturally comes in ah when there isn't so much

78
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:37,279
grabbing and grasping so so so much to explore in this in this

79
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:43,120
health and lack of it so with that the invitation again would be to explore

80
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,880
this offering this wish for safety i'm sorry wish for health and

81
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,399
playing with that for others for ourselves as much as available

82
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,880
in in this nuanced way not in just a flat one-dimensional way but

83
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:07,200
being open to all the dimensions that this can open up for us and maybe in ways we didn't

84
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:13,200
quite expect so so with that i'd like to invite us

85
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:22,800
all to get into our meditation posture ah landing landing

86
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:37,839
in the body either sitting or lying down whatever is appropriate for you

87
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:51,839
creating greeting this body however it is failing right now

88
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,079
inviting the body to be just as it is

89
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:16,800
it's feeling energetic healthy vibrant

90
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,560
it's feeling tired

91
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:33,839
not so much energy or unwell however it is hello dear body hi

92
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,519
as if you're greeting a dear dear friend whom you have

93
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:54,800
ignored who's doing their best who's doing their best

94
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,839
who have done their best

95
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:09,760
maybe you've been a taskmaster for this friend keep performing

96
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,480
cracking the whip greeting greeting this dear friend

97
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:29,200
who's been doing this the best they can the best they can

98
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,959
in this moment given all the causes and

99
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839

breathing [Music]

103
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:23,120
appreciating that this body is breathing

104
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,639
doing it on its own thank you very much you don't need to force it or do

105
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,880
anything intentionally just loving

inviting this friend your body to relax to soften

110
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,639
it doesn't have to do anything right now

111
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,839
it's worked hard enough all day

112
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,639
as the breath is perceived one breath at a time

113

so the wish for health so much to explore here so much to explore

220
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:07,280
i feel like we've just scratched the surface and one invitation as i guided us in this

221
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:14,400
practice was to appreciate the body part by part we take ourselves

222
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:22,240
for granted the body works as hard as best as it can so many things

223
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,000
go right we notice when something goes wrong but so many things are going right to

224
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,440
appreciate and that's that's the sense of meta goodwill

225
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,920
friendliness for ourselves so i'd love to invite you

226
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,760

232
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,880
how much i've learned to co-create with my body this last year

233
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:34,640
um and all that we've been through together and and it really just hit me

234
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:41,200
um that i've stopped going to war with it and um

235
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:47,440
just how loyal like it's a miracle and it's um yeah it's tumbling so yeah it was

236
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,160
really really profound for me

237
00:41:53,520 --> 00:42:00,560
thanks sally i am so touched wow the way you put you know the way you put

238
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:06,559
it that you stopped going to war with it ah

239
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:16,640
that's powerful that realization that really that shift in attitude

240
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:24,160
wow yeah not going to war with our bodies oh

241
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:29,520
beautiful and it's so common of course we do we expect especially when we get sick

242
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:34,960
that's the that's the hardest time right it's like you've

243
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:41,599
why are you not performing why are you not getting better you have betrayed me or instead

of oh sweetheart oh you've been working so well this whole time thank you thank you and

245
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,560
i appreciate how the pandemic is there anything particularly about the pandemic

246
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:00,800
alley if you like to comment on that that has brought this shift as if there's any insight or wisdom

247
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,720
in that way you like to say another to comment on and if not

248

it's okay whoops there

249
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:20,960
um yeah i would say i hit um the rock bottom of

250
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:29,040
my life in just about every way and um their self-trust was built

251
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:36,640
because i had it was like i had nowhere else to go and and my my body was

252
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:43,520
there it was the only thing that was really there with me and knows what it was like to walk in my shoes and

253
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,880
um it's you know like when you really think about

254
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:54,400
all the things that you walk through in your life and

255
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:01,760
the body witnessing and holding and taking care in ways that we can't

256
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:10,559
in such micro and macro levels um [Music] yeah it's it's incredible

257
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:18,079
thanks ali that is profound and and how this wisdom also came from

258
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:25,680
so much suffering thank you thank you for sharing

259
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,920
claire

260
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:39,040
thank you um yeah i wanted i put my hand up when ali used the word

261
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,480
co-create because it brought a whole new perspective for me

262
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:50,079
and uh it reflects on my my own experience i happen to be

263
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:56,000
unusually healthy it's a great gift and but throughout my

264
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,160
life almost you know since like before i was a teenager i started to treat my body as though it

265
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:08,560
was a very special friend that i should be very loving toward i've always been good to it

266
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,920
um you know i'm tony i'm i'm now sugar-free alcohol-free

267
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,838
tobacco-free uh the only one i haven't beaten yet is caffeine

268
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:26,560
but you know you can see i was cycling tonight i work out um you know i do everything you know i

269
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:32,319
and i i've studied nutrition i take tons of vitamins i mean i really i

270
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:38,319
i treat it like it's special beautiful i need it beautiful i

271
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:46,319
definitely co-created i i know i need it and i'm so i'm really good to it i love that and it works and we're

272
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:51,920

275
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:10,720
jerry says it's helped to recognize the in inherent negativity bias of focusing on

276
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:18,319
one or more aspects of the body that are not working the best rather than being grateful for all the parts

277
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:24,400
of the rest of the body working so you get a more wholesome perspective yeah thank you for that yeah thank you for

278
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:30,480
that absolutely and sp on youtube says so refreshing to get windows of meta

279
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:37,520
through the set i've been swept away often in afflictive states and feel far from brahmavihara is

280
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:43,520
really longing to abide in meta and wisdom thank you sp thank you so much for that so
