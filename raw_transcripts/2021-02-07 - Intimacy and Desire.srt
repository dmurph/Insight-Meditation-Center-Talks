1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:04,960
so

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,880
what i'd like to consider and explore

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,679
for this talk

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,920
is some aspects of desire

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,760
as i've said before i think that

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,599
the more proper term for

7
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,880
human beings would be human

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,078
desiring because their

9
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,559
desire is part and parcel and intimately

10
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,399
connected to human life and

11
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,960
there's no life human life without

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,239
desire

13
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:41,600
that we're going to supposed to get rid

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,840
of desire have no desires

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,800
is unrealistic

16
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,960
but to become wise about desire

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,920
is one of the tasks of buddhism and to

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,680
learn how to be free

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,160
of desires free from the desires not

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,440
that they're gone

21
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,920
but we're not caught in them and we have

22
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,439
freedom in relationship to them

23
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,000
and

24
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,840
so the um

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,920
so in order to become wise about desire

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,840
it helps to become intimate with desire

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,840
and as i said a little while ago that if

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,680
you want wisdom

29
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,880
cultivate intimacy and there's some

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,960
something some aspect of intimacy some

31
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,640
way of being intimate

32
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,360
that touches in and it brings us to the

33
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,040
place where wisdom has a chance to

34
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,960
operate

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,560
and so if you want to be wise about

36
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,840
desire be intimate with desire

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,040
and to explore this topic i want to talk

38
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,640
about a

39
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,759
subclass of

40
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,600
mental movements in the family of desire

41
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,240
and that uh and start talking about the

42
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,719
outermost

43
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,319
the most abstract abstract in a sense to

44
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,080
that which gets closer and closer to

45
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,680
something that's more and more intimate

46
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,120
inside

47
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,200
and so perhaps this talk it would be a

48
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,959
little bit of a journey

49
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,160
from uh outward to inward to what's

50
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,120
innermost

51
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,760
so maybe you'll follow along and maybe

52
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,560
you can

53
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,280
imagine or feel what i'm talking about

54
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,360
and how it works for you

55
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,519
giving me a little bit of the maybe the

56
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,640
benefit of the doubt

57
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,200
or a little bit of the

58
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,760
focusing on what i say that might be

59
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,120
relevant for you or what you

60
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,959
can identify with or recognizing

61
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,239
yourself

62
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,840
and certainly some of the things i say

63
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,840
you might

64
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,599
have aspects of it that you disagree

65
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,920
with but on this journey it might be

66
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,200
better for now

67
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
to just kind of find recognizing

68
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,400
yourself oh yeah i know

69
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,319
that this way

70
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,680
so uh this journey in exploring desire

71
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,040
has to do with three parts it has to do

72
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,200
with

73
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,319
what we desire

74
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,480
what and why we desire and how we desire

75
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,519
so what what why and how

76
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,040
and and so

77
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,440
the aspect of this is to have a goal

78
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,360
desires usually have a goal something we

79
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,879
want something we want to accomplish

80
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,959
something we want to

81
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,640
do and and goal having a goal is an

82
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,879
important part of life

83
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,120
and people have all kinds of goals that

84
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,280
they want to accomplish

85
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,720
but a goal in my vocabulary

86
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,159
is a what it's the the purpose of the

87
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:54,799
desire

88
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:57,040
it's the what what we want to get what

89
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,640
we want to see happen

90
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,519
we use the word what to describe what is

91
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,599
the goal

92
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,959
you might ask them and what is what is

93
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,360
the purpose or what's the goal

94
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,680
and um so for example

95
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,560
you as i did this morning you might go

96
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,519
shopping for

97
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,280
a relative for food and

98
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,720
the goal was to go shopping and

99
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,120
so you know what are you up to i'm going

100
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,960
shopping i'm going to the store

101
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,400
and in fact i was able to go to the

102
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,040
store and buy what i needed to do

103
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,560
and so i accomplished the goal

104
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,240
and um but you know that's the it's the

105
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,560
talking about it that way it's somewhat

106
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,080
removed for me

107
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,560
it's somewhat abstract it's outside of

108
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,280
me

109
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,320
shopping is outside of me in a sense

110
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,639
the goal buying something for my my

111
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,000
relative is a

112
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,240
you know it's a worthy goal but it's

113
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,520
kind of you don't really learn anything

114
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,400
about myself

115
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,560
except that i was going to do this task

116
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,919
and so we can also ask um why am i doing

117
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,360
it

118
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,800
and so uh the why

119
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,440
has to do with a purpose and when we

120
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,800
start talking about purpose we're

121
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,160
talking about something that's maybe a

122
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,280
little bit closer in

123
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,759
more intimate more integral to who we

124
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,560
are

125
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,720
than just the goal and um

126
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,120
and so the purpose maybe for going

127
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,160
shopping

128
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,440
was uh when my relative is sick and i

129
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,120
needed to i wanted to get

130
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
i was asked to get something to support

131
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,800
her uh in her

132
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,240
time of illness and so uh the purpose

133
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,880
was

134
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,240
to support and offer aid to a relative

135
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,639
who

136
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,840
is ill and um so

137
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,400
uh so you would if i just said that my

138
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,639
you know purpose was to go buy

139
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,360
x y and z you wouldn't uh you know

140
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,400
that's the goal

141
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,520
you wouldn't really understand the

142
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,440
purpose but you know the purpose oh now

143
00:05:59,440 --> 00:05:59,919
we're

144
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,240
understanding something about maybe what

145
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,759
does motivating gil

146
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,960
and what's happening here and

147
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,440
and then you could ask deeper but why

148
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,880
are you doing that

149
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,080
and you keep asking the question why and

150
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,840
in a certain kind of way that goes

151
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,400
through layers and layers inside

152
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,240
you can ask well why are you doing that

153
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,240
oh because i care for my relative i love

154
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,759
my relative

155
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,600
um and uh and so it's out of my care

156
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,400
that's that's why i'm doing it and so

157
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,680
now you know something a little

158
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,360
deeper about me or you're kind of going

159
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,919
in closer and closer

160
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,960
in and so you could ask what's the

161
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,400
purpose

162
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,919
and it's really useful not to

163
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,960
answer it with just one answer

164
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,000
if you have a desire to ask what is the

165
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,759
purpose of why i want to say what i'm

166
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,039
going to say

167
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,880
why i want to say what i want to say or

168
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,639
what's the purpose of this activity i'm

169
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,720
doing what's the purpose of

170
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,520
this way of thinking how often do you

171
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,599
ask yourself

172
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,080
why am i thinking this way what purpose

173
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,319
does it fulfill

174
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,720
and then even if you get an answer one

175
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,599
answer

176
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,720
ask again ask again because there might

177
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,639
be multiple reasons

178
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,280
uh multiple motivations inside purposes

179
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,000
we're trying to accomplish

180
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,720
and um and then or you might ask more of

181
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,240
a secondary one you might have one

182
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,880
answer

183
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,880
i'm you know why why are you shopping

184
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,199
because i'm shopping in order to support

185
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,319
a relative

186
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,479
but why you want to support a relative

187
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,080
because i care for the relative the

188
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,520
relative is sick

189
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,840
and and you know and why do you care for

190
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,039
a relative and why do you want to

191
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,639
support a relative

192
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,560
because it just it's the kind of

193
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,680
heartfelt wish

194
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,720
of course i would do that and uh

195
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
and so you keep asking and you can get

196
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,400
kind of deeper and deeper questions it

197
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,840
takes you on a journey

198
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,360
can take your journey to be something

199
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,840
more intimate and deeper

200
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,840
and just have the logical answers being

201
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,520
the only answer

202
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,080
the first answer only one it might miss

203
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,478
something

204
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,599
of the bigger picture or the intimate

205
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,160
picture

206
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,440
or something of what's going on

207
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,080
so that there's the purpose and then

208
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,919
deeper than the purpose

209
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,919
there is um the how are we

210
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,759
how are we when we're doing something

211
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,759
and the question how

212
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,440
um implies i think always brings us into

213
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,320
the at least

214
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,120
my vocabulary in this question always

215
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,399
brings us into the

216
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,760
the activity itself the

217
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,200
you know kind of like into the present

218
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,000
moment the action how we're doing it

219
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,120
is how we embody it how we go forth with

220
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:47,920
it

221
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,320
and where its purpose is little bits you

222
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,440
know abstract

223
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,600
a little bit removed from you know can

224
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,040
be a little bit removed from something

225
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,240
it's inner

226
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,440
but when you talked about how it it kind

227
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,519
of really comes closer

228
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,800
and um and so

229
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,720
how am i doing it am i doing it in a

230
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,880
hurry am i doing it slowly

231
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,000
am i doing it with resentment am i doing

232
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,560
it with

233
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,920
delight and joy with generosity

234
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,279
how are we doing it and

235
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,880
and are you doing it in you know

236
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,640
trying to do the minimum you can or

237
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,880
you're trying to do more than you can

238
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,080
so there's all these questions about how

239
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,360
and uh and so how do i go to the store

240
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,000
in the morning to go shopping

241
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,880
so part of it is with care part of it

242
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,320
with certain delight it was early in the

243
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:40,800
morning

244
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,600
and and it was kind of quiet and calm

245
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,279
time to be going

246
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,040
and it was also um i was going with

247
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,760
with the feeling of you know a certain

248
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,320
kind of

249
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,720
good feeling about knowing that i could

250
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,440
do something

251
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,240
for my relative and was happy to do so

252
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,200
so

253
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,920
and then um and then being in the store

254
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,880
and uh

255
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,880
a few other shoppers there there was the

256
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,640
clerk there early enough there was just

257
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,680
one

258
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,680
and um and uh and how i was there

259
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,320
i was not being there with you know you

260
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:14,720
know

261
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,560
trying to be have a human connection

262
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,480
with the person at the counter in spite

263
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,200
of the masks that we were wearing and

264
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,959
and um and uh

265
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,200
you know so how was you know trying to

266
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,000
be

267
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,839
friendly trying to have good will trying

268
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:31,040
to be connected

269
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,160
to the whole situation that was in and

270
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,200
so how but how goes deeper and deeper

271
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,399
you know so really how were you this way

272
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:40,880
how are you

273
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,480
that way and and now we come what's

274
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,839
deeper in uh

275
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,320
maybe than uh the question you know

276
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,000
related to how

277
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,440
is the attitudes that we have so

278
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,200
you know i could have done something how

279
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,519
i could have done fast or slow

280
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,320
but then how i did it the what attitude

281
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,240
went with going as fast maybe it was

282
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,920
the attitude of being fast was that i

283
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,360
was impatient

284
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,320
maybe the attitude of was i was overly

285
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,160
eager i really wanted to do something so

286
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,760
i'm really rushing because of my strong

287
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,560
desire maybe even greed

288
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,399
or maybe i'm slow because i just really

289
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,480
enjoy it i like being present and being

290
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,000
in the experience fully

291
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,160
or maybe i'm slow because i resent doing

292
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,120
it

293
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,360
and uh and you hesitate and i'm not

294
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,160
really

295
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,920
putting myself into it i'm dragging my

296
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,720
feet so there's attitudes that

297
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,640
now attitudes were coming in more

298
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,240
intimate more closer down

299
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,959
deeper down what are the attitudes we

300
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,440
carry what is the mood of the mind

301
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
what's the attitude that the heart has

302
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,200
the mind has

303
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,360
and are those attitudes attitudes of the

304
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,800
moment

305
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,920
or are they part of our

306
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,519
character part of how we've cultivated

307
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,120
and how we live the

308
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,600
the patterns of mind and thought and

309
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,920
beliefs and emotions

310
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,639
that characterize how we've chosen to

311
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,040
live our life

312
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,560
and and different from personality

313
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,000
which maybe we don't have much choice

314
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,480
about that but character

315
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
we have some choice and it's been shaped

316
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,639
by either by society and events and

317
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,320
experiences of our life

318
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,160
but also it's been shaped but that all

319
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,720
that small and big choices we've made

320
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,880
about what kind of thoughts to emphasize

321
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,800
what kind of desires to emphasize what

322
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,120
kind of ill will to emphasize

323
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,880
what the habits are that we're building

324
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,680
up of behavior and ways of being

325
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,880
and these all contribute to ongoing

326
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,040
attitudes that we carry with us

327
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,880
and so now we're talking about something

328
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,880
that can be really deep

329
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,560
and these attitudes sometimes can be

330
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,279
subliminal or not obvious to us

331
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,639
all the time they can start becoming

332
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,480
invisible to us because we carry them

333
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,160
with them all the time

334
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,079
but to sit in meditation and get quiet

335
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,240
and start seeing when i get quiet and

336
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,079
intimate with myself

337
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,000
what in some deeper way are the

338
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,560
underlying deeper attitudes

339
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,519
that are operating for me and how might

340
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,200
those attitudes

341
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,160
relate to the desires i have and how i

342
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,880
pursue those desires

343
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,000
and the deeper deeper we go in buddhism

344
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,320
and you might not agree with this but in

345
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,839
buddhism it's considered to be

346
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,440
three fundamental unhelpful

347
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,120
unwholesome roots for our attitudes

348
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,079
and three wholesome ones and all

349
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,680
wholesome beneficial

350
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,959
impulses come out of these three roots

351
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,199
the wholesome roots and all the things

352
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,480
which are unhelpful

353
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,279
harmful that we do for others or things

354
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,320
that are unhealthy

355
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,160
derived from these three unwholesome

356
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,000
roots

357
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,880
the unwholesome roots is usually

358
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,760
translated in

359
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,959
english as either craving or

360
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,320
greed some occasionally it's a strong

361
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,079
another word in pali that

362
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,120
maybe is closer to lust

363
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,920
but the strong desire com you know that

364
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,560
somehow there's a contraction there's a

365
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,760
loss of freedom in the movement

366
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,199
it's kind of unwholesome there's some

367
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,959
kind of maybe selfishness involved

368
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,160
connected to it maybe there's an

369
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
overriding of wisdom that goes into it

370
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,360
with greed

371
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,399
and so the other

372
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,480
unwholesome root is

373
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,519
ill will and often in english we say the

374
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,560
word aversion

375
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,560
for this but it could also be more

376
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,480
dramatic it could be hostility

377
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,600
so it's very mild or can be very strong

378
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,199
and but there can be an underlying

379
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,639
momentum movement

380
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,839
attitude mood of aversion of hostility

381
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:54,720
of pushing away

382
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,480
not wanting that if that's the seed the

383
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,079
root for behavior

384
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,680
it tends to be a behavior which

385
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,440
expresses that it will in

386
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,160
in forms of hostility and and causes all

387
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,519
kinds of difficulty

388
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,600
and that can be towards oneself or

389
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,639
towards others and the third

390
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,839
unwholesome attitude is

391
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,760
a root attitude is delusion confusion

392
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,079
where we're just confused in a sea of

393
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,399
not knowing and doubt and uncertainty

394
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:25,600
and

395
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,839
not making sense of things and jumping

396
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,360
around in different ideas

397
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,720
and not settling on anything and uh

398
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,440
when there's confusion and delusion then

399
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,800
it's easier for greed

400
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,839
we're not connected to wisdom uh there's

401
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,440
no wisdom in that

402
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,120
no clarity and so that tends to then

403
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,519
support more greed and more ill will

404
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,800
the healthy attitudes and

405
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,560
our generosity

406
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,160
good will and wisdom and so

407
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,279
generosity is this a feeling that

408
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,480
that openness and availability and

409
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,040
open-handedness open-heartedness that's

410
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,560
a spirit of kind of

411
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,279
being both open to the world around us

412
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,560
but also

413
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,720
um i want to use the word manifest

414
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,040
a manifesting actualizing for them

415
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,800
something for the world

416
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
it's a movement which is connected to

417
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,839
wisdom

418
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,839
and makes room for wisdom a closed hand

419
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,480
is not open to experience something in

420
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,000
the palm of the hand

421
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,839
but if we open the pan then we can

422
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,199
experience something

423
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,759
in the palm now it can be stroked by

424
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,880
someone for example

425
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,279
we can clean the palm we can't clean it

426
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,800
if it's closed

427
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,360
so same thing with the heart or the mind

428
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,440
with greed something closes down with

429
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,839
generosity something opens

430
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,240
and it's available for wisdom available

431
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,959
to be cleaned

432
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,959
and then good will

433
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,160
instead of ill will is uh

434
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,000
also this opening movement something

435
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,600
that liberates us

436
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,240
it frees something inside it frees us

437
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,640
from the contraction the closeness

438
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,839
of of

439
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,240
of uh what goes on for us

440
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,319
so uh i got distracted because i saw

441
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,079
this somewhere there was no bell i guess

442
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:29,520
i didn't bring the belt and the sitting

443
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
did i

444
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,799
so maybe no bell no

445
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,840
end and uh

446
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,280
so um so ill so

447
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,000
good will and then wisdom and wisdom

448
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,039
also itself is an

449
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,039
opening movement because one of the

450
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,960
primary forms of wisdom

451
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,640
is not the wisdom

452
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,799
of not clinging the wisdom of not

453
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,640
suffering

454
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,640
wisdom of non-harming

455
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,280
so um these are think of these as

456
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,960
attitudes then

457
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,400
do we go about with an attitude of

458
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,360
generosity an attitude of goodwill an

459
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,240
attitude

460
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,080
of wisdom attitude of discernment of

461
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,840
seeing clearly

462
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,320
or do we have an attitude that somehow

463
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:20,960
closes

464
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,640
wisdom limits wisdom and so is it greed

465
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,240
is it ill will

466
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,679
is it delusion and uh

467
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,960
and so or is it fear that somehow is

468
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,720
connected to those three

469
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,480
it's fascinating that fear that's

470
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,760
unhealthy

471
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,919
has is considered because has to be

472
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,160
rooted in either greed ill will or

473
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,520
delusion

474
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,679
so how does that work and is there a

475
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,960
different kind of fear

476
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,440
that's rooted in generosity and good

477
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,240
will

478
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,520
or love and wisdom i think there is

479
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,600
that's why fear doesn't fit in either it

480
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,840
doesn't it's not placed in just one

481
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,080
or the other it's just the unwholesome

482
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,520
or just a wholesome but

483
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,520
it depends on the roots that support the

484
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,840
fear

485
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,840
so attitude so so

486
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,559
attitude is more intimate than the goal

487
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,039
attitude brings us into something close

488
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:19,200
in to what's innermost and what makes us

489
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,799
tick and what influences us

490
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,120
and influences how we see the world and

491
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
how we see ourselves

492
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,760
and to sit in meditation or other ways

493
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,679
of beginning to find

494
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,760
no deep you know being defined

495
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,400
the underlying attitudes dispositions in

496
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,320
which we operate in

497
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,160
and to learn how to not be caught by

498
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,880
them

499
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,960
not because not be limited by them not

500
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,200
be closed by the unhealthy ones

501
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,640
beginning to open and open and open

502
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,400
and my sense is that the unwholesome

503
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,200
roots

504
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,440
of greed hate and delusion they

505
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,799
themselves

506
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,919
are not what's most innermost they

507
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,360
themselves are a little bit

508
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,720
more surfacy and as those

509
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,440
fall away and as we keep opening

510
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,520
generosity

511
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,200
love good will and wisdom

512
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,240
they belong to

513
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,559
that which is most innermost most

514
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,240
sensitive maybe most shy

515
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,600
at times most tender most

516
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,200
uh maybe most quiet and so it's only by

517
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,280
getting quiet or settled or

518
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,600
intimate and willing to have a certain

519
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,960
tenderness

520
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,600
that these generosity and ill and good

521
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,480
will

522
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,200
and wisdom really can shine and be part

523
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,760
of our life

524
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,720
so certainly we can have goals we can

525
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,960
have purposes

526
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,640
we can focus on how we are

527
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,760
but don't get don't be too caught up in

528
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,120
the goal

529
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,880
don't be too caught up in the purposes

530
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,919
pay attention to how you do things

531
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,760
it's a huge key and important part of

532
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,280
mindfulness practice

533
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,320
and as you pay attention to the how at

534
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,000
some point come in and really

535
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,880
begin discerning what are the underlying

536
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,960
the deeper attitudes

537
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,679
which are fueling or

538
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,880
influencing how we're going about our

539
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,120
life

540
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,400
and there in those attitudes is where

541
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,360
you can start discovering freedom

542
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,640
it's when the attitudes become free

543
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,799
then the desires that flow for them are

544
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:39,919
free is all

545
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,679
as well and we become free

546
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,880
so that when we have desires

547
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,159
of generosity of goodwill and wisdom

548
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:54,799
then hopefully then we have a sense of

549
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,600
how to remain

550
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,960
free with those

551
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,240
for our attitudes to contain

552
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,760
freedom so our desires

553
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,600
can be free so that our purposes

554
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,080
can have qualities of freedom and their

555
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,559
goals can be

556
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,880
intimately involved with freedom as well

557
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,720
so i hope that this has given you

558
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,640
something to think about and explore in

559
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,760
yourself and

560
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,760
some questions to ask yourself as you go

561
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,960
about

562
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,799
questions about why

563
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,200
what of why and how

564
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,760
and take the how question and go as deep

565
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,600
in as you can that you come to your

566
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,799
you can see if you can find the

567
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:46,240
underlying deeper attitudes dispositions

568
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,440
that um animate your life

569
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,399
and see if you can

570
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,080
switch to be more and more

571
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,799
have those attitudes be the wholesome

572
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,120
roots

573
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,880
may that journey of exploration

574
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,880
be empowering and freeing for you

575
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,960
thank you
