1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:07,120
so hello and

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,559
uh at the moment I'm imagining that all of you who

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:20,560
are present here for our YouTube

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,640
meditation is welcoming each other we're all welcoming each other we're all

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,800
greeting each other and appreciating the

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:38,440
shared companionship to the degree to the degree to which doing the same thing at

7
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,960
the same time um and

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:52,760
uh and sharing the same Focus here so thank you for being

9
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,399
here so um

10
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:13,159
one way or the other when we come to do meditation we are uh ascribing or

11
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:21,119
assigning some meaning to what we're doing some uh sense of purpose some

12
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:30,680
sense of uh values of what it's for some sense of um the um

13
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,880
uh context of it in our wider life some way in which it serves kind of maybe

14
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:43,360
ultimate values we have religious values spiritual values all kinds of ways in which are there on the edges or at the

15
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,000
center of doing meditation and one of them is

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,560
um our values and some people clearly bring along

17
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:03,560
values when they meditate maybe they that they've inherited from their society their family and some of them

18
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,200
are deeply unconscious as just matter of fact and some of them evolve and develop

19
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,319
in the course of meditation practice engagement with Buddhism that we acquire

20
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:22,120
new values so whether it's an old value or a new value one of the central values for

21
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:30,000
Buddhism and I would propose for people who mature in this practice of meditation

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,920
is non-harming that uh there's a very

23
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:46,080
thoroughgoing uh devotion interest sensitivity to living a life of not

24
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,280
harming at all and often that idea is attributed to

25
00:02:52,280 --> 00:03:00,519
is assigned to the idea of not harming anything outside of ourselves other people the world

26
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:05,640
and um and that's true but in

27
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:11,720
meditation the primary care around not harming is not

28
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,920
harming oneself and what we learn about not

29
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:24,120
harming ourselves uh through meditation um is um

30
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:31,080
directly applicable to how we live that life in the world around us that uh the

31
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:38,560
very things that we do that cause harm to ourselves are one way or the other a

32
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,560
a uh support for uh that spilling out onto others in the

33
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,799
world so to sit and meditate where there's care

34
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:58,680
given that we don't harm ourselves and that takes the form of not

35
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:06,439
criticizing ourselves not being upset or angry with ourselves but of course we will be

36
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:11,840
sometimes the uh very significant part of this

37
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,840
practice is to appreciate the degree to which you don't have to take

38
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,400
responsibility for the particular impulses thoughts feelings when they first

39
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:30,880
appear what we take responsibility for is how then we

40
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,440
respond to them react to them so if there is

41
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,199
a hostile thought that arises in the mind maybe hostile towards

42
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:51,440
oneself the teachings of not taking it personally just that's what the mind is doing don't Define ourselves by

43
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,440
it but in the wake of it what is a non-harming thing to

44
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,440
do not be hostile towards hostility not to hostile to ourselves not to pull away

45
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:10,840
and shut down and give up and all kinds of things that we

46
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:16,800
do what is the non-harming thing that can be done in this practice is simply

47
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,919
to see it clearly with kindness and if kindness is too much

48
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:30,840
just to see it clearly so

49
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:39,120
for whatever arises in this meditation when it first

50
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:47,319
arises let it be known and in that knowing practice

51
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:53,319
nonharming radical non-harming as you sit here and

52
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:59,639
practice so to begin with a upright

53
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:08,520
or maybe say it differently for those of you who don't sit upright uh a dignified

54
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:16,120
posture something about how you dispose your body the posture of

55
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,639
your body is to

56
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:30,560
um kind of embodies your dignity your value

57
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,000
your

58
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:42,599
importance maybe in a way that lets your chest avoid collapsing

59
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:46,240
or crunching

60
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:59,199
up a way in which your neck is a little bit straightened and

61
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,840
and gently close the

62
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,319
eyes and

63
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,360
feeling the contact with

64
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,440
whatever supports your

65
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:48,680
weight and almost as if the inhale begins there taking a few long slow deep

66
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,680
breaths

67
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:16,759
if you want to get a little more benefit from taking these initial deep breaths calmly count to five on the

68
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,080
inhale count to five on the

69
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,879
exhale to have your inhale be that long

70
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:01,440
and then letting your breathing return to normal letting go of

71
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,399
counting and sitting here

72
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,560
quietly devotedly to being present with your

73
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:25,880
mindfulness present with the breathing and devoted towards to

74
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,360
nonharming not responding to anything

75
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,760
in ways that cause harm an

76
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:43,880
attitude motivation

77
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:51,800
belief and if you do let

78
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:56,560
go the best you can

79
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:12,480
and perhaps your

80
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:22,360
mindfulness is a nonharming

81
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,320
wind that blows gently on whatever it is you're aware

82
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
of

83
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240

84

for

102
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,559
e for

103
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,520
somewhat like a pebble being dropped into a quiet

104
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:48,480
Lake and the Ripple spread out throughout the lake so I drop the concept of

105
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:56,640
nonharming into you and let the ripples of

106
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,120
nonharming spread out to touch all of Who You

107
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
Are

108
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

109
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
e e

110
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
for e

111
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:42,559
and then as we come to the end of this

112
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:49,159
sitting to turn our attention to how we will be living our

113
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:56,960
life the next day or so and independent of all the things or

114
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:05,640
the few things that we'll be doing if all we

115
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:13,919
do is to live a life dedicated to

116
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:22,679
nonharming that would be enough you don't have to be kind you

117
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:28,360
don't have to be compassionate and loving

118
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,480
you don't have to wish everyone

119
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:42,880
well but a radical non-harming to become for someone

120
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:49,679
everyone else become someone who is safe someone who for whom no one needs

121
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:56,360
to fear no one

122
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:04,840
feels aggression or or assertion dominance no one receives

123
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:08,159
judgments

124
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:21,159
Prejudice everyone is seen through eyes rooted in not causing any

125
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:30,039
harm inwardly and outwardly just this

126
00:28:31,399 --> 00:28:35,519
is one of the greatest ways of living a

127
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,158
life may it be that on this next

128
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:50,840
day whatever benefit we receive from this meditation from our practice from

129
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:57,600
being mindful may it serve

130
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:06,080
to support being in this world in a nonharming

131
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,440
way may all beings benefit from

132
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,960
our harmlessness

133
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:28,829
[Music]

134
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:36,229
[Music]

135
00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:48,600
thank you so the topic for this week has to do

136
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,799
with the meaning that meditation has for

137
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:59,279
us and I know some people like myself at one point were

138
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:05,000
a little bit allergic to the idea of meaning but as I've come to understand

139
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:13,320
the word that uh it's really a broad word that covers a lot of ways in which we

140
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:21,000
assign purpose assign roles assign functions

141
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:27,360
assign value assign um all these things to the

142
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:36,279
activities of of Our Lives to the events of Our Lives that uh how we understand it in or

143
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:44,320
interpret it in the context of our life story context of our society context of

144
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,640
our beliefs and um and there there's you

145
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:59,120
kind of no shortage of the many many ways in which we one way or the other

146
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:06,720
assign some interpretation to the meditation we're doing so this week we're try to bring

147
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:14,519
some of that out and have you be more reflective about it in a way that would help your meditation both in that it would help

148
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:21,279
you uh not get caught up in assigned meanings that are not useful for you get

149
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:28,760
in the way and but also to recognize the useful ones are there to support to to give uh

150
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:33,880
buoyancy to give momentum to give strength to meditation as

151
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:42,799
well uh to help you stay focused in what you're doing so uh today the topic is uh the

152
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:48,320
values that we live by and the role connection that meditation might have

153
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,440
with those values and it's hard to imagine that there's people who have no values at all

154
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:01,320
no ethical values no sense of uh uh prioritizing certain attitudes to how

155
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:07,320
to be in the world and um the uh some of them might

156
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:13,799
be healthy and supportive of self and others and some of them might be harmful for self and

157
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:19,919
others and but how does meditation fit into it um it would be unfortunate for

158
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:26,760
someone who's a thief who feels that it's fine to steal that's they have no problem with it and and in fact they

159
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:32,080
feel proud of their ability to steal uh and they assign the value

160
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:40,240
importance of meditation has for them is it centers them calms them down so that they can do their profession effectively

161
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:47,679
that would be quite sad because of the harm that that does but someone who um is a uh

162
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,960
caregiver for example and the value is to give the best care to someone in a

163
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,039
medical setting or any kind of setting and for them meditation has the value of

164
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:04,080
doing the same of grounding them centering them um preparing them for the

165
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:12,200
best so that the best of them can be present with wisdom and Clarity for caring for the their people in their

166
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:18,039
care and so here where the values we have how we want to live are brought to

167
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:23,919
bear on meditation and meditation is used to serve that

168
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,960
purpose uh one of the uh one of things that really inspired me is people who

169
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:35,559
want to live honestly to really live you know without any lies any deceit any

170
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:41,039
just really want to have the truth be the Forefront and um and with that as a

171
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,720
value mindfulness can be really a support for that mindfulness is a is a

172
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,720
truthtaco

173
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,000
is that it's truth making someone else the values could be

174
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:10,040
harmlessness and so the function the meaning the purpose of meditation is to live a more harmless

175
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:15,200
life someone else their value is Enlightenment full complete total

176
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:23,040
Enlightenment and um and uh so for them the the value the purpose the functions

177
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:29,040
assigned to meditation is that this is going to support them to find a way to that enlight

178
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:38,440
M there can be multiple functions happening at the same time there can be you know meditation can be has uh can be

179
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:43,720
the same meditation can be done for different purposes it can be both for many purposes it can be for

180
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:50,040
truth-telling for de-stressing for coming with more groundedness to work

181
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:56,960
that we do to being on a path to Awakening so there's a these it's not like you're choosing one over the other

182
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:03,839
but to have some clarity about what's important maybe what's most important around the values we have and U and

183
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:11,720
maybe even picking and choosing between that things that are important for us uh to give so we can give emphasis uh

184
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:17,599
to one thing to do really well if we have too many values too many purposes

185
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,119
um everything gets watered down nothing really kind of takes root and and uh

186
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:30,280
flowers and sometimes in order to really do well we have to kind of choose this is what meditation is about this is what

187
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:37,960
I'm developing and doing here and have some clarity with it and what the benefit of that is that

188
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:45,040
no matter what the purpose is and the Really sense of getting behind it and having some dedication to it as

189
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:50,319
meditation deepens it kind of blossoms out into all these different dimensions

190
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:57,359
of our life so you might put aside certain things as the purpose value and

191
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,480
later data you you find that if it's a healthy purpose it returns in a whole

192
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:11,520
different way um it maybe be a little bit like someone who um uh you know moves to a

193
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:18,079
foreign country where they have a different language and really wants to be friends with everyone on the street

194
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,240
and uh goes around trying to be friends but can't speak the language at all and

195
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:29,760
um so they get dedicate themselves to learning the language and once it's learned they find that walking down the

196
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,280
street that um it's really easy to make these connections now because of shared

197
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:43,160
language so regardless of what the purpose is for meditation learning to meditate well uh opens up in such a

198
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:50,040
wonderful way to so many different things so um what are the values some

199
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:55,280
people live uh Center their life on the values that they have more than the

200
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:03,480
goals that they have the work that they have the the what they're trying to do in their life and um it's some people

201
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:11,040
how they live is more important than what they do and I think that in Buddhist practice I think that uh we

202
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:17,800
emphasize much more the how than the what that whatever what meditation is is

203
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:24,319
for the way to it is by caring really carefully for the how we

204
00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:29,920
are uh that we're not living a harmful way that we're doing what's beneficial

205
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:35,760
that we're learning to be at peace and relaxed nonattached learning to be kind and

206
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,319
supportive learning to have be have care to what we do learning to be honest in

207
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:46,760
all ways learning to um let go so so

208
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:52,599
many different things that so that we can be at ease have equinity be at peace

209
00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:59,119
here and now some people uh lives is the value

210
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,200
they have is to be of service to live a life of generosity and

211
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:11,000
support and so then meditation serves that purpose for them for some people

212
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,640
it's to live a life of uh of um of really practicing Dharma for its own

213
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:24,720
sake and the result of that they want to live a life of service so all these things kind

214
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:31,520
shifting and changing in fact over a lifetime time of practice um that uh it's fascinating to

215
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:39,200
see how the uh what the interfaces between meditation and the way we live our lives

216
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:45,680
the purpose the values we have um what we emphasize as being important the

217
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:51,520
assign assigning of meaning assigning of importance of functions uh to meditation

218
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:58,400
into our life and back and forth and it shifts and changes in a dynamic way and

219
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:05,040
um and to hold on to any one way any one purpose any one meaning for what

220
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:11,240
meditation is um uh sooner or later we'll get all bottled up get kind of

221
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:16,800
limited and come to a dead end and um but rather they keep opening up keep

222
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,760
kind of uh looking and feeling and sensing all the different ways and

223
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:29,200
functions and meanings and purposes that um evolve evve over the years of

224
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:36,200
practicing more and more and and it's like it's like a dynamic stuff that happens it's

225
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:41,440
like um I don't know it's like

226
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,079
um um having a good friend and over the

227
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:53,760
years the Friendship shifts and changes as the the friend the the two of you

228
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,240
change and shift and um but somehow you stay connected and involved and things

229
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:06,280
flow back and forth and change and unfold and and U but because of the commitment to stay present and stay

230
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,359
connected that uh it's um it uh you all

231
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:17,800
change together so the same thing with meditation so to understand some of the

232
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:24,200
values that you live by and that come into bear on meditation uh and some of them you know

233
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,960
are you know and then see how they shift and change and one of the way they change is they

234
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:36,960
move sometimes we discover through meditation that some of the values some of the assigned purposes some of the

235
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,160
attitudes we have about meditation don't work that they're actually harmful for

236
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:49,880
us straining uh in meditation being attached to states of mind that we're

237
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:57,079
going to attain uh holding on to calm holding on to Bliss that might be there

238
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:03,839
the these are all these these kind of holding on and wanting and overvaluing particular states of Mind are kind of a

239
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:10,079
dead end they're not really that helpful and uh so if value is it's all

240
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:16,760
about attaining a state it's all about having you know some wonderful experience so that I can just add it to

241
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:21,839
my repertoire of wonderful experiences um that doesn't that's kind

242
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:27,400
of a dead end to go to attain to experience the full potential of medit

243
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:34,200
ation can be about if there's a lot of conceit involved in meditation and the assigned

244
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:40,599
meaning is that is has to do with I'm going to be the you know the best

245
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:47,240
meditator on my block and everyone will like me and accolades so how wonderful I am because I'm such a wonderful

246
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:53,119
meditator or if I meditate well then my meditation teacher will praise me and

247
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:58,520
put me up on a pedestal and will be happy ever after so so those kinds of

248
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:04,440
assigning of meaning assigning of purpose assigning of function um uh are

249
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:09,599
dead ends and they'll just you know end up kind of knocking your head against

250
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:17,480
that dead end until you know you go find a different way so to look deeply what

251
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:23,119
is the meaning of meditation what's the function what's its purpose for me so

252
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,160
here's an exercise I'd recommend that you do for these next 24 hours until we

253
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,599
meet again and that is uh you know uh with a

254
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:42,760
paper or with a computer um uh write the the

255
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:49,920
words meditation means for for me meditation

256
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:58,839
means and then fill in the rest of it and do that 100

257
00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:06,559
times and every time write something different and U so I know I would have

258
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:11,960
some years ago many years ago I would have um May I would have written down

259
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,280
meditation means nothing you know was kind of would have dismissed the whole

260
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,720
exercise but then because it's a hundred different times you have to kind of keep

261
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:28,960
going um and uh meditation means means that

262
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,760
um I I sit on my cushion meditation means that I sit early in the morning

263
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:41,520
you can say kind of physical things like that but does that really get to your heart does it really get to some deeper

264
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,760
thing and just kind of keep writing keep writing 100 times for me meditation

265
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:56,839
means and after a while you can drop there for me but that's the idea behind it and see what you discover and um and

266
00:43:56,839 --> 00:44:04,760
uh stretch yourself it doesn't have to be all at one sitting to do all 10 in one time but maybe over the 24 hours you

267
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,960
can write down a 100 uh fill in that sentence 100

268
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:18,160
times so thank you very much and um I hope that um the exercise is enjoyable

269
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:26,160
and and useful for you and then we'll finish the series tomorrow thank you
