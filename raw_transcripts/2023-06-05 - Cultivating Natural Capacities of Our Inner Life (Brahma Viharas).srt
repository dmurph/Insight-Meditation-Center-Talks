1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:08,519
all right so I'm gonna take a breath then I invite you to do the same

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:14,820
kind of find your your groundedness in your body

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:21,600
feel yourself resting into the chair the cushion

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,100
giving your weight to the support it's here for you

5
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,840
and just check in with your system your nervous system your sense of ease and

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,180
maybe Orient to your location IMC

7
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,539
right feel free to peek if you need to look around and help your mind kind of come

8
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,960
into this moment this space right here help it kind of bring this

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,280
energy this location here here now

10
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:11,700
I'm taking some yeah deeper breaths so let's lift the shoulders if you wish

11
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:19,080
toward the ears and then roll them back and even bring the elbows toward each other so we want to have the curve and

12
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,320
the spine and then push the elbows down toward the hips

13
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:31,500
and this helps us engage the diaphragm and breathing opens the chest so we can

14
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,960
more naturally take a fuller deeper breath

15
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,960
it's at the start of the meditation I often do these things including these

16
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,240
intentional deeper breaths to help my body

17
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:02,220
my nervous system shift into a space of more ease well-being

18
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:17,599
so I'll just allow a little bit of Silence here and then I'll begin the guided practice

19
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,299
foreign

20
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:41,099
a guided visualization but I want you to know that you can translate the visual

21
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:46,200
into any way that your mind imagines

22
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,599
connects also invite you to shift and change any

23
00:03:51,599 --> 00:04:00,500
of the scenery or the words so that it resonates with your being

24
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,319
and feel free to tune me out as well

25
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,560
so we're preparing to go for a journey

26
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:31,100
and we have ourselves ready and we're at the edge of a nature

27
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,820
preserve a forest

28
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,940
and we have companions with us

29
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,560
and as you look around at these companions

30
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,520
you recognize softness

31
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,960
gentleness patience

32
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,780
attentiveness

33
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:21,080
when you think to yourself these are people I would like to have around me

34
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,380
and as you look up and out toward the path where you'll be walking

35
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,780
you notice that there is a richness a lushness

36
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,580
to the forest

37
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,860
and you all begin to walk together

38
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:11,479
there's plenty of room walking at a pace that feels comfortable

39
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:23,340
and you start to notice this feeling of

40
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:32,599
inner what is it bubbling Joy or

41
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:38,060
peace a sense of a heart lifting

42
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,880
the sense that we're going somewhere important

43
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:55,819
as we're walking and it just gets more and more beautiful

44
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:14,300
and the path is opening up ahead you can see more light more space

45
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:28,520
in a Gateway sort of a large arch of flowers and Vines

46
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:36,560
they're pink and purple

47
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,900
and every color you love the most

48
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,740
and as you approach the Gateway you see there's some words

49
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:09,919
and you see that the space and the words on the garden

50
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:18,080
say that they're dedicated the space is dedicated to the well-being and happiness of all

51
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:25,979
and as you walk in you can feel this clear

52
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:32,219
the way it's arranged the places to sit or rest

53
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:35,959
the shade and the Sun

54
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:03,480
and as you look around you understand that everyone here

55
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,519
is kin we are all connected

56
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:12,320
we all belong in this space

57
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,899
and we are all included

58
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:36,779
there's a feeling that this these wishes of well-being are rating radiating out

59
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:44,540
into the space into ourselves each other

60
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:54,060
her attention is warm and clear like the sun and water for all the

61
00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:00,779
plants here and we notice the feeling

62
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:04,220
and we dwell in it

63
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:09,560
we feel it's spreading

64
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,080
feeling safe

65
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:28,980
feeling happy healthy

66
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,560
and at ease

67
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,000
abiding here

68
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,079
and in the distance you hear a child

69
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,540
it was laughing and then it starts to cry

70
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:58,940
foreign as you hear the child cry you feel your heart

71
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,140
open caring

72
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:12,060
you can feel that you are

73
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:19,339
experiencing empathy for this child care

74
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:28,560
and you can see that her loving caregivers

75
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,620
are attending to her gently kindly

76
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,899
and it's soothing to you too to see this care offered

77
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:46,459
it soothes the heart

78
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:57,980
and you remember yourself as a child

79
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:06,480
moments of crying or difficulty and you see this little being and you

80
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,660
think to yourself oh I see you're suffering

81
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,000
I remember suffering that way too

82
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:24,079
just like you I suffer and just like me you suffer

83
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,540
may your pain and sorrow be eased dear one

84
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:46,579
and you rest knowing she's being cared for at ease

85
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:09,120
resting back the softness of the grass or the chair

86
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,720
you're in

87
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:22,820
taking in the smells the sounds of nature

88
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,420
you feel the warmth of the Sun

89
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,260
it's shining bright

90
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:59,060
right now

91
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,339
and then you hear the child and others giggling

92
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,240
happy and at play

93
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:33,860
and you just open your heart to This Joy rejoicing in their happiness

94
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,740
grateful for their happiness

95
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:58,079
it's like the sun is Illuminating and

96
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:04,399
brightening and supporting the joy

97
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:21,139
and you think to yourself and to this happiness I'm happy that you are happy

98
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,880
radiant Sunbeam of happiness

99
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,199
and Joy shared

100
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:05,339
and it's time to move on to another part of this beautiful

101
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:14,880
Forest and you prepare to stand and walk again

102
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:22,880
with your friends enjoying the scenery as you walk

103
00:17:23,699 --> 00:17:28,520
marveling at the sounds and the smells

104
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:52,760
you're feeling serene a sense of balance and ease

105
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,140
calm

106
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:13,460
and there's a clearing my head

107
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:21,960
looking out over a beautiful Valley with a

108
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:28,039
a mountain lake that's incredibly clear and bright

109
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:39,320
the scene is so calm so peaceful

110
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:53,419
breathing in I notice my body is calm

111
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,620
breathing out I notice my mind is calm

112
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:15,380
thank you I find a spot at the side of the lake

113
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:19,460
overlooking it just a bit

114
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:27,179
I find a comfortable posture

115
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:35,280
I feel like a mountain a bright

116
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:42,260
still steady strong committed to being here

117
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,179
and I sit

118
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:20,220
day turns to night night turns today it rains it Suns

119
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:27,140
and I sit unchanged still

120
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,660
foreign

121
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:26,160
all right it's really delightful to be here with

122
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:32,099
you and to see many faces and to know people are wearing masks that feel

123
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:37,880
comfortable wearing masks thank you for being here

124
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:44,780
so I want to talk about the Brahma baharas

125
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:51,720
and um you know I think the most important things that I wanna

126
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,820
I'm hoping to highlight as I make my way through this talk

127
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:03,780
are that the Brahma baharas are natural States they're natural States they arise

128
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:11,640
from within they don't need to be fabricated

129
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:17,700
they they are accessible and there are things that get in the way

130
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:23,240
and there are things that help connect with them

131
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:32,339
natural States things that get in the way are also gateways

132
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:38,099
to them and there are things that we can do to

133
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:45,599
support ourselves in accessing the states of loving kindness compassion sympathetic joy and

134
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,140
Equanimity these are the four Brahma baharas Heavenly abodes

135
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:04,020
so if you're not familiar with the role and the place of the brahmaharas in this

136
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:10,700
practice I'll share a little bit about that but they're um

137
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:21,240
I'll say first for myself that accessing loving-kindness compassion

138
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:29,160
sympathetic joy and equanimity it's sort of like a compass for me like

139
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:34,980
I'm no I notice in myself when I'm engaging or doing something a sort of

140
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:41,820
where's the heart how's the heart is there a sense of uplift and ease and

141
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:47,540
openness maybe Joy doesn't have to be Joy but just this sense of

142
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:53,700
there's space here the heart is free and that's sort of

143
00:38:53,700 --> 00:39:01,920
feedback for me about how what I'm thinking about doing or how I'm engaging so tuning in to this

144
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:08,040
inner compass that helps us recognize when we're sort of engaging in this

145
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,740
territory and by eating in this territory

146
00:39:13,859 --> 00:39:21,060
and and when I notice that the thoughts that I'm having the

147
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:28,520
feelings that I'm having the physical states that I'm having are quite the opposite

148
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:37,140
then recollecting these practices like one of my most favorite recent practices if I'm

149
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:42,800
noticing this just the mind is just filled with aversion or

150
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:49,500
difficulty or anxiety I just start to watch it like it's a

151
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:54,960
stream this flow of content

152
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:01,440
and I just imagine all this loving kindness and compassion filling up the

153
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:06,720
waters so all these thoughts and things that are coming up are being held in this

154
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:13,800
field and so I'm not you know trying to make myself feel better or trying to change

155
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:19,200
the thoughts or the content I'm just oh may you two be at ease

156
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:26,660
may you be safe just the thoughts the images the worries

157
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:34,200
so they're they're really important for me and important in the practice

158
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:40,200
very kind of transformative they can help us dissolve

159
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,359
self-centeredness and support us feeling connected which

160
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,859
is huge huge

161
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:56,700
so in the tradition you know they they're talked about as

162
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,859
and these practices related to them are talked about cultivating virtuous

163
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:08,220
qualities for overcoming self-centeredness

164
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:14,640
for deepening meditation practice they're actually used as concentration practices

165
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:20,820
and they help the Mind settle they help the mind come into Unity into

166
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:27,180
at rest and ease and they are purification practices they

167
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:37,820
sort of purify by supporting wholesome States and thoughts to arise

168
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,540
and they help us integrate wisdom and insight so if we're the mountain

169
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:51,180
and we're able to sit with the changing nature of life and experience of the

170
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:56,700
nights and days and rain and snow and people coming and going and things

171
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:02,520
changing if we can embody that spaciousness the solidness the

172
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:09,119
groundedness of the mountain we can be with the ever-changing

173
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:16,320
experience of life in a way that's balanced right we can see suffering and

174
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:20,000
not collapse into it

175
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:32,700
so um Aya kemma was a a nun she was from

176
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:38,579
Germany and um she described the Rama baharas as

177
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:46,640
feelings and she also said there are the only emotions worth having

178
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:53,940
and um and so I'm a therapist right and so I'm

179
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:59,579
going to contextualize a little bit of the neuropsychological aspects of

180
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:05,700
understanding emotional states and how they're connected to the Brahma baharas or how we can connect with them

181
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:11,819
thinking about ourselves as like you know living beings with the nervous

182
00:43:11,819 --> 00:43:18,619
system that shifts changes and is impacted by both inner and outer stimuli

183
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:25,859
thoughts experiences there's a physiology to the Brahma baharas

184
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:32,900
our physiology changes when we connect with these States

185
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,700
and so we can use the body to support the mind and support the arising of

186
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:44,940
these states so some of the very simple Little Things Are um

187
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:51,359
you know a lot of people will do meditations and they'll say put a smile on your face

188
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:58,319
have you ever heard that yeah I I I've never been able to have that

189
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:04,920
help me yeah but recently I was playing with it and

190
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,220
so I invite you to just like non-smile

191
00:44:10,819 --> 00:44:16,680
oh it's not going to work right now but to play with not it's not a smile but

192
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:25,200
the subtlest lift of the outer lip just the subtle I mean like a micro movement

193
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:33,359
so that instead of the more downward slant there's just even the flat or just not a smile just a slight slight upturn

194
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:39,119
just imagining it so not trying to force some sense of smile that feels

195
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:44,460
manufactured to me I like that word manufactured it's not helpful but if we

196
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:50,700
actually the there's a lot of research about why smiling is supposed to be helpful it actually activates all this

197
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:58,200
you know the nerves that are connected to emotional states in your face changes your mood States but maybe a

198
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:06,240
manufactured smile doesn't work so I played with that and I found this subtlest little bit helped

199
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:11,520
some other things that we can kind of play with are our tone of voice in both

200
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:20,099
inner and outer so really noticing how are we talking to ourselves not just the words but the

201
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:27,020
quality the tonal quality and sometimes that's you know hard to imagine so

202
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:33,420
forgive me if you've had me do this with you before but it works usually so

203
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:42,240
um right now just imagine hearing your own name several times just hearing the name

204
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:48,140
and as you do just kind of pay attention to what you notice in your body

205
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:01,040
okay now I want you to imagine

206
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:07,560
somebody who just absolutely adores you saying your name

207
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:12,660
be an animal anything at all but somebody who really

208
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:18,900
really likes you they get you I want you to imagine hearing them that

209
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:24,060
voice that tone hear your name just say your name in your mind a few times with

210
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:31,460
this voice this affect this tone and notice what happens in your body

211
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,400
Can You Feel the difference

212
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:55,640
hopefully you can if not there are ways keep trying good

213
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:02,000
now just for comparison because we're going to be talking about different

214
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,000
neurophysiological states very briefly

215
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:16,680
I want you to imagine you're in trouble and you hear somebody calling your name

216
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:23,780
who knows you're in trouble just once or twice just notice how that feels

217
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:30,260
okay let it go did you feel the difference

218
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:36,359
yeah okay some of you I see yeses some of you heads are not moving but I'll Trust

219
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:42,599
enough of you could connect or know and remember that it feels different

220
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:50,040
and you know um these are we're shifting our

221
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:55,920
nervous system States as we are imagining and connecting with different ways

222
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:03,300
of hearing our own voice um and that in it's my belief that there

223
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:09,560
are certain neurophysiological states that I'll talk about that are actually

224
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:14,700
the foundation for the way that we feel when we connect with the Brahma baharas

225
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:20,460
now there are some people talking about this but there's no like literal proof at this point but I think there will be

226
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:25,700
they'll be doing studies and there probably are some already

227
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,960
but when we um there's something called the vagus nerve in our body which a very

228
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:40,760
big nerve that goes all the way down into our gut and when the ventral vagus nerve is is

229
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:48,720
activated it leads to calmness a sense of connection emotional well-being and this this is

230
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:56,460
associated with physiological changes in the body including our heart rate breathing patterns and a feeling of

231
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:59,000
safeness

232
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:08,700
so our blood pressure reduces our digestion improves when the ventral

233
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:13,819
vagal nerve is stimulated and we have reduced inflammation

234
00:49:13,819 --> 00:49:18,440
our emotional states are more regulated

235
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:24,720
so there's something called State dependent

236
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:30,660
traits have you heard that term so states are like emotional states

237
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:37,319
right or and they are dependent on

238
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:43,680
in this case the nervous system and where our nervous system is functioning

239
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:51,960
so if we're in a fierce base right our nervous system is in either

240
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:57,960
sympathetic arousal or dorsal vagal Activation so there's very clear shifts

241
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:04,980
in our nervous system this is the most important point there's like a inner gear shift

242
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:11,160
and we can learn how to shift into different gears with our nervous system

243
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:16,520
with practice and diligence and and Attunement

244
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:28,319
it also requires courage and determination because as I said before

245
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:35,700
um when difficulties arise when things are difficult and we aren't accessing these

246
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:41,520
states those difficulties can actually be gateways to the Brahma vihars

247
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:49,740
if we can turn toward our suffering our difficulty and be with it with wisdom and care

248
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:56,160
and then we activate these practices they can actually help us access

249
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,960
a very different state

250
00:51:15,359 --> 00:51:22,760
so the Buddha when he was teaching about the Brahma baharas

251
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:28,260
and he was talking about these these states he said he described the Buddha

252
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:35,460
describes a farmer who works hard to plant and water a crop but cannot command the plants to grow

253
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:41,700
instead with the seasons have changed there comes a time when the crops grow mature and bear grain

254
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:50,880
so this comes back to this idea of cultivation activation versus fabrication right not

255
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,160
needing just like the farmer can't make the plant grow

256
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:01,280
by yelling at it and telling it it the farmer creates conditions

257
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:06,660
supportive conditions for the FL the the plants to grow themselves

258
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:12,660
so like you know like the blossoming of a flower we don't need to do much but we

259
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:18,540
need to let it have sun shine and water and you know pull the weeds out from

260
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:25,260
around it and it'll do what it does in the same way you know we can be the

261
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:30,780
Gardeners of our own inner life and we can cultivate and support the

262
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:34,880
arising of these qualities

263
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:47,040
I have a lot of notes I have so much to know so many notes I have to scroll through you know kind of skipping around

264
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:52,700
my notes to uh find what I want to share

265
00:52:54,660 --> 00:53:00,780
so the role of the gardener

266
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:07,200
it's the role of the gardener right for our inner state so you know taking where the caretakers of

267
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:12,660
our minds our hearts and our bodies so you know just like it's so important to

268
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:18,960
have sun and water and good soil we need sleep right we need to eat we need

269
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:25,079
social connection engagement it's you know kind of simple but easy

270
00:53:25,079 --> 00:53:30,980
things for us to ignore too right but very very important

271
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:37,200
and um you know as the farmer does we we need to observe

272
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:44,040
what's happening on the farm you know noticing the conditions

273
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:50,660
and devoting time to practicing caregiving caretaking

274
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:58,920
and we need to learn right we need to have wisdom and be learning about how to care for our garden right

275
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:06,500
so that's in this in the field of the Dharma that's studying the Dharma and practicing the Dharma

276
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,300
and spending time with spiritual friends

277
00:54:12,839 --> 00:54:18,720
and knowing what we want to grow and what we don't want to grow

278
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:24,420
and being really clear about that being clear about the dangers of growing

279
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:30,960
greed growing hatred and growing delusion

280
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,700
they will overtake the garden

281
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:55,920
so everything I like this point that everything is an opportunity for practice and it can be a

282
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,599
gateway to Freedom

283
00:55:02,579 --> 00:55:09,180
things can be weeds or seeds and the weeds can even be turned into

284
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:14,720
seeds right to fertilize her at least

285
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:23,960
so for example if I'm thinking about

286
00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:32,359
[Music] um a situation and a life that might be fairly common

287
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:42,800
I might think about um

288
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:52,200
a time when someone's mind is you know filled with ill will

289
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:59,640
a lot of hatred or fear and anxiety which is also a form of

290
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:06,300
ill will and

291
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:12,780
when one finds themself in that space because it can happen to all of us right

292
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:20,720
if we recognize it if we name it and see it clearly

293
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:28,640
and we can turn toward it in a way that isn't engaging in it

294
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:40,460
we see the suffering right there right there

295
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:47,220
and if there's a sense of natural loving kindness present we can go right to

296
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:53,760
compassion but sometimes the foundation is the loving kindness

297
00:56:53,760 --> 00:57:00,059
so the sense of deep connection with knowing like all beings

298
00:57:00,059 --> 00:57:08,119
we want to feel safe we want to feel happy we want to feel healthy and at ease

299
00:57:09,059 --> 00:57:15,540
so if for example this the cause of this hostility is somebody else and what

300
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:21,960
they're doing it might not be possible to say just like you I suffer just like me you

301
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:28,740
suffer right we might not be quite there but we can connect with the fact that we

302
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:34,200
want to feel safe happy healthy and at ease and we don't right now

303
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:39,300
so we can start to connect with that wish the loving kindness wish for ourselves

304
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:45,500
right and we can start to kind of just not try and make ourselves feel that way but

305
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:51,900
recognize that is truly what we want we don't want to feel miserable

306
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:58,980
right we want to feel well and when we when that wisdom and that

307
00:57:58,980 --> 00:58:06,440
Clarity comes in that the loving kindness can become accessible

308
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:13,559
and sometimes when we start to feel it enough for ourselves it's just automatically there

309
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:20,400
for the other person and then compassion is much more accessible

310
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:27,119
and the compassion is really seeing that somebody else suffers just like we do and they just want to be

311
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:34,260
happy just like we want to they want to have well-being and ease and so whatever it is that's happening

312
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:40,500
you know whatever's motivating it we can recognize inside this sense of oh well

313
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:46,700
this is what they want and I want this too and I care

314
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:56,280
so if we can you know just recognize these states that are filled with greed

315
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:01,220
right wanting something that somebody else has for example

316
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:08,819
I want that chair I want that job I want that

317
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:14,880
scooter whatever it is that car whatever it is that shirt

318
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:20,339
that smile when we see that sense of I want that I

319
00:59:20,339 --> 00:59:28,380
don't have it you know I wish I could have it ah there's greed and the opportunity

320
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:36,359
right there to have sympathetic Joy if we can shift again Foundation is metha so if the meta

321
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:42,540
is not there maybe we need to cultivate it a little bit and recognize our suffering right we

322
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:49,818
oh may I be it safe and at ease and then oh oh yeah

323
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:58,079
I'm happy you're happy I'm happy for you that you have this job or this chair

324
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:04,559
the smile I'm happy that you know this is bringing you Joy

325
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:09,720
oh and yeah actually I as I sit back and take in your happiness I feel some

326
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:17,520
happiness too and so we can work it's just a reminder we've just walked down the wrong path in

327
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:22,920
the garden and we just need to help ourselves reorient the same spot maybe

328
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,058
facing a different direction

329
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:37,680
Maybe you know where we're lost in thought and we're

330
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:44,040
trying to imagine exactly how we're going to do this and then that and then that and what if this happens and then

331
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:49,559
that happens and we're exhausted trying to figure out you

332
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:55,380
know how we're going to cope with this and make this better and do this and do that so we're just filled with

333
01:00:55,380 --> 01:01:03,619
building these Futures and plans and it's like a mix of greed and aversion and lots of delusion

334
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:09,240
lots and lots of delusion and we can see if we step back and we

335
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:16,079
see oh look this is so much activity so much effort it's no longer useful no

336
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:22,760
longer helpful and we can go oh

337
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:28,859
wow yeah things come and go we can like things change and this I'm in the middle

338
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:36,720
of change or change is about to happen loss or you know whatever it is and we're trying

339
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:43,920
to prepare for it or adapt to it or prevent it right uh okay

340
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:52,079
I'm trying to control something that is not within my control we can cultivate then what Equanimity right by

341
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:58,619
recognizing what's happening the delusion the effort

342
01:01:58,619 --> 01:02:06,440
and just say you know things come and go they do it's the nature of life

343
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:14,280
and there's Equanimity phrases that I really like that I find really helpful and they just start with breathing in I

344
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:21,359
calm my body breathing out I calm my mind there's a long time in my practice that's as far

345
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:29,220
as I could go when I came back when a mini practice I just kept having to just breathe in I

346
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:35,059
calm my body breathe out I caught my mind

347
01:02:35,819 --> 01:02:42,660
and then you know at some point we can move on to this sense of oh yeah may I learn to see that things

348
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:51,318
come and go things change and may I learned to do this with some balance with some ease

349
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:55,220
or some sense of stability

350
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:03,839
you know sort of connected more with the sense of groundedness

351
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:11,700
that mountain and sometimes when I find that um I'm

352
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:17,280
having trouble even when I'm kind of know what's going on and I can't find equanimity

353
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:24,000
it's probably for me because I have some attachment usually it's an attachment to somebody

354
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,099
else and how I want them to be how I want them to feel

355
01:03:29,099 --> 01:03:35,420
what I want them to be doing and so you know I need to recognize that

356
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:39,740
I'm having some attachments

357
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:47,940
and so there's these other phrases that go with the loving kindness practice that I just find so helpful

358
01:03:47,940 --> 01:03:54,859
so you call to mind this dear being or this annoying being or whoever it is

359
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:03,000
and you connect with those you know the wishes of loving kindness you know may you be safe may you feel safe I like

360
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:09,180
feel not be because there's no sense of permanence and safety right there's

361
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:15,000
things are changing so may you feel safe may you feel happy you feel at ease and

362
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:21,059
well-being and I think about this person

363
01:04:21,059 --> 01:04:27,119
and sort of yeah you know went in my best states I know I want all beings to

364
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:34,260
feel this way all beings and if I'm particularly

365
01:04:34,260 --> 01:04:40,680
this is somebody I love dearly and I just see that they're having a hard time and I can't really do anything

366
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:46,319
it's really helpful for me to say okay dear one

367
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:52,680
your happiness and your suffering I wish these things I wish you to be well I wish you to be safe and happy and at

368
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:58,200
ease and and I see I know

369
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:03,540
your happiness and your suffering are a result of your actions not my wishes for

370
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:11,299
you my wishes don't create those States for you

371
01:05:12,599 --> 01:05:20,280
and something in me let's go and I I lean into

372
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:28,619
how much more useful it is to trust that these states are possible

373
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:35,099
for everyone and that we all need to find our way to cultivating them

374
01:05:35,099 --> 01:05:43,940
and so if I can look at this person with eyes that believe that trust in their innate capacity

375
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:49,500
natural States natural ways of being that they can find them if I believe

376
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:55,799
that and I see them with those eyes is probably the best gift I can give

377
01:05:55,799 --> 01:05:58,700
them and myself

378
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:15,920
I'm just feeling that myself

379
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:22,339
as a a parent um

380
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:33,140
it's been such a journey to start by really literally taking care of

381
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:39,119
doing everything creating the smiles and the laughter right and

382
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:45,000
signing them up for this and that and doing all these things painting the room the right color to sort of really

383
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:52,980
support the well-being of my children and then they get older they get older and you

384
01:06:52,980 --> 01:07:01,680
see you know you try you're still trying to make everything just right you're you know beyond the point that

385
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:07,980
you should you're still trying and then it starts to bug your kid and

386
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:14,339
they get mad at you and irritated and you know or they just get you know

387
01:07:14,339 --> 01:07:22,759
they just Rebel and they won't put on their coat when they go outside and you just have to like let go right

388
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:29,240
you have to trust the natural consequences will if some something they've got to

389
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:36,559
entangle with they've got to meet it they've got to have mistakes they need to to learn

390
01:07:38,339 --> 01:07:43,980
there's so many ways along the way as a parent that I would get caught my mind would get caught oh my God they'll never

391
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:49,559
ever ever ever ever sleep through the night oh my God they'll never ever ever ever whatever

392
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:54,599
so much suffering and that's so so much delusion in that right

393
01:07:54,599 --> 01:08:01,380
now over time if you if you're willing to turn toward these moments of suffering you start to collect a library

394
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:07,700
of resources to reference that remind you you know oh jealousy

395
01:08:07,700 --> 01:08:13,920
oh you know you know like wanting to control somebody else oh these things no

396
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:21,060
suffering suffering suffering okay what do I do and then we have the Brahma baharas

397
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:26,520
this place to turn toward this sort of even though we don't feel it maybe

398
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:32,520
it's just knowing that these states exist and knowing they are our Birthright

399
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:38,160
our absolute Birthright it is something that we just it's here

400
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:45,380
it's here and it's accessible and sometimes it's harder to access

401
01:08:45,839 --> 01:08:54,420
but maybe just trusting that it's possible even touching the tip tip of the states

402
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:59,600
even just remembering these States can be enough to help

403
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:14,580
so the last little bit that I want to talk about are kind of um

404
01:09:14,580 --> 01:09:19,620
maybe some of the the daily life practices that we can do

405
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:27,600
the things that we can do that just build into our life that can support our orientation toward these sort of

406
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:35,838
um more regulated expansive heart opening States

407
01:09:38,699 --> 01:09:44,758
so you know loving kindness meditation nice thing to start your meditation

408
01:09:44,759 --> 01:09:49,980
practice with right just orienting toward these wishes

409
01:09:49,980 --> 01:09:53,960
can be a nice way to just start

410
01:09:55,320 --> 01:10:02,040
centered breathing you can do driving in the car you know just sort of breathing into the

411
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:09,260
heart and out from the heart letting the breath move in and out

412
01:10:10,080 --> 01:10:17,840
and imagining feeling your heart with feelings of love and kindness and compassion and ease

413
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:23,699
you can also do like counted breathing practices

414
01:10:23,699 --> 01:10:29,400
there's something called soothing breathing rhythm you breathe in to about the count of

415
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:36,739
five and out to the count of five you keep this very regular pattern to breathing

416
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:42,420
and these things can sort of actually help shift the nervous system

417
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:48,600
back into a more neutral space when we're activated gratitude practice

418
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:53,820
journaling or having a text Trend that you share things that you're grateful with

419
01:10:53,820 --> 01:10:56,000
four

420
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:08,760
with social engagement some of us have social anxiety right some of it's awkward to be in big settings other

421
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:16,620
people are extroverted and it's no problem but um one thing that can be really helpful is

422
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:21,900
to connect with the fact how you want other people to feel around you

423
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:28,440
instead of focusing on you know what you're feeling focus more on how you want other people to feel around you and

424
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:34,940
what would you do to cultivate them feeling at ease

425
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:42,540
and that can help kind of get us out of the selfing that keeps us stuck

426
01:11:42,540 --> 01:11:47,480
and make other people feel good which is nice

427
01:11:49,199 --> 01:11:56,719
taking little breaks throughout your day when you need them and when you don't

428
01:11:57,060 --> 01:12:04,080
consciously saying you know like I want to be compassionate to myself my mind my heart my body

429
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:10,140
you know Finding ways to stretch or do things that you know maybe feel like a

430
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:14,960
hassle but you know or what what are good for you

431
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:24,300
for people who have um you know a sense of comfort with

432
01:12:24,300 --> 01:12:31,020
imagination we all think you've probably noticed that what you

433
01:12:31,020 --> 01:12:38,219
think affects how your body feels yeah if you haven't Notice start practicing

434
01:12:38,219 --> 01:12:47,300
tracking the way we're thinking what we're thinking about we'll have a direct impact on how your body is feeling

435
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:56,460
so practicing thinking or imagining things that are cultivated in goodness and

436
01:12:56,460 --> 01:13:03,960
well-being and wholesome States help yourself help your mind sort of

437
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,520
move from that place

438
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:16,020
and then engaging in compassionate actions toward ourselves and others

439
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:21,360
it's another way that we activate the ventral vagal complex

440
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:28,199
another little simple thing that I want to mention some people have this idea that in Buddhism we're

441
01:13:28,199 --> 01:13:37,340
not supposed to like get really you know attached or or enjoy pleasure

442
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:46,320
that's my view is not that at all that you know we need to notice the beautiful we need to receive the Beautiful

443
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:51,900
and so there's something called hedonic pleasure which you know is pleasure

444
01:13:51,900 --> 01:14:00,800
that's generated by external things nice ice cream sunny day

445
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:06,600
and actually I see that as sort of like the clutch for Shifting the gear

446
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:13,560
so when these natural things happen in our lives if we don't get stuck on just wanting the next good thing we can use

447
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:20,760
the positive feelings that arise naturally to kind of put in the clutch and then move into cultivating you you

448
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:27,360
demonic happiness which is actually connected to meaning and purpose and

449
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:34,980
turning toward that which is difficult with determination right this willingness and we cultivate this sense

450
01:14:34,980 --> 01:14:40,080
of like just by turning towards something in this way it does create the

451
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:46,500
sense of inner well-being that's more sustainable it's it's uh less dependent on things outside of ourselves and

452
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:53,699
doesn't keep us on what they call the hedonic treadmill chasing after the next good thing so

453
01:14:53,699 --> 01:14:58,860
you know little gifts that you get little nice Pleasures little great enjoy

454
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:04,380
them fill them take them in and let them support moving into like more

455
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:09,320
sustainable States instead of getting caught and just chasing

456
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:18,780
so no mud no Lotus right

457
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:24,540
the difficulties the suffering in our life can be gateways to the to you know

458
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:34,040
freedom and um that was nice how sweet thank you

459
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:40,440
um he's just going like this so this big smile it's like yes I love it

460
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:48,420
um yeah so what do you think thoughts questions responses

461
01:15:55,199 --> 01:16:02,060
there we go Martha foreign

462
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:09,860
yeah I really appreciate the talk thank you so much it's very wise and very

463
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:16,860
helpful and deep it's really profound you know leaning

464
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:24,179
into the suffering like you're talking about where we can really just Embrace and have this incredible loving kindness

465
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:30,360
and compassion for even defilements and hint of five hindrances and with that

466
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:35,820
incredible loving kindness and compassion for these things they don't stand a chance they just disappear

467
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:41,460
that's right it's so beautiful so I just I just was coming up in the mind when

468
01:16:41,460 --> 01:16:48,239
you were speaking and it just really felt alive so I just wanted to say that I appreciate the talk thank you thank

469
01:16:48,239 --> 01:16:56,360
you very much anyone else have a question challenge

470
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:03,060
comment other idea about how you work with what

471
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:10,260
I'm talking about Gene I've got it

472
01:17:10,260 --> 01:17:16,980
and then Abraham after Gene oh thank you so much

473
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:23,159
um well the vagus nerve uh is very interesting and um I haven't heard this

474
01:17:23,159 --> 01:17:31,620
corroborated but I think that's why acupuncturists always put the the needle in your ear and one way to activate it

475
01:17:31,620 --> 01:17:38,760
is humming so taking a breath and then humming out nice and do that for a bit and it will

476
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:45,659
change at least for me beautiful yeah yeah yeah there's some great things Kristen Neff has a lot of suggestions

477
01:17:45,659 --> 01:17:51,060
like warm water and touching your lips yeah so there's some great things we can

478
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:58,440
do yeah thank you Gene Abraham do you want to walk over there and get the mic oh

479
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:01,400
yeah there we go

480
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:10,320
thanks um just in terms of exploring the body

481
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:16,980
mind connection yeah a little while ago I was going through a

482
01:18:16,980 --> 01:18:25,920
period where I was quite irate at my son and it was jealousy I was really jealous

483
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:33,360
of just how mature this guy was so much more mature than I I felt myself to be

484
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:39,719
and someone suggested to me that I could send him

485
01:18:39,719 --> 01:18:47,159
um sympathetic Joy to get my mind off of the craviness and

486
01:18:47,159 --> 01:18:53,580
I could actually feel in my body the craving of the jealousy like give me

487
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:59,219
some of that maturity and on the other hand he's been very

488
01:18:59,219 --> 01:19:07,640
successful at his business he's got a wonderful marriage and just this real Joy at

489
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:13,320
his successes and just feel that move out of my body toward him in much more

490
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:19,860
spacious so this one the first impulse was to really become constricted and

491
01:19:19,860 --> 01:19:26,100
tight and the other one was incredibly expansive and of course freeing of this

492
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:32,840
toxic jealousy that I was having so beautiful Abraham beautiful

493
01:19:33,420 --> 01:19:39,300
anyone else have a practice experience great

494
01:19:39,300 --> 01:19:45,060
uh Tanya you were talking about uh making other people feel at ease around

495
01:19:45,060 --> 01:19:50,219
you yes so yeah I have a practice for that

496
01:19:50,219 --> 01:19:58,440
um oh nice something I learned a long time ago um um uh I noticed I would be leaning forwards

497
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:03,679
into social situations like if I wanted them to work out well

498
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:09,120
I don't want him wanting yeah so you're waiting for it you're you're off balance

499
01:20:09,120 --> 01:20:17,760
yeah and the other person isn't so comfortable and you know you're not so happy so I'm so I'm been reminding

500
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:25,100
myself to to stay in uh vertical kind of a mental maybe physical Mountain pose

501
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:30,840
and uh works so much better nice thank you beautiful

502
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:34,520
a sea of richness here

503
01:20:36,179 --> 01:20:38,840
great

504
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:50,820
um I appreciate it uh the explanation of starting with meta as a foundation for

505
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:56,420
Brahma vihara practice um I noticed that

506
01:20:56,420 --> 01:21:02,520
I tend to start with compassion and Equanimity um

507
01:21:02,520 --> 01:21:09,140
you know there's a lot of suffering and I want to get rid of it so I practice to get rid of it

508
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:18,000
but there's um there's it's kind of feel the practice field by aversion right and so

509
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:23,580
um yeah just hearing I don't think I've ever heard about starting with meta so

510
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:30,540
the intention of Happiness safety and peace supporting the whole Brahma vihara

511
01:21:30,540 --> 01:21:36,420
practice rather than you know getting stable and getting rid of the suffering

512
01:21:36,420 --> 01:21:42,780
so so that I can get rid of the suffering yeah yeah yeah you know watch your intention when we're trying to get

513
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:49,560
rid of something wrong practice I'm going to take you the wrong way but yes it's a foundation it's sort of like

514
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:57,600
the gateway to all of them you know they kind of unfold and support each other right and sometimes you know

515
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:05,400
um you can move right through you know but but we really have to be and maybe it's

516
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:11,580
connected to this idea of the physiological state right where we're in the ventral vagal

517
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:16,880
kind of activation a sense of openness ease you know this is a foundational

518
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:21,960
practice the loving kindness to help us access that state if we're wanting to

519
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:27,360
get rid of something more in the threat state we're in the sympathetic arousal right

520
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:33,300
which is not not going to be conducive to connecting to states that are more

521
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:42,140
open hearted yeah so yeah start there

522
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:48,900
and you know don't try don't try and manufacture it you have to be patient

523
01:22:48,900 --> 01:22:54,840
and just kind of try and connect with the the sense that this is my wish

524
01:22:54,840 --> 01:23:02,880
may not be what I'm feeling but it is my wish yeah great I think one more right what

525
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:08,280
time to wait the last one okay I'm a chiropractor and

526
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:15,480
um so I work with the vagus nerve a lot it's at the base of the skull and it controls all our organs and basically

527
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:22,140
every part of the body it's one of these Gateway nerves and so I found it fascinating

528
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:30,739
um you know I've been meditating for many years but I find it fascinating this is the first time I've ever heard anybody correlate the vagus nerve to our

529
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:36,840
mental States as far as meditation meta and so forth it makes a

530
01:23:36,840 --> 01:23:43,260
lot of sense so that that was really fun nice hear your hear your connection with that nice

531
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:49,320
beautiful well I really appreciate your sharing your attention and I wish you

532
01:23:49,320 --> 01:23:56,780
lots of meta compassion sympathetic joy and Equanimity so
