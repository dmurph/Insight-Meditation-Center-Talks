1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,879
so warm greetings everyone and

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,480
so certainly i'm happy to be here with you all and spend this time in the practice and

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:23,760
in the dharma and there is a

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,800
kind of a loose principle that

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,360
agitated thoughts attract more agitated thoughts

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,040
and that tranquil thoughts attract attract more tranquil thoughts

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:51,920
and one of the ways of understanding this is that that i understand it is that

8
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,280
just in the ordinary activities of daily life if we're a little bit busy doing things

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,559
and maybe a little bit busy and maybe feeling a little pressure about what we're doing

10
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:09,600
it's easy to do those things with a little bit of agitation or a little bit of pressure or tension as we do them

11
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:15,680
and that pressure tension agitation is kind of a magnet or an encouragement

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:23,119
or a catalyst for more agitated thoughts maybe on unrelated topics it's like it

13
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,600
predisposes us to be agitated tense anxious

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:37,360
and uh and this is one of the reasons why sitting down to meditate can sometimes feel like such a relief

15
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,560
because we're no longer having to do anything no longer having to

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,479
take care of the daily affairs of life or work or responsibilities or for these few

17
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:54,000
minutes all that can stop and and the relief of that stopping

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,399
then becomes a little bit of a magnet or a catalyst to begin shifting how

19
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,960
our thinking is so thinking becomes quieter becomes more tranquil and

20
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:15,360
tranquility attracts more tranquility so perhaps for some of you you will feel

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:25,120
that relief of being able to sit here and and not have to be doing and making and accomplishing and

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,959
just just to be here in a very simple way and all this practice and instructions

23
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,480
kind of sati can lend itself to the idea that there's a lot to do

24
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,599
and if we sit down with this kind of this agitated energy or this pressure energy

25
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:48,840
that can be carried over into how we do this practice but uh it's i think it's best to start

26
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,560
with a reminder that you don't have to do much

27
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,920
and in a big way meditation is an undoing it's allowing ourselves to

28
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:09,200
not be so busy and doing a lot and accomplishing a lot and starting off with a contentment and

29
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,280
just a relief of just being here where just being alive is enough

30
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:23,280
just breathing attentively without any other activity is maybe enough

31
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:31,280
and then on that foundation then the practice builds and uh i say that carefully the practice

32
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,879
builds rather than we build on that there's something about allowing something to evolve and develop

33
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:48,400
that's very important for this practice so assuming a meditation posture

34
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,120
and it's often good to have a posture that feels stable

35
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,400
because in that stability we can maybe shed

36
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:08,319
the busyness of life shed the agitation and concerns and

37
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:14,319
needs to do kind of like water just rolls down the

38
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:20,079
sides of a mountain so the agitations and concerns begin

39
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:29,840
just kind of rolling down off us

40
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,080
closing the eyes

41
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,360
and gently maybe slowly maybe not too much

42
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,040
taking some fuller a few fuller breaths

43
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,630
just so it's comfortable and nice to really take in more air

44
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:05,120
[Music] expand the ribcage

45
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,800
feel the body this more solidly more the substance of the

46
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,240
body in the movements of the body breathing more deeply

47
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,840
more fully

48
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:34,160
and perhaps letting the exhale last a little bit longer

49
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,840
longer than the inhale

50
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,400
to do something that's a little different that might get your mind's attention on the breath

51
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,600
you can exhale through a slightly open mouth

52
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:02,800
breathing in through the nose fully and then exhale gently slowly

53
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,720
prolonged breathing out the mouth

54
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,639
breathing out of the mouth and silently in your mind saying

55
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:26,240
ah and allowing the tensions of the

56
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:35,199
shoulders to drain off you

57
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,160
taking a rest from the holding of the belly

58
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,000
may be softening the arms especially the elbows

59
00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:02,720
you might flap the elbows a teeny bit to make sure that they're loose

60
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:16,880
maybe releasing any tension in the hands

61
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,080
and then letting your breathing return to normal

62
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,360
breathing maybe through your nose in and

63
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
out

64
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:48,080
and bringing your attention to that part of your body where you most associate to thinking

65
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:55,280
where there might be some tension or pressure tightness associated with thinking

66
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:01,440
agitation someplace where it's energized

67
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:11,840
and as you exhale see if you can relax

68
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,400
soften

69
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
open

70
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:41,839
as you exhale releasing the hold on your thoughts

71
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,480
and resting in the space of the mind

72
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,800
that's wider bigger

73
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,680
then your thoughts and images that you have

74
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,920
maybe you can notice some quality of the mind

75
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:19,360
that has the ability to be receptive tranquil

76
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,920
calm even when you're agitated

77
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:33,120
maybe it's below the agitation or behind it

78
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:40,720
or in the cracks between it see if you can become attuned

79
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:47,839
to some quality of mental calm tranquility

80
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
peacefulness

81
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:07,279
and in as you exhale relaxing the mental activity

82
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:19,839
so it relaxes into dissolves into the calm

83
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:35,680
and then with a very relaxed way with very little energy expended

84
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:47,839
receive an awareness the experience of the body breathing

85
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:15,839
so that there's a very light touch between the body breathing and awareness

86
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,320
inviting the experience of breathing into whatever calm or tranquility that

87
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:43,839
might be here even if you're agitated in other ways

88
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:54,160
and for a few minutes if you can don't worry about anything

89
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:02,160
just trust entrust yourself to your breathing without measuring it

90
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,000
or needing it to be different or judging yourself for it

91
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:15,200
a very simple dedication trusting all you need to do

92
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:20,639
is to accompany your breathing

93
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,639
for a few minutes here with any without any concern with the quality

94
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:39,839
of your attention or just a dedication to breathing

95
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:58,000
and when you find yourself drifting off in thought rather than letting go of your thinking

96
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,560
see if what look around and see what you can relax that's associated with thinking

97
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,959
see what needs to be settled reassured

98
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,839
let the mind return to a little bit more

99
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,959
calmness in doing so you might find that

100
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,839
your the the strength of your thinking

101
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,839
decreases

102
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,600
the more settled we become in meditation

103
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:57,840
the more heightened awareness we have sensitivity to the mind thinking

104
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:08,480
noticing it sooner noticing the unsatisfactory

105
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,160
this of being involved caught up in thoughts

106
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:19,279
noticing the relief of not thinking so much

107
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:30,799
when you find yourself thinking see if you can feel or experience

108
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:39,840
the impact thinking has on your body your mind

109
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:47,520
and then relax the tension the agitation

110
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:53,200
soften the thinking mind quiet

111
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:15,360
whatever mental activity that your can be sensitive to that you can feel

112
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,360
see if you can relax it

113
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,480
calming the mind maybe as if the breathing

114
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,880
is washing a calming wave through your whole body

115
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:42,559
that includes the mind and the mind softens opens expands

116
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:50,158
beyond its concerns there's so much more

117
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,720
to relax into in the particular concerns and thoughts

118
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,360
that we have

119
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:25,840
waves of calmness breathing through the mind

120
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,840
so

121
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:37,200
and then coming to the end of the

122
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:50,399
sitting the mind has greater intelligence

123
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:57,200
the mind has greater creativity when there's not so much energy poured

124
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,840
into thinking

125
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:10,880
the less agitation the less force in the thinking mind

126
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:19,278
the more ease there is and the more space there is for

127
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:28,480
an intelligent wise contact consideration

128
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,519
of others

129
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,840
and to turn your attention now

130
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,799
to other people

131
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:54,480
families friends neighbors

132
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:01,200
people in your county your state your country

133
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,720
your province people that you encounter and through

134
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,399
the news or other ways

135
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:20,320
and begin by just relaxing around thinking about them quiet

136
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,840
soft mind

137
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:31,600
soft heart and without putting too much effort into

138
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:38,480
it can you evoke a simple

139
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,760
tender kindness good will

140
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:51,840
friendliness for these other people

141
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,320
kindness begets more kindness

142
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:04,159
love attracts more love to itself

143
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,519
all within our own hearts

144
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:16,960
and then to see if there's an aspiration a wish

145
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,278
for the welfare of these people may they be well and safe

146
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,278
may they be happy

147
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,799
and to imagine yourself in their presence

148
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,640
with some dedication and championing

149
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:52,158
of their happiness and well-being as their advocate for happiness

150
00:31:53,519 --> 00:32:00,240
may all beings be happy

151
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,880
may all beings be safe

152
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:15,039
may all beings be peaceful

153
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:29,840
may all beings everywhere be free

154
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:25,039
so the eighth step of anapanasati is one trains oneself

155
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:33,679
experience um one calms the mental activity

156
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:39,360
one relaxes the mental activity

157
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:45,600
you most english translations will use some language of a tranquilized which makes tranquil

158
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,880
the mental activity and and the mental activity here is you

159
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,720
should often translate as mental formations the formations the activity the

160
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,720
constructs the constructing aspect the doing aspect of the mind

161
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:10,158
so i think activity works relatively well that then we now begin to calm

162
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,839
the mental activity and this doesn't have to be a big

163
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:23,040
project if it's easy to relax and please by all means do but it's also

164
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:31,520
recognizing this is a natural process of settling that goes on and as we gets more and more settled in

165
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:38,079
meditation more focused on the breathing and and we start shedding a lot of the concerns of the day and we're just more

166
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,440
and more here uh their attention starts being a heightened sensitivity to

167
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,358
different aspects of our experience one of them is experiencing bodily tensions the way we

168
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:55,679
hold tensions in our body and of course there's a feeling that well enough the body itself wants to

169
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:01,040
relax and let go and there's almost a natural letting go and relaxation

170
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,560
just from knowing and recognizing what goes on but we can also be participate in that

171
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:13,359
if it's easy enough and we don't get busy we can help ourselves relax more

172
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:20,400
so as we begin having more well-being and more settled and in meditation at some point also then we

173
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:27,200
develop a kind of a special sensitivity or awareness of the mind thinking

174
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:33,440
of course we can know that earlier and we're letting go of our thoughts coming back to the breathing but it uh there's more and more

175
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,760
sensitivity as we go along to the unsatisfactory quality of thinking the way that we start noticing

176
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,359
that when we're involved in thinking it's almost like an alienation from ourselves

177
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:52,480
that's unimaginable for people who identify strongly where they're thinking like thinking is who they are and but we

178
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,160
realize that thinking is just in one aspect of our life that there's a fuller range

179
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,640
of who we are that really becomes apparent as we get settled and calm and more embodied and present here in

180
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:10,079
meditation we start seeing that thinking is just a piece of what we are

181
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,720
and if we get lost in thought we actually lose touch with the fullness the uh the fullness of who we are the

182
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:22,960
wholeness of who we are in a sense and there's a kind of alienation even if the thoughts are really great and exciting

183
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,960
or important so called and but we also become sensitive to the

184
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,160
in the impact that thinking has so one impact is the alienation another

185
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:39,520
impact is that unskillful and wholesome thoughts

186
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:46,720
attract more on wholesomeness so if we're thinking a lot of with agitated ways angry ways greedy

187
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:53,520
ways that those tend to kind of perpetuate themselves and attract more of the same

188
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,040
agitation and preoccupation and we also start feeling the impact it has on

189
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:08,000
very subtly sometimes on our musculature that i could go around all day long

190
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:15,200
somewhat calm and engaged in life but when i sit down to meditate i realize that my thinking has somehow

191
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:21,520
created a little bit of tension around my eyes and just behind the forehead that i'm too

192
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:28,000
busy kind of with life to really notice the subtlety of it but as we settled in meditation that

193
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,560
subtlety of where the whole tension and tightness becomes more and more apparent

194
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:40,880
and and the tension associated with thinking the pressure the agitation that's physical almost in nature

195
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:45,920
that's more closely connected to thinking uh rather than the surface muscles that

196
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:52,079
we often kind of we can relax um or actively or something i call that

197
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:58,880
the thinking muscle and part of meditation is to is to relax the thinking muscle

198
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:04,800
and and and so as we feel this is there's a

199
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:11,440
natural tendency for the system the psychophysical system to want to relax the more we are mindful of tension

200
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:17,839
more more we feel like almost in the tension itself is a momentum to relax but we can also

201
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:23,359
soften and relax ourselves softening the mind relaxing thinking

202
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:30,320
mind and and certainly this is very helpful because the more the mind is calm

203
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:36,079
the more it that attracts more calmness the more the mind is calm the less we're

204
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:42,400
likely to be so interested in being caught in our thoughts and wonder often thoughts it's easier to stay focused and continue

205
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:49,119
with this process of meditation but also there's a very important lessons that can come

206
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:56,320
about how our mind works as we get calmer and calmer and one of them is that there's a

207
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:01,599
certain wonderful intelligence creativity that can happen when the mind is

208
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,640
calm and settled that's much more difficult to happen when it's agitated

209
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,920
it's a little bit of a trap for some people because sometimes they start composing

210
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:18,400
you know the great world novel um by um you know they have some great idea

211
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:25,200
for something and the creativity and the intelligence of the mind is really kind of operating it just feels so good and

212
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:30,400
engaging and and right to be involved in some wonderful creative thoughts

213
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,680
and um so so but it's a dead end for the purpose of meditation it becomes

214
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:42,000
actually another way of being kind of self-alienated even though it feels so good and exciting and like finally i feel

215
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,760
fulfilled i'm doing something very important writing the greatest poetry that's ever been written

216
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:55,280
and uh and um so so to not get sidetracked by that but the process that got us there is

217
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,359
showing us that there's a natural intelligence or creativity or wisdom that can operate

218
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:09,359
when the mind is not so active that the in the principle that actually the um

219
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:16,960
the mind operates the best when there's no extra energy no unnecessary energy operating

220
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:25,760
and that's a great lesson and a difficult lesson to really take in that it's so it can be so compelling

221
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,520
to get to worry so compelling to feel like i i have to accomplish i have to fix something i have to do something and

222
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,760
i have to think my way to it and and we get agitated and pressured and sometimes we feel like

223
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:45,119
we have to if we're responsible we have to engage the mind and show ourselves and maybe even show other

224
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:52,079
people how serious we are in thinking and taking care of things and that if we allow the natural quiet

225
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,560
calm mind to operate then it looks like we don't care and looks like we know that we're just

226
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,079
being kind of letting things just go you know whatever way they go but what

227
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,760
i'd like to suggest is that our our love our care our responsibility even a sense that things

228
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:15,440
are really important to take care of even then they can be taken care of better

229
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,920
if the mind is is relaxed and calm and we don't build up this extra tension

230
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,359
in the mind of doing and accomplishing and fixing and thinking about things

231
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:34,960
and to learn this this um this shift of perspective to learn

232
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:41,440
how to trust a calm mind and have that combined be engaged responsibly take care of

233
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,640
things is a process of trust process of familiarity of experience

234
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,640
seeing oh this actually works i don't have to believe in the in the messages even from

235
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:59,680
society around us that i have to be anxious preoccupied angry

236
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:07,440
apologetic i have to kind of engage my mind in some way to please other people or please myself

237
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,839
it's possible to stay peaceful and love and intelligence and creativity and

238
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:19,359
responsibility all can operate when there's no extra energy going on

239
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:26,720
so unnecessary energy in the mind and so this learning to to relax and to

240
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:32,880
calm the mind it very much depends on our ability to recognize

241
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:39,440
how we're over efforting in the mind where the agitation in the mind is that tension in the mind is

242
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:48,000
the pressure in the mind the closing down of the mind that goes on and and so the seventh step

243
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:55,839
is to feel that and to feel what's going on and then this eighth step is to relax it

244
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:01,040
and this has a wonderful uh effect where some of our problems that

245
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:07,520
we have in our lives that we feel like we have to fix and care and take care of

246
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:14,160
maybe some of them don't have any solutions but rather than solving them we can dissolve

247
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,359
them so for example someone who wants to know the meaning of life

248
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:24,480
they might have a lot of agitation around this even some anxiety around what's the

249
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,079
meaning of life i need to know because i need to know where i fit in this universe and what's happening with me

250
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:35,200
and have a purpose and all this stuff and there's a lot of agitated thinking

251
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:41,040
around searching for the meaning of life but if they do this meditation process

252
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,640
and all the agitation and anxiety associated with this question

253
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,720
abates dissolves goes away then lo and behold they might discover

254
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:58,400
that it still might be an interesting question the meaning of life but there's no personal need or

255
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:05,440
investment or desperation around it it just becomes an abstract question and the existential

256
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,760
power that held our grip around it has dissolved without solving it it's no longer a

257
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,200
problem it just becomes and maybe an academic interesting question

258
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:23,280
that might not have been the best example but i'm hoping that you can just apply that to yourself that

259
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:31,520
think about what are you concerned with what are you preoccupied with that maybe doesn't need to be solved

260
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,560
maybe more valuable is to dissolve the underlying tension

261
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:42,880
fear anxiety pressure ambition greed that might be the very thing

262
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,720
that's keeping those thoughts pumping up and going and to relax

263
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:55,839
the mental activity trust softening the mind and

264
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:03,440
it's a wonderful thing so this is especially true in meditation so as meditation con continues to develop there comes a

265
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,880
stage where periodically it comes and goes where it's really clear

266
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:15,440
that the what's really good to do is to trust the calm mind and letting go of all the

267
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:23,359
unnecessary energy that's there so um thank you very much and

268
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:33,838
we'll continue this process of step seven and eight uh for another couple of days thank you
