00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:07,740
and cold in Stafford Virginia biting me cold in the Heartland I believe it's

10
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,080
chilly and damp lovely to see all the warm greetings in

11
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,200
the midst of the cold damp or wet

12
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:30,659
[Music] bright and crisp and Glenside

13
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,140
Pennsylvania

14
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,759
sunny and cold lake effect clear and cold

15
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,659
cool and clear

16
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,780
so very happy to be here with all of you this morning

17
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:16,640
I love the little greetings the anecdotes the warmth of this Sangha it's really something

18
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,980
so we are at the top of the hour and

19
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,560
just want to invite you when you're ready to um turn your

20
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,200
attention from the weather report rolling in from all over the place

21
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,099
to the internal weather the internal weather of your body heart

22
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:48,120
and mind so you can do that by settling back and closing your eyes maybe you aren't quite

23
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:55,620
done with the chat but you just want to tune in you can share it if you like

24
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,060
before you settle in

25
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:10,440
men settling into a posture that will

26
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,180
support you for the next half hour

27
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:27,480
opening your awareness to the quality of the larger atmospherics around you

28
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,640
whether it's rain or sun or wind or damp

29
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:40,739
I'm feeling yourself embodied embodied within that larger

30
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,220
system atmosphere

31
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:55,440
and feeling into the sensations of this body

32
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,180
this moment internally

33
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:08,120
the overall sense of warmth are cool

34
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,720
relaxation aliveness

35
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:20,299
maybe weights or lightness

36
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:29,000
breathing out any excess energy or attention

37
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,960
and paying special attention just for a moment to your head to your

38
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,840
face allowing the eyes to soften in their

39
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,960
sockets perhaps

40
00:04:51,960 --> 00:05:00,120
to gently roll down and back just a little bit this invokes a global

41
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,740
relaxation response

42
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:12,680
and also allowing the tongue to relax that soften

43
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,500
vest in your mouth however works for you

44
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:25,259
for me and for many people it's helpful to have the tip of the tongue

45
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:33,800
gently resting on the front of the palate that area of the roof of the mouth right behind your top teeth

46
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:39,180
and that can allow the rest of the tongue just to relax

47
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:46,639
another signal to soften the overall system

48
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:57,000
[Music] feeling your feet your seat your body

49
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,120
rooted held

50
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:12,139
held by the gravity of the Earth supported by the Earth

51
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:22,199
checking in now with the overall atmospherics

52
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:29,759
of mood just in a general

53
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:37,940
broad brush overall way how's the heart how's the mind today

54
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,520
can be an act of love to check in with that

55
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,419
acknowledging whatever's there

56
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:09,600
and settling settling into really allowing awareness mindfulness to

57
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:14,660
be at the Forefront of attention

58
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:22,860
360 Degrees all around you within you

59
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,038
thank you

60
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:38,960
perhaps resting the attention Awareness on the breath

61
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:49,340
if there are sounds effect of external weather ambient sounds of any kind

62
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:56,300
allowing that to to be an anchor and attention

63
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,699
gentle movements of rain or shifting sound of wind

64
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,300
distant sounds from outside

65
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:26,520
spaciousness allowing

66
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:56,540
resting resting on the gentle waves of arising

67
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,420
and passing away of sensation of breathing

68
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,399
experience of sound or sensation

69
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,010
[Music]

70
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:26,540
allowing the attention the awareness to rest In This Moment

71
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:12,480
to find the attention called are you specific

72
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,180
stronger arising maybe a sound sensation

73
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,920
internal mental or emotional process

74
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:33,380
turning all of the attention to the fact of that arising

75
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:38,640
acknowledging it kindly

76
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:49,200
and with the acknowledgment either staying with it

77
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,959
as an event in this moment

78
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:00,680
or as it fades or the Mind loses interest

79
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:08,300
returning the attention to the global awareness overall awareness

80
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:15,680
perhaps including breathing overall sensation

81
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,380
sound

82
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:58,519
so compensation internal processes to come and go

83
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:07,400
no need to get involved no need to be for or against

84
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:18,480
no need for judgment just noticing

85
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,438
allowing

86
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:26,900
being with

87
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,220
[Music] any more instruments of this meditation

88
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:08,220
together tuning in

89
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:14,179
to any calm or spaciousness

90
00:31:15,059 --> 00:31:20,640
any peace relaxation even just a tiny corner

91
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:29,360
tiny drop that may have appeared emerged in this meditation

92
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:38,059
and tuning into the good qualities cultivated in this practice

93
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:44,820
perhaps patience persistence engagement

94
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:53,880
Stillness or collectiveness compassion self-compassion

95
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:04,100
kindness whatever good qualities

96
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:09,019
have been cultivated or experienced

97
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:18,620
imagining others in your life near and far

98
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,980
with whom they might be shared just in a way of being or a simple

99
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,520
intention

100
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:39,440
sharing increases these good qualities for everyone

101
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:52,320
and it feels right allowing these beneficial good intentions to flow

102
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:59,179
outwards towards those your life touches

103
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:10,278
May the goodness cultivated in our practice together here

104
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:16,260
be shared with the others in our lives and by the

105
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:23,039
sharing continue to radiate outwards

106
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:30,059
and further outward still may all beings

107
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:36,919
be safe may all beings be happy

108
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:43,460
may all beings be healing

109
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:51,980
may they be peaceful and may all beings be free

110
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,749
[Music]

111
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:32,480
thank you for the dedication the sincerity of your practice

112
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,819
foreign

113
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:46,140
the topic for this morning is again one of five bases for

114
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:52,020
cultivating spiritual power and um

115
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:57,359
this species basis is um

116
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:02,759
combination of again engagement

117
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:11,339
or padahana wholehearted engagement and in this case chitta quality or

118
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:17,339
subjective experience of the mind and heart and

119
00:36:17,339 --> 00:36:23,940
again those two help to form collectedness immersion

120
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:29,880
stability concentration samadhi all of those are kind of

121
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:36,740
um synonyms or different translations of the words

122
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,680
so I have three main points to cover this morning

123
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,020
in the first overarching point really if you take nothing else from these 15

124
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:56,520
minutes it's that the quality of our minds and hearts

125
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:06,480
though the quality of that and that thought that emerges from it can Define our practice and it can Define Our Lives

126
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,880
and this this is most easily seen in meditation practice from me and

127
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,300
sometimes you know moments that it will pop in in daily life too of course

128
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:24,180
so it's helpful to learn to notice that's point one point two

129
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:30,480
and three are sort of subsets it's ways of noticing and the first kind of thing

130
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,320
but some of us can tune into you might find that you tune into is the overall

131
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:42,420
state of the Mind in any given moment and this is kind of like the

132
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:50,960
atmospherics that overall ecology or soundscape happening in your system

133
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:58,200
the second way is to tune into the kind of thoughts that are emerging and I don't so much

134
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,800
mean the story of the thoughts though that can be very important but the underlying quality

135
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:11,460
so I'll talk about that more in a minute so first the quality of the mind and

136
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:16,740
heart quality of thoughts how we relate to experience

137
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:23,040
I'm going to ask you again to kind of feel into these as I talk about them

138
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:29,820
and I'll give you another word cloud for the poly this comes from

139
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:35,839
a number of different translators mind

140
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:42,480
mental processes mental development

141
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:49,640
heart or heart mind state of consciousness

142
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:57,980
you just feel into those so far any associations coming up

143
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:02,960
overall awareness

144
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,839
kind of like the overall atmospherics

145
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:18,480
and then my personal favorite comes from the um very prolific early translator

146
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:25,700
Caroline Augusta fully rise Davids she calls chitta the subjective

147
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:29,599
experience of mind

148
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:43,820
a subjective experience of mind so this overall subjective experience

149
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:50,579
it's as I mentioned kind of like the overall weather the overall front here

150
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:56,780
in the Bay area of rain and the kind of overall

151
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:01,800
atmospherics you might experience in a soundscape

152
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:08,520
another way I've thought of it in the past that's been helpful is if the mind is spinning up movies for

153
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:14,700
those of us that are visual what's the tint or the color theme in the movie

154
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:22,079
or what's the general mood of the soundtrack not the words not the dialogue

155
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,619
feel

156
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:35,280
so this is such a helpful sort of um part of experience to tune

157
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:41,640
into that it actually has its own foundation in the Buddha's famous teaching the four foundations of

158
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:48,839
mindfulness one of the Central teachings of this tradition of Buddhism and perhaps of most if not all

159
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:56,099
traditions and that third Foundation is an amusing Guild franstal's translation here of

160
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:01,280
this discourse observation of mind

161
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:08,940
and there are certain things that are helpful to notice you don't have to like dig around for them but just notice them

162
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:14,940
one is and I'm just going to read a few of the paraphrases of the phrases from

163
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:20,040
this section one knows a mind with craving as a mind

164
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:25,200
with craving and a mind without craving as a mind

165
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:31,320
without craving one knows a mind with ill will as a mind

166
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:36,540
with ill will in the mind without ill will as without

167
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:43,200
ill will one knows a mind with delusion has a

168
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:49,079
mind with delusion and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion in

169
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:55,020
other words Clarity or wisdom and one knows a mind

170
00:41:55,020 --> 00:42:00,300
that is collected as collected

171
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:05,960
and a mind that is scattered as scattered

172
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:12,359
so that could be distraction collected of course is that stability that Stillness

173
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:17,880
Focus samadhi one knows an expanded mind as an

174
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,160
expanding mind or spacious mind you could call it and a

175
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:28,740
not expanded mind as a not expected mine and it goes on from there

176
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:33,900
just to give you a flavor this is General and it doesn't have to be something you

177
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:39,660
even look for but every now and then if things are going really tough in a meditation

178
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:46,980
or if they're going really really well just to check in what's the quality of the mind and heart

179
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:54,420
right now the shortcut that um teacher I've

180
00:42:54,420 --> 00:43:01,980
followed now for some years his teachings said is is there tension in the mind or

181
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:07,500
relaxation or for me it's often helpful on shortcut

182
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:12,380
is it helpful or not helpful

183
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:18,000
suggest these are possibilities you don't have to go looking for them digging for them

184
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,300
but allowing them to emerge to be seen

185
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:29,940
so an example here let's say you go to visit someone who's

186
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:36,359
having a really hard time to support them to be with them beautiful thing to do right

187
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:41,819
there's a big difference during and afterwards between tuning into the

188
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:48,560
compassion and the care in your own heart or maybe the appreciation for them

189
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:55,800
and versus criticizing or blaming yourself for any little misstep or imperfection

190
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,079
of how it went the same thing goes for showing up for

191
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:07,440
ourselves in meditation right acknowledging what's happening without

192
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,020
putting on extra layers that aren't so helpful

193
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:21,359
so in meditation it's helpful just to notice the shortcut for all of this is just notice the overall mood notice the

194
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:27,720
overall tone and that tone that mood can feel so

195
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:36,060
authoritative that it's really worth remembering that the chitta this subjective quality

196
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:41,339
of mind it can change faster than a finger snap

197
00:44:41,339 --> 00:44:48,660
we've all experienced that some new event happens a new person a memory

198
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:55,859
a realization and our mood goes from one thing to completely other

199
00:44:55,859 --> 00:45:00,380
just like faster than a finger snap

200
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:06,540
the last area I'll cover just briefly is to notice the different types of thought

201
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:13,680
arising and this can be the kind of attitudes of

202
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:21,140
thought that I talked about earlier in Bill's translation of the third Foundation but there can also be

203
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:27,660
qualities of the mental activity itself and there are two qualities of

204
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:33,119
particular that are helpful in cultivating the idipada the basics for

205
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:38,280
meditative success and spiritual power and that is

206
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:46,380
the quality of directed attention at whatever your central object of attention anchor

207
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:51,599
of attention for the meditation is so that's like

208
00:45:51,599 --> 00:46:00,359
the striker hitting the gong of the Bell and the other quality is a sustaining

209
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:09,599
quality like the fade of the Bell I'll just do it now so if you just connect it'll be a clunk

210
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:15,540
like that if you connect and sustain it's like

211
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:21,040
this [Music]

212
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:31,380
foreign there's this capacity to be with be near

213
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:37,380
what is being attended to that continues

214
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:43,500
you can think of this in terms of yesterday's topic of effort too every now and then a little pulse of

215
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:51,420
connecting and then this long sustaining it's like pushing a child on a swing

216
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:56,240
you don't need to be pushing the whole time the swing swings

217
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:03,240
so this is very helpful quality of Mind

218
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:10,260
each of these are very helpful qualities of mind for deepening immersion stability in the

219
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:16,680
meditation and again nothing that needs to be made to happen or dug for

220
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:22,260
but just noticing encourage you to notice in your life when you connect when your attention

221
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:27,540
naturally connects with something and stays with it for a while

222
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:34,800
okay so to recap chitta your subjective experience of the heart

223
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:42,240
and mind is one of the really crucial helpful qualities to notice in

224
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:49,500
cultivating a deepening of meditation practice the overall attitude quality

225
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:55,560
atmospherics of heart and mind the overall

226
00:47:55,560 --> 00:48:02,880
sense of weather atmosphere presence and absence of skillful and

227
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:10,380
unskillful healthy and unhealthy qualities and these kinds of thoughts or types of

228
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:17,760
mental activity so in the next 24 hours if it feels right

229
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:23,700
just notice these in your life or in your practice maybe talk about them with a friend

230
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:33,020
and I'll look forward to seeing you at least in the chat or in my mind's eye tomorrow in YouTube

231
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,859
thank you for your practice
