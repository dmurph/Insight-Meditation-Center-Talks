1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,080
so monday was

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,839
self-respect

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,720
tuesday was self-understanding

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,160
wednesday was not harming oneself

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,799
and today the topic is benefiting

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,720
oneself

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,800
and

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,760
you know the buddha taught for the

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,880
benefit and welfare of others

10
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,000
he wanted us he wanted benefits for

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,400
people that's what his whole career his

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,320
whole dedication was for people's

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,360
welfare and well-being

14
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,480
and

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,640
and to be a follower of the buddha is

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,960
then to take those teachings in

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,760
so that we can better ourselves so that

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,320
we can for our own welfare and happiness

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,600
and for our benefit

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,000
and um

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,160
and uh this is something that i was a

22
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,920
little bit slow to come to in my

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,680
buddhist practice because of maybe

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,440
practicing in zen where this was not

25
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,800
emphasized

26
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,559
in fact maybe it was even discouraged

27
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:04,320
that when one would one would practice

28
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,960
for kind of a self-benefit of

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,960
experiencing happiness joy well-being

30
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,799
and

31
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,840
and

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,320
but somehow this sense of well-being

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,600
found me as i kept practicing

34
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,159
and i've come to really appreciate how

35
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,840
powerful it is to have a sense of

36
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,360
well-being

37
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,479
it's a kind of reconditioning

38
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,720
of our psyche of our

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,520
neurons of our muscles

40
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,479
reconditioning of our mind and heart

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,320
and not all of us have had great

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,799
conditioning in our life

43
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,119
that so the influences on how we think

44
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,119
how we understand ourselves understand

45
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,560
the world

46
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,720
how we feel

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,880
are not necessarily

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,880
that which is brings welfare and

49
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,759
happiness and well-being

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,799
and

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,399
and so rather than

52
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,759
and so one of the ingredients for

53
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,600
developing a really healthy sense of

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,600
well-being

55
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,800
is not so much doing it directly

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,720
but rather indirectly

57
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,640
by creating the conditions for

58
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,160
well-being

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,040
for

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,360
benefiting ourselves

61
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,959
and

62
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,280
classically in buddhism such a

63
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,599
talk would always refer to the

64
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,239
importance of living an ethical life

65
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,400
that if we can live ethically

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,160
and then

67
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,840
that can be nourishing for ourselves

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,680
that can that itself is a form of

69
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,319
nourishment as form of inspiration if it

70
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,400
was a form of goodness

71
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,319
but that's not automatically so for many

72
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,000
of us

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,800
and uh so for our ethical behavior to

74
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,480
know to be nourishing

75
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,440
uh we have to appreciate the underlying

76
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,560
goodness

77
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,720
of a dedication of living

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,000
wholesomely living ethically

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,560
so it might be hard to actually do it

80
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,599
but

81
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,720
but to

82
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,560
live one's life with that dedication

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,200
with that love for

84
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,560
an ethical wholesome skillful life

85
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,879
that is a powerful thing

86
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,680
and

87
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
and to appreciate that intention that

88
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,440
commitment

89
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,560
not so much that you have to do it

90
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,920
intellectually

91
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,360
but rather

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,319
ideally that that desire that wish that

93
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,640
movement towards living an ethical life

94
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,519
is itself coming from a place that of

95
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,799
inner goodness of inner well-being inner

96
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,799
something it touches something inside of

97
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,360
us that has a rightness to it

98
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,040
wholesomeness to it

99
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,720
and it's that wholesomeness we begin

100
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,560
discovering inside

101
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,519
that

102
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,959
the practice can grow and develop

103
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,200
to sit and many people don't discover

104
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,920
this through being ethical first but

105
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,920
rather through meditation

106
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,840
that the meditation

107
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,120
is kind of first a deconditioning

108
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,360
by relaxing and not being so caught up

109
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,280
in our mind streams of thoughts and

110
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,319
reactions we're beginning to um

111
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,360
take some of the power behind some of

112
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,879
our old conditioning some of the old

113
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,360
habits of mind that we have

114
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,480
and so there's a kind of a

115
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,799
deconditioning process and the calmer we

116
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,440
become stiller we become a meditation

117
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,880
the quieter the mind becomes in

118
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,960
meditation the more it's actually a

119
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,479
deconditioning process letting go of old

120
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,560
habits that the mind that are maybe not

121
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,800
serving us

122
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,479
many many ways in which we have

123
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,080
rumination and

124
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,360
way people think it's actually unhealthy

125
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,680
it undermines us it debilitates us it

126
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,320
drains us because if the thinking is so

127
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,479
negative or stressful

128
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:46,560
and so as the mind gets quieter and

129
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,240
stiller

130
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,479
there's a deconditioning process

131
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,560
and then it can be replaced with

132
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,199
wholesome thinking wholesome desires

133
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:57,199
nice ways of being

134
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,880
or to say it differently as we get

135
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,960
calmer and more subtle some people there

136
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,080
discover

137
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,800
um maybe first as a little seed a

138
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,320
glimmer

139
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,560
a feeling of this this if it feels

140
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,960
wholesome this feels this goodness in

141
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,160
this there's a

142
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,800
happiness there's a sense of well-being

143
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,000
that comes with just sitting here

144
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,840
where just being alive is enough just

145
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,520
sitting here breathing

146
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,600
and letting go of all the past

147
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,520
conditioning or the reactivities of the

148
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,600
mind

149
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,520
a mind doesn't have to be

150
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,080
fed by

151
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,320
the heart does not be fed by external

152
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,840
stimuli other people things doing things

153
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,520
recreational opportunities tv shows food

154
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,000
drink all kinds of things the mind can

155
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,080
be content and happy

156
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,400
the heart can be content and happy

157
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
without searching and wanting and

158
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,919
getting outside it's almost as if if we

159
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,880
let go of all the conditioning

160
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,080
the harmonious flow of energy within the

161
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,600
harmonious flow of the heart and the

162
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,560
mind

163
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,880
has a has a feeling of health in it

164
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,759
healthiness and goodness and joy and

165
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,319
happiness

166
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,160
so to start getting a feeling of that

167
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
from meditation from being from the

168
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,280
ethical impulse

169
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,680
the

170
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,400
and then to appreciate that glimmer of

171
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,720
well-being that that which is nourishing

172
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,280
within that which is wholesome

173
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,479
that which

174
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,639
has a quality of happiness and goodness

175
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,919
in it to appreciate that and value it

176
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,400
enough that we stay close to it

177
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,479
and a very important moment can happen

178
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,000
in buddhist practice

179
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,880
where

180
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,479
some quality

181
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,840
of inner some good quality of inner

182
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,120
inner life

183
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,199
and i say it that vaguely because

184
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,039
different people identify different

185
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,680
things but something that feels a good

186
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,800
quality of heart quality of mind

187
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,560
is experienced

188
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,440
and

189
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,680
one begins to see

190
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,400
the places where there's a choice

191
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,360
whether to leave that behind by getting

192
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,280
into a reactive mind again

193
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,160
or coming back and staying close to it

194
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,280
and nourishing and supporting it

195
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,280
not giving it up staying close and

196
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,759
allowing it to grow it is like a seed

197
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,120
that we want to like like a gardener to

198
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,280
nourish that seed to water it to

199
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,639
fertilize it

200
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,240
to um protect it so that that's that uh

201
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,479
delicate and fragile little plant that's

202
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,680
the sprout

203
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,599
can grow and develop

204
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,199
and so this point comes in buddhist

205
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,680
practice where we have a reference point

206
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,520
for this some kind of inner well-being

207
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,599
and uh and then the opportunity is there

208
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,759
to stay close to it

209
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,560
not uh tight not

210
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,800
fending off the world and shutting down

211
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,360
from the world and becoming a hermit

212
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,280
but

213
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,199
is just staying close and living our

214
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,680
life from that place going into the

215
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,440
world being with our people but have

216
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,199
that as a reference point

217
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,120
and one of the ways to have a reference

218
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,039
point is to have it this

219
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,000
is what i'm going to do now

220
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,080
undermine detract

221
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,120
from

222
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
this ner this nourishing place i've

223
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,400
discovered

224
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,479
or is it going to enhance it or develop

225
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,400
it or just keep it you know keep it

226
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,479
steady

227
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,000
it requires mindfulness it requires

228
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,080
a willingness to keep paying attention

229
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,919
to it and come back to it and stay close

230
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,839
and in the process we learn a lot a lot

231
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,080
about ourselves we learn a lot about the

232
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,560
subtle ways and not so subtle ways that

233
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,919
we lose that that we kind of

234
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,160
bypass it the way we pick up stress and

235
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,200
tension in our body and mind and heart

236
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,920
and

237
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,519
and that's a very important learning

238
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,360
that we have to learn that

239
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,120
so rather than feeling

240
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,959
you know bad about oneself that one gets

241
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,959
stressed or tense or reactive

242
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,200
from that nourishing place is okay here

243
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
this is what i have to work with

244
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,640
this is what i have to understand and

245
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,040
learn with i had to see this so that i

246
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,800
could find another way and find the

247
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,640
places of choice to not

248
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,880
give into that too easily

249
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,200
and so

250
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,800
and so we're looking for where's the

251
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,720
well-being

252
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,040
and then to do the things in our lives

253
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,959
that create the conditions for it to be

254
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,080
there

255
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,040
so rushing and being in a hurry

256
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,800
is not conducive to cultivating this

257
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,480
inner well-being

258
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,120
and just that one thing

259
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,480
to dedicate a life plan plan ahead plan

260
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,120
your days

261
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,920
consider your priorities

262
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,360
maybe

263
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,200
do less things

264
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,160
so that you can stay close to what is

265
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,920
nourishing and supportive for this inner

266
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,880
growth

267
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,720
if we're rushing around into too many

268
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,959
things that cannot be there it's kind of

269
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,800
like becomes eclipsed and it doesn't

270
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,839
have a chance to grow

271
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,200
and

272
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,279
initially that might seem like it might

273
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,720
seem like the other things you're doing

274
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,440
rushing around to do are more important

275
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,640
than our own welfare and well-being

276
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,320
but

277
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,680
over time you'll see that this is

278
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,440
probably the most important treasure you

279
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,680
have most valuable thing you have is

280
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,040
more important

281
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,279
than money and

282
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,120
relationships and jobs and

283
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,480
all kinds of activities you might be

284
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,360
doing

285
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,120
not to dismiss the importance of those

286
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,640
things and to the importance of

287
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,839
having them

288
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,839
but to not lose

289
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,279
not not

290
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,200
be involved to them at the expense of

291
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,240
losing

292
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,240
this connection to what benefits

293
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,000
ourselves the connection is inner

294
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,480
goodness this nourishment

295
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,680
and

296
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,880
and the paradox is that as this inner

297
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,880
goodness or nourishment or inner benefit

298
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,040
grows

299
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,959
our relationship to the external world

300
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,959
improves dramatically

301
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,760
and it becomes richer and more valuable

302
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,360
rather than losing the external world

303
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,120
the inner goodness touches the some of

304
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,200
the best qualities of the external world

305
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,839
so um

306
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,440
so benefiting oneself we're allowed to

307
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,279
benefit oneself not only we're allowed

308
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,160
to do it but we're encouraged to do it

309
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
in a way that's not selfish the way

310
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,800
that's not but that really nourishes and

311
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,200
supports the freedom the joy the

312
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,640
happiness the goodness the well-being

313
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,800
that uh can can can

314
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,440
flow from within

315
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,760
so um

316
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,839
the buddha

317
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:51,839
taught

318
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,079
for the benefit and welfare and

319
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,200
happiness

320
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,040
of all beings

321
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,120
including you

322
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,560
and so

323
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,880
it's okay for you

324
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,480
to

325
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,959
pursue your own well-being

326
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,120
you you're doing so you're you're

327
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,360
following the buddha's wishes

328
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,040
may you find

329
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,200
great well-being that you thrive in

330
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,639
well-being in dharmic well-being

331
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,720
may the dharma bring you much joy and

332
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,000
happiness

333
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,240
thank you
