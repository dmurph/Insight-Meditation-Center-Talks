1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:10,800
so hello and welcome everyone welcome to happy hour lovely to be with you and to practice

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,720
together in this moment whatever time zone you're joining in

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:25,359
and whether you're new to a happy hour or you're an old timer so for today's practice

4
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,199
um i'd like to bring in a theme um

5
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:38,320
that is so many favorite themes i have but this one is it's um

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,399
it's a theme of service and how it relates to our attitude

7
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,760
in daily interactions with people so there are many many ways we can show up

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,600
many ways we can show up in the world and a lot of times [Music]

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,239
maybe we show up or we've noticed in the past we show up or we still show up or others show up or let's say human beings

10
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,479
show up with this perspective of what can you do for me what can i get from you like

11
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,960
every interaction how can you satisfy my needs how can you satisfy my needs to be

12
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:24,320
seen to be acknowledged to be recognized to be applauded to be approved

13
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,680
of to be um uh how can you satisfy my my financial

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,360
needs my sexual needs like how what can you give me just this extractive

15
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,119
approach that we might recognize that you know it might be on

16
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:49,680
scene sometimes might be subtle um what if what if and this was really

17
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,719
eye-opening to me years ago to to completely shift that and what if

18
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,840
in every interaction we have um there is a sense of

19
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,720
what can i give what can i give you what can i what can i support you with and it

20
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,280
might be the answer comes up might be kindness um maybe it's a smile maybe it's a gift

21
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,520
or maybe just the stance of generosity of heart but really the stance of

22
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,680
what can i give you what can i do for you how can i serve you how can i be of service

23
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:35,200
and somehow maybe the words to be of service they sound grandiose and they sound big but they need not be

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,200
can just be dropped in into the background of our minds and

25
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:48,560
there's so many beautiful outcomes to this shift and perspective because when

26
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,440
our interactions with others and with the world becomes a matter of generosity a matter

27
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:02,879
of giving a matter of service it's not so much about us but me me me me

28
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,800
and it can bring a lot of freedom and not to say of course there are needs that need

29
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,599
to be satisfied needs for shelter and food and taking care of oneself and also it doesn't mean that we invite people to

30
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:22,319
walk over us it doesn't mean any of that it doesn't mean any of that and of course

31
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,879
one of the beings that we serve if we're serving 360 degrees and carrying

32
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:33,680
360 degrees that includes ourselves

33
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,959
so how can i be of benefit how can i be of benefit in this interaction how can i

34
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:46,480
be of benefit to this other being i'm interacting with and also to myself not in an extractive way it's just an

35
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,120
attitude of not being extractive but one of generosity

36
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:57,200
[Music] that can can make a huge shift and

37
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,200
and having been on this path perhaps for some of you been practicing for a while

38
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,280
you've heard this this teaching on um not self or or

39
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:16,560
impersonality there's so many ways to have insight into that and to acknowledge that and to to to manifest

40
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,840
that and one way is it's not about me it's not about

41
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,800
you know me me me it's not about me it's it's a different interpretation there are many different ways but not to say

42
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,000
this is the only way or limit ourselves to this vision i'm not saying that at all

43
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,080
but if we approach if we approach others if we approach the way we show up in the

44
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,240
world as a way of our gift of generosity i just i'm living for a short time my

45
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,440
life is a brief flash flash of light

46
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:58,720
in the cosmic sense what kind of gifts do i have to give can think of it as a legacy if that

47
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,919
helps you what do i have to give to this person in this moment might be the last

48
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:10,560
moment i interact with them i might be hit by a truck get an aneurysm tomorrow

49
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,160
life is so uncertain what can i give what can i how can i

50
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,520
serve so having that attitude as a shift and maybe i'll invite you to try that of

51
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,400
course we'll explore that in this guided meditation but then as a [Music]

52
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:34,720
weekly practice as a daily life practice um to

53
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:41,120
to bring that into into your mind into your mind when you're interacting

54
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,880
with others with yourself it can really shift and can also lighten a lot

55
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,759
of freedom it can enlighten a lot of suffering into freedom because if we're caught in me me me what am i lacking

56
00:05:53,759 --> 00:06:01,199
what do i need instead this practice brings up a sense of abundance gosh i have so much to give

57
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,199
actually what does this person need maybe they need a patient ear right now maybe they just

58
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:14,080
need me to be silent and not give advice and just listen maybe that's the best thing i can give

59
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,600
right now not be a know-it-all just offer them my presence but what can i

60
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,880
give because sometimes also giving advice could be so that we feel good we've done something you know right like

61
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:33,520
we feel smart but anyway there's so many ways that this attitude of service of giving can uh

62
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,960
and shift conserve so so i've said enough to set the frame and

63
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,600
um i'll start the guided meditation together will be about 30 minutes roughly

64
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,080
sit in a way that you can be comfortable your back straight ideally lying down is okay as long as you don't

65
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,160
fall asleep and as always we start by

66
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,520
blending connecting with the breath with the body spend about 10 minutes settling and then

67
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,160
i'll give some invitations to explore um yeah this this practice of this attitude

68
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,400
of service so here we go so

69
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:25,360
arriving arriving in the body arriving

70
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,840
here here

71
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,160
this moment

72
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,680
letting go releasing any tightness any holding

73
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:15,199
releasing releasing thoughts not that there's anything wrong with thinking but right now we release them

74
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,400
release thoughts for the benefit of ourselves to give our hearts to this

75
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,800
practice in this moment turning away turning turning away giving

76
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,440
up thoughts turning towards this delicious seclusion of the mind the

77
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:41,800
stillness it's so quiet and still in here we just keep stirring it up

78
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,000
turning our gaze inward

79
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,160
dropping dropping your weight into your sit bones

80
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,320
dropping dropping your weight into your feet into your legs

81
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:49,959
with the next out breath releasing releasing into this body

82
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,040
letting awareness connect with the breath

83
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:05,839
in breath out breath received received sense of receptivity

84
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,800
this body knows how to breathe

85
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,480
receiving the breath or let the breath be received

86
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,680
the entirety of the in-breath the entirety of the opera

87
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,160
in the abdomen in the lower abdomen entirely of the inbrea entirety of the

88
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,160
opera

89
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,399
your thoughts arise it's okay it's all right

90
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,200
let there be ease gentleness it's okay sweetheart telling yourself

91
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,839
and release them it's okay it's all right

92
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:50,279
letting the breath be received nourishing [Music]

93
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,320
emptying gently gently

94
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,440
like the waves of the ocean

95
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,959
so

96
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:47,279
and as the breath is being breathed being received

97
00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:00,560
if you allow the breath to be breathed through the body throughout the body

98
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:05,279
sensed as if your entire body

99
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:11,880
is bellowing not effortfully but

100
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,839
energetically

101
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:29,360
the depth of the breath the length doesn't have to change at all

102
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,959
it will make it more forceful and it just be received naturally as it is

103
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:44,320
acknowledging that this breath is nourishing the whole body it's the whole body breathing

104
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,040
i notice sense of and life and aliveness

105
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,600
sense of aliveness that can bring feeling enlivened

106
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:28,000
and let this whole body breathing let it enliven

107
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,840
sense of aliveness aspiration

108
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,400
inspiration

109
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,880
and to awaken a sense of goodness

110
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,039
maybe maybe the area of the heart center

111
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,740
aspiration goodness here i am practicing

112
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:25,640
[Music] showing up as best as i can

113
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,280
feeling feelings goodness sense of goodness

114
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,840
generosity kindness

115
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:28,240
that's your birthright that's who you are internally

116
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,120
breathing with breathing with

117
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:51,200
trusting trusting in the goodness in your own goodness i need your goodness

118
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,679
and let's bring to mind someone who's dear to you you have an easy

119
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:06,960
relationship with could be a person a pet a child

120
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,559
see yourself in their presence

121
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:25,120
with the question in your heart the question how can i serve you

122
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:32,240
how can i how can i be of service more generally

123
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,960
and how can i be of service could be of service to them but also including the relationship how

124
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,600
can i be of service how can i be of benefit includes them the relationship

125
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:52,880
that includes you in this this being who is you

126
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,799
how can i be of benefit

127
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,120
how can i be of service just

128
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:12,000
in your mind's eye i see yourself being there may not be any doing needed

129
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,640
in the scenario just feeling to the space

130
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:30,480
and don't ask the question desperately either just drop it in [Music] as if you were taking

131
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:36,080
a drop of color with a dropper drop off your fair drop of your favorite

132
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,559
color and dropping it into your whole body this attitude

133
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:51,759
defuse but definitely here in your mind's eye in your heart space

134
00:22:52,000 --> 00:23:00,760
how can i be of service what can i give here how can i be of benefit

135
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,840
not necessarily looking for answers but literally there are this letting

136
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:23,000
there be this attitude the spirit of asking the question

137
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:21,760
and notice how your mind how your heart feels with this attitude of being of benefit

138
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,279
is there more gladness more happiness

139
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:34,799
more warmth more care more trust

140
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,278
more stability strength

141
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:42,799
now letting letting that go maybe imagining yourself

142
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:52,200
in the presence of others maybe those you work with if you work or volunteer

143
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,600
or a group maybe family

144
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,840
group that includes a mix of perhaps

145
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,159
dear beings neutral beings maybe those perhaps were challenging too it's okay

146
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:20,880
just a group and imagine yourself you can also simplify this if it gets

147
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,640
too complicated but in the space in your heart's mind

148
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,840
so you're just sitting just taking a splice of time and silence you're frozen

149
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:38,000
taking the moment frozen in time the question how can i be of benefit

150
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,639
all around to everyone myself included

151
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,840
how can i be of service how can i be of benefit

152
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:22,158
and not thinking about it just breathing breathing with this aspiration through your heart center

153
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:35,640
how can i be of benefit my presence my gifts

154
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:30,000
maybe it's just a feeling of radiating kindness radiating good well

155
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:39,600
how can i be of benefit all around

156
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,679
how can i serve

157
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:36,320
and letting this go letting that go in your mind's eye

158
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:45,039
now if you like you don't have to but maybe there's one interaction that

159
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:50,960
didn't quite go well or maybe you felt like

160
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:57,240
you had an extractive attitude interacting with someone

161
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,278
in the recent past

162
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:12,559
if you like if you wish you can bring that up to to awareness

163
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:19,760
and if you don't find anything that's fine just stay with one of the previous scenarios

164
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:26,000
radiating kindness and service but if there is something that felt like

165
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,760
just yeah that attitude of mine wasn't very helpful for me

166
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:40,720
it caused suffering for me and others bring bring this scenario to mind

167
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:47,519
your mind's eye and imagine if in the midst of this exchange

168
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:53,840
interaction you had an attitude of wanting to be of benefit

169
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:59,249
realizing you are an impermanent being [Music]

170
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:05,518
every interaction is unique and it could be your last

171
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:14,720
if your attitude was one of service being of benefit

172
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:21,120
to yourself and others and the scenario

173
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:27,518
how would you how would you act how would you have acted perhaps

174
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:37,158
not thinking too much but just dropping this question in and see what arises maybe nothing arises it's fine

175
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,559
note the difference

176
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,119
i'm dropping this scenario also

177
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:15,040
let yourself let there be this question living this question how can i be of benefit

178
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,599
how can i serve

179
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,838
others the world this being who is me

180
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:39,599
how can i be of service this living this precious human birth of mine

181
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:47,520
all these gifts that i have all these opportunities yes i do have challenges of course

182
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:54,240
everyone does of course i do i have so many gifts

183
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:01,119
so much to give how can i be of benefit

184
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:09,720
in ways small or not so small

185
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,078
radiating radiating your goodness

186
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,920
letting your light shine

187
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:35,079
may all beings everywhere be safe

188
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:40,160
may all beings everywhere be happy

189
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:47,599
may all beings everywhere be healthy

190
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,400
may all beings everywhere are these

191

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,800
as best as i'm able to may all beings everywhere

193
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,640
including myself be free

194

[Music]

195
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,720
thank you thanks everyone thanks for your practice

196
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:41,760
so [Music] how can i be of service how can i be of service

197
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:48,320
we have a few minutes for reflections that might have come up

198
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,079
from your practice questions comments anything is welcome and i'd like to

199
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:01,920
invite you if you haven't spoken recently in the group you can raise your hand your zoom

200
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:09,440
hand i won't see your physical hand um or you may also type in chat

201
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:15,040
um if it's to everyone then i'll read your name if it's just to me it'll be private

202
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:21,440
i'll just read your reflection is there anything that you noticed was there an aha moment for you perhaps

203
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,000
you'd like to share

204
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:35,760
i'm not sure how to articulate this but something about the difference between

205
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:43,200
giving to please others or fix things or

206
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:49,599
fulfill a need versus really being receptive

207
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:55,839
and responsive when you ask that question how can it be of service like that feels really

208
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:01,920
different yeah and i had an interaction today where you

209
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,640
know i was just revisiting it in my head and i was like wow if i had just paused

210
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:15,200
and sort of like let myself like sort of ask that question i feel like

211
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,800
i would have had a really different interaction yeah so it wasn't like a

212
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,160
as as much like a transactional like what can i get from you but more like

213
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,760
what can i give you to make you happy you know yeah

214
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,599
but that wasn't really what was needed maybe yeah you know

215
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:43,920
yeah beautiful thank you thank you for that i really appreciate you

216
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:50,240
bringing more depth and nuance to this question because it's not just extractive it's also sometimes where i

217
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,280
just want to give you what you want right now so that you don't bother me or i think like you know there's it's some

218
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:02,960
ways of giving which are not responsive just as you were saying that are reactive maybe reactive and not people

219
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:09,280
like you might ask somebody what can i give you like how can i be of service and they'd say oh i need this specific

220
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:16,480
thing but that might and you give that but that isn't actually what you have to offer or like right that doesn't feel

221
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:21,520
good for you to give right right exactly and it also may not

222
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:27,359
be a question that you know how can i be of benefit maybe that's a better question this one or

223
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:33,760
maybe how can i be of service not something that you necessarily ask them out loud but it's what you're thinking

224
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:40,720
yourself deeply and as a way of orienting you that's more important than yeah

225
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,640
that orientation inner orientation will determine the correct words to say outward

226
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,920
which might even be silence but yeah the internal orientation

227
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,359
yeah thank you thank you thanks for that extra nuance and depth there appreciate

228
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,520
it lovely um

229
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:14,720
bill says thank you nikki wonderful meditation you're welcome thank you for your practice bill and here is a um

230
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:21,440
private reflection this practice was beautiful and also challenged me for someone who struggles to identify and

231
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:27,440
honor my own limits it feels like a thin line between how can i be of service and

232
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,800
losing myself can you talk about wise discernment in this space yes absolutely

233
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:39,440
very important um and i was trying to bring that in uh also

234
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,800
but i would i'll speak to it more directly because it's very important

235
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:49,920
that you know how may i be of benefit how may i be of service it needs to

236
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:56,000
include you it needs to include yourself it needs to be 360 degrees it's just

237
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,599
like the practice of metta when we practice metta say we're radiating meta

238
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:09,119
when it's radiating out of our chest whom does it contact first well it contacts us first it brings

239
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,800
us the goodness first and then it's radiated out and and touches all other human beings

240
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,079
so so there is the sense of yes this question of how can i be of service how

241
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:27,680
can i be of benefit it includes you and in in buddhism there is the sense of you

242
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:34,880
are as important as other beings it's not a sense of sacrificing yourself or just

243
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:41,680
there's no difference you are as worthy as everybody else so um

244
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:47,119
the sense of caring for yourself sometimes actually you might be asking yourself the question how can i be of

245
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,880
benefit sweetheart how can i serve you how can i love you better and maybe if

246
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:58,400
there is challenges with limits and honoring identity

247
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:04,319
honoring your own limits it might be if you wanted to engage in

248
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:09,359
this practice to actually step out to step out of yourself for a moment and

249
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:14,400
imagine you're you know you and this other person say in an interaction say

250
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,880
how can i serve these two people one of them being yourself so that you are included in

251
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,319
that care and that love like oh yeah this is what serves both of them this is

252
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:32,960
equally as if you know they were twins how can i serve both of these not

253
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:39,359
because sometimes if we have the perspective of just our bodies out of these eyes and perspective can

254
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:46,000
shift but when we step out of ourselves and see the relationship or how can i be of benefit to this relationship that

255
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,119
could be one way to have to bring in wise discernment

256
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:58,079
and you can let me know in chat if that helps enough or if there's more needed there

257
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:04,400
okay you're welcome um great

258
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,640
cheer hi nikki hi thank you for the meditation that was

259
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:16,880
really useful and i was new here and i knew here so it's my first time here so thank you for getting welcome welcome

260
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:23,359
lovely um actually the previous question resonated with me a lot about like how can we be

261
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:31,440
and then you answer that question right that really helps me so when i was doing meditation um my two days basically stay was just

262
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,880
like super busy at work and then responding to a lot of requests and then

263
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:43,839
and then i just feel like i need to sit down that's why i joined this meditation and then when you

264
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:50,800
guided me saying like how can i be served as service i think about myself how can i get service for myself and

265
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,920
what can i do i think well like maybe what i did today was to make a decision

266
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,960
and be here instead of like spending this hour in front of my laptop

267
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,160
and doing work right so that's actually the concrete thing i did when i

268
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:11,920
uh when i follow you like how can i yes there is myself i want to make a decision every time i make a decision

269
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:18,240
and when i want to think that is it am i limited is he like hurting my limit or

270
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:24,319
like is he good for myself right so i'm just curious my question and then that has been really helpful i just want to

271
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:30,079
say that and then i feel better after doing this half an about meditation i feel less a lot like i feel more settled

272
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:36,240
downs so my question to you is that do you feel that's a good techniques like just

273
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:43,440
contemplate that or do you have more uh concrete uh guidance in terms of how to think

274
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:50,880
through like things when when when i feel like exactly right yeah yeah this is great i

275
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:56,560
so appreciate i mean what one thing that i heard you say is is um

276
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:03,440
you know i sort of appreciate your inner wisdom that your inner wisdom decided okay how can i be of service okay the best way i can be of service to everyone

277
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:09,839
right nice to take care of me this person who is me i'm really stressed out i've had a long hard day and the best

278
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:15,839
way is to take care of me and sit and meditate and be in sangha like and and

279
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:22,480
yes of course that's supportive and beautiful so so you've interpreted this

280
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:28,720
this practice perfectly well it includes you and how may i be of benefit how may

281
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:34,000
i be of service is towards yourself and in fact this at that that

282
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,520
you know when i was talking about being extractive sometimes we're extractive towards ourselves we're like work hard

283
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:46,079
harder right there's so so it's it's just being of benefit so beautiful well done so if

284
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:52,480
i did the right thing yeah yeah beautiful yeah thank you so much thank you lovely

285
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:58,319
lovely so so dear ones let's turn let's turn

286
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:06,000
our attention now to practice together in uh in small groups and let's take

287
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,839
this same attitude to small groups of roughly size three in

288
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:18,880
small sangha and how can i show up how can i be of benefit to myself to others and maybe

289
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:27,760
being of benefit is just holding space for others and listening with kindness with care maybe that's how we can be of

290
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:33,200
benefit um so so in small groups each person will

291
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:40,160
speak from their experience only and you can say past when it comes to you you want to be silent it's okay

292
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:47,359
only speak from your own experience not commenting reflecting not managing the

293
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:53,599
group or other people's experience asking probing questions it's just from your own personal experience

294
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,800
the next person will speak from their own personal experience and then the third person will come back to you again

295
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,920
so each person will say one nugget and we'll go around and round a few times

296
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:10,079
and um how can i be of benefit how can i how can i serve that's the question let

297
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:16,720
that be kind as if it's a mantra in the back of your head you're not saying it out loud but yeah how can i speak um not

298
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:23,920
educate it's not about educating or impressing anyone but how can i share from my experience just a few words if

299
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:29,839
you wish from how this practice was for you the insights that you came that came up for you that often

300
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:35,280
helps others they can have their ahas when they hear your aha or when they hear your

301
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:41,280
challenge oh yes yes common humanity so with that spirit of kindness

302
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,319
we enter the space take care of yourself take care of each other

303
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:53,200

304

305
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:07,440

306

308
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:26,480
