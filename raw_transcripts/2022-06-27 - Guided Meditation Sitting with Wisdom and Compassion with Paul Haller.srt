1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,040
and as psychologists would tell us that

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,759
in that taking it personally we

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,520
we're endeavoring to [Music]

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,519
live we're endeavoring to [Music]

5
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,720
have the life we're living um

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,920
become to flourish

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,039
you know so uh

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,480
and and so we there is a way in which each moment of

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:53,440
contact with experience stimulates something uh

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,359
quite deep in us and especially when we're practicing mindfulness when

11
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,360
we're opening to it as it is so this notion

12
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,600
of

13
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:18,159
wisdom it is what it is and compassion

14
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,799
we have a deep deep impulse to take it personally

15
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:32,000
and and to find within some expression of our being

16
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:43,280
so now i'll give some guidance around meditation

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:51,119
and if you could keep those that notion of wisdom and compassion

18
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:01,280
the practice of mindfulness is to be aware to let each moment be what it is

19
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,759
and for us with our human and psychological

20
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:15,840
impulses that can have a great variety of expression

21
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,200
and as we start to sit if we can just sort of let that

22
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,720
proposition sink in

23
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,680
in this 30 minutes or so this 25 minutes now

24
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,480
we will um evoke

25
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,440
the narrative of our life we will evoke

26
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,760
the psychological significance and associated thoughts and memories and

27
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:01,280
emotions that arise for us

28
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,760
in the moment and it is what it is

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,760
and it's a deeply personal experience

30
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,760
it can that evoke within us a kind of steady deliberateness

31
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,159
as you start to come into awareness of your being

32
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,480
noticing your state of mind

33
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,519
it is what it is

34
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,879
and it's also this ongoing expression

35
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,360
of relating psychologically to being

36
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,120
with its psychological significance and its emotional

37
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,840
expression

38
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,919
and in seated meditation you know whether you're sitting cross-legged

39
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,520
or sitting in a chair or even if you're standing

40
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,560
there's a the long-standing tradition

41
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:08,000
of bringing awareness to the body so that as our experience unfolds

42
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,440
it it's like we are embodying it

43
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,000
and as you bring awareness to the body

44
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,000
inviting the body to find a stability

45
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,840
the classic way is that we

46
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,600
notice where we're making contact with the earth

47
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,960
whether we're sitting in the cushion and sitting in a chair

48
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:02,199
however we're entering the moment of awareness

49
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,759
and if you can notice that contact

50
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:21,840
in any way sort of press died very gently

51
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:29,840
it makes sense to press down with the sit bones usually that's

52
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,280
in the center of where we're making contact

53
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,680
and then defined an brightness

54
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,599
anatomically that can be described as

55
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:04,000
so the pelvis settles down makes contact

56
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:12,720
finds its stability and then the torso rises up

57
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,440
from the pelvis from the

58
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,120
hips

59
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,680
and as it rises up

60
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:38,918
the chest opens the shoulders wide

61
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:52,800
not in a strenuous way just like releasing

62
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,159
any way in which your body is contracting

63
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,919
in each time we sit we go through

64
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,879
process of discovery what's going on in my body

65
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,599
in this sin

66
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,440
how is it embodying

67
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,840
this at this moment

68
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,719
letting the chest open

69
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,320
letting the muscles of the face relax

70
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,480
as we bring these guiding

71
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,800
ways of paying attention acknowledging that

72
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:19,760
we're not trying to dictate just trying to open up

73
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:28,000
awareness in the body and your body will react respond

74
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,160
in whatever way it does it is what it is

75
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,640
and then to become aware of the breath

76
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:09,760
and noticing what happens when you bring attention to the breath

77
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,800
what's noticed

78
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:31,240
this might have an agenda

79
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,920
there's the morning happy judging

80
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,000
we can and usually do take anything

81
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,600
and everything personal

82
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:04,120
so weird that's what it is

83
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,360
can you offer yourself this moment

84
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:28,199
a deep acceptance of what you are

85
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,320
sometimes it can be helpful

86
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:55,120
to open with the inhale to receive

87
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,200
whatever is happening in the moment

88
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,240
thought physical sensation the memory

89
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:12,720
and emotion just breathe it in

90
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,240
and let it be embodied

91
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,160
and with the exhale

92
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,680
release so be it

93
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,000
return let go

94
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,320
nature of life is changed

95
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,480
can you awareness have a compassion

96
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,880
can tenderly hold what's arising

97
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,120
in consciousness

98
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:47,120
can there be a deliberateness in acceptance

99
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,240
of just now just as it is

100
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,600
however it is

101
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,278
however it's being related to

102
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,320
uh

103
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,010
[Music]

104
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,569
[Music]

105
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:23,600
each time we meditate each time we practice mindfulness

106
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,520
we're opening to a

107
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,320
greater being

108
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,720
i think we all know especially if you've read something on buddhism

109
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,720
the term dukkha which is generally translated as

110
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:52,799
suffering but this this too

111
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,480
the this is do and cup

112
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,919
means consciousness and the do

113
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:10,000
means constricted contracted

114
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,240
and then there's another term that you may know

115
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:22,720
it's the same consciousness but the su means

116
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:30,000
expanded or opening opening consciousness

117
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:38,400
and then the same way the dukkha is usually translated as suffering

118
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:46,720
the sukkah is usually translated as pleasant experience

119
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,880
so so this way in sitting

120
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:02,080
where we're inviting a deliberateness

121
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:08,799
a steadiness we're inviting an acceptance

122
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,400
we're inviting sukkah

123
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:23,039
we're we're inviting dukkha to soften

124
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,520
and we do it in the context

125
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:38,000
of subjective because experience

126
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:46,640
each moment that arises for us is an extraordinary product of the complexity of being

127
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:53,120
there's all sorts of influences and habit energies

128
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,360
that bring forth more

129
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:07,520
there's so many ways to dissect it neurologically psychologically

130
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,399
somatically

131
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:20,080
and in the throes of all of that we're taking it personally

132
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:26,559
whether it's inwardly arisen or it's the product to

133
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:32,960
of external eggs influences

134
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,600
what someone said to us what someone did

135
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,320
it can be made with this essence of mindfulness

136
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:54,000
which is inviting expansion which is inviting acceptance

137
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,159
which is inviting liberation

138
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,440
and then we carry the glimpses the tastes

139
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:15,840
of that liberation of percussion and into our life

140
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:23,520
so maybe today you can think about

141
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:29,760
that process especially as you're in the midst of your

142
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,760
activities your interactions

143
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,600
sometimes it's very helpful to ask ourselves okay

144
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:49,760
how is that being held in the body are my shoulders tightening

145
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:55,919
is my chest constricting is my mind constricted

146
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,440
and becoming agitated

147
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:10,398
and there's a way in which the emotionality of it all can be like an energy

148
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,919
when we open to emotion we open to emotion

149
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:21,279
we open to [Music] an intriguing way

150
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:27,279
in which our body and consciousness respond

151
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:34,200
to the significance of psychological being in that moment

152
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,000
in the midst of that motion in the midst of that activity

153
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:48,880
can there be a kind of stability that arises from

154
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:55,679
acceptance and acceptance is the blend

155
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,679
of the wisdom and compassion so be it

156
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,720
this is what it is and

157
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,760
we take it personally and there's can that

158
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,360
evoke a tenderness

159
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:24,240
because often in taking it personally we're imbuing it

160
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,000
with something of our own anxieties and desires

161
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,200
and struggles you know it's not like we will dukkah for

162
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:43,039
ourselves it arises out of our being as we are attempting to live

163
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:48,880
as we're attempting to make our life flourish

164
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:56,799
it's evoking you know it's asking for compassion

165
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:03,039
it's asking for a deep appreciation of the human condition our own

166
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,080
and everyone else's

167
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:15,840
can we bring that opening to greater being to our day

168
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:26,159
can can you hold it on a feeling level can you hold it on a physical somatic

169
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,000
level can you hold it as an attitude

170
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,440
like when someone says something aggressive or disturbing for you

171
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,600
can you remind yourself with the kind of compassionate patients

172
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,640
oh they're going through something so be it

173
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,559
