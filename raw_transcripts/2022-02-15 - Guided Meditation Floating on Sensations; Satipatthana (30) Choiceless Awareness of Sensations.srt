00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:11,360
hello everyone and welcome to the meditation session

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:19,039
and now as we're doing the section of this sati patana suta on

3
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:27,039
what's usually called mindfulness of the four elements i like to call a mindfulness of the four properties

4
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,520
i'd like to do a meditation on these four and

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,079
what it involved is first beginning with just settling in in the usual way

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,239
and then at some point shifting the focus from the breath i

7
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:51,440
like to have the breathing as a primary focus for meditation the anchor

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:59,359
but to let go of it to some degree and open the attention up

9
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:06,000
to uh have the awareness kind of in a relaxed way gently slowly

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,760
calmly let the awareness float around the body

11
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,880
to [Music] become aware of the different sensations

12
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:23,680
in the body as they appear as they call attention as awareness floats in that direction

13
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,240
so it's a kind of random maybe and there's not much choice sometimes this

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,360
kind of meditation is called choiceless or directionless we're not necessarily directing the attention anywhere

15
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,680
but we are staying in the body to feel the sensations and just kind of move

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,000
the attention moves or different things kind of parts of the body speak and some of them become predominant and

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,600
strong and we're resting there for a while and something else sooner or later will get our attention

18
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,799
and shift and change or if it's a compelling area of the body

19
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,399
it might be that this such the attention wants to stay there it seems appropriate to stay there but

20
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,959
within that area the attention kind of floats around and feels different doesn't get fixated it

21
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:19,040
doesn't get zeroed in on something but rather kind of just feels it around

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,920
and the analogy that's uh you know given is having a bowl or a bell bra spell and just taking

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,959
a cloth and and wiping it from all the different sides so just kind of randomly kind of be with

24
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,080
something specific floating around on it until something else takes it takes in

25
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:45,440
your attention so it's mindfulness of the body but with the kind of choiceless floating

26
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,560
awareness that takes in slowly gradually

27
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,800
whatever wants to come so beginning by assuming a meditation

28
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,920
posture and it can be helpful if the posture

29
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,680
itself expresses the intention

30
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,760
to be present to be here in this place in this time

31
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,480
sometimes a posture where we start feeling a strong good foundation

32
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:32,920
for the to hold the weight of our body and to feel that contact

33
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,159
sometimes a posture that is sitting upright

34
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,360
alert

35
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,080
gently closing the eyes

36
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,840
and then gently slowly some little bit deeper breaths

37
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,320
using the inhale to connect here to the body now

38
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,479
letting the exhale be a time to relax and let go into here

39
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,800
and now

40
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:59,680
breathing in and breathing out and then letting your attention your breathing come back to normal

41
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:08,600
and for a few more breaths relax your body on the exhale

42
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,479
on your exhale see if there can be a settling into your

43
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:38,758
body deep in your body so that you're here in your body

44
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:57,680
on the exhale relaxing the thinking mind

45
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:05,280
any pressure or energy to think any tension associated with thinking

46
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,840
perhaps an exhale that can be softened

47
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,600
ironed out

48
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,639
and then gently now letting your awareness

49
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,759
be free to wander around your body

50
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,080
the whole body becomes the anchor to the present moment

51
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,759
the whole body is the

52
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,638
where awareness resides

53
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,400
but within the body let your attention your mindfulness

54
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,400
not be directed but rather receptive and open to

55
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:18,400
wherever sensations appear wherever attention wants to go in the

56
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,800
body

57
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:33,520
there's a lot of sensations don't try to rush between them just in a relaxed way

58
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,560
settle for a moment in one place where there are sensations

59
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,759
and then as as the mind wants as the body speaks

60
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:50,319
let the attention float somewhere else or if it feels nice you can just let the

61
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,199
attention rest in one place

62
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,639
maybe gently letting the attention float in that particular area

63
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,440
taking it all in

64
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:34,639
noticing when the mind gets caught up in thoughts and ideas

65
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:44,079
see if you can set them tension free again so it can freely roam

66
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,800
through the body in the body

67
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,880
taking in whatever sensations appear and disappear

68
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,760
appear and persist

69
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,920
whatever calls the attention to it

70
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:41,279
perhaps there can be a global awareness within which

71
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,839
a more intimate mindfulness attention floats

72
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:55,279
around and touches different parts of the body

73
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,320
as the sensations there become known

74
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:56,640
rooted in the body letting the flow of bodily sensations

75
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:04,679
be known in an open relaxed awareness

76
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:33,760
settling settling back and observing the flow of sensations in

77
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,840
the body

78
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,600
as we come to the end of the sitting

79
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:18,240
for the next few exhales ride the exhale into your body more

80
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:25,840
deeply ride the inhale

81
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,919
to spread your awareness through your body

82
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:50,398
for a few moments here almost as if you let gravity

83
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:58,360
settle your awareness deeper into the fullness of your body

84
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,360
and then as if your body

85
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:20,080
is an organ of perception like the eyes and with the body

86
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:27,840
you could feel or sense or take in the people of the world

87
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:37,200
not through the eyes not through the usual mind and ideas of

88
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,679
self but this with a deeper

89
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,039
the body itself

90
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:58,200
in some way can know there are others on this planet

91
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:07,919
just as our body is made from materials that rises out of the earth

92
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:15,679
so does their bodies just as you have sensations in your body

93
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:21,600
of pleasure and pain so do they

94
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:31,840
just as your body is the house which holds

95
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:40,360
your heart so it is for them

96
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,960
and perhaps we could end this sitting

97
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:58,639
with feelings of warmth and tenderness and care for others

98
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:06,880
calmly peacefully from this place where we're meditating

99
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:12,799
a simple warmth and tenderness gentleness

100
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,640
in which goodwill can glow

101
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,520
radiate from us

102
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:30,559
may all beings be happy

103
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,919
may all beings be safe

104
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,000
may all beings be peaceful

105
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,600
and may all beings be free

106
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:59,089
[Music]

107
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,170
[Music]

108
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:23,039
so hello and so this will be the last talk on

109
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,919
this fifth exercise of the sati patana suta the exercise on

110
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:36,799
mindfulness of the elements or what i like to call is mindfulness of the properties

111
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:43,600
the earth property the water property the fire property and the

112
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:49,120
air property and this is a meditation mindfulness of

113
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:55,919
sensations so the basic sensory awareness exercise of just being

114
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:03,360
present for the sensations that are direct and immediate as they occur for ourselves

115
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:09,760
and there's a variety of ways of practicing this and one of the ways is the way we did in

116
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:16,320
the meditation today which some people find easier than meditating on their breath

117
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:23,440
and that is to just be just be grounded in the sensations of the body if the mind wanders off come

118
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:29,039
back to the body and the flow of sensations with the the attention

119
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:35,279
not particularly not any more directed to the body than it is to the whole body just there

120
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:41,600
rooted in the body and then floating and roaming around touching into the present moment with

121
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:48,960
the different sensations as they flow through and come into being some people find that they their

122
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,080
breathing actually works as a better anchor to the present if they stay there they can develop their stability their

123
00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:01,200
concentration and their mindfulness and there also it's a sensation meditation it's the same meditation

124
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:08,000
but now we're doing the being aware of all the sensations that come into play as we breathe

125
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,679
so technically the this four elements meditation

126
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,720
is what we're doing in vipassana when we're tuning into the breathing

127
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:25,440
now the attention though is in a much narrower smaller area of our body just in the area where the breathing occurs

128
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:32,638
or where the breathing is predominant and um and so we are um

129
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:38,638
we're there with the flow of sensations the and we let maybe the attention kind

130
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,878
of float within the location where we're focusing on the breathing and letting the sensations

131
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:51,520
come into that floating awareness or let the floating awareness settle and the ripple of sensations that come into play

132
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,240
as we get quieter and quieter and the breathing gets stiller and quieter it's easier to kind of just stay with the

133
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:04,800
simple sensations that come and go as we breathe it's still a sensation meditation it's still this four element meditation that

134
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:11,040
we're doing but because it's it's more rooted in a particular place some people find it

135
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,640
easier the mind doesn't wander off as much and it's easier to settle in simpler that way

136
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:23,280
and as i said some people find it simpler to do the whole body some people uh what we do is sometimes

137
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,200
in mindfulness as we uh what i like to teach is we are rooted in the breathing that's

138
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,640
kind of like the default that's the place we cultivate stability and steadiness of mind to stay in the

139
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,800
present moment but if something other sensation arises in the body that's more compelling

140
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,359
then we contentedly relaxedly let the attention flow to that other

141
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:53,200
place and then begin doing the sensation meditation in that place in the knees or the back

142
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,640
or wherever the sensations might be strong and there too the idea is not to fixate

143
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:06,000
the attention but rather to uh let it roam around let it come like you're like you're

144
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,640
you know maybe like you're touching a cave wall in the dark and you can't see it but you just let your hand

145
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,920
go around and feel the wall and the texture the temperature or the

146
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,440
whatever it might be so

147
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,640
but the direction that it's going with this kind of sensation meditation is the

148
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:35,839
same direction as all the different exercises of sati patana and that is to be able to steady stable

149
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:41,599
enough in the present moment the mind is not wandering off anymore we're right here in the present moment

150
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:49,440
and then um and we're just feeling the experience and because the mind is now stable and not wandering off easily then

151
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:55,520
we can settle back and just observe the experience and this idea of observing

152
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:02,800
the experience is meant to be a peaceful experience that

153
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,560
we're not interfering or making a lot of work it's very receptive allowing

154
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,839
just observing it as the flow of sensations the experience as it comes through

155
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:19,440
and in particular as we settle back and there's more more stability in the present moment we're just right in the

156
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,119
present moment then we see that in the present moment everything is passing everything is

157
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,240
moving i don't know if it's a good analogy but

158
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:37,440
if you uh take you know an old uh film that's made up of all these little squares that

159
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:43,280
and you have it passed by you have a little little slot and you have the each frame

160
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:50,240
come in front of the slot to come in front then another one comes in slot if you just settle back and watch then you

161
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,920
see that there's they just allowed if one comes one comes one comes

162
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:02,560
and now you see they come and they go they come and they go so in some kind of relaxed flowing way

163
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:08,640
we start seeing more and more things just come and go and come and go and this opens up to

164
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,720
deeper places than now of letting go of not clinging so that's the direction we're going

165
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:20,800
and but how do we get there one ways and the tradition

166
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,920
is um that uh is if a look at the analogy or the

167
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,960
simile that's used for this particular exercise i think it's so the simile is

168
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,000
if we do the four uh the four element meditation being aware of the sensations

169
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,440
in these four categories and um and it's like a

170
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:51,280
uh so i'm sorry for this little graphic that but a butcher who has uh cut out cut up a cow

171
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:58,880
and to um and put out the different pieces of the cow for uh people to maybe come and buy or

172
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,000
something and at this point people are not relating to

173
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,440
the pieces of meat as the cow is just pieces of meat

174
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:15,680
you know and they see the pieces of meat independent of the cow so i think maybe it's unfortunate

175
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:21,200
for many of us this graphic kind of analogy but the idea is that um

176
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:28,000
we often are living in thoughts and ideas of that we take in our whole self like how

177
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,280
we identify ourselves in a particular way some of the identities are accurate enough

178
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,640
but if we live in the whole the identity then we miss the parts

179
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,960
and this is a meditation to not be in the idea of the whole but rather to begin

180
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:51,280
tuning into the particular elements parts that make up the whole or that we apply

181
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,119
the concepts and ideas to and so for example if i was to think i'm a

182
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:05,040
lousy person that's a generalization of the whole if i then feel the sensations of my hand

183
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:12,480
the sensations themselves are just sensations and there's no lousiness in the hands and no sensations it's just

184
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:19,440
if i think i'm a great person that's a generalization if i think i'm a lousy person whatever it is

185
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,640
and uh and the um the um

186
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,839
the um the idea is to kind of have an

187
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:36,000
experience of ourselves where we drop below the coarser identities the coarser ideas

188
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:42,000
of who we are because often those ideas are sources of suffering

189
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,680
and even if they're sources of happiness they can also be they limit us

190
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,280
to drop into this deeper settled relaxed observing place observing the present

191
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,480
moment as it flows by so by beginning to look at this at the

192
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:03,760
sensation level of experience we're looking at the parts in a sense

193
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:10,560
of the cow not the cow as a whole we're looking at the parts of ourselves not the generalizations of what we have of

194
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:17,520
who we are and so we're dropping down to a deeper level and this is can be quite healing quite

195
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:24,800
healthy to do this because some of the ideas and attachments to the ideas that we have

196
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:31,839
involve contractions and tightness and they involve a disconnect

197
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:36,960
with our lived flowing bodily experience and to be able to drop down into the

198
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,319
lived bodily experience and let that flow the sensations flow and move and

199
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:48,480
not be bottled up not be restricted not be contracted is a really healthy spiritually really

200
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:55,280
healthy physically just a healthy thing mentally to be in this kind of flow of sensations

201
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:01,520
where the mind is not fixated on its painful ideas or it's whatever ideas

202
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:07,359
it has so um

203
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:16,480
so this idea of dropping down into the parts to the direct experience what's actually

204
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:22,079
happening more than the you know the ideas and thoughts about things

205
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,280
is part of what this exercise is about what it helps us to do

206
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:34,079
is to bring the mind and body together in harmony if the mind is thinking about tomorrow

207
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:41,440
or yesterday thinking about fantasies delusions of grandeur delusions of

208
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:48,400
for me or something uh we tend to be disconnected from our bodies

209
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,640
and um and the body is always in the present moment and so the task of meditation is

210
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:00,800
to when we want to harmonize the body and mind is to let the mind join where the body

211
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,480
is and since the body has a lot to do with sensations that's where we can find the harmony

212
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:12,480
that's where you can find the meeting the joining better than if we just stay conceptually

213
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,480
thinking about how wonderful the body is and celebrating the body with ideas we're in the sensation level of

214
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,000
experience and that's where this harmony happens is coming together

215
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,319
and this will see as we move on in this becomes really helpful

216
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:35,839
for to to connect to deeper dimensions of our heart deeper dimensions of our inner life

217
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:42,480
so we'll get there and but tomorrow we'll do the start uh doing a few

218
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:49,280
sessions on the sixth exercise of sativatana and i want to uh maybe i should warn you

219
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:56,000
that this involves contemplation maybe even visualization

220
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,520
of of corpse and um and i'm not going to make it

221
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,680
graphic but it'll be kind of very simple but this is the exercise there's

222
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:14,160
actually nine different uh contemplations on the progressive decay of a corpse

223
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,920
and i don't think it's meant to be gruesome um but it's meant to somehow in its own

224
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:26,480
way help us maybe value at the present moment and really show up

225
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:33,200
here in the present moment so that there's a qualitatively improved

226
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:39,440
aliveness to our attention and dedication to this present moment experience

227
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,240
so hopefully

228
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:51,280
this will be supportive for you to spend a couple of days on this quartz corpse com

229
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:56,319
contemplation it's a long tradition in buddhism to contemplate death

230
00:44:56,319 --> 00:45:01,520
and so we'll do that for a few days as part of this satipatana suta

231
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,240
so thank you
