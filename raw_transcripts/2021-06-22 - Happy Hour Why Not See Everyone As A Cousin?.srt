1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,120
so so hello everyone hello and welcome to happy hour

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:16,720
this uh this first day of uh of summer june 21st

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,359
and first day of oh that means winter in the southern hemisphere wow okay

4
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,560
so we've just turned the corner here we are so

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,509
so for today's practice um [Music]

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,800
yeah so what i'd like to invite is to consider

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:50,960
um is how our way of seeing

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,399
our way of seeing really creates really fabricates friends

9
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:07,200
enemies dear ones neutral people it's it's it's in so many ways

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:15,360
these categories these are categories fabrication of our minds

11
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:21,280
haven't you noticed that actually someone who maybe at some point was in one

12
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,799
category then becomes in turn you know maybe they say something that

13
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:34,320
that upsets you and then instead of being your dear person for a few days they become your difficult person and maybe resolve

14
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,520
it and they become your your benefactor again or your dear friend or

15
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:47,600
or just these these categories are so um elastic

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:55,920
elastic and and how the same person can be our uh both perhaps benefactor

17
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,159
good friend as well as or uh challenging the person we have challenges with

18
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,239
same with us we can be our own you know we can be in all these different categories

19
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:14,480
so so these categories aren't fixed aren't really

20
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:21,599
fixed they're they are a way of seeing a way of relating a way

21
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:29,120
of seeing another through our lens through the lens of me myself and mine how you make me feel

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,840
today or this month or this year or this decade [Music]

23
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:42,239
and and um again a particular person is neither

24
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,760
challenging or neutral or or dear just because of because of who

25
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:56,000
they are but how how we see them so there is really this is one way one way where the

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,440
practice of emptiness

27
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,599
now as i bring this word please don't get scared like oh my god now she's going to talk about emptiness and i don't know what the heck that is and

28
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,959
those are higher teachings and relax i already explained to you everything i was going to explain so if

29
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:21,440
you understood what i said that's it so this is one aspect of emptiness avoidness

30
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:28,080
co-fabrication creation the way that we see the way that we see the world it's

31
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,440
really empty it's really empty it's not an inherent property

32
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:41,840
of the people it's just the way we see them we make them we relate to them in these ways

33
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,959
and these qualities again it's not inherent in the person it's we fabricate it given the way that

34
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,040
we see in a given moment it depends on our way of seeing

35
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,760
and they're not inherent so so that's where one of the ways that

36
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:09,760
the practice the realization of emptiness voidness is just it's it's so elastic it's so free it's also

37
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,920
free it's much less fixed than we take it to be actually this practice of emptiness in

38
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,079
this way brings so much freedom so much ease it brings freedom

39
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:29,600
oh yes it's the way i'm seeing it's the way i'm fabricating so given that it's my way of saying

40
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,759
given that it's so malleable well why don't i malleat

41
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,840
why why don't i make it into uh why don't i see everyone as a friend i

42
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,040
have a choice so what if i saw everybody as a friend

43
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:53,520
what would happen to my perception what would happen to this world that i

44
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,600
live in if everyone was a friend if i saw everyone if the way of seeing the way of

45
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:06,639
fabricating was a friendly one how would my experience of being in this

46
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:13,039
world operating how would it shift and change so

47
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,479
so with that as the preamble i also want to give credit this idea

48
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:28,240
came up to share with you as i was listening to a beautiful talk by my favorite teacher of mine rob berbea

49
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:38,479
passed away last year and this talk is was entitled um

50
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:45,280
love healing and emptiness and it's from 2010 and i trust later deal neil will look it

51
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,039
up later and we'll share with you for any one who might be interested again the name is

52
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:58,160
love healing and emptiness it's on dharmaseed and it's by rob burbea

53
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,639
so so with all of that and having given credit to giving i'm an academic so it's important to

54
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:10,479
give credit where ideas come from well it's important for everyone but anyway let's

55
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:18,000
start our practice our formal practice of guided meditation so so

56
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,759
i'd like to invite you to get into your posture

57
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,600
whatever posture might be supportive for

58
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:40,960
you whether sitting lying down standing or

59
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:48,400
even walking

60
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:57,440
turning turning your gaze inward first to arrive and settle

61
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,840
in the body

62
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,720
letting go letting go of all the words that have come

63
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,080
before all the busyness of the day

64
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:33,120
all the plans of what you will do later today this moment just taking refuge

65
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,400
and just being

66
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,840
the radical choice in our society

67
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:59,840
in this world to just be and not do for a moment

68
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,000
letting go of doing

69
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:13,840
opening up relaxing softening the whole body

70
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,198
opening to non-doing

71
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,720
receiving receiving the breath

72
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:40,959
as it moves through the lower abdomen

73
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:45,839
sit bones the legs the feet

74
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:55,839
relaxing softening letting go of all these parts

75
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:09,839
softening [Music] relaxing the abdomen

76
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,199
letting the chest

77
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:23,839
be refreshingly filled with the breath

78
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,600
and empty the neck and shoulders ah softening

79
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,839
feeling heavy

80
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:49,120
letting their weight to be pulled down

81
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:59,120
by the earth by gravity ah as if tension

82
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,079
tightness is dripping down relieved

83
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,880
let go of

84
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,839
so too for the muscles of the face

85
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,920
behind the eye

86
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:33,839
behind the jaw connecting the jaw

87
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,839
inviting awareness to be close very close

88
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:59,360
right here just in the body right here not far

89
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:15,839
intimately feeling sensing creating all the sensations

90
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:53,040
if you notice the mind is resting on the thought and the plan memory okay

91
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,959
it's part of this practice nothing wrong with thinking per se

92
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,839
just for the purpose of this practice or calming

93
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:07,839
settling

94
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,800
in this moment

95
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,600
inviting the awareness to stay close in the body

96
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:31,680
to bow to the thought thank you please come back later i'll be waiting

97
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,199
for you but now i'm giving my heart to this practice

98
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,399
bringing the awareness to the body to the breath

99
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,839
receiving

100
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,160
just settling arriving for another few minutes before we turn

101
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:59,839
our attention to metta

102
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,960
now as we stay embodied

103
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:40,480
as we allow awareness to connect with the sensations of this

104
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:48,880
body sitting connecting [Music] the cushion of the floor

105
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:01,919
connected to the earth connected to the air through the breath sense of

106
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,960
embodiment right here right now in this body

107
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,799
not leaving the body letting it be our anchor

108
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,440
and now inviting inviting into our minds i

109
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,840
the image of felt sense

110
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,919
of a dear friend someone with whom we have an

111
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:38,720
uncomplicated relationship ideally just there is a sense of

112
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,360
friendliness

113
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:59,360
goodwill we appreciate them we like them

114
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,919
we wish them well maybe they make us feel safe and happy

115
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,360
when we're in their presence

116
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,840
whatever the nuance might be for you

117
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:36,320
and if it's challenging to find someone in this category it's okay to bring someone in who's a benefactor

118
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:44,399
a dear person maybe even a child or a pet

119
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:49,840
just the sense of friendliness ease

120
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,919
bringing them into your mind's eye as if inviting them to come and sit with

121
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,158
you

122
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,159
so if they were right in front of you

123
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,640
letting a sense of meta ease friendliness

124
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,840
that naturally arises

125
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:38,720
could show up as a smile could show up as gladness could show up

126
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:47,919
in your heart area heart center areas oh sense of warmth care good will

127
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:57,280
we're just happy to see this person this being in your mind's eye and from this

128
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:03,919
from this place wishing them well you can use your own metaphrases if you

129
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:12,960
have them or i'll offer them for

130
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:20,640
metaphases traditional ones may you be safe

131
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,320
may you be happy

132
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,158
may you be healthy

133
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,159
may you have ease

134
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:55,840
may you be safe

135
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,559
may you be happy

136
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,840
may you be healthy

137
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,880
may you have ease

138
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,280
you're welcome to keep the phrases or let it be silent

139
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,480
what's more important today in this practice as we explore in this way

140
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:37,840
is to have an image of felt sense of them just the way you see them

141
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:05,840
looking at them with friendly eyes

142
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,080
noticing what happens in your heart when you look at them with friendly eyes

143
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:24,080
does your heart feel more expansive more easeful more peaceful

144
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,679
more spacious

145
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:39,840
we're happy again notice what the nuance is for you

146
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:48,799
as you envision this being with friendly eyes

147
00:24:49,039 --> 00:25:01,039
seeing them as a friend

148
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:15,840
see what happens for you notice notice

149
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:15,520
now having primed our heart we'll do a wholesome what's called bait

150
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:23,039
and switch now as the heart is warmed up with this

151
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,720
sense of friendliness seeing through the eyes of friendliness

152
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:35,200
bring the image felt sense of someone else who's kind of neutral for you someone you know

153
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,840
maybe you've seen

154
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:47,039
and replace your friend your dear being with this new

155
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:54,400
image and see if it's possible what if you just saw this person

156
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:01,039
with a friend in a friendly way as if they were a friend experiment

157
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,840
in this moment see what it feels like

158
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:16,159
as if they were your friend as if they were dear to you pushing them

159
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,840
well in the same way

160
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:39,039
and like surfing we can surf the wave sometimes for a long long long time

161
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,039
the energy may not dissipate but if it does you can always go back

162
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:51,919
to your friend dear friend and prime your heart again and do the bait and switch

163
00:27:51,919 --> 00:28:03,840
so experiment see what happens

164
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:27,840
i'd like to invite you to come back to invite your friend your friend again

165
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:40,080
sitting with them seeing them

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,039
friendly eyes friendly gaze

167
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:55,840
the way you see them with kindness with care with goodwill

168
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,960
with meta

169
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:10,559
yeah letting your heart feel what it feels your body

170
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:23,840
pay attention

171
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:53,440
and i'd like to invite you having primed her heart again now imagine the scene

172
00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:01,039
from somewhere you've been recently perhaps maybe you went for a walk simply

173
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:07,840
near your home and there were passerbys neighbors walking by or maybe you went

174
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,158
to a store to buy something a grocery store

175
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,880
or another store or somewhere a park somewhere where they're a bunch

176
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,679
of people you have this felt sense of oh yeah there were people around

177
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:34,799
what if we saw them which we took in their minds eye

178
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:40,559
different people that perhaps we interacted with or we just saw

179
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:48,080
looking at them seeing them with friendly eyes

180
00:31:52,399 --> 00:32:01,760
with good will may you be well may you be well

181
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:15,840
as if they were a long lost friend perhaps we didn't know this was a friend of ours

182
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:31,519
what if silently brought the image of each of them up and said hi

183
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:43,840
how are you i wish you well i'm friendly i see you as a friend

184
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,000
maybe flashing an inner smile

185
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:57,840
see what works for you

186
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:39,120
as if you had a friendly relationship a connection with age

187
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:53,840
of these beings as if you knew them

188
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:49,118
as if they were your second third fourth cousins hello cousin hi you were seeing them

189
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,398
at a reunion you've never seen them before

190
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,400
with friendly eyes friendly eyes wishing you well

191
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,640
we are related in this web of common

192
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,839
humanity

193
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:12,960
notice how your heart feels how your body feels

194
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:20,319
greeting friendliness all these long-lost cousins

195
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:41,838
you're related to through the web of common humanity

196
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:07,040
may our practice in cultivating our hearts and goodness and kindness and

197
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:14,319
meta be a cause and condition

198
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:22,800
for awakening [Music] for goodness for ourselves and all

199
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:37,839
beings in this world

200
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:51,839

204
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:17,280

205
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,920

complaints it's all welcome especially if you haven't spoken for a while

207
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,800
love to hear from you friend

208
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:46,160
hi i i found the suggestion to think of strangers as cousins to be very

209
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:54,000
apt and useful i i have a lot of cousins and you know my intimacy with

210
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,320
various cousins have changed over the years some being quite close and then a rotation

211
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:08,320
and somebody else will come to the west coast and they'll be very close and there is something almost

212
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:16,400
arbitrary about that that there i can feel that we've

213
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:23,040
decided that we will be friends that we will be close it's uh just because of the accident of

214
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:31,920
family but now we make a commitment um through through that accident and uh

215
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,800
that experience seems to be a useful way for me to imagine

216
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:45,920
the boatload of people i was thinking about who i was around yesterday who

217
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:53,599
were as various and as indifferently composed as my family is

218
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,720
thank you fred thank you so much for saying that as beautifully and as

219
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:06,560
eloquently as you said all of that yeah it's a commitment you make into

220
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,599
way of seeing the way of relating otherwise it can be kind of random beautiful thank you i

221
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:20,319
love that and actually that suggestion when i suggested for me it it um brightened

222
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:26,400
the practice also it brought more dimensionality for me saying all the people i had seen earlier

223
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:32,480
today like oh yeah hi cousin hi it's just

224
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:40,319
yeah thank you for that yeah lovely yeah yeah

225
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:47,520
other reflections what did you what else did you notice claire please thank you

226
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,680
i wasn't so much noticing i had a very funny coincidence so that i wanted to share with you

227
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,200
i have a friend who is a huge fan of proofs and somehow rather i got on the phone

228
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,400
with them today and instead of my usual annoyance with them

229
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,880
i decided to look through stuff i didn't just and i just googled and i came up with a quote that i

230
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,079
thought would just blew my mind changed my whole perception and it's so

231
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:22,480
relevant to what you were talking about it reads the real voyage of discovery consists not in

232
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:28,240
seeking new lands but unseen with new eyes

233
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,760
and i thought that is just amazing because that's been so true for me and it's exactly what we

234
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:41,760
were talking about and it was the theme of my whole day it's really weird yeah yeah exactly it's

235
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:48,079
beautiful thank you for sharing that yeah a way of seeing with new eyes not new

236
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:54,640
lads but new you know would you type it if you can in chat or

237
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:03,838
say it one more time claire the whole quote great thank you

238
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,760
yeah so so i will go to merry christine's question

239
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:19,119
how do you see an abusive person with new eyes yes very good question so

240
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:26,079
um the i think the way of inviting to see

241
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:35,280
with friendliness is um is to see their humanity in this case

242
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:44,720
to see their humanity it doesn't mean that you um become a you know a

243
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:51,599
doormat and say oh just friends i'm just going to forget about everything you can abuse me but but allowing yourself to see their

244
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:59,599
friendliness their long-lost cousin who are causing harm you still see them oh yes they're a

245
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,720
cousin you know they they're related they're you want them to be well and

246
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,000
yeah you're going to keep your distance from from this cousin but you wish them well

247
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,800
yeah thank you christine very important question yeah thank you oh yes beautiful

248
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,160
and thanks for putting that in chat again claire the real voyage of discovery consists not

249
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:29,280
in seeking new lands but seeing in new eyes seeing with new eyes beautiful

250
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,599
lovely yeah the other reflections

251
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:40,800
as i wait for you i'll share that with this practice towards the end i felt

252
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:48,319
much happier i felt my heart being really expansive just kind of yeah just the delight of

253
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:54,000
the people i had seen earlier who were kind of two-dimensional for me they were just people

254
00:43:54,000 --> 00:44:00,160
neutral people and then they became oh wow so

255
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:07,520
so so in fact they became dear i was wishing them well so i think tomorrow when i go

256
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:12,800
to the same place i'll go for my daily exercise swim if they're there like oh i'll see them

257
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:18,720
with different different eyes like oh yeah this person swimming next to me in the lane oh may you be well

258
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:26,800
so her for me was quite lovely too so so how about

259
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:35,200
we since i'm not seeing any hands and i'm not seeing any um uh new reflections

260
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,880
let's turn uh we'll save some time for on the other end when we come back

261
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:47,200
from small groups for reflections and right now how about we engage with our

262
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:53,839
cousins our long-lost cousins whom we will meet in a small group a couple of our cousins

263
00:44:53,839 --> 00:45:00,400
who will have the privilege to connect with or reconnect with in small groups so let's

264
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:08,560
uh practice i'll make out the make the breakout rooms and how about uh we start with

265
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:16,079
the 15 seconds of silent meta for um for our

266
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:22,960
cousins and after that then you can share as much or as

267
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:29,760
little as you wish let's see okay the rooms are created and i am

268
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:35,680
going to open them now here we go okay

269
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:41,920
welcome back everyone okay the rooms are closed welcome back

270
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:48,160
and we have a few minutes for reflections questions your practice is

271
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:54,319
important especially if you're new and uh would love to hear from you

272
00:45:54,319 --> 00:46:01,200
what did you discover was there's something new that you discovered about yourself about what worked for you what

273
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:09,280
didn't what what happened either during the guided meditation or

274
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:15,839
in the practice meetings

275
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,319
you can erase your zoom hand or type in

276
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:29,839
chat

277
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:44,079
lisa please thank you yeah i was noticing that it

278
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:52,480
felt like really like freeing or lightning to be given permission to

279
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:58,720
to notice which i did anyway but that like the categories change

280
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:04,560
for the person that i might or being i might like pick for a

281
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:12,078
category that the complexity it's like allowing for the complexity of that

282
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:19,599
the change depending on my view and the conditions of

283
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:26,800
that moment going into my view it just felt like even though i i could know that yeah somehow it's

284
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,640
like oh you saying it and offering this meditation it just was like

285
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:38,160
felt like being given permission for that and i really really appreciated it and it feels

286
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:44,800
like this is a super rich teaching that yeah i want to like be with more so

287
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:51,119
thank you nikki yeah thank you lisa one thing that i'm hearing what you're saying don't

288
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,480
mute yourself just yet because i want to follow up with what i'm hearing if i hear correctly is that there's a

289
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:03,280
sense of this acknowledgement that yeah this is what happens with these categories that they're kind of

290
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:10,319
random depending on how we see them you know one person can be a friend another day and a

291
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:17,359
challenging person who is challenging etc so that actually gave you permission it

292
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:23,839
brought some ease is what i'm hearing to say oh yeah this is this is how it works it's it's

293
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:30,800
it's it's okay this is how it works for everyone right this is and it's based on how we see others

294
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:37,599
and it just keeps shifting and changing and that can allow a sense of okay this is how it works

295
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:43,280
given how i see so okay how can i it actually opens up practice opportunity

296
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:50,160
did i kind of hear that correctly what you're reflecting on yes completely like the it's okay

297
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:58,559
and and then um yeah like the warmth is

298
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:06,160
can i don't know somehow can flow between these like categories seeing that one day

299
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:11,680
or that half day it was like that and then that later hour it was like that and it's like

300
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:18,480
what and just noticing my own rigidity around but it should always be the same

301
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:25,599
i and i don't that doesn't feel good but i noticed my like well then i can just check off that box

302
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:33,359
you know and it's like hmm that's not yeah this just like feels good somehow and

303
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:40,240
yeah yeah i would like to be with be with this more i can feel like i can be with this for a little while as a

304
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:46,880
practice nice you just added another aspect to it which i want to highlight which is not the rigidity of it doesn't

305
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,920
have to particularly this is how it works like so not fighting against how it

306
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:57,359
actually the mind makes these categories this is how it happens and opening up to working with it and

307
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:03,920
another thing that i just thought about sharing actually as a as an invitation for all of us is as

308
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:10,640
different people we relate to as they shift and go between these categories can we still see them as our cousins oh

309
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:17,040
yeah this is the cousin who's still my cousin but you know today you know we're still related we're still

310
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:23,520
connected in this web of humanity and you know through our human family we're still connected and today yeah

311
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:30,400
