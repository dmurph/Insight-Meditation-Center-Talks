1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,200
so good evening again my name is Maria strotman I'm here for

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:12,080
Diana and um you know I've been part of IMC for uh

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,480
a lot of years that's IMC not the dis the

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:25,800
institution or the uh the building but I AMC the sa and some of my

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,480
longest running IMC friends are in this room right now and others that I don't

6
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:39,440
know as well or at all and so there are things that I think

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,600
about the people that I know and that I don't know and and really what I know is

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,879
that we are all here we all came here and meditated tonight and beyond that there's a great deal of

9
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:59,559
speculation views ideas about who you are your ideas about who I am why we're

10
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:05,360
here what we might mean why we're here I might have said

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,560
that

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,119
twice tonight's talk is going to be on the Dharma of

13
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,320
hearing and like all of the senses what gets in the way of actually hearing is

14
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:29,560
what we think about what we're hearing what we think about what we're

15
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:36,880
seeing what we think about what we're expecting what we want what we might

16
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,119
want all of this gets in the way one of the things I want is the iPad I left at

17
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:50,960
home with my talk on it but that's okay this is going to work because all

18
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:58,240
of my devices are linked which means it's on my phone in little tiny print so

19
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,240
we'll see how this goes so when I uh was taking training for Zen

20
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,360
hospice project one of the things that we did was we wrote down something unusual about ourselves that we didn't

21
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,599
think people would know we wrote it on a piece of paper and we put it in in a basket and then everybody went around

22
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:23,560
and picked from the basket and tried to guess what this obscure thing who this belonged to and of course everybody

23
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,599
wrote the most outrageous obscure thing they could think about about themselves

24
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,959
and of course very few people guess correctly about what that thing was true

25
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:41,239
of because we don't really know one another we have all kinds of ideas you

26
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:48,200
know I don't like yellow therefore if you like that this isn't true by the way this is an idea if I didn't like yellow

27
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,080
and you were wearing a yellow shirt I might say there's something wrong with

28
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,319
you so today I got an email from Liz

29
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:05,480
Powell who who manages the sign up page for people who want individual practice

30
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,640
discussions and she she sent me two people that are signed up for tomorrow

31
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,080
and she said here are your two people and I thought well that's great she I know people are signed up but I don't have their names so I wrote back and

32
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:24,040
said I don't have their names and she said well yes it's in the text and I said well you used to do that but these

33
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,360
don't have it and she wrote back and she said well here are the two names but they are in the text

34
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,480
I thought well so I went through and read every word and the problem was she used to

35
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,879
send it in a different format and it was a different format than before and sure

36
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:48,640
enough the names were there just in a totally unexpected place so I couldn't see

37
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,840
them and they were obvious once she told me where to find them

38
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,720
obvious but I couldn't see them and so sometimes when somebody's

39
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,280
talking to me they'll say something to me and I can't hear it I'm

40
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:12,120
listening but I can't hear it because I'm expecting to hear

41
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,000
something else because I'm busy planning what I want to say to them because there

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,080
are all kinds of reasons so the question

43
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,600
is how do we hear when we're

44
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,600
listening how do we hear people we actually don't want to hear that's the

45
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,440
real trick we think we want to hear them but we don't really want to hear what they

46
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,840
have to say maybe because we don't want to hear something about us or something

47
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:53,360
about them we don't want to hear it today I had U an Audiology test you know

48
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,600
to get my ears checked and they put you in isolation in this room and then they send these little tiny sounds to you and

49
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,919
you they three little beeps an interval of time three little beeps and they they

50
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,919
either start out softly and get louder or the other way around and they test each year differently and pretty soon I

51
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:19,680
found my mind trying to decide whether I was hearing it or I was hearing an echo

52
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,039
or I was well you know the intervals were about the same and so I could

53
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:31,479
imagine it was happening and I didn't trust my mind

54
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:38,479
could I trust my hearing if I couldn't trust my hearing or my mind how did I know whether those

55
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,319
beeps were there or not and to to watch your mind go through

56
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,479
all of these machinations and realize this was and I was listening

57
00:05:50,479 --> 00:06:01,479
hard I could I could feel the energy in my body listening hard and then I said no listen easy

58
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:07,639
relax just you're not passing a test like you

59
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:15,280
know it's going to change your life here listen if you hear the beeps push the

60
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:23,199
button all of this energy and how hard I was listening it

61
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,599
turned out how hard I was listening wasn't the answer I needed to listen

62
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:37,199
easily lightly in a relaxed way I thought okay

63
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:44,560
huh and on the way home I passed this corner at the corner of El Camino and uh

64
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:51,319
Embarcadero and there were two people out on the corner and one was waving an Israeli flag and the other had a big

65
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:59,759
sign and the sign said ceasefire free Israelis and Palestinians

66
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:06,599
from the hamus

67
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:11,759
uh what do we call them

68
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,960
um terrorists and I thought okay I know what they want I I I get their message

69
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:24,520
and then I thought do I get their message do I know what they want to

70
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:30,520
say do I really know what they want to say because what I'm what I'm reading

71
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:36,199
and what I'm hearing is something that I either agree or disagree

72
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:45,159
with that's the first thing I hear something I'm agreeing or disagreeing with not a mental decision but that I'm

73
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:51,280
interpreting what I'm hearing based on my

74
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,639
bias I'm interpreting what I'm

75
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:03,080
hearing we don't we're not really conscious of the fact fact that we're interpreting what we're

76
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:09,280
hearing you know it's sort of uh yeah I'm I'm really paying attention I want

77
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,720
to know and it turns out you know as opposed to this very quiet environment I

78
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,879
was in when I was listening really hard my sense right now is that

79
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:27,080
everything is really loud big noises big noises lots of

80
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,640
yelling lots of yelling and it's really hard to hear when everyone's yelling I

81
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:40,039
know I came from a very very noisy family everybody yells all the

82
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,959
time and one of the things I discovered in my hearing test today was that my

83
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,519
left ear which has had a hearing aid for about a year is used to having a higher

84
00:08:54,519 --> 00:09:00,000
volume and when I was doing the test of words in noise

85
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,640
I've lost the ability because I've retrained my brain to have a higher volume sound in my left ear with the

86
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,000
hearing aid with without the hearing aid I can't hear as well as I did

87
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,320
before voices words in loud noises but with the hearing aid it's

88
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:28,120
great because my brain has been reconfigured to work with the hearing

89
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:34,839
aid our brains have been reconfigured to work with our

90
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,560
views that's it's just that's those are the triggers that's how they work that's

91
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,920
what humans do so part of the problem for us is

92
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:53,200
keeping that in mind when we're listening that what we're hearing is affected by what we're

93
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:01,120
thinking about what we're hearing

94
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:09,160
and what are people hearing they're say they're hearing but but but but or well but me or they're hearing y you blame

95
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:15,240
blame blame blame blame or

96
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,320
why someone the other day told me that she was really

97
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,519
sad and she wanted to know if the Buddha had anything to say about how to be in

98
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,240
Conflict how to be with conflict without getting really

99
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:43,240
angry and you know if that indeed is the problem or

100
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,160
the challenge how are how do you

101
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:58,639
hear how do you hear what is unacceptable to you without becoming reactive angry hurt

102
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:03,160
sad depressed

103
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:11,959
hopeless how do you hear it as something more than noise and why would you why would you

104
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:18,560
just not turn it off so in thinking about that I thought

105
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:26,240
well so what are the sources of conflict sources of conflict have to do with beliefs or views that you have economic

106
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:33,079
in inequality uh non- diversity of uh

107
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:39,720
ethnicity culture money ability ways of dealing with the

108
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,680
world tribalism a division into me and you Us

109
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:53,399
and Them um a lack of security feeling safe

110
00:11:53,399 --> 00:12:00,399
all of these things are very human characteristics and they give rise to conflict

111
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,639
and it's important to understand that these things are are all conditional

112
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,399
they're just conditions they're not in any way

113
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,040
truths they're sort of acquired and developed

114
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:25,680
conditions they're not absolutes they're

115
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:32,320
conditions and they can come down to Greed hatred and delusion me

116
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:41,480
mine is greed Me Mine hatred not mine not mine go away not

117
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:48,600
mine delusion ignorance we just don't know don't know confusion

118
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,440
confusion and we have certain reactions we have triggers that you know that that

119
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:01,639
sets you off could be a yellow shirt it could be language that is used we have

120
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:07,360
uh we have the inner triggers which have to do with self-criticism self-doubt oh

121
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:14,560
I'm doing it wrong again oh I can't believe this is I'm falling into this pattern again outer ones that have to do with

122
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,399
anger and resentment these are just reactions to

123
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:26,680
conditions and I'm not talking here about whether things are right or wrong

124
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:32,279
or appropriate or inappropriate I am simply describing conditions and

125
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:38,800
reactions these things happen these things

126
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,560
happen so then what kind of responses do we have we have intellectual responses you know I'm going to debate you to the

127
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:53,079
death I'm going to tell you I get my facts lined up and I'm going to talk to you about the facts of

128
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,519
life and in that case things have to be right or wrong I have to if I'm right

129
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:05,519
you have to be wrong we attack the other or build up ourselves you are the enemy therefore

130
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:12,759
you know you're you're slime and I am right therefore I'm Angelic and we we

131
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:19,920
set that up in our arguments uh we negotiate and usually in

132
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,199
negotiate the idea is you get more you get more from them then you get from yourself that's that's sort of you know

133
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,680
the the win-win thing is usually not on people's agenda

134
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,480
and uh compromise is really looked down to if it's a question of

135
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:43,519
Purity compromise is unacceptable and we often go into the

136
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:50,120
negotiation with the idea that we're going to change somebody else's mind but we rarely think of it as changing our

137
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:56,560
minds and if you notice all of these things have to do with views this is this is how I'm viewing the world this

138
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:03,519
is how I view the world and the other the other form of reaction

139
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:09,079
has to do with retribution punishment you know you've harmed

140
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:18,360
me and has to do with how I feel about things that happened in the past okay now I've lost my little

141
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:26,199
thing this is the problem with going with something as small as this okay

142
00:15:26,199 --> 00:15:30,600
so I'm going to give you an example

143
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:39,120
so this is a poem by a leon uh who is the current poet

144
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:46,720
laate for the US uh and this is called the contract

145
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,680
says we'd like the conversation to be bilingual that's the title of the

146
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:59,880
poem when you come bring your brownness so we can be sure to please the funders

147
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:05,440
will you check this box we're applying for a grant do you have any poems that speak

148
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:12,399
to troubled teens bilingual is best would you like to come to dinner

149

150
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:25,360
uncomfortable but not complicit don't send us the one where

151

152

153
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:41,279
in the dirt watching V vultures pick apart another Bird's bones in the sand

154
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:48,079
no we don't want those poems tell us the one about your father stealing hubcaps after a

155
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,759
colleague said that's what those people do tell us how he came to the meeting

156
00:16:53,759 --> 00:17:00,120
wearing a poncho and tried to sell the hubcaps back to the man don't mention your

157
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,640
father was a teacher spoke English loved making beer loved baseball tell us again

158
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:13,079
about the Poncho the hubcaps how he stole them how he did the thing he was trying to prove he didn't

159
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:19,319
do okay I like this poem because what she's saying is don't invite me because

160
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:27,360
I'm Brown don't invite me to tell the stories that make you feel

161
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:33,080
good don't make my brownness your

162
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:38,200
cause just see me as I

163
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,120
am hear me talk if I want to talk about my father let me choose the reason I

164
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:54,559
talk about my father you don't get to tell me why I talk about my

165
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:02,240
father you know there sometimes we get the idea that that inclusiveness is a matter of checking off the boxes when it

166
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,640
really has to do with seeing me seeing

167
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:15,840
you really hearing and not just listening not just

168
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:26,840
listening one of the things that happens is we get into the habit of collective collectivizing people you know all of

169
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:33,120
these people are the same we forget that we're collections of

170
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,799
individuals which is why I began the discussion here with we are a collection

171
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,919
of individuals but all I really know about us is that we all came here to meditate tonight and I don't even know

172
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:53,640
that for sure I just know that we're all in the room claiming to meditate maybe somebody came here just

173
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:00,559
because it's the only quiet place they thought they could come at this place time there are all kinds of reasons for

174
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:06,480
people to come someplace and the assumptions may or may not be

175
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:12,000
true and in Conflict one of the challenges is just

176
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,760
hearing one of the four foundations of mindfulness is when hearing just hear

177
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:26,159
don't bring everything you know to the party just see just

178
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:31,640
hear so one of my props that I did bring with

179
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:38,760
me this is uh the Buddha before Buddhism which is a translation of the the uh

180
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:45,000
book of eights that gilded I love this book you can tell I've got stickers

181
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,600
everywhere and now I have paper clips as well to distinguish from the

182
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,480
stickers so this is from uh so there are only eight SE eight sutas in this and they're all written in kind of verse

183
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:05,760
form sort of like the dapada and the one I want to read you is

184
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,240
this one the light is really dim here tonight I'm having trouble seeing not because of

185
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,760
view but because the light's not quite sufficient for me let's

186
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:29,400
see oh see oh this is sweet Jim thank you all right

187
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,799
so light I am right here okay let's

188
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,919
see lusting for debates and plunging into assemblies they take each other to

189
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:50,640
be fools they speak relying on what others have said passionate for praise

190
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:58,679
they call themselves skillful wishing for praise while debating in an assembly they become anxious refuted they become

191
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:05,000
depressed criticized and shaken they seek their opponent's faults one whose Doctrine is called

192
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,919
deficient and by the judges rejected despars and Grieves the inferior debater

193
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:17,679
moans I've been defeated renunciant are elated and deflated by the disputes that arise

194
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:25,559
among them seeing this you should abstain from disputes they provide no benefit other

195
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:32,799
than being praised wishing for an opponent you roar like a

196
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:39,279
hero nourished on Royal food run off o hero to where the fight is as before

197
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:45,600
there is no fight here if grasping to a view and disputing

198
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:54,559
they say this alone is true tell them in this dispute you have no opponent

199
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:01,039
here you have no opponent thank you Jim you have no opponent here I'm just not

200
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,759
going to fight

201
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:14,360
you I hear you the other day I was talking to a

202
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:21,480
friend of mine and we had a disagreement about a group of people that she maintained

203
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:28,080
would do something and I said you don't know that and this is probably my best friend

204
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:35,159
friend and she was getting very heated about how naive I was being and I

205
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:42,200
thought you know we don't have to fight about this so I just

206
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,640
stopped and sure enough that was the end of it we went on and everything was

207
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:54,840
great we didn't have to fight about whether I was naive whether she was right or

208
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:00,600
wrong we didn't have to fight about it we didn't even have to agree to disagree

209
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:07,039
which was her suggestion you actually don't have to

210
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:14,278
take up this is right or wrong you actually don't have to take it

211
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:25,679
up I'm going to try to do this without your light Jim because I think I

212
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
can

213
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:40,520
so this is from the greater discourse of the dead end they say their own Doctrine is

214
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:46,679
perfect they say the doctrine of others is inferior quarreling so they dispute

215
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:52,720
everyone saying their own opinion is true if it is inferior because of

216
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:58,559
someone's contempt then no Doctrine would be the best

217
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:04,960
because no Doctrine goes without somebody thinking it's inferior this is because many say the doctrine of others

218
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,440
is inferior while advocating their own if any Doctrine people worship is true

219
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:17,799
as is the path they praise then all doctrines would be true and Purity would belong to them

220
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:27,880
all H so should someone say I I know I see

221
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,120
see it's just like this some believe Purity comes through views but if they

222
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:39,679
see what good is that for them going too far they say Purity comes from something

223
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:45,320
other something outside of them seeing a person sees only names and appearances

224
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:51,159
having seen one knows only these whether one sees much or little this doesn't

225
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:58,240
bring doesn't bring Purity say the skillful if you if only only what you

226
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:05,840
see and experience can be true then it's dependent on what you see and experience all truth is dependent

227
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:12,120
just on your experience it seems like there's something wrong with

228
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:24,279
that they are not an enemy to any Doctrine those who are free from viewpoints not clinging to the world

229
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:30,559
they have no self reproach not forming opinion not shut down and not desirous

230
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:36,158
they are sages wise ones who have laid their burden

231
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:44,760
down you know it feels like if you just say well I'm not going to have an

232
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:50,799
opinion then I don't have to fight with you then everything's going to be Rosy

233
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:56,000
but that's not actually what it says it just says you don't have to

234
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,000
fight you don't have to to claim that you are always right you actually don't

235
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,120
have to say this is right and you are

236
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:17,080
wrong now that brings us to my dear

237
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:22,520
friend Joseph Goldstein how do you get around this problem how do you get

238
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:27,679
around the views that you hold the beliefs that you hold the values that

239
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:34,279
you hold what do you do with those you can't ignore them and be an integral

240
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:42,240
person you have them the trick is mindful

241
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:50,120
awareness to see them to see ah this is my value and to see the other person and

242
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:59,240
see that they hold also a value and to see we're both in this room

243
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,760
we're both on this Earth there was a I saw an amazing quote

244
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,080
in one of the poetry books I was going through today the title of the poem was

245
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:17,240
um an Israeli says to a Palestinian I had no idea they shared some of my

246
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:22,480
same's aspirations really how could you not

247
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:30,399
know that it's because they were categorized as some something else something not

248
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:38,200
human in fact it's amazing how often we dehumanize people as an in an effort not

249
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:46,960
to feel them not to be touched by them not to be touched by their

250
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,960
arguments and it's not a conscious process it's very simple we just say

251
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,640
they're wrong and we become

252
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:10,279
self-righteous or they're not like me and therefore they must be wrong

253
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:19,559
that's kind of a red flag you sort of go wait a minute they probably are thinking the same thing and we can't both be

254
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:27,880
right so the ability to be present for

255
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:33,679
the fact that someone else holds their views as strongly as I

256
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:40,080
do that someone else burns with the same fervor that I burn

257
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,039
with and they experience the same

258
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:54,600
burning and what is it that this person is experiencing what do they

259
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:00,720
actually believe what do they actually want what do they

260
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:09,360
actually believe when I look at them as a person

261
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:15,760
and not an institution or a group of

262
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,120
persons how do I hear them how do I hear

263
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:26,799
them how am I listening how am I listening am I

264
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:32,200
listening with an intention to hear

265
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:39,398
them or am I listening with an intention to have better arguments next

266
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:46,440
time how am I listening so um this is a Buddha Dharma

267
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,440
magazine which is a Buddha Buddhist publication comes out four times a year

268
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,600
and the most recent issue is on Buddha nature now Buddha nature is a a Buddha

269
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:04,240
concept that is uh more commonly spoken of in the Mayana Buddhist Traditions Zen

270
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:11,519
and uh Tibetan Buddhism Traditions pure land Chinese Buddhism and less so in

271
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:17,799
tradan Buddhism so what I want to talk about is not Buddha nature but Joseph

272
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:23,159
goldstein's response to the question of what did he think about Buddha

273
00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:32,639
nature so let me let me pull up the page because he's Traden right so first of

274
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:41,919
all so he wrote a book called one Dharma in which he he talked about the

275
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:50,000
similarity of all forms of Buddhism and what they had in common versus their differences so some of these terms are

276
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,200
used more often in the uh later Traditions I think a popular

277
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,279
understanding of some of the later traditions is that we're already enlightened and we simply have to

278
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:06,840
realize it that might imply that it's more accessible than it actually is whether we phrase it in terms of we're

279
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:13,840
already enlightened and we just need to realize it or we're not yet realized and we have to get there the task is

280
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,320
formidable okay so that's how he set it up and he went on a long retreat and he

281
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:24,399
argued with himself so an important consideration here is when you're

282
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:29,880
hearing you also are hearing the argument ments in your own head the

283
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,960
arguments you have with yourself where you're trying to understand something for

284
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:43,399
you those arguments are going on in your head and you need to be able to hear those arguments also so here's what he

285
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:48,880
did and I found this quite wonderful let's

286
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:00,480
see there's only one Dharma we may not see the unity of it all all the time but

287
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,519
it's not like there are two dharmas out there first let's

288
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:12,320
see he asked a question about him being a monk and he says I wasn't a

289
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:22,120
monk I'm on the wrong page

290
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,080
sorry

291
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:42,840
see I had this all written out but I don't think I can read it off off my phone so I have to find it

292
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:55,278
here maybe I can find it maybe I can read it all

293
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:03,360
right in one Dharma when I was struggling with trying

294
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:10,600
to reconcile the different views the thing that helped me the most was the phrase I used metaphysics as skillful

295
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:18,559
means not as truth statements skillful means not truth statements I finally

296
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:25,720
realized I was asking the wrong question it wasn't a question of who was right it

297
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,279
skillful means means not to see each of these positions as statements of truth

298
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,840
but is skillful means for not clinging because in my understanding and practice

299
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,320
in several Traditions to me that is the essence of the free mind the minds

300
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,840
that's not clinging to anything as I or

301
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:55,120
mine if you think of your beliefs and your views as being I or

302
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,880
mine that's where we get entangled clinging to views clinging to

303
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,079
views is the problem not whether the views are right or

304
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:13,839
wrong so if you hold the view lightly and say huh what do I learn from

305
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:20,000
that view and what do I learn from that view then you come up with something

306
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:28,879
that more closely resembles a wise attention to conditions in fact I think somewhere

307
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,200
here yes he

308
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:42,520
says in earlier years I remember getting into these intense Dharma debates

309
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:49,480
totally convinced I was right and that my view was the Right View and passionately arguing it and

310
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:56,679
believing it one of my favorite mantras these days is who knows when I'm fully enlightened maybe

311
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:02,079
then I can say I know but until then it seems best to keep an open mind in this

312
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:09,240
regard I have a new definition of enlightenment okay what is it lightening

313
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:14,280
up we could think of the path as the process of the lightening up from the

314
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,320
more superficial levels to the most profound levels because basically

315
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,839
lightening up means letting go of all self- reference which of course is no

316
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:30,960
easy task so that's what I want to leave with you

317
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,440
with the way to be with the

318
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:43,400
unacceptable is to lighten up and to say suppose I look at it this way and

319
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:52,240
suppose I look at it this way what can I learn from this how can I hold all of

320
00:35:52,240 --> 00:36:00,000
this and not have to choose something as right right or wrong that sets me on the path

321
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:08,319
toward ill will greed and delusion I wish you all

322
00:36:08,319 --> 00:36:17,160
uncertainty and the freedom that comes with it thank you but don't leave your iPads at

323
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:24,559
home so are there any questions comments Rotten

324
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,720
Tomatoes

325
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:38,680
I just like to say thank you so much for you're addressing our our situation in

326
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:44,400
the world and listening thank and hearing thank you thank

327
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:58,680
you it's it's hard it's hard

328
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:04,200
to be challenged in in your

329
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:12,119
deepest places of what's right and wrong in the world and to not

330
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:20,319
react and so the the tools that we have are the tools

331
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:27,560
that allow us to to see as clearly as we can see oh this this is what's

332
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:34,838
happening oh oh this is what's happening oh look how I'm reacting to

333
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:40,400
that oh that really

334
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:52,760
hurt yeah thank you I took that test in

335
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:57,920
Middle School the hearing test and I had the exact same experience you described

336
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,800
I thought God I'm so neurotic if I was just a normal person I could just listen and answer the

337
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:09,319
test and then hearing you say that rather than drop my decades old judgment

338
00:38:09,319 --> 00:38:17,599
I thought oh she's crazy too well you know it's uh yeah it's easy

339
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:27,280
right it's you say well that's that's that's not acceptable to behave that way so now in my defense I said well

340
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:35,839
I'll just let it go and that's that's the part that I

341
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:41,599
think we need more more freedom around the the part

342
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:46,760
that that basically lets us off the hook a little bit you know I was talking to

343
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:54,079
my husband today about how often we refer to okay what's happening now with the war and there are kind of two

344
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:00,720
approaches or more now more than to you can not read anything you can read

345
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,319
constantly reading constantly is probably uh just foolish not reading at

346
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:17,000
all is in denial and somewhere in between is a place where we say this is

347
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,160
happening and I'm not prepared this is

348
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,400
happening and I don't want it to be true no matter what else you

349
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:33,880
believe this is happening and I don't want it to be true and and today as I was thinking about it I realized that

350
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,280
what's up in the news is is happening in the Middle East but there is

351
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:48,960
still war in Ukraine and you know there was and those people aren't getting any

352
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,359
relief uh and I remember when that was upfront and that seemed like the most

353
00:39:54,359 --> 00:40:01,720
crucial thing and what's true is that people are suffering everywhere and we were talking about end

354
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,359
of the year donations and I said well you know let's let's feed people let's you

355
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:15,720
know people need to eat I'm sure there are people here who need to eat and you know there's suffering in

356
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:24,040
the world and we can't we we don't have the means to end all suffering in the

357
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:32,440
world but the the response that that is to lose all hope or to become angry is

358
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:39,920
simply not useful it's not skillful so I'm I'm sort of reminded of

359
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:48,359
of the the the listing of things for for speech for for why speech you know is it

360
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:55,839
is it true is it useful is it timely is it

361
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:01,280
kind and that pretty much goes for everything that's the way we

362
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,599
listen that's the way we make decisions about what to

363
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,520
do there's no right or wrong sometimes things are skillful and

364
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:19,000
sometimes they're

365
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:30,599
not but it's not because things are

366
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,839
necessarily right or

367
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:44,480
wrong there there is a poem that is haunting me I don't know whether I brought

368
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:57,800
it this is a poem by naom shihab n who's a a person that I read some poems from

369
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:03,720
last week and this was written uh uh at the time of the last war in Gaza for

370
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:11,520
Muhammad side of Gaza age 15 there is no stray bullet S no bullet

371
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:18,920
like a worried cat crouching under a bush no half hairless puppy bullet dodging midnight streets the bullet

372
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:24,920
could not be a pecan plunking The Tick Tin Roof not hardly no fluff of pollen

373
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:31,280
on October's breath no humble Pebble at our feet so don't gentle it please we

374
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,520
live among stray thoughts tasked abandoned Midstream our fickle hearts

375
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:45,280
are fat with stray devotions we feel at home among bits and pieces all the wandering ways of words but this bullet

376
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:51,200
had no innocence did not wish anyone well you can't tell us otherwise by

377
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:57,040
naming it mildly this bullet was never the friend of life should not be gr

378
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:03,599
granted immunity by Soft saying Friendly Fire straying death eye who have we

379
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:11,280
given the wrong weight to what we do why have we given the wrong weight to what we do Muhammad Muhammad deserves the

380
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:17,000
truth this bullet had no secret happy hopes it was not singing to itself with

381
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:24,520
eyes closed under the bridge a bullet is a bullet is a

382
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:28,400
bullet it has no good

383
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:37,480
intentions so have good

384
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:43,280
intentions and I trust all will be well good

385
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,280
night
