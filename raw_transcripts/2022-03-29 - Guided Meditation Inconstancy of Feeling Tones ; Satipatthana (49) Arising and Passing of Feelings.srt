00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,560
hello everyone warm greetings from redwood city at imc

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,760
and um where

3
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,679
everyone we are ex discussing the

4
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:41,360
discourse on the four foundations for awareness and developing awareness on different

5
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,440
areas of our life and the topic for today is developing

6
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,840
awareness on the feeling tones of our experience the ways in which

7
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,840
things can be experienced as pleasant unpleasant or neither pleasant or unpleasant

8
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:07,119
and at this point this is in the satipatthana this point in the text we're following

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,240
the emphasis is not the

10
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:19,280
the pleasure or the pain of pleasant and unpleasant but rather the inconstant nature in

11
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:26,640
which these sensations appear how they come they persist they go they appear

12
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,759
they disappear and it's not just the sensations but also

13
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:38,400
the dance of this inconstancy also has to do with how we are

14
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,920
how we perceive them our perception is not constant we're aware of

15
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,439
the pain the knee and then we hear a sound outside and our attention for a moment is not

16
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,200
with the pain or reduced with the pain and then we have a thought of something

17
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,360
and then we're back to the pain and it might seem like whenever we're paying attention to it the pain is there in the

18
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:07,840
knee um but in fact it's uh the perception of it is varied and

19
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,920
changing and if if the attention is very close to the pain we might see that it's a

20
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,280
it itself is made up of component sensations that are dancing it may be

21
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,800
intense same thing with joy so it isn't that we have to understand

22
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,239
them these pleasant and unpleasant experiences we have as only being

23
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,560
inconstant but it's the inconstant nature of them the way in which they come and go that

24
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,000
becomes a foundation for being in the present moment

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,680
awakening awareness in the present moment as an alternative to being reactive to

26
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,000
them or caught in them or distracted and away from them or whatever it might be

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,120
so maybe that can be a little bit the meditation this morning so to assume a

28
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,840
upright alert meditation posture

29
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,720
and lowering your gaze of your eyes

30
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,200
45 degrees to the floor and relaxing the gaze

31
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,640
looking at nothing in particular loose focus

32
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:35,519
and then gently if it's nice close the eyes

33
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,799
and then having the attention in your torso and your chest

34
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:54,360
rib cage taking a few long slow deep breaths

35
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:10,239
deep in-breaths and extended relaxation as you exhale

36
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,199
relaxation where you settle in to your body and your seat

37
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,479
maybe breathe deeply if couple of more times and as you exhale

38
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:35,840
relax into the contact of your body against the chair your cushion your bed

39
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,479
wherever you are

40
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,039
letting the breathing return to normal

41
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,840
and maybe also to relax further in the exhale

42
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:39,560
the normal exhale softening in the body relaxing into your body more

43
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,600
and then centering yourself from the body breathing

44
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,720
wherever you're it's easiest or nicest for you to be aware of the breathing in the body

45
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:23,000
enter into that part of your body to feel and sense the experience of breathing

46
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,800
and if there's any experience any feeling sense of peace

47
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,720
or calm as you breathe

48
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,840
let that register in your body

49
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,160
maybe there's a part of the exhale that feels peaceful or calm

50
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:20,080
or the end of the exhale or maybe it's the beginning of the

51
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,080
inhale

52
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:54,280
relaxing the thinking muscle relaxing the thinking mind

53
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,479
so the thinking mind moves towards greater peace or calm

54
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,840
tapping into the mind's ability to be at ease

55
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,519
and as you feel your breathing the body breathing

56
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,080
notice if there's any pleasant or unpleasant sensations

57
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,240
maybe a different parts of the cycle of breathing

58
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:08,160
allow those sensations be felt and known peacefully

59
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:19,399
seeing their coming and going as you breathe in and as you breathe out

60
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,760
and it might be the pleasantness might be very mild

61
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,240
the unpleasantness might be very mild

62
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:38,399
maybe it's a feeling of comfort and discomfort in the breathing

63
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:49,040
see if you can be untroubled by pleasant and unpleasant

64
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:58,480
and rather [Music] breathe with it feel in the breathing

65
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,839
ride along

66
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,480
with the rising and passing of

67
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:15,839
strengthening and weakening of pleasant and unpleasant as you breathe

68
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,199
the ancient analogy for the sensations of pleasant and

69
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:49,040
unpleasant pleasure and discomfort

70
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,279
is a vast peaceful lake

71
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,360
imagine being at a lake that's peaceful

72
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:06,160
calm relaxed very still surface

73
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:15,279
and a gentle rain begins and little drops on the surface of the

74
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:22,160
lake those are likened to the sensations that

75
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,800
come and go

76
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:37,480
rippling briefly in the calmness of the mind

77
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,440
and as we come to the end of the sitting

78
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,840
may it be that whatever degree of calm or

79
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:05,120
peace or whatever degree of

80
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:14,000
heightened awareness or clarity or other benefits we received from this

81
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:21,200
meditation may it be a medium maybe a vehicle

82
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:27,840
for good will into the world may it help us connect to our

83
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,760
well-wishing or our capacity for kindness and care and

84
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,399
compassion

85
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,559
and may our peace our well-being

86
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:51,039
carry out into the world these wishes

87
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,480
may all beings be happy

88
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,120
may all beings be safe

89
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,120
may all beings be peaceful

90
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,840
and may all beings be free

91
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,600
and may these wishes spread out to lands across the world where there's war

92
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,679
hunger

93
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:35,159
people struggling with climate change and environmental deterioration

94
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:44,240
people who are sick may our kindness our good will

95
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:51,039
spread out with our peace out into the world for the welfare and the benefit of the

96
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:58,159
whole world and as we live our life today

97
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:03,679
maybe we can think of practical ways maybe small ways

98
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,960
that we can enact that goodwill

99
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,880
in order to be friendly and kind to the people we encounter

100
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,880
may all beings share in bringing forth

101
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,559
happiness peace

102
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:33,059
[Music]

103
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,780
[Music]

104
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,279
i'll be right back i have to push a button

105
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,679
um

106
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:05,039
so this week we're doing the second exercises and exercise in the

107
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:11,840
fourth foundation for awareness and

108
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:19,039
the first second and third exercises five total is

109
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:25,240
the first three have to do with ways in which we

110
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:32,000
select out of our environment things to cling to or react to or get

111
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,360
caught in there's a vast sea of sensations perceptions

112
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:46,080
experiences in any given moment and the human being

113
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,120
when we're born slowly starts to make a

114
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:58,480
process of selection to zero in and and um and pick up what's important to

115
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,519
emphasize or it's important to uh gather together and and construct into the

116
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:09,679
different things that we experience and we know that the brain is a constructing

117
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:15,520
apparatus that it takes in sense data and it

118
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:22,480
reconstructs it into reality to how we experience and know it

119
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,720
and mostly there's a very good relationship between uh kind of a

120
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:35,358
good enough relationship with what we see and what the mind constructs so we can find our way in the world

121
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:40,560
and but it is a construction process and sometimes you can see it go a little bit

122
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:46,720
awry you know it happens probably a couple of times a year when i go hiking on the

123
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:53,358
trails in the mountains near here that for a moment i see a little some it was

124
00:34:53,359 --> 00:35:00,240
a stake or a little root of a tree that's half out of the ground snaking along

125
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,079
and i think of the root or this or the stick for a moment i think it's a snake

126
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:11,119
and so my mind has kind of somehow constructed the snake out of it

127
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:17,838
or there's a particular tree that i go by where there's a gnarly kind of

128
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:24,560
side growth on the trunk and and it looks like a cutest little dog

129
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,839
dog head sticking out and i said i always see that dog and the smile

130
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:36,800
and so it's no dog there but my mind somehow reconstructs it from the pieces it looks like a dog

131
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:43,119
and so the mind constructs and and it's partly also a selection process

132
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:49,520
we select out of the out of our environment the things that we want to prioritize things are important for us

133
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:55,280
as i like to said many years ago i was looking for a futon couch

134
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,119
futon bed couch and so i started looking as i was driving around or

135
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:07,359
attentive to that and back then so many years ago i was surprised how many futon shops there were i had no

136
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:13,440
idea they just kept popping up i was never really paying attention to it but now i was prioritizing that it

137
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,680
was on my mind and i was noticing it so we tend to notice the things that interest us

138
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:27,520
and i go down the shopping store you know the supermarket aisles

139
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:33,359
and a tremendous amount of stuff that just a blur that i have no interest in and i don't really take in i can't tell

140
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:39,040
you later what what i passed by and i'm looking for things that i particularly want

141
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:44,079
and so then you know when i know where i'm in the aisle where it is then i start looking

142
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:50,320
and searching for it and oh there it is and so there's a selection process

143
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:58,400
so this is all very normal but then the selection process also then becomes places we cling to

144
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,760
and so for the areas in which we cling to self or cling

145
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:10,320
to our own experience or a sense of who we are the buddha says that we

146
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:17,680
he emphasizes five areas that we prioritize or that we preferentially pick up on or that we

147
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:23,119
select or we project we kind of the part of the construction process we

148
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,720
give emphasis on this and he talks ab and these are the five

149
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:35,440
heaps the five groupings the five divisions the five ways in which we group our experience

150
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:42,880
into you know heaps of things and then we might prioritize these over

151
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:49,680
others and the buddha sometimes called this a burden

152
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,720
he also referred to it very explicitly as a construction constructing process

153
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,880
of the mind that minds

154
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,920
constructs the or some degree our experience of each of these five domains

155
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:12,240
groups groupings then the first one is appearances it's usually translated into english as

156
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,520
form and kind of the appearance of the body the physicality of the body the way it

157
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:25,520
appears to us the second one which is today is vedana the feeling tones of experience

158
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:32,240
whether they're pleasant unpleasant or neither pleasant or unpleasant and that was a whole exercise

159
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:37,920
a big exercise that near the beginning of this text the second foundation of mindfulness is

160
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,720
on this as well and and then it was just to know it

161
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,480
to know pleasant as pleasant to know unpleasant as unpleasant in the fifth foundation

162
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:58,480
the instructions are to know the inconstancy of the experience to know that the unpleasantness arise

163
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,240
that um and that it's arising it appears it uh if it persists that persists but

164
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:10,560
then as it uh passes away the rising and passing of um

165
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:17,680
of this feeling tones and um and as i said in the meditation

166
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:24,800
the analogy for this is a peaceful lake surface and a gentle rain it comes along

167
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:31,839
and uh and drops fall in the lake and makes little little uh ripples little concentric waves that

168
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:37,200
goes out a little splashes and um and those little splashes are there for a moment

169
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:42,320
and then they're gone the after effect might be the ripples that go out and so

170
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:48,800
these sensations are like the splash and then and then there might be a ripple through

171
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:55,119
us the after effect of that if there's if the rain is

172
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:00,560
uh falling hard it might just seem like it's a constant uh you know

173
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,400
uh there's a constant experience but if we look very carefully we see

174
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:11,760
that actually in fact it's still just a moment of splash and another one another one just a lot of them are happening all

175
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:18,079
around so um so in terms of the construction or

176
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:24,800
selection process some of us will prioritize whether we're comfortable uncomfortable

177
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:32,000
we navigate the world looking for what's pleasant and what's unpleasant avoiding the unpleasant wanting the pleasant

178
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,520
and um and that's kind of how we uh you know has give some priority to an

179
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:43,040
essential world and sensuality and is uh comfort and

180
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:49,760
being comforted by by experience and so we don't care that much maybe

181
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,680
how our appearances are the appearance of other people we're just interested in whether it's physically comfortable or

182
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:01,760
pleasant we don't care so much about

183
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:09,119
you know our ideas our opinions our stories of things we just want to be comfortable and pleasant

184
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:15,359
and of course it's a matter of degree but this is part of the grouping of our experiences some people prioritize and

185
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:22,240
select out of and and for the buddha this is one of the areas of clinging

186
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,599
so these are the five groupings of clinging and one of the groupings of clinging

187
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:33,440
is clinging to the feeling tones of experience

188
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:39,440
and and the antidote to that is uh is not to feel

189
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,640
um is to avoid feeling but rather the antidote is to see

190
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:50,480
that uh these sensations that were that are the basis for the construction

191
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,920
basis of the grouping and the clinging they are constantly

192
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,160
arising and passing away rising and passing away it's not necessarily easy to see that

193
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:08,560
but when we're now in the fourth foundation so if these four foundations of mindfulness our path it implies that

194
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:15,520
as we settle down and get concentrated and focus in this mindfulness practice at some point we're settled enough

195
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:22,400
that in the subtleness we become the calm we kind of become the calm surface of the lake

196
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:28,880
it becomes obvious that these sensations of pleasant and unpleasantness are appearing and disappearing

197
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:35,040
and then in that seeing that it's obvious that we are trying to hold on or cling to it

198
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,319
it's fascinating how clinging gets highlighted when things are coming and going

199
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:45,599
appearing and disappearing it's almost as if clinging is not quite successful

200
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:52,800
when things pass away in in deep meditation it's possible to feel the mind go towards an object like

201
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,800
i want that and by the time the mind gets there in that fraction of a moment the experience

202
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,920
has gone away that there's a pleasant experience so that's nice i want that by the time we

203
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,280
get there with you know it's gone because it arises and passes so quickly

204
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:16,160
and and so in that process uh not only are we beginning to let go

205
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,760
of clinging but we're also beginning to appreciate hopefully

206
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:27,119
the mind's clarity to see that clearly to see something

207
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:34,640
very simply in and of itself to see pleasant unpleasant and neither unpleasant in such a simple way

208
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:42,000
that it's not connected to stories not connected to the past and the future not not connected to the preferences we have

209
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,240
uh not connect to our fears of where it's going that uh that there's a kind of clarity and

210
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:55,040
simplicity it's just pleasant it's just unpleasant it's coming and going it appears and go appears and disappears

211
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:02,160
there's a rhythm to it it pulses into existence and pulses out the awareness of it the perception of it

212
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:08,480
the perceiving of it is moving and shifting around a little bit and one way or the other

213
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:16,400
we begin loosening up the grip of of clinging to it and selecting that out

214
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:23,359
of the wider field of experience that we have and at some point that as we do that the

215
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:31,040
attention becomes more much more spacious allowing and um more choiceless or more available

216
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:37,520
to whatever is happening without us that selection process operating

217
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,760
so

218
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:49,839
so it's great to learn not to cling so much and this is one of the ways that the

219
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:57,359
buddha is talking about and the benefit of this is that as we let cling less we can love

220
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:03,200
more as we cling less we can have more good will we can our hearts

221
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,359
care for the world can exist more we care for ourselves more

222
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:17,040
and and that's kind of the reward or the benefit from learning how not to cling

223
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:25,279
and for today it's clinging to pleasant and unpleasant so you might over these next 24 hours

224
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:30,400
see how much you prioritize or select out of your environment

225
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:36,000
and how important it is for you to kind of how you orient yourself and how your choices you make

226
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,040
uh whether whether things are pleasant or unpleasant

227
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:47,280
is this a neutral thing an interesting thing for you is this particularly strong for you

228
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,640
and if you can see if how important this is then can you also kind of see the ways

229
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:59,359
in which pleasant and unpleasant come and go through the day and what shifts for you

230
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:05,359
when you see it's coming and going and you realize oh this is the way it is for now just for now

231
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:12,319
it'll pass so thank you and um

232
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:16,760
i look forward to being here with you tomorrow
