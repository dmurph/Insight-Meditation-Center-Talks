1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:06,720
so hello again and formally welcome to happier

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:14,400
i like our soft beginning at the um at the start where we just say hello

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,439
and and basically it's a way of um

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,199
welcoming ourselves welcoming each other it's it's meta in action it's meta in action

5
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,880
um and i love that part it always warms my heart that when folks say hello and

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,880
sometimes they share a weather report very sweet so

7
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,360
and i find that part which does not get recorded on

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:50,239
for audio dharma in some ways for me to be the the landing the landing into the meta space

9
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,960
because we've already started our practice of meta when we arrive in this space in this community

10
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,440
by saying hello and and um sharing greetings so

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:10,840
so so for the theme for this evening uh evenings practice

12
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,840
um in some ways continuing with the theme from earlier

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,799
this week from monday is the theme of you know at this time it's such a busy

14
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:32,159
time of the year for many it's also it can be a challenging time of the year

15
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:41,600
it could be a challenging time of the year so so metta as a refuge metta as a refuge

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,399
as a coming home metta as a coming home as a refuge so

17
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:55,119
so that is the theme that i'd like uh to continue to practice with today the

18
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,840
sense of coming home and um [Music]

25
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:48,800
nourishing sense of love and warm-heartedness for ourselves

26
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,000

179
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,640
everyone i will read both clark i see your hand please

180
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:15,920
yeah i was just gonna say i feel like uh doing meta for all beings often feels

181
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,760
kind of hard because the phrases sometimes feel sort of artificial and i don't have a concrete

182
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,040
being to imagine it's sort of like i'm not sure what i'm connecting to

183
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:33,119
i it wasn't it was fun imagining i i imagined that my blanket just like

184
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,160
went on forever and as it encountered people like wrapped

185
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,680
over them which sounds kind of scary but it sounds lovely it sounds really

186
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,680
lovely monster but yeah there was something really tender about the idea of like wrapping a blanket around

187
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:55,680
somebody right like so that it helped bring that tenderness alive so

188
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,960
it wasn't just sort of like a you know sometimes you just feel like a meta robot like you're just repeating

189
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,720
their phrases sort of by wrote i really like that image so thanks

190
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:13,839
that is so lovely clark thanks so much for sharing that i'm just loving the generosity of that image your blanket

191
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:22,720
expanding and covering everyone it it comes in contact with it's just such a lovely fun playful image right a way of

192
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,640
practicing meta instead of as you were saying being a uh meta robot sometimes which

193
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:35,200
can feel pretty uh yeah not connecting but yay what whatever works the way to

194
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:41,520
to connect with the practice so yeah the meta blanket is always available to you

195
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:47,440
for yourself and others um jane

196
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,119
says thank you nikki love the soft warm blanket whispering meta and then opening

197
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:59,599
up to include others ah makes me happy just to think of it oh that's lovely thank you jane

198
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:04,880

199
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:11,119
yeah so any other reflections before we go into

200
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:16,240
uh into uh small groups and practice

201
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:25,440
together i see dave's hand please

202
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:31,520
oh yeah that was that was really delightful i noticed on the drive home i was at the

203
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:37,599
far end of whidbey island it's about 45 miles south when i looked after in the distance

204
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:43,440
the world seemed more all of the piece instead of taken apart by the critical mind

205
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,200
i don't know how to describe it really but it looked like it did when i was a kid

206
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,880
before i learned to take it apart and judge and well that's this place and that's they're no

207
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,079
good there and and so when i came to this and you're inviting us to come home

208
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,280
i really do feel like a kid again so that was very

209
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,400
very apt thank you beautiful wow

210
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,960
profound what you shared is so profound because the way often we

211
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:23,280
see the world as children these fresh eyes non-judgmental eyes and what a

212
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:30,400
blessing i i feel so moved in my heart what a blessing to be able to get that

213
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,560
perspective back right to look at the world and see it with those fresh

214
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:43,760
beginners eyes how beautiful i'm getting chills actually they feeling into what you just

215
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:51,200
shared ah beautiful maybe we'll make that the theme of our practice at some point

216
00:42:51,200 --> 00:43:00,160
lovely thank you dave it's lovely yeah i see so many smiles yeah

217
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:08,160
so dear ones there are no other reflections now let's turn

218
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:13,599
into small groups small community connection with

219
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,640
such a great way to connect with other human beings share your blanket with

220
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:25,040
each other in these small groups of three and then we come back and we'll have a

221
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:30,319
little more time and space for um for reflection so i'm going to

222
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:36,560
create the rooms now let me take a moment to do that

223
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:43,200
okay so all right the rooms are created i'm going to open them

224
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:49,040
please take care of yourselves and each other with the meta blankets coming home

225
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,599
here we go

226
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,480
okay welcome back everyone the rooms are closed and we have a few minutes for any

227
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,760
reflections anything especially that might have come up while you were

228
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:14,079
in groups together sharing your meta blanket with other practitioners i see some of you actually wrapped in literal

229
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:19,920
blankets right now it's very sweet so

230
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:29,760
so any reflections any thoughts you like to share

231
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,000
you can raise your hand type in chat

232
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:45,280
i see jerry's hand usually i don't see people's hands because i see very few of you but oh jerry can you raise your

233
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:52,240
uh zoom hand it'll be so much easier to ask you to unmute that well here here we go there

234
00:44:54,079 --> 00:45:00,800
so i was in our group we were reflecting about how this practice

235
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,839
both for some of us on the east coast it's

236
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:11,839
near 10 but for all of us we were reflecting on how

237
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:17,440
um just a little it's it's it's like

238
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:23,359
analogy that i said was like if someone cracks a joke um

239
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:29,920
and it's inappropriate and good in good spirit the next person you see no matter what's

240
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,440
going on in your life is a little lighter so you're smiling and they may

241
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,560
not know why you're smiling and it just sort of lifts things a bit so

242
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:47,839
i i was reflecting that this work that both of you and diana are doing

243
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:54,160
it just takes the edge off uh some of the things in life and allows you to

244
00:45:54,160 --> 00:46:00,640
not get lost in the weeds not to go deep down and sort of reflect and and

245
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:06,720
frankly be a bit nicer to people whoever they are as you re as you go through life and

246
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:12,560
with you don't do it you can get deep into the weeds faster than you

247
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:19,680
would like so that's the thought that was coming up that's lovely thank you

248
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:24,800
beautiful yeah not getting into the weeds and coming up a little faster and

249
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:31,839
i like the you know happy hour is like a good joke that keeps he keeps your spirits up or maybe keeps

250
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:39,200
your heart warmed uh and and that's actually that's similar to a comment someone else made which i

251
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:44,640
had missed earlier on on youtube who said thank you for always reminding me

252
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:52,720
of what's important and how to be and that's similar you know a reminder just a little reminder to our hearts of how

253
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:59,839
to be how to be just touching into that yeah thank you jerry that is lovely yeah

254
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:08,000
so meaningful so such a beautiful reflection reflections

255
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:13,839
to bring us to the end of the hour so let us

256
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:20,319
close this hour of practice practicing good will kindness

257
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:27,119
cultivating it for ourselves and others dedicating the merit the goodness

258
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:32,640
as a part of our service this cultivation is a gift it's not

259
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:38,400
something we keep for ourselves with a tight fist but we share with all beings everywhere

260
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:44,960
may all beings everywhere be free may they be reminded of their own goodness may all beings everywhere be

261
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:52,809
happy including ourselves [Music]

262
