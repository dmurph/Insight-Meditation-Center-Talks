1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:08,879
i want to tell a little story

2
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,920
there was once a family who went for a vacation to

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,920
another country turned out to be a buddhist country and they were there for a couple of

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,599
weeks and there was a teenager who in the family and she

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,600
noticed that their vacation spot was right close to a buddhist monastery

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,000
so the first week she kind of just noticed and you noticed it was particularly calm and peaceful place

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,520
that strucker is unique the second week she decided to kind of

8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:51,520
venture in and see what's going on in there and uh fortunate for her she met the

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:59,840
abbess pretty soon as he came in and they struck up a friendship and

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,600
then they he went back to see the abbess every day and abbas taught her a little bit about meditation

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,479
but that wakes up quickly and she was going to go back to her home country which was not a buddhist country

12
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,680
and she'd never heard of meditation before so she asked the abbess you know when i

13
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,079
go back to my country how can i

14
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,320
you know how can i continue this and learn more what this meditation is all about

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,240
and this was of course before youtube so so uh

16
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,960
and all that so so uh the app is said oh and you go back to your country

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,520
ask around for different people who are you know you're wise people you think are wise

18
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,840
and ask them if they can point you to the first someone they think is

19
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:58,718
wise a wise person who really knows how to listen

20
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,560
and then learn how to listen from that person and that was the instructions that was

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,440
the alternative to meditation learn how to listen and this idea of listening

22
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,640
uh is something that's very uh it keeps repeated in many religious traditions as

23
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,840
kind of representation of the kind of attention that

24
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,879
we bring in this kind of life of ours of practice and it's represented i think in my mind

25
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,000
that by the idea that the direct disciples of the buddha

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,519
in the holy word is sabaka which means the people who heard the

27
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,840
hearers and to be able to hear and there's something about

28
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,280
having the ability to hear the dharma literally by hearing it back in the old

29
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,800
days there was no books there was no audio dharma there was um

30
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,280
and so it was only her dharmas only could only be heard in someone talking about it

31
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,680
but not just hearing the dharma as a spoken but to hear the dharma in everything to

32
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,239
hear it in the breeze that goes and the rustling of the trees or in the hum of the air purifier or

33
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,879
something to he what is it to hear the dharma so i wanted to read

34
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,239
a little poem that

35
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,720
a verse that is by one of the early buddhist nuns named uttama

36
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:42,080
and it's slightly abbreviated i took out some of the technical terms that would maybe not mean anything for anyone

37
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:49,519
or most people not attaining mental peace

38
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,519
and with no control of my mind i approached a nun

39
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,840
who was trustworthy she taught me the dharma

40
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,239
i listened to the dharma as she instructed me

41
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:15,920
i listened to the dharma as she instructed me for one week i sat cross-legged in one

42
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:21,120
spot filled with joy and happiness

43
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,639
on the eighth day i straightened out my legs and shattered

44
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:33,360
the mass of darkness she woke up

45
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,560
so the turning point from her distress was hearing

46
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:45,440
listening to the dharma as it's being taught and

47
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:52,000
so listening how do we listen why is listening so important

48
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,520
the when i think about listening i think about

49
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,800
listening both externally but also listening internally and the importance of that is that i use

50
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,320
this metaphor this idea that the world that we can perceive

51
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,479
around us is kind of infinite it's like you know it spreads out wide

52
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,840
and big this world of ours and if you stand on top of a mountain and

53
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:29,360
look out across the world it's you see the vastness of it you know how big it is maybe and there's so much to perceive

54
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,400
but if you look inward to yourself is actually equally vast and big

55
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:43,120
and uh it turns out this little human body that we have um is when you but you when you kind of

56
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,160
bring the inner eye to see or the inner ear to really listen to what's here it

57
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,560
can feel just as vast it's as buried and multitude multifaceted as

58
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,120
the external world and listening sits right at the junction

59
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,800
between this external world this internal world and

60
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,639
and you can listen both externally and internally but the place standing there at that

61
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:18,840
junction and where the listening happens either way it's not like a

62
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:26,400
straight pure separation to an internal and external world the internal world that we have

63
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,479
is it influences how we listen to the external world how the external world is with us and

64
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:40,080
our experience with it influences how we experience the internal world and to and to be centered in the

65
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,160
listening um and really attend and be open to what's

66
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,440
there sooner or later you'll be start your different times your attention will

67
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:57,120
sometimes go more to the external world but sometimes goes more to the internal world

68
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,360
to the point where some point we realize that the two are not so separate from each other we're not not

69
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,479
not distinct from each other that how we are in the internal life

70
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:14,400
affects how we listen to the external world our listening our perception of the

71
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,639
world is seldom innocent seldom just pure and simple and

72
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,960
we're just seeing things just as they are but often we're listening or perceiving

73
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,560
for certain things we have our agendas our concerns our bias that we

74
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,680
bring along in how we perceive the world how what we

75
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,039
listen for so to stay with the idea of listening

76
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,800
some people are might be primed to listen to the tone of other people's voices

77
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,120
because a tone tells them whether they're safe or not and so they're that's what they're listening for that's what they pick up

78
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,560
and what other people never occurred to them that for some reason they that that's not an

79
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,319
issue for them and uh and so they're listening not for the tone of the voice

80
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,440
but they're maybe listening but what are they saying that

81
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:18,479
reflects back on me i hope they're saying good things to me and they're speaking to me in a way that they recognize my wonderfulness and greatness

82
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:25,120
and and if they don't let me tell them about it and uh and other people are listening

83
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,319
for how that how because they have maybe a lifetime history of this

84
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:37,039
of how they're going to be disrespected or ignored or not seen or not understood or overlooked or

85
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,880
diminished or some place of their value and so they're primed to listen to that listen for that

86
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:48,640
so so we we perceive different things for different purposes

87
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,000
if you're walking down the street and you need to buy a pillow

88
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,040
you'll notice pillow stores or you know but if what you're hungry

89
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,959
you might be looking for a grocery store and yes that's what you notice

90
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:10,000
or you know so that we kind of sometimes have we look according to what we want

91
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,279
what we're interested in what our history is what our associations are

92
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,480
certain sounds certain voices certain something we have histories of

93
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:27,200
of that and so if you know if you lived in a foreign country and had wonderful experiences with people speaking that

94
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:34,959
language and you hear people you know down there walking down the street speaking that language like ah oh yeah that's so good

95
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,720
and our history of that language influences how we hear and the impact it

96
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:46,000
has but if it was a difficult uh experiences with that

97
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,360
that language maybe if you were in a war zone and it's traumatic to hear that

98
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,760
language around then it can re-trigger some of those fears and concerns and pain

99
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:04,880
and uh in the listening so as we as we go into this more and more deeply in this practice

100
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,920
we start seeing that listening we stand at the junction of listening to the external world and the

101
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:16,320
internal world we start seeing the two aren't so absolutely separate

102
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:22,320
and that's where we begin seeing the dharma experiencing finding the dharma

103
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:29,279
not because someone's teaching the dharma but how we can find the dharma in every place we go every experience we

104
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,399
have because that's where we can see are we clinging

105
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:41,120
are we resisting what are we bringing with us what what are we adding to the situation

106
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,880
and some of we're adding might be appropriate and wonderful some of it might actually

107
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:53,040
be harming ourselves and other people some of it might not be particularly

108
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,800
harming in the way we think about harming but it's a kind of a wind drag it's kind of a

109
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,880
it kind of uh like you know interferes with our freedom or

110
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,079
our ease and peace so something is so kind of pretty subtle

111
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,680
maybe and um i've noticed in my mostly i see this in my meditation these

112
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:21,040
last few weeks is something i've become kind of more acutely aware of than before

113
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:28,480
is um how much time comes into play uh in my conceptions of the moment and

114
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:34,000
how it interp penetrates or is kind of there initially kind of unconsciously

115
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,440
it's kind of like oozes in to how i perceive what's going on in the moment

116
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,760
it can be so simple that as i exhale i'm aware that the exhale is going to

117
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,880
come to an end that's time right it's an idea of time a concept of time

118
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,720
and i can see like i can just let go of the just the simple thing of the exhale coming to an end

119
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,639
it's just an exhale n doesn't have to be part of it at all it's as if

120
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:10,880
it's timeless just the exhale and i could see the little added edition

121
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:16,720
of time the concept of time that added on top of it some people might feel what made you

122
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,160
what do you mean gil added on type on top of it time is real

123
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:30,480
we live in time kind of uh yes but i uh but my conception of time is my

124
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,200
addition uh it's just like for example if i'm sitting meditating

125
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,720
and uh and someone says well the roof of the building is real

126
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,920
does that mean i'm supposed to be thinking about the roof all the time roof roof sitting here roof roof roof

127
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:54,480
roof ruff ruff you know real you know you know you know ideally when you sit

128
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,760
and meditate at imc none of you will think about the roof when you're sitting here

129
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,440
and um except now that i brought it up you'll always think about it when you come

130
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:12,000
so same thing with time yes the roof exists but you don't have to think about all the time you can time exists you don't have to think

131
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,880
about it and there's so subtle the addition to it and and even something like uh sometimes

132
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,760
i'll relax when i meditate and i see it even there too that i'm a little bit ahead of myself

133
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,079
to the end of the relaxation or to the what's going to how good it's going to be when i am relaxed

134
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:38,720
just you know it took me a half a second ahead of myself or something but um i am you know living in this extra as

135
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:46,480
opposed to just feel the relaxation be with it just don't don't have time as if everything

136
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,560
that occurs is here forever kind of or just if this is its moment

137
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:59,040
and i really be here for it so the same thing so listening it's all these things that come along with

138
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:06,560
listening all these associations memories meaning agendas

139
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,880
preferences that come along so as we learn to sit back and listen

140
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,320
deeply then we're also learning to listening to ourselves

141
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:24,480
there's a story of a man who came to a therapist and said you know

142
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,519
my spouse is always angry and it's so difficult to live with my spouse and

143
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:34,959
i've been trying to deal with this for years but i think i need some help here from a therapist

144
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:40,959
and the therapist said well have you ever tried listening to your spouse well no

145
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:46,880
well go go home and listen so the person did and came back the next week

146
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:53,440
to the therapist and said i've been listening but it doesn't change anything okay i'm glad you've been listening now

147
00:14:53,440 --> 00:15:00,480
go back and listen to what's behind the words your spouse

148
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:07,120
speaks where are those words coming from so the person went back and spent

149
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:13,120
another week listening and listening what was behind the words and came back to the therapist and said

150
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,040
oh this made all the difference in the world there's peace at home now because

151
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,440
i realized that when my spouse was angry for me i had to you know i felt attacked

152
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,639
and my you know i kind of assumed i had to attack back and i had to have a fight i had to protect myself

153
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,880
but i listened to what was behind the words i realized my spouse was afraid

154
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,079
and when i realized the fear was there and i asked if we could talk about it

155
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,440
that just changed everything and there was no more any fights in the home and we had a whole different

156
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:53,920
conversation so to listen deeply to ourselves that way

157
00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:00,079
what's behind our words so many of us live in conversations

158
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:06,320
live in memories live in projected futures and concepts and ideas

159
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,880
what happens if we listen to ourselves deeply and uh and in doing so

160
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:20,480
maybe hear what's behind the words if we're some people are phenomenally

161
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,959
you know in the world of thinking and stories and imagery

162
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:33,440
it's a fine story sometimes a fine world sometimes to be in but what happens if you listen to what

163
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:40,320
makes you think and listen to that what do you find and what happens to

164
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,440
you know if you listen deeply there to what what makes you think what makes

165
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,199
you your impulse to be and once you're there

166
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,320
and discover that i bet also then you'll learn to listen to others in new ways

167
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,360
because what was making you spend a lot of time thinking

168
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:08,558
probably is influencing how you were listening as well certain subtle agendas or concerns

169
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:14,079
but so this idea of settling back and listening deeply deeply

170
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,798
and you know i grew up speaking norwegian

171
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,720
and there's a word in it just like in english there's a word for hearing and a word for listening

172
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,120
and listening the word is but if there's a academic norwegian

173
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:39,120
dictionary academics

174
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:47,280
dictionary that has a definition for um for this listen that i really love

175
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,600
it's uh it's um make an effort

176
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,200
and i've never known maybe other dictionaries do this too but part of the definition is in parenthesis

177
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,440
so i don't know why you know but okay so it says make an effort and then it says in parenthesis

178
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:13,360
and keep quiet [Laughter]

179
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:20,640
maybe it's apprentices because you're supposed to say it quietly or something so make an effort and and

180
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:27,520
keep quiet to pick up perceive sound

181
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,600
what a great definition to listen but uh to be quiet

182
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:39,120
as you listen and the reference point i have for that is listening to a very quiet sound far

183
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,240
in the distance and i think some of us if we try to do that we even close our eyes and get

184
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,960
really quiet and kind of quiet our thinking mind so we can really hear the subtle sound

185
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,679
but uh but what happens is it possible to quiet the inner the chatter

186
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,519
even if it's just for two moments

187
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:10,160
and uh what happened that's that and that suggests that's a way of beginning to hear the dharma in

188
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,360
everything it's in that quiet we can pick up and experience

189
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,960
better where the stress is where the compulsions are where the preoccupations

190
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:28,080
are and one of the marvelous things about being quiet for one moment or two moments it doesn't have to be long

191
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:34,720
is that it could be just long enough to see how difficult it is to be quiet

192
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:41,120
and and as soon as you start seeing how difficult it is to be quiet that's where the dharma can be found

193
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,880
that's where we see where there's compulsion and clinging and desire and fears operating

194
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,320
and rather than being upset at seeing that in the dharma we kind of celebrate oh i

195
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:58,720
saw it i see it more clearly than ever before and some people have specialties

196
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:07,840
specialize it you know being critical about what they see like all good new all cell phonologists bad news

197
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:14,080
but in the dharma we're training ourselves to kind of learn to appreciate

198
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:20,799
seeing the compulsions the agendas the fears the angers the greed the desires

199
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,799
that we get caught in we appreciate it not so we can do it better

200
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:32,400
but so that we could listen to it and listen to what where does it come

201
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,919
from what's even deeper than that and to listen in such a way that the

202
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:44,880
listening has a lot of space in the room one of the things i love about listening

203
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,080
and i may hopefully there's not a good argument that it's different than this

204
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,960
you can make probably some argument but there's something about listening

205
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,240
that that you're not touching what you're

206
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:09,600
listening to you're not you're not um interfering in a certain way

207
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:16,960
it's just you almost i think of listening as making space to allow oneself to hear

208
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:22,720
and uh and so there's a kind of a peacefulness or non-aggressiveness hopefully in the listening

209
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,880
there might be times when listening is aggressive and maybe even problematic but then

210
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:35,039
what i'm pointing to is what inspires me about listening is it's kind of like uh this ability to

211
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:40,799
have perception that doesn't require any kind of interfering

212
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:46,799
with what's happening it just allows things to be as they are but they're heard

213
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:53,840
but but but to really know how to do that well

214
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:59,919
then we have to also hear ourselves listen to ourselves to see where

215
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,440
the extra baggage we bring the extra judgments and values and preoccupations

216
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,640
we have because seldom listening is seldom innocent

217
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:17,440
but if but to have this sense this is as this clear reference point

218
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,559
of the possibility of listening without interfering

219
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:28,720
and the reference point for that for me is hearing the difference between listening and

220
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:35,440
hearing is that listening is uh requires some effort as a norwegian dictionary says

221
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,640
you know make an effort um the uh

222
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,480
uh it's some directedness to listen but to uh to hear

223
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:52,720
uh uh we can it's uh hearing and listening sometimes is synonymous in the way we speak but

224
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,080
sometimes hearing is doesn't have that directedness

225
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:05,120
it doesn't have the effort we can hear without having to think about or want to

226
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:11,120
hear what we want you know a loud car goes by we hear it but initially we're not

227
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:19,120
planning to hear it choosing to hear it directing ourselves to hear it we just hear it the bird sings and we hear it

228
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,640
and there's something about just hearing and leaving things alone and being able to relax and open just

229
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:31,760
here that is is a wonderful reference point

230
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,360
for seeing when we can't hear when we do it when we do get involved

231
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:44,400
and caught up in our thoughts and ideas of what's going on and that's one of the functions

232
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,760
of mindfulness meditation this path of buddhism

233
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,200
is not to kind of fall into some wonderful bliss state a wonderful place

234
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,400
of peace and just kind of like have a kind of enlightened retirement

235
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,400
and i have it made and that's you know if only i could be kind of rest in peace then everything

236
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:13,440
will be okay the purpose of the dharma is to have just enough peace

237
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,720
so that we can see what takes us away from it and that's

238
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:24,480
where we see the dharma that's where we hear the dharma and uh

239
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:32,000
and so when we listen to the trees rustling or the birds or the rivers glowing or the rain

240
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,480
falling

241
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:44,000
we're not just hearing the rain the leaves rustling we're also if you listen well

242
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:51,919
we're hearing that there's a mutuality a cooperation in the hearing it's us and our memories

243
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,840
and associations and all kinds of things that come along with the hearing

244
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,679
and this and some if we don't have any attachments and clinging and fears and all these extra kind of

245
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:09,360
suffering producing things as part of it it gets to be a very rich world

246
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,520
to hear and listen and perceive the natural world around us and the social world around us

247
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:21,679
it adds a kind of deeper dimensions to it what are we listening to

248
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:27,039
it's kind of co-created it's kind of like we're it's not just completely

249
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:33,360
out there is not completely in here but something is happening in the interface and the

250
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:40,640
connectivity and the ways in which we somehow overlap our lives or

251
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,640
co-create our lives together co-create with the wind blowing in the trees out there

252
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:54,240
and and what is that what is that world what is that life

253
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,760
a life that's not so maybe so self-centered but it's not

254
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,520
exactly self-forgetting either

255
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:11,120
so to listen to listen deeply to hear

256
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,000
to allow the

257
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,760
so to be able to hear the dharma not only and when it's dharma's being taught

258
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:29,520
by someone but to be able to hear the dharma all the time wherever we go

259
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:35,760
the dharma is available if we've learned how to listen and then we become a disciple of the

260
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:42,480
buddha a a listener

261
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,159
so let's all listen and remember also to listen to each other

262
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:54,400
and maybe to listen to what's below the words of what people say so that we can love

263
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:59,520
in some deeper way what's behind the words and

264
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:06,000
may listening be a vehicle for care and compassion and love

265
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,919
in this world that we live in so thank you very much

266
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:21,840
and uh for those of you who are on youtube

267
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,279
we've started now a few weeks ago to have a zoom room that's open

268
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:33,440
after the talk where jan and barry kind of host it and they do some breakout groups and

269
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,559
just to have a discussion about the talk or about the dharma or get to know each other a little bit

270
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:45,440
so and i think that the the link is i think it's in the chat

271
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:52,000
at the very top of the chat and also i think it's going to be posted in a few minutes or moments or is it again now

272
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,520
thank you martha and then also

273
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:03,039
if it's also on the imc calendar you found the home page of imc there's a calendar

274
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:09,760
you can find a link there to the zoom room so thank you and

275
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:16,399
we do have a little bit of time left before the official ending of today does any of you have any comments or

276
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:23,120
questions that he'd like to make at this point so brian

277
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,200
well thank you that was a wonderful talk and you know a lot of my work has been with listening to the world so it was

278
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:40,080
very appropriate the problem is that when i listen to my body my body won't stop complaining

279
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,919
it says oh you're finally listening to me your shoulder hurts you're you know

280
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:52,480
it's uh yeah and also i have really bad tinnitus so whenever i listen i hear the tinnitus so you know there's a lot of

281
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:59,679
things that that are difficult for me when i actually listen to my body

282
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:05,840
yes so so that what you're calling the difficulty yeah

283
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,360
that's where you find the dharma okay so i wouldn't shy away from experiencing that

284
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:17,360
difficulty but for you to discover what what do you mean by difficulty what exactly is happening

285
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:24,399
because uh a painful shoulder one you know one way of just as a way of

286
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:30,559
thinking about it it's helpful to think kind of provisionally that a painful shoulder

287
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:35,760
is just a painful shoulder there's no difficulty

288
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,840
the difficulty is what you're adding so what is that and uh so i would spend

289
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:48,480
i'd i'd encourage you that you seem to sit well and still uh i would encourage you to uh

290
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,080
in meditation at least spend time being very patient with the physical pain and

291
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,440
listen to it and feel it and discover what you're adding that's extra

292
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:06,080
and the advantage of that is that once you can find what's extra the resistance the judgments the fears or whatever the

293
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,399
expectation or whatever that extra that um that's very respectful for our body then

294
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:18,960
you might be able to listen to your body more deeply and then you might be able to discern that there's subtle subtle or not so

295
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,399
subtle shifts you can make in your posture or how to take care of this part of yourself better

296
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:30,559
also you might discover that the body has self-healing powers and sometimes some of the places of

297
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:36,480
tension will begin to unravel themselves or soften or open up

298
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,679
or you start discovering that i guess this pain will be forever

299
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,760
but the problem was not the pain the problem was all the tension i added around it

300
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,360
and i can soften the tension that's around it and then it becomes simpler and simpler and it turns out i can be

301
00:30:53,360 --> 00:31:00,320
peaceful i can be at peace with the pain once i've kind of you know settled some of the extra layers

302
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:06,159
so i don't know if how i worded it is meaningful for you but no maybe that's that's wonderful that's wonderful yeah

303
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:11,519
take your time a lot of compassion and care the only one thing i would suggest for you

304
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,720
is some basically suggesting you know sit in pain

305
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:24,000
is uh what i suggest for you is only do it sit with the pain when you feel um

306
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,519
you want to okay this is this is a good exercise it's useful i understand why i'm doing it

307
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:35,279
i see how i understand really understand this this is a there's a way in which this is beneficial for me

308
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:42,640
and it's not easy to do but i feel motivated when you no longer feel motivated

309
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:48,960
or feel or understand how it's beneficial probably to take a break you don't have to force yourself to kind

310
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,159
of you know bear through it at all costs so so just be

311
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,480
caring for yourself too that way thank you

312
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,880
thank you dearsonga so in my ten years of practice i've gone

313
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:24,080
from someone who's unable to listen to being very very can you hold the quote at my oh sorry yes okay so my 10 years

314
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,840
of practice i've gone from not being able to listen to people to listening so deeply

315
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:36,080
that i've become very reactive so i was wondering if there's

316
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:44,000
a difference or if there's a passive listening active listening what i do i'd call it reactive listening

317
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,880
great great well i congratulate you for listening deeply that's a review that's a really great thing to learn how to do and chad

318
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:56,799
said i don't know you well enough but what i suspect is happening is that you've come to a deeper place

319
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:03,600
inside of you that the what you hear is is uh striking it so what i mean by

320
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,360
this is that if i hold my hand like this and someone comes along like this

321
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:15,519
uh you know there's resistance it hits something but if my hand relaxes

322
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:21,279
then this goes right through it doesn't stop and so or if i had like there's lots of

323
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:27,679
space and things just find their way through so you're probably getting touching something very deep inside of you that

324
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:33,919
those things are striking and so discover what they're hitting and if you can find out what's going on

325
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,519
what's because it doesn't have to hit anything so what is that that it's hitting

326
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:46,320
um and uh and then then i think you're probably what's wonderful sensitivity and

327
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,559
capacity to perceive and feel and others might even get more acute but it's just

328
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:57,840
gonna not land anywhere it's not gonna hit anything and you'll feel more porous

329
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:06,320
and you won't be unfeeling if you do that but you'll actually be more more capable of holding what's going on

330
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,358
thank you that makes a lot of sense yes because i have ptsd so yeah

331
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:16,398
one of the things we're trying to do in this practice i would say suggest and i think

332
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:23,679
listening is again a nice metaphor for this is we're uh we're expanding our capacity to hold

333
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:30,878
life experience so rather than necessarily solving the problems or fixing things that happen

334
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:36,240
we're making more room in the mind the heart the body to be able to hold things

335
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,679
and to be present for things as they are and so sometimes we were so preoccupied

336
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:48,158
with ourselves with our concerns our life that there's very little room and then if there's very little room in

337
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:54,720
there then sometimes i feel like i have to change the world so that everything can be okay

338
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:01,359
and the other people have to behave better so that can be okay but as we learn to open up the ears to

339
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:07,520
listen and there's that turns out there's lots of room and hearing to hear all kinds of things without

340
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,599
being reactive to it there's lots of rooms in the heart amazingly lots of room in our love

341
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:19,280
that can just be really spacious and it isn't it doesn't

342
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,040
forgive people for what they say sometimes it's like you know everything is good but

343
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:31,359
we don't have to then it doesn't have to we have to react to it because we have

344
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:37,520
so much space so thinking of meditation as increasing our capacity

345
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:44,440
is i think a useful orientation

346
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,640
so any last last one anything else anyone wants to

347
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:05,200
well thank you all for coming and and uh

348
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:12,720
i hope that uh you'll come back soon and stay stay uh

349
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:19,200
we'll probably make soon uh maybe in a few days um an update for the registration and

350
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,880
things for how we do it here at imc and what we're opening for

351
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:30,960
so uh you know i think all of you have registered so um therefore you'll get an email

352
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:37,599
within you know with the updates for november probably will open a little bit more at imc and

353
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:42,960
we might change a little bit how we do this sunday morning and and uh

354
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:49,520
so so that information will be you know will come through those emails people who are registered

355
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,200
and the reason we do it that way is we don't want to make it too public when we're open because that's a little bit

356
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,560
of a challenge for for the managers if people who show up

357
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:06,720
without having been that we know that they're uh you'd have been vaccinated

358
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:13,440
and also we want to try to keep the numbers at a proper number and we might slowly increase the number

359
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,480
but uh but when i keep on i keep keeping to keep tabs on that so we don't want to

360
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,599
have people wandering in so it's through getting being registered and getting that emit that email that

361
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:32,838
you find out what's actually happening so thank you all very much
