1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,960
hello and welcome to the meditation session

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:17,359
and as an introduction to this meditation uh I think many of you know

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,560
that when we practice mindfulness meditation uh there's a big emphasis on

4
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,640
being with things as they are and cultivating the ability to be present

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,440
for whatever arises in experience and um and whatever sense

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,920
door whatever location mind body heart

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,680
and to cultivate a way of being with what

8
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:54,000
is but there is something subtle or maybe not so subtle that very important to take into

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
account is that um the mind has a tendency to prioritize

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,439
certain things to be oriented in certain directions as being the important thing

11
00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:12,759
to notice and um so if

12
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:18,600
um we're you know looking for I remember

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,360
many years ago when I was looking for a futon couch I was surprised suddenly how

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:33,360
many futon couch doors there were uh I had no idea but now that I was looking for it or concerned with it I my

15
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,720
attention prioritized it and I noticed and saw and so some of us

16
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,040
prioritize certain uh way of thinking certain attitudes we

17
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,799
prioritize what's wrong we prioritize finding evidence that we are

18
00:01:51,799 --> 00:02:00,719
somehow um uh wrong or a bad person or some something like

19
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:08,679
that and some people prioritize um um you know everything is wonderful

20
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:14,239
and and had live in kind of a rose-colored glasses of things and and

21
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:21,200
so they don't see things as they really are and so this idea of prioritizing some people prioritize around things

22
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:29,440
that are directly connected to themselves Me Myself and mine and there can be a tremendous over orientation on

23
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:37,239
myself and how it affects me and what I want some people prioritize other people

24
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:43,599
and it's concerned with caring for them and what they think so same thing when we sit down to

25
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:50,239
meditate there can be a bias towards certain experiences there times in my life I

26
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,800
bias towards of pain ready to notice and pounce on any slightest indication of

27
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,080
pain and discomfort sometimes with a magnifying glass glass and and making it

28
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:10,239
be much bigger than it actually was sometimes we uh sit down and meditate and the orientation we have is

29
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:17,640
uh maybe automatically around how we feel the emotional state we're in and some of it might be natural

30
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,440
because we have certain conditions that allow certain things to predominate and be very important for our well-being to

31
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,879
care for well but there might also because of that a kind of Habitual

32
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:36,720
reaction to keep looking in certain directions keep becoming aware of certain

33
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:45,000
things so when we get down to practice samadi um we're shifting that and being

34
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,239
intentional in the direction in which we prioritize not to push something away

35
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:58,760
not to be aversive to something or or to condemn anything at all but uh it's for

36
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:06,959
example if you're washing your dishes and pots and um um sometimes you know what I wanted

37
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,480
to wash it well um uh I'm paying careful attention to where their dirt is and if

38
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:20,160
I can't see the food that's stuck to the plate I might pass my hand over it to really feel and I might be a lot many

39
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,600
many other things might be going on in my life but um I'm really engaged

40
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:32,160
washing dishes require a certain direction of attention I'm not pushing things away or denying other things it's

41
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:39,800
just this is the task at hand so with samadi the task at hand is to is to

42
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:46,120
engage and notice what supports you to become gathered to become unified to be

43
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,800
really here with all of yourself in a nice unstressful

44
00:04:51,800 --> 00:05:00,360
way and um and part of that that allows the subma to grow is to slightly

45
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:07,360
prioritize the good feelings that come along not to manufacture them not to

46
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,759
think they're always going to be there uh sometimes big part of practice is to

47
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:20,520
uh learn to be a quanus and peaceful non-reactive with what is and sometimes

48
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,639
the feelings of well-being that arise are subtle and it might be a feeling of

49
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,360
rightness of being with what's difficult difficult emotions difficult moods

50
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,000
difficult situations and pain there can be as we practice mindfulness and we develop some

51
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,800
non-reactivity there's a feeling of rightness oh this is good that I'm present and so it's a kind of subtle

52
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:49,000
kind of well-being that uh but it is a kind of well-being that something feels

53
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:59,479
right given what's happening it's right that I'm here and um so the um so with Sade

54
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:07,599
though as we settle in we want to gently prioritize ways in which we feel good

55
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:13,360
ways in which through the meditation with the meditation there's

56
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,880
feelings of well-being that begin arising and they might be very subtle at

57
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,840
first and um and uh but over time the guideline or the orientation might to

58
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:32,360
notice the pleasure that's there what's Pleasant and the growing pleasantness and

59
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:39,039
pleasure of prioritize that not to push anything else away but to just gently

60
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,440
kind of keep that as a reference point uh to really help you stay there in the

61
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:50,479
Rhythm like I put my gently feel the top of the plate to see if there's any food

62
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:58,440
still stuck that I can't see so the so the um so we gently kind of

63
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:03,479
prioritize the Fe feel this goodness here feel the well-being that's

64
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:10,720
arising and in due time the uh this sense of well-being and

65
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:18,840
pleasure um morphs into a sense of joy and um and so I'll lead you

66
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,360
now so to assume your meditation

67
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,599
posture and gently close your eyes

68
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:42,680
and to take a few long slow deep breaths and settle in to your posture your

69
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:53,360
body the Deep inhale is a getting the support of a deeper

70
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,360
breath to be present here in our body

71
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:14,960
as you exhale allowing the longer exhale than

72
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:24,319
usual help you settle in further become grounded in the body

73
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:35,200
deeper inhales and exhales is a little bit of a ritual

74
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:45,279
transition to help the mind the heart be ready to be here and now in this

75
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:04,800
body and then letting your breathing return to normal and for

76
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,279
maybe another four or five

77
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,360
breaths feeling different parts of the body that you want to relax on the

78
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:20,880
inhale and then relax those parts of the body on the

79
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
exhale for

80
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:07,360
and then to feel in your body any sense

81
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:15,399
of anything that you appreciate right now about Sensations

82
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:25,360
feelings maybe there's a subtle shift to being a little calmer more

83
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,000
settled more connected

84
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:45,040
maybe there's some certain pleasure that comes or a pleasantness inspiration that

85
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:51,240
comes with beginning the meditation and settling into

86
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:59,680
it it might be a mental appreciation pleasure

87
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,160
but it might be something in the

88
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,959
body maybe a diffuse feeling

89
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:16,160
of pleasantness that might be there in

90
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,959
addition to any places in your body that are

91
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,680
unpleasant gently lean into the Pleasant

92
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,360
let your

93
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:43,320
awareness become a little bit more clear or present with the help of what's Pleasant

94
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,720
in your

95
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,320
body it might be some soft diffus

96
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,519
generalized hum or glow in your

97
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:20,079
body or it might be some very specific spot that as you meditate Comes Alive a

98
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:27,959
bit with pleasure tingling

99
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,639
the

100
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:54,560
glow if there's a generalized sense of well-being or

101
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:02,480
pleasure allow that to be surrounded the experience of

102
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:10,600
breathing almost like a gent soft blanket

103
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,519
or that nurtures or nourishes the body's experience of

104
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,519
breathing

105
00:13:52,320 --> 00:14:00,079
and then to feel in this cycle of breathing in and breathing out is there any point in that

106
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:05,839
cycle the where the sensations of breathing feel

107
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:19,279
Pleasant where the body can take in the pleasure of it

108
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,720
and if there is some pleasure in breathing something

109
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:45,279
pleasant let that be a slight

110
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:50,279
priority to feel it each cycle of

111
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:59,680
breathing as if it's a door to enter into to be more

112
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:07,800
in the breathing more centered in the breathing

113
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:46,399
and if there's any pleasure at all associated with the

114
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,720
meditation gently

115
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:58,600
lightly let that support the awareness

116
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:07,279
that begins in the settling spot the grounding

117
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,800
spot and remains throughout the

118
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,240
inhale throughout the exhale

119
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,680
feeling the full length of in and out breath as if there's a gentle way from

120
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,720
the inside breathing is stroking your

121
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:10,240
body and if that any of it is

122
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,880
Pleasant allow yourself to

123
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,959
feel the pleasure as an

124
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,679
encouragement to stay with a breath continuously

125
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:01,280
and when you let go of your thoughts see if in the

126
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,559
quieting and letting them go float

127
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:13,280
away there's some sense of pleasure well-being in the mind to not be caught

128
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,559
in

129
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:26,919
thoughts and allow that well-being or pleasure than to join the pleasure of

130
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
breathing

131
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

132
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

133
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
e e

134
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,679
sometimes the pleasure that can support

135
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:41,320
meditation is evoked by ever so

136
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:49,440
slightly with the corners of your lips your mouth making a little

137
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,960
smile just enough for there to evoke some pleasure

138
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,120
or Joy Delight

139
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,320
and if there is such

140
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:19,000
pleasure let it support an orientation

141
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,200
to being centered on breathing

142
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,679
as if the rhythm of breathing the

143
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:53,600
body is what keeps us connected to pleasure Joy

144
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,520
well-being however subtle it might be

145
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

146
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

147
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

148
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

149
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

150
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

151
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
for e

152
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,880
and as we come to the end of this sitting

153
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:32,600
perhaps to allow yourself to

154
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:43,399
smile perhaps allow yourself to feel whatever well-being or goodness

155
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:48,039
that's here through this

156
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:59,679
meditation maybe is a subtle pervasion of the body with

157
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,398
being calmer more

158
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,240
settled maybe it's a

159
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:16,440
specific feeling of physical

160
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,039
pleasure somewhere in your

161
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:31,240
body or something that's between being invasive and

162
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:47,240
specific and for a few moments maybe there's a way of allowing yourself to

163
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:55,880
drink in whatever sense of well-being or

164
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,120
pleasure that's

165
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:12,200
here maybe turning up your lips to smile in such a

166
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:18,840
way that a sparkle might be there in your eyes for how you're going to open

167
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,039
your eyes and see the

168
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:31,039
world and with your mind's eye with a sparkle

169
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:38,799
of appreciation Delight that maybe can

170
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:46,320
see other people with respect and delight and

171
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:58,880
appreciation that softens them that disarms them

172
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:05,398
that brings forth their own relaxation and ease and

173
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:13,399
well-being so that the difficult people in the world become less

174
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:19,679
difficult so that the friendly people in the

175
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:26,278
world feel seen and share joined in their

176
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:34,559
friendliness May may it be that this practice that we do allows us to see the

177
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:41,600
world with fresh eyes without

178
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,760
bias but with a Sparkle with a

179
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:56,240
joy and with that to live for the welfare and happiness of all beings

180
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:04,760
including our own and in knowing well-being for

181
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:12,200
ourselves we can wish it for others may all beings be

182
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:21,399
happy may all beings be safe may all beings be

183
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:29,120
free and may all beings be peaceful

184
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:38,720
and may this wonderful community of ours with so many people meditating

185
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,240
now feel like we're doing this together as we go out the

186
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,039
world that we're spreading human goodness out into the

187
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:53,039
world

188
00:30:55,870 --> 00:31:04,589

192
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:15,760
samadi and um but before I do I I would like to make the repeat the announcement

193
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,880
I made on Monday that IMC partly inspired from what this YouTube

194
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:27,480
community did three years ago uh raising money for the refugees

195
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:34,000
from the Ukraine uh where IMC is inspired to do this

196
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:41,480
again for children in in areas of great crisis who are facing famine and illness

197
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,760
and injuries of all kinds and the way we want to do this is

198
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,919
with the making donations to save the children organiz wonderful

199
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,519
organization that um does wonderful work in the world for

200
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:04,080
children for many decades now and uh so we started this week the fundraising drive and we're about a

201
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:11,240
third the way to what I'm hoping is the inspiring goal for us and uh and if

202
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:18,600
you're interested in joining together and participating in the kind of the the

203
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,679
the the collective effectiveness of a community doing something uh with each

204
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:29,799
other uh you can go on the IMC website the homepage has a couple of places

205
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:34,919
where you can get to the uh save the children donation page that we're

206
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:41,519
using that um is specific to IMC and um and there's a red banner on

207
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,559
top of the website and there's a in the what's new section of the

208
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:51,919
homepage there's a notice as well so thank

209
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,000
you and uh in talking about that um the

210
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,480
the Gathering together of a community and the power that that can bring so in

211
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:09,358
meditation the Gathering Together of ourselves into a unified whole um

212
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,638
into to enter into a state being that's called

213
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:21,000
samadi uh gives the individual a certain power and uh that can then can be used

214
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:27,200
for good in the world and um and brings the the power of

215
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,679
of love the power of Peace the power of being

216
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:38,599
settled um and um the power of being present in a very full and embodied

217
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:47,760
complete way and um and so the um so this Gathering

218
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:55,000
ourselves together of samadi is supported by Pleasure supported by the

219
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,599
pleasantness or the happiness that can come from meditation and there are times when

220
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:07,040
meditation teachers have deemphasized the joy and the happiness and come with

221
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,839
meditation one form of that the emphasizing is by saying uh telling the

222
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:18,000
practitioner when they feel some Joy or happiness or pleasure in the meditation

223
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:24,640
to um to um um now now there's one more

224
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:31,680
thing for you to let go of and and but I think I would say it

225
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:37,480
differently uh it's one more thing not to be attached to but don't exactly let

226
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:44,000
go of it stay with it maintain it it's one more thing to open your hands to

227
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,079
hold kindly and supportingly uh so that something there

228
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:54,960
can grow and develop uh it's almost like um not

229
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,520
clinging not being attached not being resistance not not being afraid of the pleasure and joy that comes in

230
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:07,119
meditation is almost like we're opening up uh or there's an opening up like a

231
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:13,240
flower that opens when it's going well we don't say the flower is letting go of

232
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:18,560
itself when it opens but it is no longer bunched up and

233
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:25,599
tight and uh the reference to flower uh works well for some people who

234
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:31,920
uh talk about the the beauty that can arise in samadi and that's

235
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:39,280
sometimes a more useful reference point than pleasure or Joy where it's some of

236
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:46,119
us can have a complicated relationship to that and maybe we have a certain standard what Joy means or what pleasure

237
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:51,760
means that gets in the way of us appreciating what's here but uh or we

238
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:58,119
want to we appropriate it the joy we hold on to the Joy or the pleasure like we want more

239
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:03,359
Beauty uh of meditation uh it's difficult to appropriate that it's

240
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:09,960
difficult to grab onto Beauty because it's kind of a morphous it's kind of like it's not something that something

241
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:16,640
that can be destroyed the more we cling it's um it's almost like the an

242
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:22,440
open hand uh disappears if we grab onto the hand to hold on to we like that open

243
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:29,359
hand so much we don't want to share it with anyone and we make a fist well the open hand is lost and in that process so

244
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:35,880
Beauty can be that way so some people can feel the beauty of uh maybe of

245
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:42,640
breathing that some there's something very sweet that can start happening and may the word sweetness is another way of

246
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,839
talking about this positive positive feelings that can start coming from

247
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:57,040
meditation and um and uh it's okay to evoke it slightly not to make it a big

248
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,760
project but to um classic instruction is to uh

249
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:09,599
have a little half smile on your lips and sometimes that brings kind of pleasure Sensations around the lips

250
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:17,520
around the cheeks or the face sometimes it begins to shift some whole inner feeling that we have um kind of

251
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:23,240
reconditions Rec kind of shapes something uh that uh maybe creates an

252
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:31,480
alternative to how we might be shaped and affecting our body or hearts or Minds by doing with our mind something

253
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:38,760
that's the opposite of a smile uh sometimes we can be an automatic pilot with with resentments or

254
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:44,839
anger or aversions or finding what's wrong or or being critical

255
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:50,319
self-critical and it can be so much so so so common and so frequent we do this

256
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:56,760
that it just seems like the natural state of way of being and we don't even know that we're doing it but it has a

257
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:02,760
very strong condition effect influence on our whole being and sometimes uh it's

258
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:10,720
nice to do within reason a slight kind of re uh orientation towards what is

259
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,640
good right now what is Pleasant right now what is nice right

260
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,839
now some people find it useful when they sit down and and make sure that they're

261
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:28,280
sitting in a place where they're not no one's going to disturb them where they feel safe and then and and maybe even

262
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:35,200
look around in their room that the door is closed and no one's there and there's no monsters under the

263
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:41,000
bed and uh and uh and actually feel the safety of it some people feel very

264
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:46,680
little safety in their life and to um and so that the fear doesn't get the

265
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:51,800
upper hand it might be good to actually take time to feel the sense of safety

266
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,520
that might be there uh some people take time to feel gratitude at the beginning

267
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,560
of a sitting and being reminded of things that we're grateful for um is an

268
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:09,040
antidote to some of the other non-gr grateful ways in which we're operating some people like to evoke

269
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,440
sense of contentment contentment is in the family of well-being

270
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:21,160
happiness and um and so to find feel the ways in which you feel content in your

271
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:29,280
life as opposed to discontented and so to kind of bring into the meditation some kind of uh

272
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:36,280
appropriate way not forcing it not not paning it but some appropriate Way start

273
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:43,520
kind of uh evoking and bringing forth and being connected to uh a well-being a

274
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:50,040
pleasure in the pleas present moment for some people that pleasure

275
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:57,560
that can come from meditation comes from uh uh uh starting to be absorbed in the

276
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:03,920
focus of meditation such as the breathing to uh because just staying

277
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:10,640
continuously with the breathing means that we're no longer um concentrating

278
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:17,000
absorbed in thoughts and feelings which are create the opposite for us opposite

279
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,240
of Joy opposite of well-being and um and when those begin

280
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:28,680
quieting down and settling and the and and they're not fragmenting us or or or

281
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:36,160
um uh irritating the heart or the mind there's a natural sense of uh being

282
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,760
more peaceful more subtle more calm and as we kind of stay continuous with the

283
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:49,000
breath um there's something that gets uh evoked um that is clearly a feeling of

284
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:55,960
pleasure or joy that is not in the breath itself but

285
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:03,240
is in the way the mind mind is getting organized and absorbed with the focus of attention it

286
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:10,280
turns out that there's something about the brain that when it gets really peacefully absorbed or attentive

287
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:16,400
gathered around a thing that it seems to release uh maybe it's releasing hormones

288
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:25,040
or something it tends to re release something something begins to be evoked and pleasure and joy that comes maybe

289
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,559
partly because with that kind of absorption um there's no longer a feeling of

290
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:36,520
unsafety there's no longer a feeling of discontent there's no longer a feeling

291
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:43,240
of of uh being oppressed or being being put upon or no longer being reminded of

292
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:49,760
all the responsibilities we have to accomplished all the things all the plans we have to do the to-do list all

293
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:57,760
these things that make us fragmented and cut up in tense begin kind of falling away and just that feels good

294
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:03,559
there's the pleasure of relief ah just here in a simple

295
00:43:03,559 --> 00:43:08,599
way and um and of course it's not like this

296
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:13,880
direct kind of highway to pleasure but it's helpful to realize

297
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:20,559
that pleasure well-being contentment gratitude can coexist with the

298
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:27,440
opposite and um and uh and it starts kind of creating a different atmosphere

299
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,559
a different uh influence on ourselves when we kind of begin centering

300
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:38,680
ourselves on the more subtle sense of wellbe again not to push everything else

301
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:47,000
away but to appreciate that uh we will take care of the world ourselves better

302
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:53,599
when we're really centered and calm and peaceful in a way that samade creates

303
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:59,480
samade creates a kind of a capacity and power and ability to meet the world in a

304
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:05,480
full and open way and direct way so that we can care for the

305
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:13,079
world out of from the place that's the best in us we don't want to care from the world

306
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:21,200
from how we um um we don't want to care for the world from how we

307
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:28,520
um you know are aversive or angry or greedy or

308
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:34,280
afraid there's a there is possible to care for the world care for ourselves

309
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:40,040
from Beauty from peacefulness from Love and that's that's the kind of

310
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:46,559
wonderfulness of samade that it um as we grows we have the ability to respond to

311
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:55,040
the world in that way so thank you very much and um I hope

312
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:02,079
