1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:07,560
so I want to read just a few paragraphs as a a way of sliding into

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,160
our meditation so if you've already started you can just continue or feel free to

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,720
close your eyes and the invitation is if what I

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,880
read is interesting to you you could play with it in the meditation it's

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,599
optional it's just a few paragraphs

6
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:39,760
I once met a man who was raised on the Canadian prairies we got to talking about the

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:47,719
open space and how it had shaped his Spirit when the wind stops he said it is

8
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:54,359
so loud that everyone pauses to listen the thought intrigued me how

9
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:03,359
could the end of a sound be loud but when I traveled to those prairies I began to understand for the

10
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,520
people in the great prairies the sound they hear the music that underlies their

11
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,320
lives is the constant and everpresent howl of the wind to them it is no sound

12
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:22,960
at all when it is removed the silence takes a different shape and all are aware of

13
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,320
it all pause to hear we need to pay heed to the many

14
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:36,759
silences in our lives an empty room is alive with a different silence than a room where

15
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:44,360
someone is hiding the Silence of a happy house Echoes less Darkly than the Silence of a

16
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,119
house of brooding anger The Silence of a winter morning is

17
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:56,719
sharper than the Silence of a summer Dawn The Silence of a mountain pass is

18
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,880
larger than the Silence of a Forest Glen these are not

19
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:10,319
fantasies they are subtle discriminations of the senses though all are the absence of

20
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:19,040
sound each Silence has a character of its own we can meditate listening to the

21
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,599
shape of the silence that surrounds us it focuses us on the thin line

22
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:32,680
between what is there and what is not there it opens our heart to the

23
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:41,080
Unseen and reminds us that the world is larger than the events that fill our

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,280
days so we're almost at the winter solstice here in the northern hemisphere

25
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,799
that is and it'll be happening in another five or six days so I always

26
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,760
feel like that's a natural time for uh going inward being

27
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,519
quiet uh it's kind of the feels like a time of pause to

28
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,200
me it's like the pause actually at the end of a of a pendulum swing um that's

29
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,480
how the solstices and the equinoxes work is that you know it gets slower and

30
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:37,200
slower in terms of you how the days are changing and finally it get to the

31
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:44,640
shortest day and then it's going to swing back the Equinox is at the bottom things are changing quickly and then it

32
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,239
swings to the other side so it has that feeling of getting to that pause and

33
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:57,200
change of Direction so before the sit those of you

34
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:05,760
who were here at the beginning I read a little Passage message that included uh listening to the shape of silence as an

35
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:13,720
invitation and I'm not putting anyone on the spot but I'm just curious if anyone tried it and if anyone wants to um

36
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,959
comment on anything that you

37
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:27,479
noticed maybe you all just went immediately into samat oh here's one great there's a microphone I think there

38
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:35,560
yeah thank you so much for bringing

39
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:43,680
it my experience was searching forence oh

40
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,560
and can you yeah you just hold the button down

41
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,520
there you go how about now yeah okay my experience was I went searching for

42
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,918
silence and I had a hard time hearing

43
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:10,800
it I heard a lot of sounds and movements and some coughs

44
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:17,919
and then I I went Inward and I noticed some silence Within Myself

45
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:25,360
uhuh and I just paid close attention to that and listened nice yeah that was my

46
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,639
experience great yeah there's something about when we go looking for for it the

47
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:39,919
noise if you will that's a virtual idea but um the noise of that going toward

48
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,440
can obscure the silence so I'm glad you touched it that's

49
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:54,280
fantastic yeah and one more here yeah hi

50
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:07,360
best well I always notice that the energy of meditating with the group is

51
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,039
very different than meditating at my home it's a different kind of Silence

52
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:20,960
isn't it yeah exactly it just feels different here nice yeah great

53
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,639
good thing to notice yeah and here

54
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,160
I thought I would be meditating on silence but that ending sentence which

55
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,840
was something I'm paraphrasing here about the world being much larger than our individual

56
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:50,520
circumstances hit me really hard and then it just sent my mind off onto contemplation

57
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:57,960
of that okay how big the world was and how my individual

58
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,360
circumstances you know are are so secondary to the the bigger picture

59
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:10,000
that's going on is how it hit me fantastic that's also great that's also great I think that's going to touch into

60
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,199
some of what we discussed today so the piece that I read um

61
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:22,840
mentions that listening to silence is a it calls it a subtle sense

62
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:28,759
experience and I would say you know the senses there's a way in which our senses

63
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:35,599
open up when the mind is soft and takes a receptive posture and then we have

64
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,680
kind of a a refinement of the senses and that's often something that

65
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:48,560
we can experience in meditation it's one of the draws that people have to meditation is that feeling of the

66
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,080
enlivening the opening up of the uh perception in a sense so I want to

67
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,479
reflect a bit today about the way Dharma practice changes our

68
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,759
perceptions and I'm using that word um to mean both what we notice in the first

69
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:13,360
place um and also how we recognize what we're experiencing and

70
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,479
both of those affect then how we relate to experience so that's kind of the territory I'm trying to capture with

71
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:28,080
that with that word perception so all of this has to do um with the senses by

72
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,039
which we receive experience right just our ordinary human senses as well as the

73
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:41,000
Mind William Blake talked about uh cleansing the doors of perception that

74
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:48,279
was his poetic way of saying it and the doors are these different senses seeing hearing smelling tasting touching and

75
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:54,399
then also the Mind door we talk about that as a door in Dharma practice

76
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,399
also cleansing is an interesting word there you know it's kind of cleaning up our senses

77
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,560
they get sharper they get brighter um less

78
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,160
obscured more purified in a sense and this happens naturally through Dharma

79
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:19,640
practice particularly through the practices of mindfulness of awareness cultivating awareness and also somat the

80
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,920
Gathering of the mind or the unifying of the Mind steadying the

81
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:31,040
mind and I know very well that sometimes it does not feel so ref mind um we don't

82
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,040
feel very cleansed but um you know the mind can be busy or reactive or tired or

83
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,640
whatever but we can get some encouragement about that from the sutas there's uh the Buddha is quoted as

84
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:49,560
saying the mind is Luminous but it is obscured by visiting defilements and

85
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:56,399
that word defilements is referring to things like reactivity views strong views that come

86
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:05,880
in patterns of thought and um actions that we fall into so um so

87
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:13,720
these are visitors they're they're mentioned as visiting which is a nice way to think about it so as we practice

88
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:20,240
I think we do experience that sometimes we have these visitors in us and

89
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:27,200
sometimes the mind doesn't have so many you know the weather can be a little clearer inside so the doors of

90
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,440
perception can seem fresh and bright and practice gives us the clarity to

91
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,959
Notice start noticing the difference between those States we notice um the

92
00:10:37,959 --> 00:10:44,600
obscuring patterns that come in sometimes we actually see them rather than just being lost in them and it

93
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:51,880
doesn't mean they end they seem to go on for quite a while but we have a greater and greater ability to see when they're

94
00:10:51,880 --> 00:11:00,000
there and also appreciate when they're not there so that becomes a useful distinction that we make in practice

95
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,959
so as we look maybe carefully at these patterns that come in um we're able to

96
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:14,560
see that there are not only things that you know this obscuration is the word used there're not only things that

97
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,959
darken you know like literally kind of blocking but they also have a can have a

98
00:11:19,959 --> 00:11:27,440
distorting effect so there's like a a way we're looking through a darkened lens in a sense so the shape has changed

99
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,880
in addition to to their not being as much Clarity um so just as a concrete example

100
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:41,519
we might have a distorted idea that uh our neighbor is unfriendly because we've

101
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:50,440
never seen them smiling so we create this Distortion oh they must be an unfriendly dower kind of person um but

102
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,639
of course if we then kind of treat them that way um they're going to be less

103
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,200
motivated to smile at us right so we've kind of um there's an unhealthy feedback

104
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,279
loop that can be created by the distortions we have in our mind where we

105
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,480
distort something uh by not seeing it clearly and then that very Distortion

106
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,920
prevents us from seeing what might correct that Distortion right so it becomes self-reinforcing I think this is

107
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,160
well known in Psychology but it's also described in Buddhist practice so the

108
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:31,240
Distortion is kind of a reaction in and of itself and it creates more reaction activity and all of that is a lot of

109
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:38,079
suffering for us so um so we can have these distorted

110
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:44,560
perceptions but then through practice we can have this clarification this cleansing of the doors of perception if

111
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,800
you will and so then there's a feeling as we do this process we can start to

112
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:56,639
feel oh yeah what practice is doing is kind of aligning or orienting or

113
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:03,760
straightening out you know the distortion is getting corrected through practice I'm curious if that language

114
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,839
resonates for anyone do you have a sense through practice that things may be feel less distorted

115
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:16,199
sometimes yeah I see some nods yeah and then there's less struggle you know when

116
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:21,760
we're seeing more clearly even if what we're seeing clearly isn't that Pleasant

117
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,480
um there's somehow a feeling like we can deal with it when we know we're seeing it

118
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,079
clearly so I didn't just make up this image by the

119
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:39,600
way about Distortion the Buddha talked in the texts about distortions of

120
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,600
perception they're called vipasa in P distortions of perception so ways that

121
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,120
the Mind warps experience into something that does not reflect

122
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,160
reality and they start out as simply you know mistaking what we're seeing but

123
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:02,720
then this feedback loop that I talked about kind of continues through repetition and these distortions can

124
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,160
actually Harden into fixed views that can create pretty big limitations on our

125
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:14,160
life so these are kind of big deal to notice these things but then the Buddha

126
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,560
also talked about what are called Universal qualities sometimes they're called characteristics but let's say

127
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:26,000
Universal qualities of experience that can be seen when the mind is not

128
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,600
obscured um it's interesting that the three Universal qualities though were

129
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,920
originally called the three perceptions so it's the same term as far as I know

130
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,720
that I hear that from a reliable scholarly source so they originally called the three perceptions so the

131
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,160
these are the three aspects of experience that we would naturally recognize or regard when the mind is

132
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:58,519
clear and wise and open but we miss them if we're looking through the distorted lens okay so the three perceptions that

133
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:06,279
are part of Dharma wisdom and then these distortions of perception and interestingly those two lists match up

134
00:15:06,279 --> 00:15:12,519
quite nicely um so I want to um draw that parallel today and then talk a

135
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:17,920
little bit about how we would um move past some of these distortions like how

136
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:24,000
do we how would we undistort our mind so just to name them up front the

137
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,360
first characteristic or wise perception is the experience erence of things being

138
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,600
impermanent or Inc constant that's that's wisdom to see that and then the

139
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,680
first Distortion of perception is that we regard what is impermanent as

140
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,000
permanent Buddha names that as the first vilasa so you see the connection there

141
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,040
the second of the these three Universal qualities is that experience is

142
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:59,319
unsatisfactory it can't be ultimately conditioned experience can't be ultimately satisfying and the second

143
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:04,839
Distortion of perception is that we regard what is unsatisfying as

144
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:12,800
satisfying and then the third characteristic uh is that experience is not self and that one's a you know Hard

145
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,040
One to talk about we won't we w't to completely get through that one today but and then the third Distortion that's

146
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,839
named is that we regard what is not self as self so you see maybe the connection

147
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:31,120
there and it turns out that the correcting of these distortions can come about in a number of different ways one

148
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:38,279
of them is pretty straightforward it's to pay more attention to deliberately pay attention to experience in terms of

149
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:44,360
these three wise perceptions if you will we can actually practice that way even

150
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:49,800
though they will come about naturally through practice so we don't need to try too hard at it but if we're really

151
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,040
feeling distorted we can bring in a conscious um reflection of one of these

152
00:16:55,040 --> 00:17:00,199
three wise ones and then um second way

153
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:06,000
is by deliberately expanding how we see the world and our place in it so a

154
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,720
little bit like that uh listening to the shape of Silence we can deliberately engage broader perspectives so that we

155
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,280
don't get stuck in a distorted a smaller distorted one does that make sense kind

156
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,319
of like deliberately open up the lens a little bit like was named at the end of

157
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:30,480
of the piece where I said that we see that the world is much bigger than our particular little issues that's a

158
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,760
deliberate perspective we can bring in that can be very liberating right so

159
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,720
we're going to talk about um both of these and maybe sometimes they're kind of creative like listening to the shape

160
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,360
of Silence I understand that's kind of you know can we really take that

161
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,640
literally and yet if you just try to engage with that something happens you

162
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:59,000
know several a couple of you named that there is something that happens to engage with an instruction like that

163
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:08,080
that so sometimes we can be creative to get our mind out of these

164
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:15,400
distortions okay so what I'm saying overall is that how we see things is something that we can

165
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:23,600
have some impact on through our spiritual practice I don't think we have complete control over that um we don't

166
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,360
we don't have complete control but we can affect it we can influence it through practice and that's really good

167
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:36,400
that's what really wise actually to do that so we'll have some examples as we go through these so I want to just talk

168
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,919
a little bit about each of these three wise perspectives or wise perceptions if

169
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:50,120
you will and the um corresponding Distortion that goes with them and then we'll go on from there so we start with

170
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:56,880
impermanence oh and all of these by the way each of these three has several different facets and several different

171
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,320
levels that we'll understand them at there can be kind of a an immediate level and then it gets you know that

172
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,600
gets deeper and deeper as we keep practicing so I can say that they can be unfolded for a whole lifetime of

173
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:14,039
practice um so what I'm just going to do is try to aim to hit maybe a couple

174
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:20,120
different aspects of each one but it won't be a like a complete unfolding because they're so

175
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,559
big so the first one I mentioned was the first of the universal qualities is that

176
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:31,120
things are impermanent they change in poly we call it

177
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,480
anicha um or maybe inconstancy is a better word and the Distortion is that

178
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,919
we we see what is actually impermanent as permanent right so this includes

179
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:48,200
change uh in constancy fluctuation the Buddha talked in terms

180
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:54,679
also of arising and passing he says notice things arising notice them passing that's all part of pointing to

181
00:19:54,679 --> 00:20:00,559
this it's probably hard to overemphasize how important seeing changes in

182
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:06,080
Buddhism um but in some ways what's so special about that I don't think anybody

183
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,400
is surprised to hear that things are changing could be like okay come on

184
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:19,120
let's get on to something a little deeper but it's um it's worth noticing there's a a verse

185
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:25,840
in the dapada that says better than 100 years lived without seeing the arising

186
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,120
and passing of things is one day lived seeing their arising and passing so the

187
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:37,840
Buddha is pretty strong in terms of how important it is or how meaningful

188
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:45,559
valuable it is to see this and if we start reflecting on it we realize that despite it being so obvious there are

189
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:53,000
ways in which we don't see it there are ways in which we are entertaining the Distortion that things are permanent

190
00:20:53,000 --> 00:21:00,280
when they're actually impermanent as a lightweight example of one time I uh I marked an item of

191
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,600
clothing that I wanted to distinguish with a permanent pen um and you know I

192
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:12,679
put little Mark on it and then after uh many months of using it and washing it and using it and washing it the Mark was

193
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:18,640
almost gone and I actually had a moment where I said how can that be I used a permanent

194
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:24,159
pen okay come on Kim everything is impermanent we know that so even though

195
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,720
the pen says permanent on it it's not really permanent just so you know so you

196
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,960
know there's that but you know more generally we do get shocked right when

197
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:43,559
things end or break or um go away or change you know um we can be irritated

198
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:49,320
that it suddenly starts raining after it was sunny you know um or sometimes it's a

199
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:54,840
delightful surprise right that something changes we think oh this is going to be here forever and then

200
00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,880
suddenly like it goes away you know we get an email the next day saying oh you know I changed my mind about such and

201
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,200
such you oh wow so things can change in many different directions right but often we

202
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,880
feel that something has gone wrong when our car changes or our house or our relationship changes in some

203
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:21,600
way um the Buddha pointed right at this when he talked about being aware of death right we see other people dying

204
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,960
but we don't think it's really going to happen to us we have a memorial this afternoon

205
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:34,879
right maybe we could use that as a moment to reflect that there will be a time when we're not sitting in this room

206
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:43,400
either so another verse from the dapada death sweeps away the person obsessed

207
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,720
with Gathering flowers as a great flood sweeps away a sleeping

208
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:55,240
Village I used to volunteer at a hospice and that was really interesting I would

209
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:02,000
sit with people who were dying it was a very beautiful practice but I I did occasionally meet someone who was well

210
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,159
into their '90s who was a little bit outraged that they were dying they couldn't quite believe it really it's

211
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,840
almost over um there's something nice about that you know to

212
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:19,039
carry energy Life Energy all the way to the last moment and yet it was

213
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:25,600
interesting that um there was a little sometimes clinging to permanence

214
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:34,080
there so when we see this Distortion that things can last forever there is suffering for us I get

215
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:40,080
it you know it's understandable I think that in a human life we want stability

216
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:47,159
so I'm not you know I'm not like dismissing this is a serious um understanding to to kind of take on this

217
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:54,320
idea of things really being impermanent yeah at the top level of course things change but really everything everything

218
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:01,360
being impermanent that's actually not you know that's pretty deep we want stability we want steadiness we

219
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:07,960
want things to be ongoing we work to set things up so that they will last and

220
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:13,760
that's wise and skillful to do in our life it would be really hard if we

221
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,799
didn't try to do things like that but it's not realistic to expect of ordinary

222
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:26,520
things that they will comply with that forever right so

223
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:33,840
you know when we see with the distortion that things can last forever we suffer because it doesn't align with reality so

224
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:39,200
there's a you know there's some some subtlety there so then that maybe paves the way

225
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,919
for us to look at the second characteristic which has even more subtlety to it and that is that

226
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:51,480
experiences are not reliable or not satisfactory ultimately um they're not more

227
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:56,640
specifically they're not reliably pleasing or harmonious for us are

228
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:03,120
they so this is the the quality of unsatisfactoriness or stress or struggle

229
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:09,159
it's all captured in a word called Dua which is often translated as suffering

230
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:15,600
not the best translation you know when it's put forth as a quality of experience we can

231
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:22,360
understand it immediately thinking about you know this quality of impermanence if everything is changing and not then of

232
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:29,039
course it's going to be unreliable in the long run that's just the that's just another way of saying this same thing

233
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,320
right so the verse I read from the DAP talked about being obsessed with

234
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:42,080
Gathering flowers that's the suffering that can come from just chasing after uh

235
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:49,440
momentary or impermanent Pleasures that we can have we can spend a life um

236
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,960
obsessed with trying to always have it Pleasant every moment

237
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:02,279
and that's a lot of work it's um yeah it's not a good strategy

238
00:26:02,279 --> 00:26:08,360
for happiness in the S we can do okay you know I get in the same way that we can set things up to last for a while we

239
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:14,520
can also do okay having Pleasant this Pleasant that and you know to some degree okay we want to take care of

240
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:21,279
ourselves nourish ourselves but it's also unrealistic to expect that that will always

241
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:27,919
work Andrew olinsky says conventional strategies for human happiness entail

242
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:33,240
very ways of maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain that's the conventional

243
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:39,080
part the problem is that pleasure is not ultimately sustainable and pain is not

244
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,919
avoidable does anyone really disagree with those two yeah the shortcoming of

245
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:51,960
our usual approaches is that they treat the symptoms rather than addressing the underlying causes of the

246
00:26:51,960 --> 00:27:00,880
predicament which is that unsatisfactoriness is part of the fabric of experience so just to be clear life is

247
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,760
unsatisfactory when it's lived in this ordinary mode of trying to spending all

248
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:12,000
our energy maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain so we feel if we do that

249
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,080
you may have noticed we feel a constant sense of lack and a constant sense of being unfulfilled or needing something

250
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,320
or having the stress that this pleasure is going to end or that it ends sooner than we thought it would and then we

251
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,440
have to get another one so there's a a sort of a constant doing that has to

252
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:37,000
happen when we're engaging with that conventional way so um part of the issue

253
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,399
is that we're seeking ongoing happiness uh and I would say that maybe another aspect is that we're seeking

254
00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:51,640
what I what I like to call resolution uh which means the sense of things being wrapped up integrated the

255
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:57,159
musical cord resolved the loose ends are gone the hanging questions are answered

256
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:02,399
it's all tied up neatly and we got it and we're done anybody feel driven by

257
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:08,039
that sense and and then you get to the end of the day and there's still five things left that you didn't get to today but I'm going to get to them tomorrow

258
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:16,159
and then I'm going to feel fulfilled and complete so this sense of resolution is part of this Dua characteristic it's not

259
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:22,600
it's not exactly suffering right it's it's more subtle than that it's not satisfying and it can't be because the

260
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:28,720
world can't do that that's another Distortion that we have is that we think we should be able to get it all together

261
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,760
and keep it that way but that's not in line with reality

262
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:40,240
there's going to be loose ends you're going to be lying on your deathbed and there's going to be loose

263
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,600
ends yeah so the world is constantly disappointing and frustrating if we

264
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,799
don't understand the quality of Dua so that's a little more subtle but

265
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:59,679
then it paves the way for the third characteristic the most subtle perhaps of not self um experience is not defining or

266
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:08,320
referring to an objectively existing self it is anata anata not self and the

267
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,360
Distortion is that we see what is not self as self and and that also causes

268
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:19,120
problems for us so there's so many different aspects of this U you know

269
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:25,519
taking things as me in mind getting identified with them um certainly yeah

270
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:33,240
it's very it's easy to see that in a number of cases like with our body or with our views we take those to Define

271
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:39,880
us um but in the end there's also a a quality maybe that I'll focus on today

272
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:48,360
kind of an issue of control feeling of control um who's in charge here really and can I

273
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,880
you know am I the one who can get it all together and keep it that way who's the

274
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:01,200
eye who's trying to do that um so so the anat luta the quality on the

275
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:09,440
characteristic of not self that's what it means is says it is not possible it's going to

276
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:16,960
say the word form which let's just refer to let's just imagine the body when I say it it is not possible to have it of

277
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:24,200
form let my form be thus let my form not be thus so it says specifically the

278
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:30,440
characteristic of not self is about the fact that we we're not in control are you in control of your body

279
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:36,440
completely no no so um and we can we can

280
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:43,640
I mean really we can see this in a number of very obvious ways could you make yourself three Ines

281
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,720
taller without putting on high heels no could you make yourself 10

282
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,799
years younger wouldn't you like that no no you can't do that yes you would but

283
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:58,880
no we can't do that so it's easy enough to see that we don't have total control

284
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,360
of the body and it's continuing to age and so forth and that doesn't mean just like the other characteristics it

285
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:11,799
doesn't mean there isn't something there that we work on yeah we do of course try to you know have some Integrity in what

286
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:18,159
we do and we try to take care of our body even though it's not really ours and it's going off the deep end anyway

287
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,880
but we do our best and um you know and there's not that there's no influence

288
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:32,120
you know meditation and Dharma training are definitely ways that we influence all of these things but if we if we try

289
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:41,760
to confine that to one thing that we me as an agent can do um it's really not

290
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:49,840
you know it's it's going to be a lot of duka it's a mistaking a distortion of how things actually are so we can see

291
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,880
that um these habits that we call Self or this body that we call Self really is

292
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:01,799
subject to these other characteristics it's impermanent it's not satisfactory and it's not really something that we're

293
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:07,919
in control of this gets pretty deep and it's understandable again I'm not I'm

294
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,279
going to extend the of course you know just like of course we want things to be

295
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,720
stable of course we want things to be happy and satisfying of course we want

296
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:24,880
to know who we are know who other people are and know how we can navigate all of

297
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:31,799
that it would be so nice if there was actually rule book that I could follow where all my relationships would go

298
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:37,880
smoothly um so don't feel bad that you have these

299
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:43,240
distortions I think they're quite reasonable and yet they're not in

300
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:50,720
alignment quite with how the world is and that's the issue for us that's the predicament we find ourselves in so we

301
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:57,039
want stability rather than anicha we want resolution and ease rather than Dua

302
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,880
and we want control and an identifiable self rather than

303
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,679
anata um and yet that is a lot of where our

304
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:14,159
struggle comes from in life isn't it around those three areas so one practice

305
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:20,080
we can do Buddhism tells us that if we shift

306
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,639
toward more often acknowledging these three Universal

307
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:31,399
qualities we will shift our eles into a relationship with experience that is

308
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:36,600
more harmonious that is less struggle it's not going to take away all those

309
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:42,320
things that we're trying to have it will provide more reliable forms of them we

310
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:49,919
will find something that is more reliable inside more stable more happy

311
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:57,159
more I almost say the more control part but um we'll find something inside that

312
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:04,000
uh is more reliable than trying to make external reality or even our internal thoughts and moods match up with these

313
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:12,720
things that it doesn't match up with so we can train ourselves to see more accurately and we will find if we do it

314
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:17,760
if you have enough Faith to give it a try you'll find that it helps I think I

315
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:24,358
I see a bunch of people here who have practiced for a long time with IMC and think we know that over time it's a

316
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:30,839
little Mis maybe mysterious is too vague but it's a little surprising amazing

317
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:36,079
that actually if we engage with the idea that things are totally impermanent that

318
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:42,919
they're not really ultimately satisfying and that there isn't really a self that they refer to things get more useful

319
00:34:42,919 --> 00:34:49,040
over time why because it's more in line with reality so

320
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,398
then I said earlier that we would also talk about a second way to help the Mind

321
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:00,720
become less distorted and that is to encourage loosening up of these visiting

322
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,240
obscure obscurations that we have by playing a little bit in the realm of

323
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,440
perception playing a little bit with our perspectives and we can do that it's not

324
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:19,760
just like any wild fantasy we can imagine is necessarily liberating but if we bring in if we understand these three

325
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,040
characteristics um three Universal qualities we can bring in imaginations

326
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:31,640
or different perspectives that are somewhat liberating so I um there are actually very simple

327
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:39,320
possibilities for this maybe I'll name those first so let's say that you're going to a um holiday party or a family

328
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:45,599
gathering sometime in the next few weeks and you find yourself often subject to

329
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:52,440
limiting let's say limiting experiences when you're in these situations um it

330
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:58,040
can be that uh we could just bring in an alternate perspective that might might

331
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:04,359
be somewhat freeing for example we could instead of saying oh here are these people and they this and that and I get

332
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:11,160
caught in these patterns how about the idea that everyone is doing the best that they can

333
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:17,440
you know what if you just like brought that into the Mind before you went in and maybe reminded yourself periodically

334
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:25,079
as you went through the experience that's a helpful perspective it's a freeing perspective how about the

335
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:31,880
perspective how can I help how could I help here instead of oh you know I have

336
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:37,599
to endure this how could I help here here's one that I

337
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:43,920
use what would I have to let go of to make this easier do you find yourself caught in

338
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:52,960
something that's unpleasant or difficult what would I have to let go of to make this easier it brings it into right

339
00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:02,319
here so then I'm also going to offer something um kind of a meditative engagement with

340
00:37:02,319 --> 00:37:08,400
a couple of perspectives a little bit like that uh listening to The Sound of Silence at the beginning I want to

341
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,040
invite you into some very large very different perspectives around the realm

342
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:19,920
of time um so we're not really thinking about them maybe just as I kind of go

343
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:26,520
through this you might rest in the feeling of what it's like to change our perspective of the flow of

344
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:34,160
time one thing that burdens us about time is that we often live in what I call personal personal time and

345
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:40,000
historical time those are two different very common very conventional

346
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:47,160
perspectives one is the flow of our everyday I have to do this and that between now and when I go to bed tonight

347
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:54,240
or it's on my calendar for tomorrow personal time then there's historical time the flows of months and

348
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:00,839
years and decades how things have gone during my lifetime um basically where our society is and

349
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:06,480
where it's going these are very burdensome uh dimensions of time because

350
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,560
they're I don't need to say why we all know um but then we can take a much

351
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,760
longer perspective sometimes that's really helpful or a much shorter perspective so

352
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,440
we'll do both so in the realm of the long I want to invite you

353
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,760
to a perspective called The Cosmic calendar it might be that the universe is

354
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,160
beginningless like the Buddhist texts say I don't know but at least there is a limit to how far back we can see so

355
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,920
let's say we go back that far so let's imagine taking all of known time and

356
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,040
compressing it into one year okay so the beginning of the universe was at

357
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,240
midnight on January 1st and it goes all the way up and this present moment that

358
00:38:52,240 --> 00:39:00,119
we're all sharing right now is midnight on December 31st what what does that year look

359
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:08,400
like so I'll give you some little highlights of the year the Earth formed in the first week

360
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,480
of September life began later in

361
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:20,520
September but there wasn't multicellular life until December

362
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:26,040
5th the first dinosaurs appeared on December

363
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:34,880
25th and that big meteor Extinction that killed them happened early on December

364
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:42,640
30th humans appeared in Africa on December

365
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:52,440
31st at about 10:30 p.m. the Buddha lived 6 seconds before

366
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:59,480
midnight and the last 400 years of human history occupi less than the last second

367
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,839
of the year don't think about that just feel

368
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:11,920
into the vastness of cosmic time now what was that that you were worried

369
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:18,720
about yeah so just let the Mind open to this sweep of the evolving universe

370
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,839
that's so much bigger than our life and it's breathtaking and it's not at all

371
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:32,359
meant to say that our life doesn't matter but it's meant to take maybe some of the gripping the stickiness out of it

372
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:38,880
right and then the other way is really interesting also so instead of you know

373
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:45,880
instead of the the vast we can we can plumet in to this very moment and we can

374
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:52,960
um bring ourselves to the richness of everything that's happening right now

375
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:59,359
and I can't even name there's how many sense impr Impressions actually come in

376
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:04,680
to the sense doors every moment there's so many of them that the the brain has

377
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:10,200
to filter them by a huge Factor like millions or billions in order that we

378
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:16,680
can have the experience we're having now so much has to be cut out it's kind of there like if you just look around

379
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:22,359
you'll realize that you are vaguely aware of the shape of this room um shape

380
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:28,880
of whatever room you're in for those online um it's coming in and if it were

381
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,359
to change you would notice but it's not uh actively coming into your experience

382
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:41,920
in this moment um there are layered and Vivid impressions of Light Of Sound

383
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:47,800
motion washing over our senses all the time usually people can only get to

384
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:54,680
opening up to that on a retreat experience where a lot of things have been removed so that we have a more

385
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:02,280
opening of the doors of perception right but nonetheless if we can open to

386
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:09,240
that and have an ongoing flow of the immediacy of all of these sense

387
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:15,960
Impressions again there's no room for a self to form there so these perspectives

388
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:22,200
I've offered are um validations or ways of touching in with this third

389
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:28,319
characteristic of not self and we can see in all of these anich

390
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:35,720
Dua you not ultimate resolution right and anata not self no room for a self

391
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:42,160
there so all of these different ways I've talked about of experiencing just of

392
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:48,160
time you know the the cosmic the historical the personal the immediate

393
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,400
they're all just different perspectives actually one is not better than the other one is not the

394
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:01,400
ultimate but it's really nice if the mind can flexible about being able to touch into

395
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:09,239
each of those as needed [Music]

396
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:17,240
so play around a bit and see if that doesn't loosen up some of these distorted

397
00:43:17,240 --> 00:43:23,920
perceptions we can have um there's a some verses called

398
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:29,160
mindfulness by aan cha one of the Great teachers of the Thai Forest tradition of

399
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:36,720
last century he said try to be mindful and let things take their natural course

400
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:42,520
then your mind will become still in any surroundings like a clear Forest

401
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:48,440
pool all kinds of wonderful rare animals will come to drink at the pool and you

402
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:53,839
will clearly see the nature of all things you will see many strange and

403
00:43:53,839 --> 00:44:02,040
wonderful things come and go but you will be still this is the happiness of the

404
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,440
Buddha so this ability to shift perspectives when needed and

405
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,640
to reduce the Distortion that we have in our

406
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:20,960
ordinary conventional way of seeing things is part of what we do through

407
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:29,520
practice we don't have to do it it'll be done it's part of what is done through practice use a passive voice there so

408
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,680
indeed our doors of perception can become more cleansed can become more in

409
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:41,280
line with you what's actually happening I need a certain distortion on these

410
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:47,559
because my eyes are a little distorted but I sometimes take them off figuratively to have a sense of you know

411
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:55,960
not looking without the without the lenses so here we are at the time of the

412
00:44:55,960 --> 00:45:01,000
solstice a time part of

413
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:07,280
that larger sense of time of the earth tilting on its axis moving around the

414
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:13,359
Sun that causes these changes

415
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:20,280
so maybe taking a pause to go Inward and

416
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:26,160
sense where the mind is listen to The Silence

417
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:32,680
consider how you're relating to your life could there be a

418
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:37,720
shift that includes some of the wisdom we've talked

419
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:43,160
about because I know it's there in all of us it's just a little change in how

420
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:48,880
we see

421
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:55,000
so I wonder if there are any questions or comments we're right

422
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:01,200
near the end but um yeah let's could somebody bring him the

423
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,760
microphone yeah thank you and if anyone needs to go I know we're right at time

424
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:13,680
but I'll I'll be able to stay a little bit longer

425
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:20,960
yeah yeah if it's if the light is on it's on thank you yeah so yeah the

426
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:27,520
question is you were just reading uh aan cha and he was saying um

427
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,839
at the end he said something like and there you will be or you so it brings up

428
00:46:32,839 --> 00:46:38,480
wait a minute we were just talking about no self so could you uh help reconcile

429
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:44,240
some of that seeming Paradox uhhuh yeah so he does he says you will see many

430
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:49,280
strange and wonderful things come and go but you will be still so who does that

431
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:56,119
refer to so again I think um this is a flexibility of perspective so uh the

432
00:46:56,119 --> 00:47:05,960
question is uh can we use the word you or I or me and yet know that it doesn't refer to

433
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:11,920
exactly one definable entity the Buddha used the word I all

434
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:17,400
the time because he was talking with people and I think that's the same for

435
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:22,440
Rajan sha and so we can a little bit like what does it mean to listen to the

436
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:27,960
shape of Silence first of all how do we listen to silence and what does it mean to have a shape you know that doesn't

437
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:33,720
that's not quite literal and yet if we offer our mind that idea H listen to the

438
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:40,400
shape of Silence maybe maybe nothing comes but at least for me sometimes something there's a response to that

439
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:48,599
somehow and so in the same way I think it's okay to say you and yet know that

440
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:56,400
you could be a lot of different things okay great

441
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,839
all right thanks everyone
