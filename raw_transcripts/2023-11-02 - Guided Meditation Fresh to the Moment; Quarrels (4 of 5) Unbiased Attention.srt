1
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:11,960
welcome one of the tasks of mindfulness meditation is to keep our attention

2
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,359
fresh meaning to always be ready

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,519
to discover each moment for itself almost

4
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:32,680
like each moment arrives and it's a new event completely fresh and not to carry along with us our

5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,079
preconceived ideas our biases or are conclusions we've

6
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,160
made about what's happening and of course it's easy enough

7
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:51,719
and maybe appropriate to make conclusions about their recognitions of what's happening but then it might keep us from

8
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,680
being fresh for the next moment and so one way of staying fresh

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:06,119
like every every moment is a new moment even even if it's repeating what just happened is

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,799
um is to kind of have the attitude

11
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,920
is either what else what else is happening here what's

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:25,320
next or the attitude Maybe not maybe it's not like

13
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:30,680
this maybe so maybe not we shall see

14
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,880
especially this idea of maybe not and then maybe you come to the same

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:43,000
conclusion the same recognition that's fine but to stay fresh always new what's

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,079
this ready to be almost like you're ready to be surprised or ready to

17
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,600
discover and in the process of doing doing this it isn't so much about what

18
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:02,840
you discover what you're aware of what you know as it is is it the openness the

19
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,560
freshness the relaxed attention that doesn't settle on some

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,360
idea or conclusion the sense of being the attention is always

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,879
fresh like walking through some beautiful natural setting

22
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:30,319
You' never been to before and just like the the eyes the mind is just ready new

23
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:39,120
seeing something new and wow so on this sitting to sit quietly

24
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,920
with maybe it isn't so the conclusions I've

25
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,560
made maybe not let's see let's see what's

26
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,519
next so to assume a meditation

27
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:05,159
posture and lower your gaze or close your

28
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:21,120
eyes and even if youve meditated a thousand times 10,000 times

29
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,680
before each moment is fresh each meditation is

30
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,280
new no two meditations are the

31
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:48,360
same and what is it that's here that's new what is it to be fresh and alert

32
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,680
present as if it's the first

33
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:01,680
[Music] time

34
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,400
and then taking a few long slow relaxed

35
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:43,280
breaths and in a relaxed way relax as you

36
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
exhale

37
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:23,360
letting your breathing return to normal and continue in a relaxed

38
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:31,160
way to relax on the exhale roaming around your body to see

39
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,840
where can you

40
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
soften

41
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:19,240
and then settling down to accompany your

42
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,880
breathing each breath is a new

43
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:34,120
appearance in inhale just this inhale with no past or

44
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:39,639
future just the exhale with no past and

45
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,479
future just this to be aware

46
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:52,919
of with no conclusions not bringing with you past

47
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:58,160
bias or judgments or concerns about

48
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,919
anything just

49
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,478
this fresh alert ever

50
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:16,800
ready for this moment to be

51
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,440
itself what appears as this

52
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
moment

53
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,840
the now is

54
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,479
inseparable from what arises in the

55
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:53,159
now the shifting changing experiences of

56
00:07:53,159 --> 00:08:02,159
now with no conclusions not car caring with you

57
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:14,080
judgments fresh for every moment breathing in and breathing

58
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
out

59
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200

breathing in the present moment experience of breathing with a fresh

attention this is our lived

93
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:59,679
as we come to the end of the sitting to consider

94
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:07,440
one of the gifts we can give to others is to meet them without precons

95
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,919
considerer ideas preconceptions

96
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:23,840
judgments bias to have a fresh mind to meet

97
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:33,480
others and to do that gift to our eles to be mindful in such a way that

98
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:40,600
we're aware of ourselves without preconceptions without

99
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,398
judgments without thoughts that limit

100
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:59,600
us and to be able to do it for ourselves

101
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:05,398
strengthens our ability to do it for others and vice

102
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:12,480
versa and as we come to the end of this sitting may it

103
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,000
be that we can give people the

104
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:26,120
gift of being known and seen and appreciated free of our bias our

105
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:36,200
judgments prec conceived ideas to meet even people we know with a

106
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,720
friendly not knowing wanting to know who is

107
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:53,240
this knowing others with delight and appreciation with no preconceived

108
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:03,760
ideas so they can relax so they can just be who they

109
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:20,559
are and with whatever fresh eyes we have to see people may we wish them

110
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:29,679
well may all beings be happy may all beings be

111
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:40,320
safe may all beings be peaceful may all beings everywhere be

112
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:53,789
[Music]

113
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
free

114
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:08,070
thank [Music]

115
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
you

116
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
e

117
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:29,240
so continuing this theme of quarrels and disputes

118
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:39,919
a topic that Buddha had a lot to say on and he came across situation where or

119
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:46,480
report that there was a group of religious teachers

120
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:53,519
philosophers who are arguing philosophically or metaphysically about the nature of the universe nature of

121
00:30:53,519 --> 00:31:01,960
life things like the universe is forever the universe is finite

122
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:11,159
infinite that um human beings live forever in multiple rebirths there is no

123
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:16,360
rebirth the nature of what happens after death so all kinds of things that are

124
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:21,720
not really about the here and now but about these big existential questions that

125
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:27,960
people Ponder and these people who are

126
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:35,440
having opinions about this were arguing quarreling about who was right and then the Buddha described them

127
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:43,200
with an analogy analogy which in some ways is uh

128
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:51,200
pretty apt for how people can be but also it uses maybe an analogy that is

129
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:58,440
not really uh maybe it it itself offers a kind of bias or a kind of stereotyping

130
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:07,720
that we don't want to live in so it's an example of what not to do and um so what he said was

131
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:15,000
uh uh or what he talked about or what he suggested to a King who was questioning

132
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,840
about this was to have a group of blind people

133
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:30,039
come and to with their hands to touch different parts of an elephant and then report what they were

134
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:36,840
touching and those who touched the the

135
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:43,919
um the legs said it what they were a solid column those who studied the Torso

136
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,679
said it was a big round Barrel those who touched the ears said it was a winnowing

137
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:58,799
basket those who touched the tail said it was a rope and um and so it went and so each

138
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:07,320
of them then thought they knew what the elephant was but they only had a partial

139
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:12,840
View and uh and so in the same way these these people were arguing because they

140
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:19,159
only had a partial view of reality of life and we're arguing based on that partial

141
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:27,000
view so it does speak to how human beings are partial uh in their attention their

142
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,000
awareness we come with preconceived ideas we have come with Selective Vision

143
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,840
that we see things selectively according to what we want and in this analogy the Buddha in a

144
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:44,799
sense does that too unfortunate unfortunate way with blind people assuming that that because they're blind

145
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:51,440
they can only have a partial understanding of what is going on and that's certainly not

146
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,679
true but uh but still the Buddha put a great emphasis on the ctivity process

147
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,880
the bias the um preconceived ideas the

148
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:10,480
judgments we make through which we see the world around us and that based on

149
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,800
this limited views that we have when we're seeing through ideas like this

150
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:24,560
that uh to argue based on that is to uh is uh very unfortunate and that is part

151
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:32,040
of the the root of many argu is um is the the select selective way the biased

152
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:37,679
way in which we understand and see the world and he talked about uh many many

153
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,560
examples of this uh he talked about um two in

154
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:50,679
particular that for some people uh it is essensual desires that make their

155
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:57,440
attention partial makes it biased or selective and um and then that orients

156
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,720
them in terms of what they want what they don't want what they'll argue about about the conflicts they get into and

157
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:10,960
other people uh the other big category is people uh selectively choose based on

158
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,760
their views their opinions the stories they're living by insisting that they're right this is how things

159
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:26,440
are and um and then arguing because of that and um some of the bases for these

160
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:35,440
select Ive or biased viewpoints is um objectifying the world being being being

161
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,640
the one who sees and creating this kind of objective objective relationship

162
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:47,880
that's all seeing through the lens of Me Myself and mine so what kind of

163
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:54,760
selfishness or self-centeredness now how does this relate to me so a sensual desire what is

164
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,800
in it for me what can I get out of this uh what kind of discomfort sensual

165
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:06,319
discomfort can I avoid and for opinions and stories and

166
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:12,240
Views is how what supports my view what threatens my view that I have to attack

167
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:21,440
and criticize and show how wrong it is and um the um we have preconceived

168
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:28,560
ideas that we bring with us into these things we have something like we see a friend or see a person who some time ago

169
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:35,440
was one way and we treat them that way and forever more or maybe that's happened to you that you've feel like

170
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:42,839
someone keeps seeing you in the way that in very selective they recognize you about someone something you did long ago

171
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:48,599
that doesn't really represent you anymore and um or the conclusions the

172
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:55,200
judgments we make and one of the big ones is uh comparative thinking we compare ourselves to others We compare

173
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:02,920
our views our opinions who who has the best wanting to have the best view the most thorough true idea and um we want

174
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:09,800
to have the best pleasure we want to to have the best experience and uh and this is what the

175
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:18,560
best is this is what's not so best this is the and I always want to have the best so the um uh the drive for sensual

176
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,640
pleasure in Buddhism is actually broader than what we might think of in English

177
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:30,119
uh when we say that you know the drive for sensual pleasure um it's the drive for Comfort it's a

178
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:36,200
drive for pleasantness it's a drive to avoid discomfort to drive to avoid the

179
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,240
unpleasant and we can get into conflict with others if they stand in a way or if

180
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:46,319
they cause if they're unpleasant or do unpleasant things for us and we think

181
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:54,599
that that's not what we should be what should what we should experience we push them away we don't like them we uh maybe

182
00:37:54,599 --> 00:38:02,480
get into conflict with them and it's all about you know what we think is pleasant and unpleasant um we're envious and jealous

183
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:10,599
because they have the pleasure that we want they have the wonderful experience and uh and then we have um

184
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:15,880
the views and opinions the stories that we live in and part of the reason why

185
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:23,319
they can be so sticky is sometimes we Define ourselves by those and we want to reinforce who we are we reinforce the

186
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:29,680
idea of who we are by propping up those stor insisting those views and things are

187
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,760
true so in all these ways we are seeing partially we're not seeing the full

188
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:43,040
picture of things we're oriented we're selective and in that selectivity not seeing the whole things we run into

189
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:49,960
things that challenge that selective narrow View and then we're in easily get in conflict with it and can be in

190
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:56,359
quarrels and disputes wanting wanting my pleasure you need to provide it or um

191
00:38:56,359 --> 00:39:03,480
this you know my way or the highway because I want to have this that's you know the wonderful Pleasant enjoyable

192
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:09,200
thing and um and uh and that sometimes the there

193
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:16,119
are kind of real intense fights over people's strong drive for addiction to

194
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:23,040
what's called Buddhism would called sensual pleasures and the same thing with VI and opinions people get furious and

195
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:29,599
judgmental and self-righteous and in doing so both these ways we stop seeing the full

196
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:35,079
picture we stop opening up to the full experience of what's Happening here now

197
00:39:35,079 --> 00:39:41,160
the full Humanity of ourselves the full Humanity of others and part of the goal

198
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:47,760
of this practice of ours is to be able to drop the bias drop the selective ways

199
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,040
in which we see self and others stop the judgments we have the comparative

200
00:39:53,040 --> 00:40:00,240
thinkings we have the ideas that I'm not good enough I'm a problem or I'm great I'm wonderful and we have to prove it to

201
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,960
everyone to relax all those things to quiet the mind that's involved in all

202
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:13,079
that chatter it's not just chatter it's also a deep kind of subliminal kind of

203
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:18,920
attitudes we carry to be able to relax it so that we

204
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:24,280
can go through the world without being in Conflict without being quarreling and

205
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:30,319
disputing and bumping into people and and and um self-righteously arguing and

206
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:35,800
complaining and and criticizing um but

207
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:43,280
instead to try to kind of keep opening up to the full picture of here what's really happening here what's the

208
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:50,960
fullness of yourself what if you see yourself as whole so whole

209
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:57,319
that it can't be taken away by other people's opinions views desires

210
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:04,079
what if you see other people as whole and worthy and autonomous respect worthy

211
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,040
people so they come they show up we're more fresh and interested curious who is

212
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:16,359
this person what is this we don't have to agree we don't have to go along with

213
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:24,440
what they want but that doesn't have to be done with as an argument it doesn't have to go as a dispute it can kind of

214
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:32,000
Grant people okay that's interesting tell me more most people if you ask more deeply

215
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,079
what's going on for you why you know how do you come to this and what's the background for this view this desire you

216
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:44,480
have what are you trying to fill or what are you trying to do here as you start

217
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:51,680
uh getting to know people better we'll find there's depth there's background there's context of who people are that

218
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,839
um changes the whole nature of how we relate to people that's not possible if

219
00:41:56,839 --> 00:42:04,319
we Clash around desires Clash around views and so this meditation practice we

220
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:13,079
do a practice which helps us to relax the judging mind relax the mind

221
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:18,359
that makes comparative thinking the mind that wants to be right and wants to hold

222
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:25,079
on to views and stories and chatter the mind that wants to is driven by desire

223
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:31,839
and it's wants and its aversions and it's a phenomenal to drop down relax

224
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:39,079
settle and to be able to be present for the world without those in a responsible

225
00:42:39,079 --> 00:42:46,200
engaged uh wise way that's respects everyone involved that has space for

226
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:51,960
everyone and maybe in doing so supporting everyone involved in a

227
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:57,640
conflict in a dispute to begin opening up and seeing each other more wholly

228
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:04,440
more fully and finding a different way a way that doesn't involve quarrel maybe a

229
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:10,200
way that supports the welfare and happiness of everyone

230
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:15,920
involved so thank you for this and um we

231
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,359
