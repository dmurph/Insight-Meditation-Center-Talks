1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,879
so welcome and good evening so I wanted to continue on a

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,240
theme that I I started last week so last week I start to talk about this idea I

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,480
introduced these um five qualities of

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,640
endeavoring of five things that the qualities to bring together if you want to do

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:30,599
something something that that bu talked about is a support for any thing we want

6
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:37,040
to do of course he's teaching about spiritual practice but it's something that we could do for

7
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,680
whatever I'll just list these five I already gave a whole talk on them but I just want to kind of like add a little

8
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,840
bit on this so these five factors of endeavoring we can

9
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,199
say first one is confidence second one is Vitality third one is integrity

10
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:01,920
fourth one is energy and the fifth one is wisdom

11
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:07,400
so this is that's talking about like how to like to gather up certain qualities

12
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:14,159
so that we can do something or go in a particular direction accomplish

13
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,600
something but now I'd like to maybe add on that but also introduce something

14
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:26,840
else and that is where are we going what are we doing like which direction or

15
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,159
what are we oriented towards when I talked about it last week was

16
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,640
just you know whatever you want to do and this is true you can apply those five qualities to whatever you want to

17
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:44,040
do but maybe it's worthwhile considering what is it we want to

18
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:51,840
do what direction do we want our life to take what direction do we want our

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,079
anything about us to take so there's this way that it can be

20
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,399
enormously helpful to just even ask ourselves cuz sometimes we don't ask ourselves and it can be so

21
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,520
powerful what is our deepest

22
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:17,400
aspiration in my mind an aspiration is a little bit different than a goal goal is maybe more immediate and and uh

23
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,959
tangible want to be able to lift x amount of pounds walk certain amount of distance knit to certain way or you know

24
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,360
something like this whereas an aspiration is in my mind at least is a

25
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:38,080
little bit more um Grand it's a little bit more

26
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:44,159
heartfelt what is it what is our deepest aspiration maybe as I'm talking now you

27
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:53,040
can just ask yourself what are you most inspired

28
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,760
by what what makes your heart sing

29
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:08,319
the place this direction you'd like to go because there's a way in which when

30
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:15,959
we're aligning with an aspiration that we have the way that we are being consistent with an aspiration that we

31
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:24,400
have there's a sense of openness or sense of ease like yeah this may not be comfortable

32
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:31,680
exactly at this moment but I know that what I'm doing is going in the direction I want to go

33
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:38,599
just uh recently I I sat a retreat and um after the retreat a number of us were

34
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:44,879
talking and um I just found myself saying there's

35
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,120
about there's something so powerful about being on Retreat even if it's a horrible Retreat and that you're in

36
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:57,400
physical pain emotional distress right and these things happen on Retreat too right it's not all Bliss and fun

37
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:03,799
sometimes it is but sometimes it isn't but I said there's just something about you know being aligned with what's the

38
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:09,480
most important to you to me that just feels good even if the

39
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:16,079
retreat is hard and I hadn't really kind of like put that together in such a clear way

40
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:23,400
that this is there's something beautiful that happens just being on Retreat so this is for me one of my aspirations is

41
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,600
to you know be cultivating my meditation practice

42
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,840
and yeah I'll just say that doesn't mean that you all have to have the same aspiration

43
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,479
either but I just pointing to that there's this sense of openness or ease

44
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:46,720
or maybe even a little bit of relaxation when you have this sense of

45
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:56,199
what I'm doing is aligned with my deepest values what I really want from my life from this

46
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:06,280
life and with this alignment and this ease there's there this way and there can be some power to that power meaning

47
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:15,440
uh this like a a movement of force or something like this many years ago I had this uh quote

48
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,720
uh in my kitchen so next to the where I would do doing the dishes that so that I

49
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,600
would see it regularly and it I put it there when I was in the midst of having to do

50
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,199
something that was really hard and I didn't want to do it something that was like really hard

51
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:40,680
and it's and was something that took me many months to do and I didn't just didn't want to do it and um I could and

52
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:47,840
here's like a different translation I couldn't find the exact translation of the one that I had uh up there on my

53
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:56,280
next to my kitchen you would think I would have it memorized having seen it however many times but it's by um

54
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:03,639
G he's a German poet I guess we could say and writer and

55
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:10,240
he says um in this quote he says the moment one commits oneself Providence

56
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,440
moves too I don't really know what providence

57
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,800
is but just this idea that okay I'm going to go this direction I'm going to

58
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:27,440
do this there's a way in which not always and it's not always obvious but

59
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,720
there's a way that things can help us along if it's really aligned with our

60
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,240
deepest desires or aspiration and then this quote

61
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,440
continues go writes whatever you dream you can do begin

62
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,800
it this boldness has power magic and Grace in

63
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,440
it begin it

64
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,599
now one way that I think about this idea that um this Providence moves too is

65
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:07,039
that sometimes we feel like oh my gosh I see all these things that have to happen

66
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:14,280
in order to have what really is my aspiration what really inspires me my really goal and I don't think I can do

67
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:21,479
that but here's what we're not considering this beautiful thing called

68
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:29,400
like impermanence the version of ourselves that's going to get to that step is going to be the one that just

69
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:36,440
completed the step before which is going to be the one that just completed the step before so we are changing as we're

70
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,680
moving along this path towards something we want to do so maybe when we're way back here like oh my gosh I don't think

71
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:48,280
I can do that but when we're right here it's the next thing like oh okay I can do

72
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,360
that this this way that we want to project the current version of ourselves

73
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,120
into the future and say well this current version it's going to be hard to do that but the current version isn't

74
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,560
going to be the one that's going to do it it's going to be the one who finished

75
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:12,080
or completed or found a way through other things and I remind myself of this

76
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,639
whenever I have something big that I have to do like okay well future Diana can take care of that I'm just going to

77
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,198
do this one little step here that the next thing that needs to be

78
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,839
done and so maybe I'll just say the obvious that often just because we're

79
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:37,360
busy and we are surrounded by a I mean

80
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,839
we kind of built this society that likes to distract us from anything that's uncomfortable right we carry these

81
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:50,959
gizmos in our pockets that's designed to distract us and just because of that

82
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:58,320
it's often that we don't touch into what is our aspiration we're just busy taking care

83
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,560
of you know the next thing maybe the next thing that feels urgent and important but really maybe isn't aligned

84
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,800
with what's the deepest wish or the deepest desires that we

85
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:16,839
have and so it's worthwhile to really spend some time and think about it and

86
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:22,560
I'll talk about this in a little bit more in the in a moment here

87
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:29,560
but because there's a way in which we can I don't know we can feel like I know

88
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:35,240
I get lost in this too just taking care of like the to-do list and that just feels like life is just one big long

89
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:43,079
to-do list we don't want that kind of a life we can have a bigger life a better life

90
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:50,959
but it does require us to pay attention pay attention to what's going on inside of us and what's how we're spending our

91
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,880
life energy so some aspirations might be

92
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,000
something like there's this deep in wish in our hearts for

93
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:09,399
happiness for well-being and ease and maybe that wish for happiness

94
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:16,560
and well-being is it's not only for ourselves but for others and maybe there's this wish

95
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,800
really wish for the be able to make the world or the our community or family

96
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,600
members or others that we're in contact with to just have a little bit more ease

97
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,839
a little bit more happiness little bit more peace

98
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:38,720
wellbeing just imagine what the world would be like if everybody had just a

99
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:47,760
little bit more peace ease and well-being I know I feel inspired by

100
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,839
this so maybe that's one thing that inspires us but maybe it's something more about service more indirectly about

101
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:03,040
service there's such a beautiful thing to just be supporting others and to help them find what's

102
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:10,680
important to them or maybe they do know and to help them Reach it and to have you know to show up with

103
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:16,560
compassion when people have difficulties or or to support others rather than

104
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,120
having it to be about oh it's all about me but instead to feel like let me let me help out and there's a way which

105
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:29,560
helping and supporting others I don't know feeds us nourishes us too

106
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:36,839
i s of had that experience when I was um and I I didn't do this for a long time but I was a chaplain up at uh San

107
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:43,079
Francisco General and there was something that uh it'd be quite something to just meet

108
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:49,000
these patients some of them really really sick some of them you know to be in the

109
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,480
hospital was a step up in their living conditions and um just to be able to

110
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,959
meet them where they were just kind of it was a beautiful thing to be able to do

111
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,320
but it's not so easy you don't need me to tell you this we have these

112
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:16,399
aspirations these things we want to do yes I'm going to do this but to consistently Orient our life our

113
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,440
activities the way we spend our resources our energy towards that

114
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,160
towards our aspirations it's not easy if it were easy you would already

115
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,880
be doing it so I appreciate very much that the

116
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:42,720
Buddha he talked some more about this idea like what are some supports for this some ways to help us go towards our

117
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,199
aspirations and there's this he talked about this uh

118
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:54,639
quality of steadfastness or I might say

119
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,959
persistence or this stick intuitiveness or or maybe this tenacity

120
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:08,120
or determination or resolve or resolution something like

121
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:16,720
this is a quality that's needed because it's not always easy it's not always

122
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,279
easy of course we like things to happen quickly things don't necessarily happen

123
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:27,440
quickly we like to take the path of least resistance but maybe following our

124
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,639
aspirations is not anop paath of least resistance so it doesn't mean that we're

125
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:39,199
failing that it because it's hard doesn't mean that we're bad humans or we're failing or anything like that it's

126
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,760
hard because I don't it's just

127
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:51,959
because it's just the way that it is we could talk about it and philosophize about it but you know it's just not easy

128
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:58,399
all the time sometimes it is I talked about being like aligned there's this openness when you're aligned sometimes

129
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:05,120
it's beautiful and sometimes it's difficult that's how it is and you don't

130
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,399
need me to tell you this either everybody knows this if anytime you've ever wanted to uh achieve anything or

131
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:18,720
gain anything there's been difficulties so this word this uh

132
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:26,560
persistence or perseverance or tenacity determination po word is

133
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:32,079
aitana and one person described it and I kind of like this as this gentle but

134
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:40,000
persistent wind that's like blowing on at your back this just kind of like helping you go a particular

135
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,759
direction this idea of like okay I'm going to go this

136
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:55,839
direction and for some people I'll just say that actually this kind of like persistence or perseverance is not uh a

137
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,920
difficulty for them for them that's the way that they are they have a goal and they're just kind

138
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:09,199
of like have a certain doggedness and they just make it happen and if you're one of those people then maybe where the

139
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:17,120
difficulty is it's different than some other people the stick intuitiveness maybe the difficulty is not to like push

140
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,680
this practice or push whatever it is you're doing to drudgery I have to do this and just

141
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,839
doing it and then your life gets filled like drudgery nobody wants that or if

142
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:36,920
you're one of those people that stick to itness is easy and that's the way that you move through the world maybe there's

143
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:44,440
the edge for you is to be able to do that and not alienate others or dismiss

144
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:50,160
others or there can be a way it's like get out of my way I have to do this I don't care what you're doing right now I

145
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,399
have to do this so right everybody whether this

146
00:15:55,399 --> 00:16:02,079
idea of persistence or perseverance determination comes easily or not there's a way in which we can practice

147
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:09,560
with it that it can help us with our aspirations and uh Asen goenka some of

148
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:16,519
you may know is a teacher in the Insight tradition and he says and maybe have all

149
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:22,160
heard this I know I've heard this before too it's something kind of just uh it's not unique to

150
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,319
him but this idea that well we could say for um in particular

151
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:36,639
May maybe with a spiritual practice but any other thing that you want to do you can dig 10 Wells one foot

152
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:43,160
deep but you're not likely to find water but maybe there's one well that's

153
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:49,680
10 ft deep that you can find water so this recognition of just staying there

154
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:56,480
staying there and it's this that's kind of like this power of aitana it's like okay I'm

155
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:03,880
just going to stay here and and I made this resolve this is really

156
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:09,480
what's important to me and I'm going to hang in there even though right now it's

157
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:17,520
uncomfortable even though right now I don't want to do it but to find a way to do it but not a

158
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:24,520
way that is um where we're tied up into knots not without a way than which we're

159
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:31,240
like uh beating ourselves up like you're going to be a bad person if you don't do it or you are a bad person because you

160
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:38,240
don't want to do it or something like this but instead this like peaceful

161
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,559
perseverance like okay yes this is what's needs to be done this is what I'm

162
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:51,080
going to do and we kind of like bow like yes I recognize you don't want to do it we're

163
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:56,400
going to do it anyway and I'm saying this for myself

164
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:02,600
too because some you know sometimes I find myself oh I have to do things I found myself you know putting

165
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:07,720
them off or something like this but recently I had to do something that was rather

166
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:15,559
uncomfortable and it's so silly but it turned out it worked just like I just said out loud okay I can do hard things

167
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:21,720
and I'm going to do this and there was just this little tiny pep talk it wasn't a way like Diana you're going to be such

168
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:29,280
a loser if you don't do it right that doesn't work I've tried that it doesn't work instead like okay I can do hard

169
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,679
things I'm going to do this and it was hard and I did it so it's a way in which

170
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:41,960
we can stop uh maybe always insisting that we're comfortable all the time I

171
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,320
like to be comfortable I think all of us do but there's this way in which um kind

172
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,559
of like Society really promotes like comfort for the exclusion of everything

173
00:18:52,559 --> 00:19:00,320
else you know never to feel uncomfortable it's okay to feel

174
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:10,080
discomfort it's just discomfort it doesn't mean anything about the way the universe is made

175
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:15,360
whether it's a just world or not it doesn't mean about whether we're good people or not it's just

176
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:21,360
discomfort it arises it passes away and I wish for all of you that it doesn't

177
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:27,000
stay around for a long time but we don't get to control those

178
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:35,120
things cuz there's this way in which if we do apply this pers perseverance or

179
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:40,840
persistence this aitana it adds like this richness to our

180
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:47,000
life this level of fulfillment or satisfaction like yeah I I I really

181
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,559
tried maybe I didn't get what I wanted maybe I did but I really did

182
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,760
try and there's this way in which so often we can be holding back and feeling

183
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,559
like well I don't even really want to try because the fear of not achieving or

184
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:08,960
attaining acquiring where the fear of that of of

185
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:13,520
not doing that often prevents us from even

186
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:21,840
starting but if we're able to begin again and again and again and again just

187
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:29,000
begin again and again and again there's this way that it does it brings a certain I don't know

188
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,559
satisfaction to your life when I had to do that difficult thing and I did it there was a little bit of uplift like oh

189
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:41,880
look at that I did it you know I really didn't want to I wasn't quite sure that I could

190
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:47,000
but I did it so and there's you know we need to fill

191
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:54,320
our fill our lives with these types of things there's so much stuff that's kind of like our energy draining

192
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,600
out and this is something that kind of like gives us a little bit of confidence little bit of boost to do something

193
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:06,400
that's difficult it doesn't have to be wildly difficult it can be just sending

194
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:14,440
that email that you've been putting off that you need to reply to coworker or something like this or

195
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:21,559
what whatever it might be so how would we make the a resolution

196
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:27,760
how would we like set a resolve I like this one way is to think

197
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,600
about is what like for yourself like what well

198
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:42,400
what is something that I can maybe like practice this Adana with this determination this resolve

199
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:49,039
persistence and just to ask yourself what qualities would I advise a

200
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:56,760
friend who is very similar to me what qualities would I advise them to develop

201
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:03,240
or cultivate or pay attention to somebody that we loved and cared for

202
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:10,240
what would we do as opposed it's really helpful to think about things that way it's it's a little bit more accessible

203
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:17,120
otherwise that inner critic is pretty sneaky and it otherwise it'll get right in there well you know you should do x y

204
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,120
z a b c instead just like okay if I had a good friend who was like this what

205
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,840
what maybe something that this friend could work on

206
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:35,200
to ask ask it that way but maybe this is a reflection maybe

207
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:41,880
it's not something that comes immediately to mind but maybe it's something that gets dropped in during a meditation or something when there's

208
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,440
some openness or some

209
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:53,279
ease and when you feel like you have this idea of okay I I really want to set

210
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:59,840
I want to like Orient towards this aspiration in order to meet this aspir ation I want to cultivate this

211
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:06,960
particular quality and once you have that sense where you filled in those

212
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,880
words whatever the aspiration is whatever the quality to be developed at next or right then to help with that

213
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:19,000
aspiration to be a little bit more specific I want [Music]

214
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,520
to have more spaciousness in my life maybe that's the

215
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:34,240
aspiration and then maybe the quality to cultivate

216
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:41,600
is taking care of clutter maybe that's just something like okay I'm just going to organize my space like the physical

217
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,159
space I'm going to start there or I'm going to practice saying no

218
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:55,000
because maybe my life is filled up with things because I can't say no to other people and or or I'm just going to spend

219
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:02,760
more time taking walks in nature instead of Doom scrolling I'm G to go

220
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:10,000
outside whatever it might be so after you've kind like have these

221
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,799
ideas then sit with it a little bit and see like how does it feel is there a

222
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:22,320
little bit of delay like oh yeah yeah or is there a little like yeah okay I guess

223
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,080
I should do this I really don't want to there should be a little bit of something that uh has a little little

224
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,919
bit of kind of excited or this recognition that this is a would

225
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:40,760
be a great thing for my life and maybe the challenge feels challenging but not too much not like I can't do it or

226
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:48,960
something like that so feel into it and choose something that feels achievable

227
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:56,240
and yet you'll have to stretch yourself a little bit not completely be a different person just stretch yourself a

228
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,760
little bit

229
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:06,559
and there's a way in which we can even like say things out

230
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:15,679
loud maybe like sit for a little bit and you know I resolve to take care of clitter

231
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:23,200
maybe I'm going to say this because I am planning to clean my desk tomorrow so I have my desk right I was a

232
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,720
mess I resolved to take care of clutter in my house and then maybe it's

233
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:35,720
something like and may it be so you know there's like a a bow or a saying or you know something or maybe you ring a bell

234
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:41,279
or light a candle or do something like this to make it distinguish it from just

235
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,640
one more thought like okay this thought is a little bit

236
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,080
different and then or you can also actually occurs to

237
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,760
me you can also say it to somebody else or maybe you guys can do something together and sometimes be accountable

238
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:04,279
ability partners and I do this with a a friend that we we

239
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:10,440
send photos to each other for just making sure we go get outside every day into nature and it's quite it's

240
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:15,520
fantastic you have to get these little pictures oh okay she's outside look you

241
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:22,360
know I should go outside it's so nice so how do we keep it it's okay easy

242
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:28,840
enough to make it but uh how do we do this Adana how do we have this persistence and how do we have this uh

243
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:36,720
determination this resoluteness well one is when your resolve slips and it will guaranteed

244
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,919
right if it didn't then this then you chose something a little bit too easy maybe

245
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:48,840
but when the resolve slips just reflect on how that

246
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:56,200
felt not beating yourself up not analyzing it just feeling maybe the

247
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:01,760
disappointment cuz dis disappointment like for me it feels like this little tightness in the gut and kind of like

248
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:08,200
the shoulders kind of like oh you know this collapsing down and allow yourself

249
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:14,799
to feel that collapse if indeed it is a collapse and the body and the mind don't

250
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:21,320
like that collapse and so there'll be a way in which oh yeah okay going this

251
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:27,799
direction leads to this uncomfortable feeling collapse for example going this

252
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:35,600
other direction gives me some confidence even though it's a little bit uncomfortable not what I want to do but it gives me some confidence so just

253
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,159
recognize both the body and the mind it can be really helpful to bring the body

254
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:47,159
into it our posture our physical posture or the

255
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:54,080
internal uh contraction that

256
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:00,919
happens and then just not maybe there's something

257
00:28:00,919 --> 00:28:06,760
obvious about you know why it's was hard at that

258
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,960
time to follow your resolve like yeah okay I made the

259
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:18,080
resolve to not eat as much sugar maybe I shouldn't have bought all those

260
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,760
cookies okay don't buy cookies anymore or you know maybe there's something obvious but maybe there's something

261
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:31,480
that's not obvious too and there can just without a lot of analysis because analysis often the

262
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:38,080
inner critic gets dis uh disguised as analysis while you did this wrong you did that wrong you did this wrong that

263
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,200
is not where we're going it's like okay just what's what's

264
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,960
can happen next what's what what how did I get here

265
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:56,200
and what what's next how can I write this or how is there a way that I can

266
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:04,399
just Begin Again that's all that's needed is just Begin Again in whatever way that's simple I

267
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:11,519
think um is it James Clear he's this person who wrote This Book Atomic habits if I'm remembering correctly he says

268
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:17,519
like just do something that's you can do in two minutes okay that's worthwhile like okay

269
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,960
this is how you begin again just do something for two minutes we can do that

270
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,559
all of us can do that but there's this way in which we

271
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:36,200
can also get in trouble with this resolves I'm saying here's an aspiration and then have a resolve to do it and

272
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:41,840
like I I don't want to say that it's only upside because there's a way in

273
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:49,240
which we can kind of like slip into something that it turns into something that's not helpful for example just

274
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:55,480
beating ourselves up when we have difficulties let's not make this something else that we're going to beat

275
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:00,840
ourselves up with I'm going to going to just tell you right now there's going to be difficulties and it doesn't mean

276
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:07,799
anything about you as a person it doesn't mean you can't do it it doesn't mean anything it's just the way things

277
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:13,720
are it's not a personal failing it's just the way things

278
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:20,919
are but there's a way also that if we have this resolve or the I'm going to do this in order to meet this aspiration

279
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:26,240
that we can get really fixed views this is good and anything else that deters me

280
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:34,720
from it is bad and there's a way that we can have this uh dogmatism or fundamentalism or just this really fixed

281
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:41,519
view like I don't care about anything else you guys are inferior or something because you don't have the same idea

282
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:48,120
that I have or it's terrible way right to kind of like move through the world but sometimes we feel like in order to

283
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:56,279
support this determination and this resolve that we have to like really uh bear down and strain and strive and I'm

284
00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:01,399
even making a fist when I'm doing this because it kind of feels like that but

285
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:07,880
then this fisted like having this fist um shows up in our minds too kind of

286
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:15,600
like being closed like no only this don't uh tell me about other ideas

287
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:21,200
that's silly I don't want to hear it or something there can be a certain harshness so that could be like one of

288
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:28,240
the downsides of this uh resolve or also there's can just be this

289
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,960
stubbornness or this immovability or obstinacy that kind of like bleeds out into other things

290
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:42,519
too like okay I'm going to try to control everything because I'm trying to control this one thing but that's not

291
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:48,919
going so well or I don't know it turns out right we can't really control nearly what we think we can right but when we

292
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:55,240
try to do something this idea of wanting to control it just bleeds out into other areas of our lives trying to control

293
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,480
other people and once uh I had a friend that was uh

294
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:06,000
trying to lose weight and this friend discovered that uh they were feeding the

295
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,240
cats less and less because well some you know we all should

296
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,559
be losing weight right but you know the cats didn't need to lose any weight at all but there's this way right that we

297
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:24,159
could kind of just bleed out into other things so the Buddha also kind gave

298
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:31,000
somebody some ways to work with this the way that having a resolve can slip into

299
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:37,720
some contraction or tightness or bleeding into stubbornness or obstinacy

300
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:44,080
or something like this so the these four

301
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:50,159
supports I'll just mention these briefly there four supports for this uh

302
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:56,120
resolve right you know this is Buddhism right so we have all these lists I love these lists but uh I know not everybody

303
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:03,080
loves them that's perfectly fine if you don't so this for um to support Adana

304
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:10,559
resolve determination persistence is some wisdom like some wisdom about like okay

305
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:16,279
how to stretch your capabilities in a way that honors who you are as a person

306
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:21,679
honors your life experience as well as stretches your capabilities not

307
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:28,960
something too big and not something too small there a little bit of wisdom required in this

308
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:37,000
it also takes wisdom to not beat yourself up to not allow this inner critic to get in there it takes some

309
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,399
wisdom to say oh I see you inner critic okay you can be there I'm going to do

310
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:48,600
this and I'm going to take care of myself but I'm just going to let you be on the side like so we're going to honor

311
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:55,279
and respect that their inner critic it's a habit that likes to come along but we don't need to give it Authority we don't

312
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:03,000
have to believe it we can just say okay I see you Mildred come along whatever name we want to give to

313
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,878
this person this is not uncommon for people to name their inner critics kind of names that give them a give a little

314
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:15,638
little levity to it right wisdom

315
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:20,839
truth this a second support for Adana this

316
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:27,599
persistence there's a way a number of different ways we can interpret this one is like maybe just being true

317
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:35,000
to your resolve staying with it that's I I'll

318
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:42,800
stick with that I could talk more about that but one way we can interpret truth here is just to be true to the

319
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,040
resolve third one is

320
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:54,919
relinquishment we're going to have to let go of some things

321
00:34:54,919 --> 00:35:01,720
guaranteed we're going to have to let go go of something views or activities or

322
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:08,280
habits patterns I I don't know what they is and this willingness to let go of

323
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:15,079
what needs to be let go of we all know this and there's this a

324
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:23,839
quote in the dhap if you see a greater happiness that comes by forsaking a lesser

325
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:30,480
happiness be willing to forsake the less happiness for the greater

326
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:38,280
happiness tennis he says exchanging candy for gold like okay this candy is sweet but

327
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:46,680
you know gold is more valuable can help us in ways will make a difference unlike

328
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:53,319
candy so the third quality that can help us with this uh setting a resolve is

329
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:58,599
relinquishment just recognizing we will have to let go of things

330
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:05,800
because often the things that pull us off of the path are those things that look good and promise a quick

331
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:12,480
gratification and you know and those are well if those worked

332
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:19,240
you wouldn't be making a resolve for something different so just recognizing you're going to have to get let go of some of

333
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:27,280
these things and then here's the fourth quality is this sense of peace

334
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:35,280
like doing this resolve with a as much peace as you can in a way that we're not getting all

335
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,440
worked up with the difficulties that we're not uh as I'm saying again and

336
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:48,160
again and again that we're not creating this stories that it means that we're bad people or inadequate in some way or

337
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,560
that uh we can't do it or any of that kind of stuff but can we do it with peace like

338
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,880
yeah it's hard but I can do hard

339
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,440
things and maybe I can't do that big hard thing maybe I can do this little

340
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,839
hard thing find something you can do that takes two minutes or

341
00:37:10,839 --> 00:37:18,000
something but to do it with some peace with as much ease and openness as you can find so that we don't kind of like

342
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,880
slip into the downsides of this resolve this stubbornness or

343
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:32,400
obsy so this idea of making an aspiration what's like really meaningful

344
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:39,040
for us and then setting a resolve or

345
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:46,520
determination what is something a quality something that we can do develop cultivate to help support our life going

346
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:53,640
towards this aspiration and then the Buddha talked about these four qualities to help this

347
00:37:53,640 --> 00:38:00,920
resolve wisdom truth relinquishment and

348
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:08,040
peace and I'll end there and then I'll open it up for some questions thank

349
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,318
you anybody have some questions or

350
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:34,640
comments thank you Diana um last week I attended

351
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:42,560
a one-hour seminar on decluttering oh fantastic and it was for all of NASA

352
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,000
there were like over 400 people on this just you know so decluttering was quite quite

353
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,720
a you know timely for many many people it's a thing and they actually had six

354
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:59,800
categories of why you hang on things oh okay so I won't go through the whole six

355
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:06,040
but you don't want to sit up here and just give a whole another talk yeah well yeah yeah I mean it was a one hour talk

356
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:11,079
that I listened to but you know there were things about um I guess the ones

357
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:19,680
that stuck in my mind number one was um things that um had no home had no place

358
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:26,839
to go some things that were just junk you know just needed to be thrown out some things that you had overb bought

359
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:32,200
like you'd gone to Costco and bought you know like 5 PBS of nutmeg

360
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:38,599
you 5 PBS of nutmeg a lot of nutmeg yeah

361
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:45,720
um one of them was sentimental attachment and um I don't remember the

362
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:53,400
other two but um that sort of helped me at least think about okay well why

363
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:59,400
rather than just beating myself up like get rid of this more like well what's what's the

364
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:05,359
attachment here because um you know clinging is

365
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:13,440
something that we talk about but this was like you you could sort of look at what what might be behind that not

366
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,520
wanting to let go and maybe if I if I may we could even go as further to say

367
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:27,319
let's go ahead and put them in piles this thing doesn't have a home this thing uh has sentimental value you this

368
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:33,160
thing has um it's a to-do list and then just or this thing needs to be recycled

369
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:38,359
or something like that yeah Shuffle the Clutter yeah what and one of the other

370
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:44,839
categories was the someday Al oh yeah you know the projects like someday I'll

371
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:54,520
you know so we all have those too I'll get around to that someday yeah just in case yeah yeah thank you Jim thank

372
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:59,520
you anybody else have a comment or a

373
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:15,680
question hi um as I was sorry listening to you H I

374
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:25,040
was thinking that um what what is it that stops us from doing what we want to

375
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:32,520
do or where we want to give it's very clear in our mind that we we want this

376
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:40,200
we want this this is my dream or small dream big dream and um then

377
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:49,200
I I have a feeling that and there are some um training in the back in the

378
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:57,079
background some memories of you know in the subconscious that um it says why why

379
00:41:57,079 --> 00:42:03,040
would you do that or you can't do that and

380
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:10,720
then um I I was going through this for a while and then I started

381
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:18,680
meditation and then um actually for me de decluttering my mind is more

382
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:29,079
important than getting rid of his stuff you know it's a so then I noticed that this I have to

383
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:37,359
focus on my conscious mind I have to be aware of what's going on in in my

384
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:46,400
conscious mind in my right in front of my brain that what is it that um I have

385
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,720
to train this because I it comes from all the background that my

386
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:58,359
experiences and then then I focus on my

387
00:42:58,359 --> 00:43:06,079
awareness yeah yeah and during the meditation I the I'm practicing for a

388
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,839
while and in the beginning it didn't happen for two years I didn't even know

389
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:20,960
what what meditation and I sat with no result and I knew something finally it's

390
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:29,359
going to happen then so uh for for me when this meditation is

391
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:36,800
helping me to to be aware of what what is it that I

392
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:42,880
want but why am I not doing it and then

393
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:49,079
some the clarity comes in the me in the meditation yeah this recognition of

394
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:54,359
what's like preventing you from EXA what's in the way I'm I'm getting to

395
00:43:54,359 --> 00:44:03,440
know myself yeah yeah yeah I know myself more than before um

396
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:11,040
that I'm very real when when you know you sit and then you get rid of all the

397
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:18,920
clutters as I sit my thinking my train of thought is getting less slower and

398
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:27,040
slower and then I get to the point that it's kind of empty and then I feel like

399
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:32,400
my creation comes from there and

400
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:39,839
um this has been really great experience for me I just wanted to share with you

401
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:49,119
and then you added some more some more knowledge that I can I can bring to my

402
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:55,480
awareness to um when I meditate and it's just

403
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:02,359
being aware I um I like to be conscious of what's going on in my mind we can't

404
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:10,160
just let it go we can't you know it's my baby it can my mind is my baby to take

405
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,599
care of it I'm not going to let everything comes there like before you

406
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:23,520
know yeah it can make a big difference if we can know what's happening in our minds but we don't always do right so we

407
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,680
can't necessarily wait until we have the perfect Clarity but uh but thank you for

408
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:34,079
bringing up like okay what what is getting in the way that makes me think that maybe my the next talk next week

409
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,640
I'll talk about okay what are some of these things that we that get in the way of doing the thing that's important to

410
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:47,640
us right would you be surprised if I said well the Buddha has a list of course of course right but thank
