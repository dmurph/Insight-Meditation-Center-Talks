1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,759
let's see where was I I was introducing myself my name is May Elliott and good

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:11,460
morning uh here we are in the midst of a week-long study on the foundations of

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:18,300
vipassana meditation so yesterday we focused on the breath and today we'll be talking about the

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,400
body so these are the basic instructions meditation instructions one receives

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:30,000
that Insight Meditation Center and many of the western the pastina centers in

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,239
California and around the U.S so I'd like to begin our sitting with a

7
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,420
quote and we'll have a little more silence in the sitting today than yesterday my quote goes like this this is from

8
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,600
Kate Johnson the language of the body is sensation

9
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:57,059
and feeling is the way we listen the language of the body is sensation

10
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,059
and feeling is the way we listen

11
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:09,500
so let's begin our meditation with a stable upright posture

12
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:20,400
foreign upright and energetic space to be in an

13
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,979
energetic spine perhaps maybe some lifting in the

14
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:33,540
neck and pairing that with some relaxation

15
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,740
some ease

16
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:51,680
you might start by connecting with your primary anchor that might be the breath

17
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,140
a global sense of the body or a sense of sound

18
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,340
for the Simplicity of the instructions we'll just talk about the breath

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,520
so go ahead and connect with the breath where you feel it most predominantly

20
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,360
maybe in the chest the belly or the nose

21
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,700
thank you allowing the mind to collect and

22
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,360
stabilize

23
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,000
foreign in order to support us in learning the

24
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,159
language of the body we'll spend some time exploring one particular area in the body

25
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:46,860
and we'll do this with the hands we'll go ahead and choose one of your hands

26
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:52,580
and bring your attention to that hand and see what you notice

27
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:00,959
because the body speaks in the language of Sensations

28
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,680
you might feel tingling

29
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,519
for temperature

30
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:21,199
buzzing or movement

31
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:37,560
maybe there's a global sense of the hand there's the whole hand being

32
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:44,720
not a picture of the hand and the mind but a felt sense of the hand from the inside

33
00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:00,960
and as we feel the hand we're not trying to make it any different than it is

34
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,040
we're not judging anything or telling stories about our hand

35
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,340
just feeling foreign

36
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:30,020
between their fingers where the skin meets the nail beds

37
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,099
just exploring the territory

38
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,319
feeling the Flesh of the hand

39
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:50,900
the muscles and feeling the bones

40
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,020
if the sensations are Pleasant that's okay if they're unpleasant that's okay

41
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:13,159
it's just observing with a kind and gentle awareness

42
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,539
foreign

43
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:38,759
you can move your attention to your other hand and explore in the same way

44
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,960
seeing what you notice

45
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,919
foreign

46
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:41,520
s in this way it gives us a sense of how we might feel into Sensations elsewhere

47
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:49,380
in the body foreign for feeling

48
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:55,979
temperature pressure tingling sharpness softness

49
00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:03,240
Etc so we can now let go of our focus on the

50
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,720
hands go ahead and return to your primary anchor

51
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,620
coming back to the breath

52
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:25,699
foreign

53
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:44,159
so from here the way that you might incorporate more of the body into your meditation

54
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:51,000
is by staying with the breath as the anchor but when something else feels more

55
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,740
predominant maybe a sensation in the knee tightness in the shoulder

56
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:05,279
coldness of the toes and something else becomes predominant you can allow your attention to let go

57
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,300
of the breath and to go to that Sensation that New Sensation

58
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:17,640
the mind can feel that sensation and when it begins to lose predominance and

59
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:26,060
we return to the breath so the breath is still our home

60
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:32,040
but the awareness can venture out to other areas of the body when they call

61
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:38,000
for our attention and then coming back to the breath

62
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:48,200
you can go ahead and try that now through the meditation

63
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:04,740
foreign

64
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:34,200
you can add a soft mental note when breathing you might make a quiet

65
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:41,360
internal note saying in and as you breathe out

66
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,480
okay oh

67
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:55,680
and then as another sensation calls the attention we might say

68
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,880
tingling or pressure

69
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,220
foreign

70
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,360
[Music] out

71
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:24,000
it's just a light mental note with the majority of the attention on the

72
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,620
sensations being felt

73
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,680
foreign

74
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,000
foreign

75
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,560
thank you

76
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:31,579
foreign

77
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:23,459
foreign

78
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,720
thank you

79
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,300
as we sit attending to our primary anchor the

80
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:40,079
breath can we apply our attention to the breath

81
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:46,680
and maintain contact with it aiming and sustaining

82
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,720
the taka and vichara

83
00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:00,740
staying in contact with the full length of the inhale

84
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:10,160
and the full length of the exhale naming and sustaining contact

85
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,540
foreign

86
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:59,060
when another sensation arises heaviness

87
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:05,159
lightness length

88
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:13,039
whatever it is allowing the mind to connect with that New Sensation

89
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:18,558
and feel it completely

90
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:40,580
then returning to the breath

91
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,720
foreign

92
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:23,400
foreign thoughts and emotions may still arise

93
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:30,919
but for now we allow them to fall to the background letting them go

94
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:38,700
dedicating our attention to the breath and the physical Sensations

95
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,700
foreign

96
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,039
foreign

97
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,820
foreign

98
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:57,200
thank you

99
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,820
foreign

100
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,480
foreign

101
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,400
thank you

102
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,879
foreign

103
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,159
foreign

104
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:35,340
by practicing mindfulness of the body we can learn to be more present in the

105
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:40,400
world the body is always in the present

106
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:48,080
we can become more able to be with things as they are

107
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:59,539
to live with less greed hatred or delusion

108
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:09,299
and when we're able to do that we can be more available more kind more

109
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:13,820
generous and more compassionate with others

110
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:30,900
so may the goodness of this practice benefit all beings everywhere

111
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:39,200
so they may be happy healthy safe and free

112
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,740
thank you

113
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:20,220
oh good morning again everyone so nice to be here with you if you are just arriving my name is May

114
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:27,059
Elliott and here we are in the midst of our week-long study on the foundations of

115
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:32,880
the pasana meditation so yesterday was on the breadth today

116
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:40,080
we're talking about mindfulness of body so there was an experiment done by the

117
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:47,460
University of Iowa some years ago where they made a gambling game that consisted of four

118
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:55,740
decks and each of the cards in the decks either awarded money or detracted money

119
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:01,679
and the task of the player was to make as much money as possible

120
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:08,220
so unbeknownst to the player some of the decks provided great gains

121
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:15,419
but even greater losses so in essence these were bad decks and the only way to

122
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:20,658
win the game was to pull from a good deck

123
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:27,840
44 40 to 50 cards of sampling from all the different decks

124
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:34,080
before a participant caught on and could consciously avoid a bad deck so about 40

125
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:41,340
to 50 cards now during the game a participant would

126
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:46,919
be hooked up to electrodes measuring Biometrics and this is where the study

127
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:52,020
got interesting um so despite not being able to identify

128
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:59,520
the good deck until about 40 or 50 cards the participants bodies showed us stress

129
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:06,419
reaction when they hovered their hand over a bad deck only about 10 cards into

130
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:12,659
the game so this stress reaction happened long before the player consciously recognized

131
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:21,179
that the bad deck would would produce a losing hand so 10 cards Ted cards in the body reacts

132
00:29:21,179 --> 00:29:28,679
40 to 50 cards in the player can consciously name the pattern so somehow the body was exhibiting

133
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:35,460
stress signals some some sense of risk or danger associated with that deck 30

134
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,740
to 40 cards uh before the thinking mind caught on

135
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:48,299
so for me this points to the wisdom of the body the body is giving us signals all the

136
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:55,200
time and what what could we learn from the body if we really trained in listening

137
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,840
to it it has so much to teach us

138
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,000
thank you again the quote that I shared at the beginning of the meditation the language

139
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:13,460
of the body is sensation and feeling is the way we listen

140
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:22,380
and it's hard to listen we're so often distracted I I used to live at tasahara

141
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:29,100
a secluded Zen Monastery in the ventano wilderness and in the valley where the monastery

142
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:35,159
was located um instruments would play to call the residents to the meditation Hall

143
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:42,360
so when we'd hear the Han this wouldn't block being hit we would know that it was time for Zaza for meditation

144
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:48,059
and one of my friends would often remark at the sound of the Han oh it's time to

145
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:54,600
go to the movies uh and I thought that was at because sometimes sitting in meditation can feel

146
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,659
a lot like sitting down to a fantasy film or maybe a drama or a horror film

147
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:06,720
or if we're lucky maybe a romance and our habits of rumination are a lot like

148
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,299
watching blockbuster hits so when we sit down to meditate

149
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:18,480
often it's hard to to attend to the language of the body it's hard to actually hear it because it's drowned

150
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:25,140
out by the films of our mind as we become more settled then we begin

151
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:30,419
to enjoy the peace and ease of simplicity

152
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:36,480
the peace and ease of resting in the body we realize that's a blockbuster hits no

153
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,120
matter how enjoyable they seem to be are actually pretty agitating

154
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:47,520
being lost in thought replaying these movies is a little like being out on the

155
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:53,279
tiny limbs of a tree being blown about by a storm and this is an analogy that

156
00:31:53,279 --> 00:32:00,299
Gil often shares it's like we've we've lived our lives on the tiny branches

157
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:09,059
and as we learn to be still and present it's a little like coming off the tiny branches deeper uh closer to the trunk

158
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:14,100
of the tree it's a little more stable we're blown about less and eventually

159
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:19,980
we can come we can come right into the Heartwood

160
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:27,179
where we're not blown about by the worldly lens and we don't need to be blown by them we

161
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:33,120
don't need to be blown by praise and blame gain and loss

162
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:40,020
Pleasure and Pain Fame and disrepute the more that we live in the thought

163
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:46,260
world the more we lose touch with our life as we experience it through the filter of

164
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:54,480
our thoughts and our perceptions so we end up lacking a sensitivity to our experience so given that we then seek

165
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,120
greater intensity and we want uh louder and bigger and tastier

166
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:09,779
experiences we need that greater intensity in order to feel anything so without training in being in the body

167
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:15,840
once we get what we've been seeking we don't really know how to be present

168
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:22,320
for it and the Buddha stressed over and over

169
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,779
the importance of the body because of because of course the body is

170
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:34,080
always in the present the mind with its many distractions stirs up a lot of trouble but the body

171
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:40,919
is always here so our practice is just learning to land in it learning to make our home in the

172
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:47,159
body in this practice you'll often hear teachers talking about letting go

173
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:53,100
but what are we letting go into we're letting go into the body

174
00:33:53,100 --> 00:34:00,779
letting go into the body so how do we do that how do we feel it

175
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:06,240
it starts by making contact just being here learning to love the

176
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:13,560
simple ease of whatever is seen or heard or spelled or tasted or touched

177
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:20,638
and to do this without getting lost in commentary about the body is difficult and it can help to be

178
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,099
curious this is something we talked about yesterday when talking about mindfulness of breathing the way that

179
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:31,560
curiosity is like glue for the present keeps us connected to the present

180
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:37,560
if we can get interested in Sensations and how things feel we can think about

181
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:43,919
it like being a scientist kind of like being a scientist exploring the inner world

182
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:51,240
so uh in the early 90s there was this cartoon on TV called The Magic School

183
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:57,839
Bus and in it Miss Frizzle the teacher the zany science teacher would take her

184
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:04,680
students on these unlikely field trips inside the human body where she would do this by shrinking the

185
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:12,599
school the school bus down to the size of a peanut miniaturizing the students and then they would drive the bus into a

186
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:18,540
bowl of Cheetos or something like that and then poor Arthur the one student who

187
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:23,640
always missed the school field trips would grab a handful of Cheetos

188
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:29,280
and inadvertently ingest the school bus so from there the field trip would begin

189
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:36,180
and all of the kids in the science class would learn about the anatomy of the human body while literally coursing

190
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:41,220
through the digestive tract or riding on a blood vessel being pumped through the

191
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:46,680
bloodstream or something like that so so that's all to say that I sometimes

192
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:55,619
think about mindfulness of body as a little like being on a field trip with Miss Grizzle and so when we're exploring

193
00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:01,740
the body from the inside I sometimes think of it like I'm one of those miniature scientists exploring the

194
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:07,560
inner world and like Miss Frizzle when we sit and practice being in the

195
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:12,780
body we actually are within it we're entering into the human body and

196
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:20,099
exploring it from the inside they're like wow you know the jaw feels like this when it's clenched or when the

197
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:26,040
stomach produces sensations of hunger feels like this or this is what it's like when the mouth

198
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:32,180
feels dry so can we bring the same curious clear

199
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:37,859
non-judgmental attention that the scientist has to our

200
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:41,119
exploration of the body

201
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:54,240
now sometimes when we're investigating the body we encounter something difficult

202
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:01,200
we encounter something painful so I want to say a little bit about working with unpleasant

203
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:08,880
Sensations as you practice in the body you may notice that some Sensations are hard to

204
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:16,440
view it or that there's pain and this is a natural experience of course and our job isn't to reject or

205
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:23,520
hate the discomfort but rather just to be aware of it you know can we practice being non-reactive to that which is

206
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:30,900
uncomfortable I think so what's so powerful about that practice is that in doing so we grow our

207
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:36,180
bandwidth for being with the full spectrum of of difficulty of human life

208
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:43,380
without being unskillful in our reactions to it and we grow our ability to be with what's uncomfortable without

209
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:49,800
reacting unskillfully so when unpleasant Sensations arise

210
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,839
we might bring our interest to the pain we might explore the sensations that

211
00:37:54,839 --> 00:38:00,660
make up this idea that we call pain sometimes when we explore closely we

212
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:08,880
find that there are only moments of aching burning pressure or tightness it's kind of a kaleidoscope of

213
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,980
Sensations and that there isn't actually something there something fixed called

214
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:19,680
pain just a kaleidoscope of Sensations and sometimes I can

215
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:26,640
unlock some of the rigidity that the Mind holds around our idea of what the pain is

216
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,520
so if the discomfort for that's a great practice to do if the discomfort isn't

217
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:38,040
too extreme but if the discomfort is really intense you can also allow the attention to go elsewhere in the body

218
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:43,079
somewhere more comfortable to rest to a more neutral sensation so this is a way

219
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:48,119
that we can resource so say if the back hurts we might allow the attention to go

220
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:53,160
to the breath maybe go to the breath in the belly or go to the feet or such somewhere that

221
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:59,579
feels neutral or another place that we can go is if there's discomfort in the body we can

222
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:05,599
pay attention to sounds as our primary anchor and give ourselves a little spaciousness

223
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:12,119
and of course it's really important to know the limits of our bodies and to respect those limits and not pushing

224
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:18,180
ourselves to sit in or hold postures that might exacerbate an injury for

225
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:27,300
example so so it's always okay to consciously choose to move to shift postures to

226
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,579
readjust during a meditation period doing it mindfully doing it with

227
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:38,880
awareness um such that we can be present and also that we can be compassionate with

228
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:47,099
ourselves and of course unpleasant Sensations aren't all we find in meditation

229
00:39:47,099 --> 00:39:52,920
we can also experience incredibly Pleasant Sensations you know the body can be filled with

230
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:58,260
lightness with ease with relaxation or spaciousness

231
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:04,920
so if an area of the body feels Pleasant you can allow yourself to enter into

232
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:10,880
that sensation to feel it fully and to be nourished by it

233
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,320
our renunciation practice doesn't mean that we can't experience what's

234
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:22,020
beautiful so um suffering comes from clinging

235
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:27,240
right from craving not from meeting what's Pleasant so you can enjoy a

236
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:33,660
pleasant sensation there's a pleasant sensation in the body you might enjoy it kind of like sliding

237
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:38,820
into a bath and just allowing yourself to soak there and really take it up

238
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:44,400
allow your attention to rest in the pleasantness and then of course when that sensation

239
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:51,078
goes because it will not clinging to it not grasping after

240
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:56,520
so I think I'd like to end by just doing a little review of how you might

241
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:02,339
continue practicing with the body this is what we talked about uh what I talked about in the meditation

242
00:41:02,339 --> 00:41:09,420
so we start when we sit down to meditate it can be really helpful to start with mindfulness of breathing we're directing

243
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:16,200
our attention to that sense of inhaling and exhaling and then from there we expand our

244
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,599
meditation to include other Sensations in the body so the breath is still our

245
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:28,260
primary anchor that we can begin to include Sensations elsewhere as they present themselves so

246
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:35,160
we still are have a preference for the breath but when something else becomes strong in the body then we allow our

247
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:41,760
attention to go to that sensation we feel it until it's faded away and then we return our attention to the primary

248
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,980
anchor of the breath so that's a little bit of what your

249
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:52,640
um your practice could look like at this phase of the instructions so

250
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:59,099
I hope that these teachings have inspired you to let go into the body

251
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:06,300
uh to let go of the narratives of your minds and maybe I come in off the branches off

252
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:11,820
the tiny branches and enter into the Heartwood of your life

253
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:17,640
so I hope that you all have a wonderful day today and I look forward to seeing

254
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:26,000
you tomorrow for a discussion of mindfulness of emotions thank you so much everyone take care
