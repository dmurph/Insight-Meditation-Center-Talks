11
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:43,579
sensing our way up the spine aligning little by little

as we do this you may notice your breath adjusting itself

13
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,159

any effort with the meditation

is to relax a body her mind

so hello again deep appreciation

78
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,059
for this week of reflection together my name is kodo

79
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:34,080
yeah so deep appreciation for five days considering the five lay

80
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:39,299
precepts what a pleasure to do that in Sangha

81
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:45,419
foreign for this morning our fifth day

82
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:52,520
is I'll make some some brief comments about the fifth uh precept

83
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:58,860
and then I would like to as we have been this whole week do a recitation of the

84
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:03,960
precepts but I'd like to do a longer form and in the ancient language of the poly

85
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:10,620
so I'll I'll share that with you and then I would like to make some time at the end for questions

86
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:17,100
so maybe a bit to cover in about 12 minutes and I may stay a few minutes after if

87
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:22,620
there are extra questions so let's begin with the

88
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:28,460
fifth precept which is put this way

89
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:36,539
for the sake of our training together I undertake the precept to abstain from

90
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:41,840
intoxicants that are a cause for heedlessness

91
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:52,080
clear confident with the time that we have one of the

92
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:59,640
maybe more evocative things that we could put forth is a simple observation

93
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:05,039
that the Buddha as far as I am aware and these early teachings

94
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:10,860
never praised the use of intoxicants

95
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:17,240
in fact spoke against it strongly consistently so

96
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:24,539
the Buddha prohibited the use of alcohol wine intoxicating Liquors for

97
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:31,740
the monastics and then in the in the 10 rules for novice monastics which were then the

98
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,720
model for of the five lay precepts

99
00:33:36,899 --> 00:33:42,539
and um out of curiosity I was looking up the origin story where did this rule come

100
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:49,559
from because the um the video the monastic rules are just full of these these um

101
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:54,899
stories of a time before a monastic Rule and then something happens and then the

102
00:33:54,899 --> 00:34:02,460
Buddha says ah yes now there will be a rule we will train in this way so the story is something like

103
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:08,878
there's this um there's this venerable monastic I think at the time is an attendant of the

104
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:15,000
Buddha perhaps not Ananda but another monastic and they're wandering on alms round and

105
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,300
the folks um uh say oh don't don't go over to this cave there's a dangerous serpent in this

106
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:26,878
cave to make a long story short the attendant the monastic I think his name is

107
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:31,980
venerable sagata goes into the cave and has what more or

108
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:37,700
less amounts to a um meditative battle

109
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:43,679
uh with this uh with this dangerous serpent

110
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:50,700
sort of peacefully subdues this dangerous serpent sometime later comes out and the lay

111
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:56,760
people are standing at a respectful distance and they say oh venerables this group of

112
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:03,540
monks what can we what can we give you what's hard for you to get that we the late people can offer

113
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:08,760
and the the group of monks say oh there are these there are these intoxicants

114
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:15,240
there are these Liquors that are really hard for us to get you can give us those so every house in the town apparently

115
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:21,359
then gives to the monastics these drinks so this this attendant

116
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:26,640
venerable sagata goes from house to house and then sometime later as you might imagine

117
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:33,359
according to the according to the writing he's found sort of face down um unconscious next to the path and the

118
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,180
Buddha says oh manastics pick him up let's take him back

119
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,700
so this previously strong

120
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:53,579
meditator venerable respectable Monk Is found unconscious at the at the least a um a

121
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:58,740
bit embarrassing then they take him back to back to the monastery and he's sort

122
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:03,780
of rolling around in his sleep the monastics put him down with their with uh with his head toward the Buddhas

123
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:10,079
while he can sleep the sign of respect in Ancient India and while he's rolling around he

124
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,920
ends up putting his feet toward the Buddha a sign of disrespect at the time

125
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:23,700
and this is when the Buddha makes the proclamation and he says things along the lines of it's oh it's unseemly it's

126
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,800
uh I have it here how does he put it it's not fitting

127
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,839
for sagata it's not becoming it's not suitable it's not worthy

128
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:39,540
it's not allowable and it's in the wake of this that the Buddha then makes this rule

129
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:45,119
of abstaining from intoxicants um

130
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,180
so I think with the time we have I'll I'll maybe leave some of the reflection to what do you suppose the Buddha's

131
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:56,400
motivation was what were the intentions that the Buddha was um

132
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,460
had for himself and then what qualities was he trying to imbue in the Sangha

133
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:09,420
what were the qualities what were the consequences that he saw uh through through this act that he

134
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:16,260
wanted to prevent qualities consequences intentions

135
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:21,420
so um the one I will highlight before we move

136
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:28,140
on to the next piece very very important quality in the Buddhist teaching very important

137
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:33,780
ancient word uh apamada heed fullness

138
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:40,859
infamous this um this precept encourages us to undertake the

139
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:46,020
abstinence from intoxicants that are a cause for heedlessness famada and that

140
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:53,280
is the Mind becomes blinded or in influenced in such a way that it's care

141
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:00,240
for skillful qualities gets lost let's care for skillful qualities gets

142
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,960
lost and in contrast

143
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:16,619
one who is accomplished in the Restraint of these precepts is said to shine

144
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:23,640
glow be eliminated to be accomplished in virtue and blameless

145
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,539
they're heedful

146
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:38,480
foreign other note

147
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:44,640
which I think I'll save for the very end so some very brief reflection on this

148
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,940
fifthly precept but I would like to take a moment now and offer a longer

149
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:56,280
recitation [Music] of these precepts in poly as that's uh

150
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:01,800
the recitation has been part of our practice all week let me share this with you so that you

151
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:06,500
can see foreign

152
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:13,578
that link if it shows up

153
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:26,280
because of time I'll refrain from much explanation here and just offer the recitation and then if there are

154
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:32,220
questions we can do those at the end this may take about three minutes and in case anyone needs to go I'd like

155
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:37,280
to say thank you so much as a Sangha for

156
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:42,480
supporting this aspect of a teacher trainee spending the week with me and these

157
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:49,200
Reflections on the precepts I I have a very clear sense

158
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:56,040
um both from my my training as a priest at Zen Center and then as a teacher trainee here

159
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:01,040
um that the entire community

160
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:06,599
trains a teacher so my deep gratitude

161
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:12,060
looks like I need to adjust something in the document here

162
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:15,140
maybe give that a try

163
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:24,859
there so

00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:28,980
and then the precepts me [Music]

170
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:38,319
soon [Music]

171
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:49,539
[Music]

172
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,559
the army

173
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:02,460
so long form amateurs refuges precepts

174
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:09,480
and I hope these Reflections this week have been supportive for for you for us in terms of

175
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:15,960
considering how to live um live a dharmic life with ethical

176
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:22,560
reflection uh to consider how we might apply these precepts in our own life come back to

177
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:28,920
them again and again um and how to live well how to live

178
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:35,420
wisely how to live in a way that benefits us and benefits everyone

179
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:43,980
so now I'd like to um open um the chat for more questions

180
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:52,800
and I can stay behind probably until about 750 Pacific so a few minutes at least

181
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,760
um anything you'd like to ask I saw a question earlier about um

182
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:05,000
what to do if you know someone is speaking an untruth to you is there something

183
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,720
is there something

184
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:17,400
um is there something you can say and do and there's this there's this teaching in the dhamapada of uh to conquer a liar

185
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,339
with truth it's at least encouraging

186
00:43:23,339 --> 00:43:29,220
um to conquer a liar with truth

187
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:35,060
how that's done that's definitely particular to circumstance

188
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,520
what's coming to my mind to share right now without knowing is that we can always protect our own

189
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:47,220
commitment to truthfulness um someone someone may

190
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:52,319
say something untruthful May lie to us actually um

191
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:58,319
you know one-on-one situation and we can protect truthfulness in ourselves

192
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:04,578
we can protect it in ourselves whether or not they're willing to say something true

193
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:13,920
if you choose to engage very simple ways without it without as

194
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,960
much without even any charge could be something like

195
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,180
oh I'm not sure that that is true I'm not sure that that is accurate

196
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:29,460
and there's no there's no Barb there's no Revenge there's no like demand in

197
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:37,099
what you're saying is just offering the simple observation oh I'm not sure I'm not sure that that's true

198
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:43,859
um and one of the guiding criteria here for me is how to proceed

199
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:49,680
peacefully how to proceed in a way that that supports peace and the interaction and

200
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:55,740
then beyond so that's something general and then the um

201
00:44:55,740 --> 00:45:03,859
the particulars really depend on context you know if there are other questions

202
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:12,380
yeah thank you for all the thanks this is lovely

203
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:25,619
oh someone asked a question earlier about if the other uh recordings would be posted that's my

204
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:31,680
understanding though I'm I'm not so uh in the know about how that works

205
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:37,980
foreign and about Zoom

206
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:44,040
I understand that sometimes we also meet on zoom in addition to YouTube this being my first time

207
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:49,800
um I went with just YouTube and maybe by the next time I'll be able to do

208
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:57,619
um I'll be able to do YouTube also or be able to do Zoom also

209
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:09,000
yeah these are good questions the um

210
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,460
there's no simple answer for the question this very commonly

211
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:21,599
comes up actually the uh the Holocaust question would we lie to hide someone

212
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:28,020
and um the there there's no simple answer to this

213
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:33,839
question but what it raises is the fact that

214
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:41,900
um we continuously have to navigate what is a wise peaceful non-harming life

215
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:48,900
and the something to note about something like the Buddhist precepts is

216
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:57,420
um for for us as lay practitioners there's no there's no like overarching Authority

217
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:02,460
in any place at all that interprets the precepts that like

218
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:08,700
this way is the is the right way for you to apply this to your life we can give advice we can encourage a reflection but

219
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:15,420
there's no Final Answer Authority anywhere um

220
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:21,300
so truly we have to study closely my my sense of the as I was saying yesterday

221
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:27,060
the developmental model of working with these precepts is something like

222
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:32,819
starting where it's simple start where it's simple where we're not working at the edge cases like the the

223
00:47:32,819 --> 00:47:39,119
Holocaust example is what I'm referring to as an edge case because it's particularly complicated

224
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:45,780
so um well complicated in some ways and quite

225
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:51,359
simple than others maybe I'll say that but the developmental model for the training is to begin where it's easy

226
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:57,780
begin where it's clear start observing things like cause and effect

227
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:04,020
within yourself what qualities are generated what intentions are are evoked what are the consequences of your

228
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:10,319
actions and then let that wisdom let that wisdom grow let that wisdom

229
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:17,599
expand and then what we learn where it's simple can guide us and where it's difficult

230
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:24,359
oh will I be here next week I won't I won't actually um next week

231
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:30,619
another teacher trainee May Elliott will be teaching an introduction to

232
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:37,800
mindfulness meditation I think should be covering uh covering five aspects of

233
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:43,560
the instructions that we do well to practice over and over again

234
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:49,940
and then maybe last question before I go that I happen to catch as it went by was um

235
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:56,520
um what do we do when we realize we've gone against Our intention or broken a precept

236
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:01,680
as I mentioned yesterday the the model that I take from

237
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:08,339
um from the Buddha is um is a simple one

238
00:49:08,339 --> 00:49:13,920
it's one first recognizing that this is the fact recognizing that I've gone

239
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,819
against my intention or I've broken a precept that I commit was committed to for myself for

240
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:27,540
um so recognizing and then laying that open

241
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:36,780
laying that open that means with a good Dharma friend someone you trust a mentor teacher uh

242
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:43,020
let telling them telling them confession so recognizing

243
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:47,720
laying it open and then making a resolve

244
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:55,880
that in the future we'll try to do something differently and try to do this differently

245
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:01,020
ever pointing ourselves toward skillfulness non-harming and not

246
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:03,440
suffering

247
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:13,380
so this dhamapata verse I think will be the last thing I'll say and then I'll say

248
00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:22,099
farewell translated by Gill uh verse 53.

249
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:27,839
just as from a heap of flowers many garlands can be made

250
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:34,940
so you with your mortal life should do many skillful things

251
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:40,440
maybe so may we continue this reflective

252
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:45,599
dharmic life for the benefit of ourselves and

253
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:52,260
for the benefit of others for the benefit of both for the benefit of the whole world

254
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:59,540
without exception please take care see you again
