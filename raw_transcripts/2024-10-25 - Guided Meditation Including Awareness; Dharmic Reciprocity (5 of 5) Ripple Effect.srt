practice this theme of dhic

6
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,440
reciprocity so the invitation once you've had a

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:57,000
chance to settle in welcome yourself

8
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:05,559
here offer a warm welcome to the day or the

9
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:15,360
evening to settle Back start to move the attention

10
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:24,680
inward maybe adjusting your posture taking that La last sip of tea or

11
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:35,520
coffee and start starting with a couple of intentional slower deeper

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:49,479
breaths receiving on the in

13
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,880
breath and letting go into the practice

14
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,840
relaxing softening on the out breath

15
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:20,160
perhaps at the end of the next out breath allowing yourself to rest in that

16
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,000
Tiny still point that moment of transition between the exhale and the

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
inhale

18
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,159
and then allowing receiving the breath as it naturally

19
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:45,440
wants to be in this moment

20
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,599
allowing mindful awareness to be at the

21
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,680
Forefront of your attention for this half hour of

22
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:30,159
meditation noticing the Sounds in your space the warmth or cool

23
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,799
of this body and the air on your

24
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,159
skin a sense of weight or

25
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:54,720
lightness noticing too whatever [Music] mood

26
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,280
attitude is in your heart

27
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:06,200
perhaps gratitude or

28
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:17,480
calm intention or the momentum of the

29
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:26,360
day letting that be there too taking

30
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,720
nourishment from your aspiration to practice

31
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,000
whatever the

32
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,080
conditions allowing a soft

33
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:59,199
smile and the [Music] tuning attending to whatever anchor of

34
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,639
attention

35
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,039
feels like it will help you stay in this present

36
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:17,639
moment here just here

37
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:40,759
acknowledging and including all of embodied

38
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,000
experience and then resting

39
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,000
settling on each breath this

40
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:07,560
breath where for this sound this moment

41
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:04,680
noticing the effect perhaps soothing

42
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,479
effect of centering the

43
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,360
attention resting and

44
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,960
Sensations coming and going

45
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,240
however life is showing up in this

46
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,479
breath e

47
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:50,160
if an emotion sound sensation

48
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,639
thought becomes

49
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,680
compelling including this too

50
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,920
in mindful awareness of this

51
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,360
moment respect

52
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,880
care and if it fades becomes less

53
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:33,160

in the last few minutes of our formal meditation

90
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:58,000
together the invitation is open the awareness wide

91
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:09,080
if you haven't already to all of present moment experience

92
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:21,640
unfolding notice sound

93
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:31,840
sensation breath but mental or emotional

94
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,559
activity flowing through like flocks of birds or

95
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:45,799
clouds in a vast

96
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,880
Sky then two

97
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:08,159
noticing the quality of that observation the

98
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:14,360
appreciating the capacity for it

99
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:35,000
and then casting your mind back over these moments of

100
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:41,320
meditation acknowledging any

101
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:49,880
challenges with respect [Music]

102
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:56,640
compassion and trust that they become part of the compost

103
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,039
growth in this

104
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:20,278
practice and then two especially noticing

105
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:27,080
recalling any little glimmers of goodness

106
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:38,799
peacefulness or calm steadiness a finger snap of

107
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,919
kindness a droplet of mindful

108
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:58,440
awareness and breathing those into your heart your emotional Center

109
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:09,080
being sustained by them savoring

110
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:27,679
them and from that pleas sending those good wishes outwards

111
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:34,880
to the others in your life other

112
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,480
practitioners and those your life incorporates in other

113
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:50,398
ways those here near and far wishing them

114
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,039
well may they be safe

115
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:08,398
happy healthy may they be

116
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,320
peaceful at ease and

117
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:26,720
free and then two widening the circle allowing that

118
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:36,039
goodness to Ripple out offering the intention may all beings be

119
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:44,080
safe happy peaceful and

120
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:53,120
free noticing the effect of that wish on this heart this

121
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,840
mind In This Moment

122
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,829
[Music]

123
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:29,919
thank you for your practice

124
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,840
for

125
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,880
e e

126
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:29,200
so warm welcome sa warm welcome to the last day of this 5day

127
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:36,200
exploration a special welcome to those of you who slipped in late

128
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:42,039
and what I'd like to cover today this last day of the Buddha's

129
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:47,639
teachings about giving and reciprocity

130
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:53,440
Reflections on how that resonates in our own

131
00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:00,360
practice is um sort of the last thing on one of the lists that I've been reading

132
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:07,720
in this obscure little um section of the poly Canon which is that a good person

133
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,760
with Integrity gives with the view that

134
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,480
something will come of it something will come of it in other

135
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:26,599
words that there are effects for What from what we give cause

136
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:33,520
and effect condition it how different conditions come together to expl to kind

137
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:38,679
of form this moment to form what

138
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:44,200
is and this teaching many of you will recognize is very closely related to a

139
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:51,320
big topic Karma the Buddha made it clear that if someone tries to wrap their head around

140
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:57,160
Karma all of the implications of karma their head would explode so in the

141
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:03,160
interest of keeping everyone's head intact today just going to offer the

142
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:08,880
simplest definition of Karma and it is the the fundamental

143
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:17,359
definition which is action action of body speech or

144
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:24,599
mind so action and result K viaka karma viaka

145
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:30,480
is what people are usually in ort of mainstream Buddhist English talking

146
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,320
about when we talk about Karma and of course you don't always know the

147
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:43,760
results however we can trust and know that there are

148
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,200
results Choice regard for consequences and

149
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:55,599
results are actually key to the entire process of Buddhist

150
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:02,319
Meditation so karma is not fate actions have results those are sort of the core

151
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:08,200
teachings and one of the key actions in these early Buddhist

152
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:15,640
teachings is giving and there's a particular frame on

153
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:23,640
it it's giving with attention to the effect of offering on your own heart and

154
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:31,040
mind your own practice your own way of being and perhaps this is also not

155
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:38,280
totally knowable however it's way more knowable than the vast interplay of Ripples and

156
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:45,440
conditions out in the world from the Buddha perspective in

157
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,640
these early teachings on giving the most helpful reason to

158
00:36:51,640 --> 00:37:02,800
offer is to en Noble the heart and mind to prepare for deeper Insight

159
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:10,599
wisdom and to increase that kind of wisdom generosity and goodness in the

160
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:16,440
world so it's not giving to get and it is definitely not offering out of

161
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:23,200
obligation and this points to there being a real power

162
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,280
in giving with no strings attached

163
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:34,200
that creates a certain kind of resonance a nonlinear

164
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:40,319
reciprocity those of you who've been here all week might remember the story I started

165
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:47,000
with being in a temple in Thailand a monastery practicing there and how the

166
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,160
people there would give excess food excess water to the

167
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:58,319
villagers around them and in this kind of oceanic cycle of gener osity the

168
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:06,200
excess water on this arid Island the only water that came from rain rippled down through their sisters

169
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:11,800
cascaded back into the ocean and what felt like an expression

170
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:17,440
of trust that somehow that moisture that

171
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:24,000
life sustaining fluid water would cycle back to

172
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:30,760
them I find this inspiring to bring in another ocean simile the

173
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:37,079
Buddha likened existence all of our existence to AV void across the

174
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:43,880
ocean the destination the far Shore freedom but much skill is

175
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:49,359
required in the voyage across the ocean as well as a

176
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:56,000
compass compass being nonharming and a guiding North Star

177
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:03,680
where wisdom and nonharming Ming meet together so in a real sense the person

178
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:10,520
on the voyage we don't control the weather or all the conditions of the

179
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:17,160
ocean we do have influence over how we respond and wisdom about what weather

180
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:22,599
patterns to enter into and what directions to take that

181
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:27,640
Voyage is a collaboration with what is

182
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:36,160
in a real sense where we give time attention material goods and especially the

183
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:44,520
actions of our body speech and mind determine the quality of that

184
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:52,480
Voyage so this lens on giving invites

185
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:58,599
discernment it invites choosing to give up ditch the excess weight

186
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:06,160
of unskillful qualities and make room for skillful ones so the Buddha invites us to

187
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:16,400
notice notice the effects of attitudes and actions on your heart on your mind your

188
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,318
practice on that crucial relationship with

189
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,960
yourself what we offer to practice matters even more than the detail of

190
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,640
what's offered how it's offered

191
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:40,839
matters so this is the core of the teaching of giving and for that

192
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:46,800
matter of karmic action and result paying close

193
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,920
attention to the effects on your own heart and mind and life

194
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:59,119
has benefits that's especially true when combined with some of the other

195
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:07,010
qualities we've been exploring this week a benefits of considering the effect

196
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:14,920
[Music] of offering wholehearted

197
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:23,119
attention mindfulness respect appreciation of

198
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:29,720
timelessness and of season all of this begins to reorient to a

199
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:37,760
different very beautiful Compass so how to do

200
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,560
this noticing the effects Moment by moment like the Buddha taught his young

201
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:51,079
son rahula this is a teaching I've given many times Dharma teachers love this teaching he taught his seven-year-old

202
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:56,720
son to notice before during and after an action of

203
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:03,800
bodies speech your mind is this harmful if so stop

204
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:10,680
it or don't do it to begin with OR make amends for it if you notice

205
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:16,040
afterwards and resolve not to do it again is it

206
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:24,720
helpful if so keep doing it and learn from that either way learn

207
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:28,119
from that

208
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:41,839
anything anything we give offer or do affects us first the Buddha offered the

209
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:47,559
simile of hatred or hostility directed outwards being like picking up a hot Cal

210
00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:54,400
to throw it at someone else who does it burn first on the other hand if you're

211
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:03,640
offering kindness beautiful things beautiful attitudes like meta loving kindness that

212
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:08,720
Sublime intention touches This Heart first your

213
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:16,078
mind first so this is transferable

214
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:23,240
wisdom across life and it's also transferable wisdom in choosing what to

215
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:28,760
receive or not there's this story of a person coming coming to the Buddha with a lot

216
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:36,319
of hostility and blame of some kind who knows what and the Buddha ask them if

217
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:44,040
someone shows up at your doorstep and offers you something you don't want do you take it and the person said no and

218
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:49,079
he said just like that I leave your hostility with you I'm

219
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:51,839
not picking it

220
00:43:54,119 --> 00:44:01,200
up I don't have to receive that gift on the other

221
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,880
hand receiving the gift of Dharma offering the gift of Dharma in the

222
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:12,559
Buddhist teachings is considered one of the highest perhaps the

223
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:18,240
highest expression of generosity and to receive that the

224
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:26,160
Buddha advises that to notice assess for yourself the wisdom

225
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:35,319
for you in your own heart and life of whatever is being offered and if it seems helpful to

226
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:42,480
respectfully receive it and do your absolute best to practice with

227
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:50,400
it so these teachings are

228
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,520
offered out of a love and generosity for the

229
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,880
Dharma and the high highest gift that I

230
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:08,000
receive is trusting knowing that you will find what works for you and keep it

231
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,520
set aside the rest and continue to practice sincerely
