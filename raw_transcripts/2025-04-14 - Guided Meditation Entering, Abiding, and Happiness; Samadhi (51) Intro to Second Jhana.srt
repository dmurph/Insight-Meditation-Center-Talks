10
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:33,360
practice and I would like to read to you as we start uh the briefest description

11
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,560
of the third janna the texts say that the ancient

12
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:46,280
practitioners the noble ones described the third janna this

13
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,040
way um equimus and

14
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,079
aware one abides in

15
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:02,360
happiness equomous and aware one abides in

16
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:10,239
happiness the word for aware is sati more commonly translated as mindfulness

17
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,280
so it would be aquamus and

18
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:23,920
mindful one abides in happiness this idea of abiding in happiness

19
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:31,120
so to assume a meditation posture

20
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:40,319
and if you've been sitting regularly in meditation posture maybe the familiarity maybe

21
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,360
there's something about assuming the posture that's a happy thing a comforting

22
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:54,959
thing yes to the to entering into This quiet time for the

23
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,360
body to be still yes

24
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:08,719
to putting aside the responsibilities of the

25
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:17,280
day and to abide in the present moment the simplicity of here and

26
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,640
now with nothing else to do with nothing else to do but

27
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,040
to sit

28
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,360
quietly and to gently close your

29
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:53,400
eyes feeling again anything that feels nice for you with the eyes closed the body

30
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:02,879
still and into that niceness take a few long slow deep

31
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:11,000
breaths breathing in deeply and

32
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,920
exhaling a long exhale

33
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,840
letting go as you exhale

34
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,080
and letting your breathing return to

35
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:08,639
normal and one of the first words associated with Janna is is

36
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:17,800
to enter not to hold yourself apart from your body your

37
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,199
heart not to be in the control tower watching from up there or thinking up

38
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:31,280
there but to enter into like entering into a refle

39
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,600
refreshing ing bath or pool of

40
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,639
water or refreshing grove of

41
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,160
trees so to enter into your

42
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:54,479
body as you exhale lower yourself into your

43
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:01,600
body into the torso all the way down to where your

44
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:08,000
weight is received by whatever is holding you up

45
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,319
from gravity

46
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:26,319
breathing normally but pausing at the end of the

47
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:35,199
exhale not to hold your breath so much but to pause so you can dip deeper in to

48
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:41,240
the body to feel the source that

49
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:49,400
urge to breathe in and to

50
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:54,440
receptively receive the inhale

51
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,919
dipping into the

52
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:17,319
body relaxing on the exhale

53
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,520
softening into whatever feels good in the

54
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:49,280
body softening into the stillness softness

55
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,479
that you find in the body

56
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:20,639
and as you exhale to relax the thinking

57
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:32,198
mind a softening quieting of thinking

58
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:06,959
and every time you relax your thinking mind letting go of your

59
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:17,880
thoughts let go into your body into your body breathing

60
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:53,480
and then as you exhale see if there can be a

61
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,760
resting with the exhale

62
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,160

67
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:07,279

00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,760
sitting not having a bell here

113
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:21,600
so welcome everyone

114
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:27,440
to the next week of our series on

115
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:34,000
samadei and um if you hear in the background all the

116
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:41,279
many birds um I'm sitting meditating outdoors at the

117
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:46,320
lands of spirit rock and um accompanied

118
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:53,480
by the birds and occasionally by the animals that are here and

119
00:30:53,480 --> 00:31:02,240
Um it's nice to be meditating outdoors so this week the topic is the

120
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:08,279
third Janna the third of the three absorptions that the Buddha

121
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:13,480
emphasized and with this happiness comes to the

122
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:19,640
foreground and the word is suka s u k h a and

123
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:25,559
um and perhaps it's uh in when we get into this third genre things get very

124
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:30,919
simple very ordin not ordinary exactly but very simple

125
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:35,960
nothing nothing really special exactly except that it feels so

126
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:43,039
good feels so nice and so still and so quiet there's virtually no thoughts at

127
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:48,880
all certainly no discursive thinking no conversational

128
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:55,480
thinking and um and

129
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:05,360
uh there's one uh wonderful descriptions of all the Janna that uh maybe is a nice entryway

130
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:13,640
into the third Janna um abiding in the Janna in any of the

131
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:18,840
Janna is called the happiness of

132
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:26,640
renunciation the happiness of seclusion the happiness of peace the

133
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:34,080
happiness of awakening i say of this kind of happiness that it

134
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,440
should be practiced cultivated that it should be frequently

135
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:45,640
done that it should not be

136
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:52,039
feared it should not be feared so I don't know how many of you fear

137
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:58,240
happiness and joy but certainly some people fear going

138
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:05,679
into this very deep stillness where for temporarily we're putting aside all the

139
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:13,039
reference points we have for how we live our life uh including any reference point of me

140
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:18,640
myself and mine uh conceit and self- concerns kind of

141
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,080
fall away which for some people is quite frightening

142
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:31,120
um in a certain kind of way um our connection to other people is no longer

143
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,919
salient no longer operating in the moments of being deeply in meditation

144
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:45,200
and for some people that feels like a betrayal or feels not possible in the time of the Buddha I

145
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,399
think the reason why he said this should not be feared is that the renuncient

146
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:58,240
aesthetic traditions of his time uh didn't feared any kind of uh happiness

147
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:05,519
because they thought there was a form of attachment it was a form of keeping you trapped caught in in attachments

148
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:11,280
and the Buddha is saying no there is a happiness which is not a trap that does

149
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:19,200
involve attachment doesn't involve doesn't keep you in the world of clinging and uh this is the happiness

150
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:25,440
that comes from the renunciation from a certain kind of seclusion from peace and

151
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:35,440
certain kind of awakening awakening from clinging with a clear awareness so happiness is the primary

152
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:42,638
characteristic of the third Janna and um in the second Janna there's

153
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:49,919
uh uh joy and happiness and joy as I said last week is

154
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:56,079
a little bit the genesis the source of it is a little bit more uh kind of a

155
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:02,480
mental excitation there's a little bit more thrill or or

156
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,079
big the mind kind of say yes or something and uh it manifests often with

157
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:15,280
the strong sensations in the body energies in the body but uh it's uh it

158
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:21,079
has something to do with the excitement or the activation of the mind in a joyful

159
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:27,599
way and at the same time uh in the second Janna there also is the sweetness

160
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:34,800
of this happiness contentment of this happiness that is deeper more settled

161
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:41,680
more restful more contented and so the the shift from the

162
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:50,800
second Janna to the third is a quieting of the joy the joy fades away is the

163
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:58,480
classic language it um and um and so sometimes

164
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:08,000
for many people just the natural unfolding because as we get more and more settled more present um we're more

165
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,839
we feel safer more content not to be thinking a lot not to be trying a lot

166
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:18,960
not to be trying to make something happen it's enough just to be present

167
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,320
just to be here and there's a movement towards calming that happens it's just a

168
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:33,599
natural movement and at some point there's a calming of this joy and what's left is the happiness

169
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:41,680
this sweet happiness this deep sense of well-being that feels very embodied

170
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:48,480
and um some people uh their their the way to shift from the second Janna to

171
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:55,440
the third is to feel the joy certainly but at some point see if you can

172
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,119
distinguish the happiness that's there from the joy that's there find the more

173
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:08,800
sweeter the more contented the more softer happiness from the more excited

174
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,720
kind of joy find it in your body and then put your attention there rest your

175
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:21,280
attention in that sweeter kind of happiness and maybe even the exhale kind

176
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:28,320
of settle into it rest into it more letting the joy kind of fade away fall

177
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:35,040
away um and uh so some people can kind of kind of it's a way of entering into the

178
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:41,800
third Janna and um and

179
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:48,960
uh and with uh the mind getting very quiet so there's no discursive thoughts

180
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:56,320
there might be knowing there is knowing it might be a nonverbal knowing and um

181
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:02,040
the Buddha describes that in this third Janna there is still

182
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:07,119
sadana which is a poly word that means clear recognition

183
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:12,960
so there is a very simple knowing that simply recognizes what's going on and

184
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,200
that it's good and that doesn't have to involve you know conscious thoughts

185
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:27,440
nonverbal thoughts perhaps but there you know it's really a registered you we know that oh this is this is good this

186
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,560
is happy and uh and because the thinking

187
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,160
mind the the reactive mind the mind has gotten so quiet there's almost no

188
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:44,640
tendency to be reactive to be for and against any experience uh different

189
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,520
things happen if they do and it doesn't rattle the mind doesn't stir up the

190
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:59,720
mind so there's a lot of equinimity in this state and uh and there's a lot of

191
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:07,040
awareness and it's not the mindfulness that is a doing mindfulness it's not a

192
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:14,720
mindfulness that uh involves mental noting or or um uh it is no longer any

193
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:24,119
need to be focusing on uh something um the mind is just very

194
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:31,040
present and in the midst of it there might be breathing very and the breathing has gotten very maybe very

195
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:38,839
subtle now very quiet um and uh and that breathing might be

196
00:39:38,839 --> 00:39:45,839
almost continuous with the happiness and um with that well-being

197
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:51,680
and and it all happens in a real sense of awareness a field of awareness field

198
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:59,240
of openness uh clarity and uh so the classic

199
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:05,119
description is with the fading of joy

200
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:11,000
A practitioner abides at quantamus

201
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,400
aware with clear recognition and experiencing

202
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:27,200
happiness with the body so here now there's four primary factors

203
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,640
uh of the third Janna that are here that they're kind of the

204
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,920
primary characteristic and whether these are really distinct

205
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:46,000
states or whether they're somehow all part of the same that can be kind of you

206
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,520
know like different sides of a diamond i don't know

207
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:58,680
so these four are being a quantumous aware clear

208
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:05,760
recognition and experiencing happiness with the body so here the emphasis so

209
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:12,880
much with the body we're at rest we're at peace with the body um and uh it

210
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:19,200
really feels that for the time we're in the third Janna that we're not anymore

211
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:27,440
in our normal body we're not experiencing the karmic body we're not experiencing the physical

212
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:34,079
body so much that with the aches and pains and all that and um uh these all

213
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:42,000
kind of re that that that body it's almost like we have different bodies to abide in and the state of the mind has a

214
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,480
tremendous amount to say about how we experience the body not that the state of mind is

215
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,760
responsible for the experiences of the body but the state of mind has a lot to

216
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,560
do with how we experience the body and when thinking becomes very very very

217
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:07,640
quiet and still when the mind is very focused very still and

218
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:15,680
centered when um there's very little effort needing to be done to just abide

219
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:25,400
dwell float in the present moment um when uh uh kind of active active

220
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:34,440
energetic joy and energies in the body get really quiet and still at that

221
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:40,560
point the body is experienced very different the body feels very very light

222
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:47,119
almost like it has no weight the body feels very open or transparent as if

223
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:54,960
almost as if there sometimes it's beginning to feel like almost like it's completely translucent or something

224
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:03,280
there's no it's like very clear the body can feel just very cozy and sweet it can

225
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:10,800
feel like it has no boundaries um not so much because there's no boundaries because the mind

226
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,319
is not oriented or constructing or tuning into that sense of boundaries to

227
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:22,560
the body and um very very sweet

228
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:26,760
uh deep very quiet

229
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:35,039
so key factors of the third Janna is the fading of

230
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:42,680
joy equinimity awareness clear

231
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:47,760
recognition and happiness of the body

232
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,680
all of which one abides in one abides in these

233
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:01,839
experiences one rests in them it's almost as if we become them

234
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:09,920
we're one with them we're unified with them so um that's my introduction that's

235
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:17,760
the introduction to the third genre and um we'll go spend

236
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:24,800
the week with this and um maybe there won't be too much to say but to practice

237
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:30,480
with it and we'll see how this goes so thank you and I'll be here at

238
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,960
Spirit Rock for two more days and um back at IMC on

239
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:41,078
Thursday thank you very much
