4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:22,140
[Music] um to engage with [Music] um

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,800
with the practice of equanimity Equanimity equipoise

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,739
which is the fourth Brahma vihara the fourth Heavenly abode

7
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:41,820
practice the the four of the four heart practices the first one being meta

8
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,700
loving kindness second one being Compassion or karuna the third one the

9
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,940
yes the third one being vicarious Joy uh or sympathetic joy muddita and the

10
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,440
fourth one is equanimity and it's it's holds all the other ones

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:09,520
and it's also in some ways could be thought of as the Perfection of the other one so Equanimity is um

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,760
[Music] um this sense of balance equipoise and it

13
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,020
has warmth has care about it so it's not aloof it's not

14
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:26,880
uncaring it's not uh whatever I'm just being a Quantum is that's not Equanimity

15
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,759
that's aloofness that's the nearest neighbor nearest neighbor or near enemy

16
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:41,100
not nears tonight somehow the words are different words are coming in anyways this is interesting uh lots of anata

17
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:48,240
here in the way this mind is working tonight but it's the near enemy uh it's a near enemy

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:57,240
um of mudita so um the aloofness or is a near enemy

19
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:04,140
somehow nearest neighbor from well my years of doing mathematics and computer science is coming in but anyway just

20
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:10,619
laughing at this mind wasn't it fun sometimes to laugh at the impersonality of how our mind works right it's

21
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:18,480
ungovernable sometimes you want to do something or think something and something else happens just anata not

22
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,840
self right there anyway but tonight we're not going to practice not self we're going to practice

23
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:31,500
um Equanimity so so Equanimity so so many different ways to get into this

24
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:37,860
practice of equanimity and and it's a crown jewel really Equanimity

25
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:44,099
is a crown jewel of um Buddhist practice

26
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:50,160
it supports us not just on the cushion in our practice the formal practice but

27
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:57,300
throughout our life as the vicissitudes challenges difficulties

28
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,400
um our Diamond a dozen in this Human Condition so can we be with them with

29
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,120
Equanimity with equipoise not bearing down but just

30
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,060
in the middle of the storm and the eye of the storm having an expanse of

31
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,360
spacious view so so I think that's all I want to say to

32
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,959
set up the framework for tonight and we'll just practice together and find our ways our

33
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,319
a unique way into it tonight so so I'd like to invite you

34
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,920
to get into your meditation posture whatever that might be

35
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,739

36
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:53,540

and letting there be a sense of Integrity in your body

39
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,940
sense of a brightness

40
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,660
letting the spine be upright be held

41
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,660
not pushed up but as if there is a thread

42
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:41,100
the top of your head Invisible Thread holding you up

43
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,759
nor a powerful magnet ah that opens your

44
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:56,960
upper body your torso your chest all opened up with the breath

45

sitting upright

46
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,699
and letting your lower body

47
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:26,120
be well grounded well rooted to the Earth

48
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,419
the upper body opened up

49
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,780
a bright sense of foreign spaciousness opening to the

50
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:01,100
heavens and the lower body connected well rooted to the Earth

51
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:11,780

57
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:21,139
your abdomen your chest expanding with each breath

58
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,280

no need to get rid of it

63
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:21,259
push it away

64
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:30,300
or even attend to it perhaps but just opening to

65
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:38,159
it all you can be here there's so much space space spaciousness

66
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:45,380
ease that this can be here along with everything else for us

67
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:59,940
and if they're fatigue restlessness all of that can be present

68
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:06,080
too doesn't have to take Center Stage

69
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:25,019
as if you're expanding it's imagining imagining that you're expanding your

70
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:30,740
stretching your heart you're stretching your awareness

71
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:40,080
first you're stretching it and then it stretches on its own it keeps going

72
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,100
expanding expanding just like the universe keeps expanding

73
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:51,380
your heart keeps expanding stretching

74
00:09:53,880 --> 00:10:01,140
stretching on its own including everything everything

75
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,320
and there's still more space

76
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:27,660
there can be so much ease in this expansion and yeah pain difficulties emotions can

77
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:33,720
be there sleepiness agitation can all be there

78
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,540
cannot be here there's enough space

79
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,680

80
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:01,700
your heart so expensive spacious

81
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:38,779
when your thoughts are rising plans memories

82
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,680
it's okay it's all right

83
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,940
letting the expansiveness spaciousness hold everything

84
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,639
or letting it drop everything doesn't have to hold

85
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:15,380
if it feels like an effort

86
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:24,120
okay ah I can also drop just drop

87
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,959
release

88
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:37,279
not with aversion

89
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:49,880
but with the wisdom that doesn't need to be held can be released

90
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:58,860
so if you're opening up your hand ah

91
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:02,839
letting it Fly Away

92
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:25,820
and this gesture of the Open Hand Helping Hands

93
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:50,160
being felt in your heart too not just in your hands maybe actually might be helpful to open your hands

94
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,959
as they're resting on your lap I feel into the energy of the open

95
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,220
relaxed resting hands

96
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:09,680
not grasping not pushing away

97
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:14,779
no pin relaxed

98
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:35,360
kneel into the spaciousness of this gesture of the Open Hand

99
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:43,339

100
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,259
you can feel with in this gesture

101
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,220
now imagine your heart

102
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:29,000
also has the gesture of the Open Hands

103
00:17:29,179 --> 00:17:34,220
relaxed not grasping or pushing away

104
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:43,320
things can be Landing resting in the hand and then

105
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:49,260
leaving arising passing away it's like this

106
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:57,080
it's like this and this human realm comings and goings

107
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,659
all the comings and goings

108
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:30,559
interesting maybe even delightful

109
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,340
expansive a sense of care your hand is

110
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:44,960
turned upward so we can hold your heart can hold

111
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:50,900
yet it doesn't grasp hold on to

112
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:08,520
also as the hand has this gesture of openness

113
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:17,660
the fingers there's space between the fingers pings pour through

114
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,900
thoughts memories

115
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:42,860
there's a lightness and the feeling

116
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,320
and letting them pour through fall through it's okay

117
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:03,919
your hand is open for new experiences new knowings

118
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,899
new gifts

119
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:19,519
new blessings and new Sorrows that serve as teachers

120
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:24,679
this gesture of the Open Hand

121
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,620
a heart that has an open hand

122
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,320
it's also just a gesture of generosity

123
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,700
generosity with life

124
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,000
experiencing knowing giving

125
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:57,360
not grasping can we relate

126
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:04,980
to Equanimity in this practice today as the gesture of an open hand open

127
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:10,340
heart in this way

128
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:48,360
maybe just to get a sense of it close your hands feel the fist forming

129
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,059
on your lap feeling to how that is different let

130
00:21:54,059 --> 00:22:00,179
your heart feel how this is different different stance

131
00:22:00,179 --> 00:22:07,700
in life a closed fist

132
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:19,460
and open whenever you're ready you've got a sense of it

133
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:24,500
Open Hands resting on your lap

134
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,658
your heart

135
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,020

136
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:06,320

137
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:11,120

of the Open Hands in your heart with each breath

143
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:49,799
the gesture of equanimity sitting grounded

144
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:57,480
upright like a mountain stable

145
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:04,020

feel the embodiment

152
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:55,220
it's not an idea of equanimity

153
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:01,158
it's an embodied experience

154
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,820

155
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:20,960

Even If you experience it for a moment with respect to something here

164
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:21,860
something opens up in your mind in your heart a possibility

165
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:27,899
for different relationship to life

166
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:34,140

169
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:55,799
fake it until you become it sitting

170
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:00,980
feeling your body on the earth connected

171
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:08,599
rooted upright open heart open hands

172
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:17,598
expansive spacious the breath inside outside all around

173
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:39,780
you might even visualize stories like a little bird like a butterfly

174
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:45,020
Landing in your hand open hand and then flying away

175
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:55,700
not reacting comes and goes

176
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:05,540
you sit you are breathed spacious stable

177
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:14,720
nowhere kind here

178
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:49,820
and as we bring this practice period to a close

179
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:56,900
may we embody Equanimity for ourselves

180
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:04,279
for others the benefit all beings everywhere

181
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:13,079
may all beings everywhere including ourselves

182
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:19,339
be stable no true

183
00:36:19,339 --> 00:36:24,780
equipoise with presence and care not turning away

184
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:30,420
not closing the hand may all beings everywhere be free

185
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,500
including ourselves

186
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:52,619
[Music] it's everyone

187
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:55,880
thanks for your practice

188
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:04,920
so we have some time for Reflections for questions comments

189
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:11,040
about this practice Equanimity in this particular way of feeling into it and

190
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:18,359
and today I was inviting us to feel into the embodiment of equanimity with the

191
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:26,040
gesture of sitting connected to the Earth really feeling or stability sitting tall like a mountain it's a

192
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:31,380
gesture of equanimity with open hands open your hands and open heart really

193
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:37,560
feeling into that it's not a closed fist it's not the one that grasps objects uh

194
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:43,200
it's not one that pushes away or throws away it's one that's open it can land it

195
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,020
can go pour through there's a sense of openness of the heart and stability

196
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:54,119
so that's the invitation I was making for us to feel into Equanimity not at

197
00:37:54,119 --> 00:38:01,020
night not like an idea like what is equanimity this word I can never get like what do they even mean

198
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:06,060
feel into it what does it feel like what does it feel like

199
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:13,320
that was the invitation I was hoping that maybe even for a split second something connected in a different way

200
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:21,960
than that maybe opens something up for your possibility in your life in your practice so

201
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:28,740
that was my hope intention and would love to hear how it was for you

202
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:34,980
many insights experiences what worked what didn't work for the benefit of yourself

203
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:40,740
benefit of the Sangha you can raise your Zoom hand you can type in chat puzzle

204
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:47,280
please hi just uh when you said to the Equanimity that just kind of hit that

205
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:54,119
was pretty neat it's like oh wait just wait it changed a little bit it was it was

206
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:59,579
neat thank you nice thank you for reflecting them back to be equivalent I

207
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:07,859
love it great thanks for highlighting that puzzle I'm glad something shifted for you yay and try that try that

208
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:13,800
since it hits in a particular way it you can

209
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:21,420
drop that in right you can drop that in in your daily life practice I'll be Equanimity oh yeah I

210
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:30,260
know what that feels like my body knows like it's not so much a heady thing be Equanimity beautiful thanks muzzle

211
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:38,119
any other Reflections you can also type in chat red

212
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:43,800
thanks Nikki the contrast between the open hand and

213
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:50,820
the clenched fist was really striking to me I if I was less aware of equanimous

214
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:59,339
feelings throughout the meditation I could tell from the uh the sharp contrast of being

215
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:06,300
in the defensive position with fists closed that this was not Equanimity and

216
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:14,640
better better to return to the open hand beautiful great thank you so much for

217
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:20,880
reflecting that yeah that's great thank you for the reflection Fred this this um

218
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,579
contrast because like yeah it feels different in in our bodies

219
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:31,700
um this and this and and um

220
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:39,119
it's there's a lot of science too um our mind States

221
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:46,800
and um and our physical States in fact a lot of metaphors and a lot of our mind

222
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:53,220
States the words that we use in language come from our physical gestures so so

223
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:59,280
it's important to to um yeah to to take advantage of what we

224
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:04,440
already have to make these knowings more more

225
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:11,339
clear distinct by using these uh these gestures and some um Michelle I think

226
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:18,859
you're trying to raise your hand yes and and Dan will go to you afterwards Michelle please

227
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:28,560
um as I open to this tremendous fear that I was feeling

228
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:35,000
um the more I open to the fear the more Equanimity I felt

229
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:42,540
does that make sense absolutely it makes sense Michelle yeah

230
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:49,740
yeah how interesting right now interesting the more you open to

231
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:59,460
fear the more Equanimity you felt yeah feel into the profundity of that

232
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:07,380
that's a profound insight because the more we close up to fear the

233
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:13,920
more we're afraid of fear uh the more the bigger it feels and the more we open

234
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:21,660
up to it okay I'm not scared here come oh wow there's more Equanimity look at

235
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:27,000
that it's so counterintuitive and yet that's it

236
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:34,819
beautiful thanks for sharing that Michelle

237
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:40,079
beautiful ah

238
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:45,599
Jerry says it felt like a brief moment of openness to a blend of the loving

239
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:53,040
kindness compassion and joy yep great Dan I see you please

240
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,500
yes um um I I thought I had the explanation

241
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:04,260
damn very well as you gave it and it was a very good session

242
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:11,460
but just for the heck of my life I'm I'm got this on my phone but I have my computer here so I typed in equity

243
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:18,960
and I looked at that and was talking a calmness composure even the September

244
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,800
especially in a difficult situation and I was thinking and you talked about

245
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:31,740
you know uh disturbances or or being upset and things which was very useful

246
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:36,960
as a bit of a contrast but there's no threat while sitting here

247
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,540
and a couple hours ago I was crossing the street here in New York City and

248
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:49,440
years ago it used to be worth your life crossing a street in New York the traffic was very aggressive especially

249
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:55,859
the cab drivers they would come right through an intersection and it was almost worth your life crossing the

250
00:43:55,859 --> 00:44:03,780
street so almost through without exception if you're in a crosswalk even a quarter of

251
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:12,119
the way across the street someone coming the other way will stop they'll let you go okay and come so I'm crossing the

252
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:18,839
street and I'm about here for your cross and the guy is coming quite quickly into

253
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:24,060
the intersection and I can tell by his speed and the Kangal it was real he's

254
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:31,200
just gonna go he's not gonna stop and it occurred to me to slow my Pace to

255
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:37,980
be sure he had a left enough room I didn't I just kept walking I'm a big

256
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:45,240
guy I have a very big mouth good commit command voice and I got really close to

257
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:51,180
the car not to endanger myself and that I was I knew I was going to yell at him

258
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:56,460
even though in a sense I knew it was a bad idea and I wished not to do it and

259
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:03,839
the phrase no good can come of this went through went through my mind right and I

260
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:11,880
thought how the heck with it I'm just going to yell got it okay oh I didn't curse I didn't do anything or but he had

261
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:18,540
his window all the way down and I was grateful for that I think I'm getting I think I'm getting the picture then yeah

262
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:25,260
and for the benefit of time I think I get the picture and your question is okay that's a stressful situation oh no

263
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:31,619
all I did was yell hey and as soon as I did that I read I

264
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:38,640
regretted it and wish I had said nothing at all yeah so so here's what I would say I

265
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:44,760
appreciate you bringing that in and and here's so the the question basically is you're asking okay here I'm sitting I'm

266
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:49,980
practicing there's no threat uh I'm feeling pretty calm and I'm practicing

267
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:55,079
this Equanimity thing and yet there on the street is where I really wanted it

268
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:01,140
uh well that's where I wish I had it great fantastic I'm so glad you're bringing this up like what does this

269
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:06,240
have to do with the price of tomatoes because that's what I wanted I'm here I'm doing nothing well this is the

270
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:12,380
practice we practice it it's like going to the gym with small weights so that

271
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:17,460
and it's it's the same thing with the loving kindness we we cultivate it so

272
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:24,300
that when when the 100 pound weight is present like oh I know how to do this I've been

273
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:30,240
practicing I've been practicing my heart I've been practicing in my mind for those States When the Thought comes like

274
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:37,020
okay there's no good to come out of this yes I could be equanimous etc etc so this is exactly why we do this practice

275
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:43,920
this it's what that's why it's called practice we're practicing because there

276
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,500
are a lot of performances in the world when we're crossing the street um

277
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:56,460
etc etc etc when somebody I don't sends us a text message or calls us Etc so so yeah

278
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:03,540
so thank you for those Reflections everyone so I'd like to invite us to engage in uh

279
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:08,819
small groups small practice groups I'm going to create them now and uh the

280
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:15,420
breakout groups are roughly size three and the invitation is to share a little

281
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:20,700
bit um anything you'd like to share about tonight's practice about the sense of

282
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:29,520
embodiment if there's something new for you something that arose and you can also hold uh presence uh quiet silence

283
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:35,040
off of you silence they pass off for one nugget from your own experience allow

284
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:41,220
the next person to offer their nugget or experience and the next person again

285
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:47,339
speak from your ex personal experience not from your head but embodiment let's

286
00:47:47,339 --> 00:47:52,980
really bring in embodiment not advising or directing other people's experience

287
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:58,079
be kind take care of yourself take care of each other and

288
