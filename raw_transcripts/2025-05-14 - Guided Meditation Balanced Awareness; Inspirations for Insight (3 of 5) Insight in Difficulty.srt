1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:07,440
and this morning um we're going to meditate together before we start um if

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,400
you take a moment to either silently reflect on or share somehow what you noticed in your

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,840
practice yesterday anything at all related to the

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:27,640
themes of connecting with wisdom with

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,640
abundance

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,800
kindness relating to the moment

7
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,840
And when you're ready taking your seat whatever posture you're

8
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,200
in settling in to your space for

9
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:28,798
meditation perhaps taking a moment to look around or listen to the

10
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:36,640
soundsscape allow a small smile or sense of connection with

11
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,520
yourself with your body

12
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,920
beginning to allow the attention to move

13
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,119
inward noticing the sounds around

14
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:12,319
you the silence between the sounds

15
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,440
noticing the warmth or cool of the

16
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:41,080
body the weight of your body on the chair or cushion or mat

17
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,920
and connecting the [Music] tuning with the internal world of this

18
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:13,800
body all the little sensations of aliveness

19
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,120
scanning through your

20
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:50,400
body maybe a gentle sweep of the attention from the head to the

21
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:57,920
feet inviting the eyes to relax in their

22
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:06,120
sockets the area between the eyes and the brow and behind the eyes and the

23
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,159
head to soften and spread

24
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,519
eyes closed but perhaps as if taking in a broad

25
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,400
vista allowing the tongue to soften

26
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,720
and sweeping the attention down through the neck and

27
00:04:53,320 --> 00:05:00,280
chest noticing the sensations of the body breathing

28
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,400
allowing the mind to be soothed the heart to

29
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:27,240
rest in a gentle rhythm of in and out breath

30
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,360
allowing the whole core of your body to

31
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:58,680
relax softening the hips and buttocks thighs and hamstrings

32
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:24,400
noticing softening the shins and calves ankles and

33
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:35,720
feet and taking in the integrity of the whole body

34
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,560
allowing awareness to fill

35
00:06:54,199 --> 00:07:01,560
it and settling onto each inb breath and outreath or whatever anchor of

36
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:09,440
attention object of attention feels most imbalanced

37
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,360
in connection today

38
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,240
if the mind the attention is pulled

39
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:52,720
away by thoughts images wants or aversions

40
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,600
gently staying in your

41
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,320
seat returning to mindfulness

42
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,560
awareness noticing any leaning towards or leaning

43
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:21,160
away and when it's possible returning to simple

44
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,160
balanced awareness

45
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:59,000
if the mind becomes entranced seeing how

46
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,040
graciously appreciatively it's possible to

47
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:10,920
welcome the return of mindful awareness

48
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,960
in the last few minutes of our meditation

49
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:41,840
together the invitation is to open

50
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:49,919
up your awareness to know the

51
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:57,840
knowing include the quality of mindfulness itself in the

52
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:07,559
knowing take a step back open the lens of awareness

53
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:24,799
allowing everything that's known just to flow

54
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,840
through allowing your heart your mind

55
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,559
to be

56
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:59,720
bright nourished by the knowing itself

57
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,559
and then as we draw this meditation to a

58
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:45,480

71
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,000
so sa today we continue the series on inspirations for

72
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:50,559
insight stories and wisdom from the myths and stories of the Buddha's life

73
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:56,720
and others around him but before I start I'd like to make an announcement which

74
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,640
is um that the Sati Center for Buddhist Studies

75
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,440
many of you know this organization kind of a sister organization to

76
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:15,279
IMC they are um they've opened their applications for the Buddhist chapency

77
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:20,720
training program about a week ago and um there are two versions of this program

78
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,080
there's an in-person version with Gil and two other teachers and an online

79
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,279
version with myself and two other teachers both are wonderful i went

80
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:37,120
through the first and now teach the second um so for your consideration if

81
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:43,279
you're looking for a way to bring your practice into a um deepen it in an

82
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,519
engaged way a way that helps

83
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:59,120
others so I'd like to sto start today's um talk

84
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,320
today's inspiration for um insight

85
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,360
with a story so um that

86
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:16,440
story is the night the very night of the Buddha's enlightenment

87
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:22,399
awakening and um some of you were here last yesterday and heard the kind of

88
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:27,760
pre-story of him receiving nourishment and kindness and deciding on the middle

89
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,360
way and then he made the determination strong determination that he was going

90
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:40,559
to sit under the bodhic tree until he awoke and so off he went and he did and it's

91
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:45,720
kind of the culmination of his hero's journey from a mythic

92
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,640
perspective he's sitting and as he's

93
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:57,519
sitting Mara the um mythic figure the namesake

94
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:04,559
literally means death who symbolizes the life denying forces mara comes and

95
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:11,600
brings his armies it said brings every force to bear sense desire ill will

96
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:18,640
horrific visions of all kinds and the Buddha observes this play

97
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,159
of just intense arising of these images and

98
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:32,240
of the hostility and of the desire unmoved

99
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,960
so Mara then shoots his army shoots volleys and volleys of arrows at the

100
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:43,679
Buddha and in this myth they're converted to showers of flowers raining

101
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,919
down on him instead of piercing him offering this sort of beautiful

102
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:54,679
fragrance that's associated in the ancient texts with

103
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:59,840
virtue and then finally Mara is not getting anywhere with all of this so he

104
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:08,240
taunts the Buddha with one last kind of attempt to undermine his

105
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:16,000
practice his awakening and he says "Who are you to wake up who are you?" He

106
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,720
taunts him with doubt and it's said that in

107
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:26,919
response the Buddha touches the earth beneath

108
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:34,320
him and in some versions of this story the earth shakes in response i think of

109
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:41,079
this as as earth as my witness and then when he

110
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:47,118
awoke he awoke completely it said that it's the end of ignorance and this is

111
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:53,520
canonical here freedom from all forms of suffering and a knowledge of the karmic

112
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,640
effects of actions of living beings action and result where people how

113
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:07,040
people are impacted by their own actions after his awakening the Buddha

114
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:13,200
went to another tree and it said rested under it stared at it for a full seven

115
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:18,320
days enjoying the bliss of samadei and

116
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:25,680
freedom so powerful evocative myth right it's the culmination of this hero's

117
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,760
journey an embodiment of courage

118
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:37,480
determination restraint and a peaceful victory you'll notice there was no

119
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:43,160
combat but instead he stayed in his

120
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:49,359
seat so that's the story and

121
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:57,440
um want to invite you to take whatever feels inspiring in it to you into your

122
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:04,640
heart and mind i'll offer a few reflections in the next few minutes of some wisdom I found it holds for

123
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:11,560
approaching the experience of insight one lesson I take from this is that the

124
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:17,920
mind can experience insight the heart can experience freedom even when the

125
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,079
most difficult kinds of memories or images or

126
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:31,040
hindrances are present in fact that can be the moment of very strong insight

127
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:38,480
i've seen this in people I support and I've seen it in my own practice as well

128
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,400
as we covered yesterday the exact same experience can be challenging and

129
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:56,720
difficult can be distracting or discouraging or it can be a penetrating insight

130
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:04,040
the difference lies in how we relate to experience and what mental

131
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:09,359
faculties are implied here so I talked a lot yesterday about how we relate to

132
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:16,640
experience and that will be a little bit in this talk as well but first I'll kind of focus a little bit

133
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:23,520
more on the faculties of mind so the first things that you notice in

134
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:28,560
these mind in his mind in this story is

135
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:36,160
that if we kind of depersonify Mara and his attack all of the mental hindrances

136
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:43,119
are t that are talked about in the Buddhist teachings are present sexual or sensual desire which is by definition a

137
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:50,800
lifegiving force here is utilized as a distraction and then there are these

138
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:59,320
horrific visions ill will of being shot at and fear of all

139
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:07,280
kinds the Buddha meets these rather than becoming entranced by desire or pulling

140
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,880
away or pushing away in fear or disgust or horror he holds his

141
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:22,240
seat even though all hell was breaking loose he stayed present he didn't give in he

142
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:30,040
didn't give up but he also he didn't actively engage in fighting there was a

143
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:36,320
non-contention present in other words if we consider the Buddha

144
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:43,400
in this story as our inner capacity potentiality for awakening awakened

145
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,720
awareness which is on a continuum with simple

146
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:56,320
mindfulness he was mindful simply present and that kind of simple presence

147
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:05,760
of mindfulness not leaning towards or away is a powerful support for

148
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:13,520
insight and what supports the capacity of this mindful awareness

149
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:20,200
what we do each time we sit noticing it attending to

150
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:25,880
it appreciating it not being critical when it's

151
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,640
gone and sometimes reflecting after meditation what

152
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:39,280
conditions you might put in to help it arise more often how much interest might

153
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,960
be able to be brought to bear to help the mindfulness be more continuous more

154
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:52,800
steady more balanced mindfulness too awareness too

155
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:59,200
is conditioned and appreciation helps it to arise more and

156
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:05,119
more often so now we come to this image of the

157
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:11,480
army's volley after volley after volley of arrows transformed into

158
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:20,440
flowers the way an aware wise heart and mind can metabolize difficulties into

159
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:25,560
wisdom so what might this look like there are different

160
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:32,720
ways i'll offer a few most of you probably know the simile of

161
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:39,920
the second arrow get hit by a first arrow those are the slings and arrows of life it hurts there's pain there's grief

162
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:48,240
there's loss there's the arising of things we don't want on a personal familial or societal level that's the

163
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:54,079
first arrow the second arrow is all of the ways our minds and hearts make

164
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:01,040
things worse when wisdom is present it's possible to

165
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,880
see the arrows the many ways the mind can make things worse as conditioned

166
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,920
processes of this mind and this

167
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:18,400
heart in other words while in some ways life's difficulties might feel and be

168
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:25,280
intensely deeply personal on another level what we experience inside is not

169
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,319
personal its universal qualities tendencies of heart and

170
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:38,520
mind so instead of taking things personally it becomes possible to

171
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,720
connect with this process and with the flip side of

172
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:49,480
wisdom compassion care

173
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:57,240
just like me everyone suffers sometimes that compassion recognizes the

174
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:04,240
universal human experience so in short rather than being wounded by

175
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:11,400
the arrows of the life denying forces of the mind seeing into them with clear

176
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:20,359
mindfulness how they're formed how they're conditioned how they're common among humans and other beings too

177
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:26,200
some this perspective this capacity can transform

178
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:31,000
difficulties into inner beauty

179
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:39,680
flowers and as we draw to the close of sort of unpacking this story just as it

180
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:45,119
was for the Buddha in this story doubt tends to be the most difficult hindrance

181
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:51,839
for people who are you who am I to

182
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:58,680
experience bliss who am I to experience a moment of insight

183
00:42:59,319 --> 00:43:04,880
mara a classic way in the um stories and

184
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:11,359
teachings of the Buddha is to simply say "I see you Mara i see you." To look

185
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:17,160
doubt in the eye and doubt the doubt

186
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,480
there's also the power of being grounded in your own

187
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:29,359
seat your own place on earth touching the

188
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:36,920
earth there's a simplicity and an integrity in us being part of

189
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:43,400
nature we are nature everything that unfolds in our minds and hearts is part

190
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:51,880
of natural processes interacting there's honor in that

191
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:59,359
so to review factors of mind that are helpful at the moment of insight and

192
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:05,040
difficulty are recognition of a strong simple mindful awareness that doesn't

193
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:11,839
lean towards or away not entangled recognizing that what arises is based on

194
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:17,680
conditioning nature and rather than reacting with blame or shame and even if blame or

195
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:23,920
shame are present to bring compassion clear seeing to the process of what's

196
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,920
happening

197
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:37,200
so in other words the way our minds and hearts metabolize or relate to anything

198
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:43,800
in our inner lives can transform how it lives in us the very same

199
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:52,000
experience can result in protracted difficulty or in profound inner growth

200
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,160
sometimes both first one and then the

201
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:02,319
growth so friends please stay grounded in your

202
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:08,240
own place on this earth these next 24 hours if you're walking you're earth

203
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,760
walking if you're sitting earth sitting and notice for your homework

204
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,920
your assignment should you want to accept it where are there moments of mindfulness

205
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:30,280
awareness where you're not leaning in or leaning away thank you for your kind attention
