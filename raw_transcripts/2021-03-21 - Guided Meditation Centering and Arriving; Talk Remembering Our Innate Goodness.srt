and i will be guiding you in the meditation and and offer a few

15
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:49,280
reflections today so at this time i invite you to

16
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:57,200
come into a comfortable posture one that suits your unique frame

17
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,840
and needs of your body

18
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,239
disregard any notion of

19
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,200
the posture that you feel you should have

20
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,560
and allow yourself to be a student of the body

21
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,560
and for it to inform what will bring you ease

22
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:43,840
for when the body is at ease the mind is better able to settle

23
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:51,040
i invite you now to sense into the parts of your body

24
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,840
that create the foundation of your posture

25
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:05,039
the touch points of the earth where you connect perhaps the soles of

26
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:11,840
the feet on the back of the thighs and butter

27
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,400
or if you're in a laying posture if that is what suits your body

28
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,840
the whole of the backside

29
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,360
take these initial moments now to feel into the connection

30
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,320
your connection to the earth

31
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:52,320
earth resting on earth

32
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,840
and since the energetic exchange

33
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:10,000
you may choose to take in a few deep breaths if that's available to you

34
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:21,840
and slowly exhale out anything that's not needed in this moment

35
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:41,199
and i invite you to slowly scan the body

36
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,840
from your foundation the soles of the

37
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,120
feet your seat upward

38
00:06:53,199 --> 00:07:00,720
with kind attention to release any tension

39
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:08,880
or holding that you may encounter breathing spaciousness there

40
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,840
and take your time

41
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:36,000
and when you feel complete in offering the deepest peace

42
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:42,240
to your body heart mind

43
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:53,919
allow yourself to bring your awareness to your anchor whatever it may be

44
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:13,840
the breath sound touch

45
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:27,840
and his thoughts arise do not push them away in aversion or judgment

46
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,520
simply allow the witness in you to notice

47
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,839
the arising and passing away

48
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:52,839
and at that moment at that very second that you

49
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:59,839
recognize thoughts have arisen or that you may

50
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:07,200
even be caught in thought celebrate that moment turn your full

51
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,399
attention to that second

52
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,720
for it is the time that mindfulness has returned

53
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,880
offer your full awareness to mindfulness

54
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:51,839
the invitation now is to continue to practice in this way

55
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,200
should there be recurring thoughts

56
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,200
difficult thoughts

57
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,200
turn your attention there

58
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,639
notice the quality

59
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,840
offer it your kind attention

60
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:15,360
and release it back to your anchor

61
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:22,320
knowing that that recognition of his presence

62
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:29,840
is the moment mindfulness has returned

100
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:42,640
as we come together today i'd like to take a moment to acknowledge

101
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:48,640
the land where we are and the indigenous the indigenous people who live

102
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:55,440
on this land i acknowledge that i am on traditional

103
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:02,319
unseated land of the first people of oakland the lausanne ohlone people both

104
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:09,040
past and present who speak the church in your language

105
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,319
i'd also like to offer a lineage acknowledgement of our practice of

106
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:22,160
buddhism which is an asian heritage and tradition

107
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:28,400
a tribute attributed and and and it comes to us

108
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,760
through 500 years of written language

109
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:42,000
of unwritten language and was recorded in sanskrit and pali before other

110
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,920
language translations and let it be acknowledged that these

111
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,760
practices were preserved nurtured and handed down for millennia

112
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:59,599
before reaching western shores and western languages

113
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,640
that in many ways the people and cultures of origin

114
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:11,440
can and in many instances have been erased in much the same way

115
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:18,880
that the people who originally inhabited inhabited these lands have been

116
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:28,319
erased so let us remember our ancestors

117
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:35,280
and the ancestors of this land who survived pandemics

118
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:41,920
the destruction of their known world and their ways of living

119
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,079
may we hold their names dearly in our hearts and minds

120
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:55,440
and may this acknowledgement serve as a reminder of our inextricable connection to the practices

121
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,640
we share and the places we inhabit

122
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,920
as well as a reminder of our connection to the earth

123
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,240
across species and across time

124
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:22,400
before i go into the talk i'd like to share with you an excerpt from a public notice sent

125
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:31,280
from the east bay meditation center in regards to the rash of violence against asian and american

126
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:35,599
asian pacific islander communities

127
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:46,319
the east bay meditation center expresses our collective grief

128
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:52,400
an outrage at the ongoing violent targeting of asian and

129
00:45:52,400 --> 00:46:01,839
asian americans and in the wake of the most recent tragic attack in atlanta

130
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:10,560
we stand in solidarity with asian and asian americans in beloved community

131
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:16,480
these violent acts of hatred are arising due to the current and

132
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:22,240
historical oppression of asian americans in the u.s

133
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:29,560
they are the direct result of our nation's deep roots in white supremacy

134
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,839
imperialism and xenophobia

135
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:44,160
i'd like to invite you all to participate in a moment of silence

136
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:52,960
as i recite the names of the beings whose lives have been senselessly taken during the atlanta

137
00:46:52,960 --> 00:47:00,160
mass murdering spree which happened just on tuesday

138
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:10,000
you may choose to place your hand over your heart or slide the eyes closed

139
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,240
or simply just be present

00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:50,319
and those whose names i do not know names that have not been spoken

144
00:47:50,319 --> 00:48:07,839
or names that have been forgotten

145
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:21,839
[Music] uh

146
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:31,520
and even in the midst of all this it's so important

147
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:39,920
to focus and bring to mind the beautiful qualities that exist in our lives

148
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:47,200
and it's a pleasure to be here with you today and to share my experience of the dharma

149
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:53,280
on this first day of spring it's a day of great significance as a

150
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:59,040
time of birth and rebirth of renewal and awakening

151
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:06,079
with hope may may it mark the dawning of a new day that follows a difficult period of

152
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:11,599
isolation massive death and deep

153
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:19,119
internal grief we've been living in a difficult time of disease and

154
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:26,400
hatred living in a triple pandemic really on many levels

155
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:32,319
the most obvious is the coronavirus that has plagued the earth with a cloak of

156
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:38,400
illness and death the more disguised virus of white

157
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:43,599
supremacy that has infected the infrastructure of systems

158
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:51,760
and institutions all around the world with hatred of difference and the loathing

159
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:59,760
for the natural diversity of life itself and a third pandemic of

160
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:06,240
untruths lacking why speech

161
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:14,400
a blatant spreading of deceptions that have blinded and wrecked a scourge

162
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:20,720
of mass confusion and metastasized delusion for so

163
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:29,440
very many we've been living in a time of massive individual and communal grief

164
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:39,119
and what is fortunate is that the dharma is immensely vast and far-reaching

165
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:46,400
that it touches into every aspect of our lives the scene and the unseen acknowledging

166
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:52,160
the known the unknown and the unknowable

167
00:50:52,960 --> 00:51:00,000
there are many paths to enter the dharma some resonate sweetly within our hearts

168
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,519
and others present difficult challenges to overcome

169
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:11,920
the undoing of our harmful conditioning

170
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:20,559
you know life has always been hard to pin down but lately the reality that we are not

171
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:24,960
in control of our lives our futures

172
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:32,880
our circumstances has been even more apparent

173
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:40,960
right now we're living in a liminal realm a transitional groundless place

174
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:50,960
here nothing is certain we're at the threshold of an unknown

175
00:51:50,960 --> 00:52:00,000
the threshold of an unknown this invisible cloak of delusion

176
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:09,760
the delusion of predictability it's been pulled back to reveal the truth of uncertainty our

177
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:15,200
lives today have brought into the open the instantaneous

178
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:19,838
passing of each moment

179
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:27,119
and this truth has been there all along yet these current circumstances have

180
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:34,319
forced an entire world to not only face but to embody

181
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:43,920
the truth of the moment-to-moment change in every breath of our unpredictable

182
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:50,480
lives the buddha states that every life

183
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:56,720
is marked by three characteristics of existence

184
00:52:58,839 --> 00:53:06,240
impermanence anichah the pali word

185
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:11,280
suffering or dissatisfaction dukkha

186
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:20,319
and egolessness sometimes referred to as not self anata

187
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:29,838
our intuitive understanding and somewhat forced embodiment

188
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:36,319
of a nietzsche impermanence is the characteristic that opens the

189
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:41,760
door to our release from attachments which is the true

190
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:49,040
source of personal internal liberation from suffering

191
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:57,040
to release to let go

192
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:04,319
to settle to feel into the emptiness

193
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:11,359
of this existence and as the truth of the unreliability

194
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:17,119
of life continues to unfold we can choose to embrace tremendous

195
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:22,960
suffering by clinging on to old habits and familiar comforts

196
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:31,040
or we can welcome the stillness within us that holds the power of awakening

197
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:36,960
intellectually we know that nothing in this life

198
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:42,400
in this world will last forever and that the longer we live we will

199
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:50,400
certainly see everything that we have come to know and love wither die

200
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,119
vanish into the intangible

201
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:02,720
however true understanding of impermanence is non-cognizable

202
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:09,839
we can only know the truth of it in the unnamable experiential terrain of our

203
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:15,040
bodies where there is a resonance of memory

204
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:21,839
that is a part of our very being

205
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,359
sati to remember

206
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:38,400
to remember it's there within us you know the ancestors are not out there

207
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:48,400
somewhere those who have come before us they live within us

208
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:53,760
they move through our bloodstream they're in the marrow of our bones

209
00:55:53,760 --> 00:56:00,319
the chain of dna in our bodies that gets passed on from generation to generation the

210
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,839
memories are there

211
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:15,680
not only of experience of loves and hurts and pains and traumas

212
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:23,119
but the memory of what we are it is there

213
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:30,480
but these these memories are easily forgotten because we live in and are conditioned by a culture of

214
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:39,520
memory loss and dwell in the immediate gratification of short-term memory and distraction

215
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:46,880
we move about barely present to the moment enchanted by a a world of rapid

216
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:54,720
information bites the media technology and corporate

217
00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:00,240
marketing schemes that create a culture of attention

218
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:06,000
deficit beings and now that the wheels have all but

219
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,040
grind it to a stop we are even more susceptible to the

220
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:19,359
enticements of distraction being out of our comfort zone

221
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:27,359
being able to move about in the ways that we've always moved

222
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:33,839
the deep insight necessary to cultivate an easeful and fulfilled life in the

223
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:39,280
midst of chaos and horror and the enchantments of delusion

224
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:44,400
arise when the mind is still silent

225
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:50,160
and unencumbered aware

226
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,280
it's quiet you that allows us to see the trappings that lead to our own

227
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:02,480
destruction it is stillness that throws open the doors to our

228
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:12,079
discerning internal wisdom a wisdom that is unempirical and immaterial

229
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:21,280
unquantifiable when the loud noise of want and desire

230
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,319
and dislike have been quieted the unspoken wisdom

231
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:33,440
contained in the deepest recesses of the body arises the wisdom of ancient knowing the wisdom

232
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,799
of all that has gone before us the wisdom held in the whispering earth

233
00:58:38,799 --> 00:58:44,480
all become available to the conscious mind

234
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:50,400
this is a wisdom that reminds us remembers to us

235
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:58,240
that we are all a web of connection that is unseen and unbroken

236
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:04,640
that there's really no space between us that we are part of the space the

237
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:12,319
air the void that we are the pause

238
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:22,160
this is a time for remembering what it is that we have forgotten

239
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:28,960
connecting with the memory contained within the body

240
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:37,200
mindfulness of the body is no accident the first door to awakening

241
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,920
the first of the foundations of mindfulness

242
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:53,040
our cultural default is wired to do too many things move too fast take on too many projects

243
00:59:53,040 --> 01:00:00,000
and juggle too many jobs in our endless efforts to make ends meet or to acquire

244
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:07,200
the things that we have been told and conditioned we need for a fulfilled life

245
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:15,680
and accompanying this normalized way of life are deeply seated feelings of overwhelm

246
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:22,079
overload fatigue sleep deprivation

247
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:29,040
these are all systems and mental states that keep us from remembering

248
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:36,799
that we are sacred in our very flesh that we are light beings of infinite

249
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:42,160
energy living forth just a brief

250
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:50,000
whisper of a moment on this material plane

251
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:59,200
that we are interconnected to all around us both animate and

252
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:06,319
what is seemingly inanimate i read just the other day that

253
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:13,599
it's been noticed that trees have a heartbeat

254
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:22,240
so spaced out that it's not hardly at all perceptible

255
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:31,040
everything we touch vibrates with the energetic charge of life the same charge of life that is apparent

256
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:36,480
in our senses when we allow the mind to settle and be

257
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,838
with what is

258
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:46,720
constantly juggling the balls where do we find the time to reflect

259
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:51,760
upon the moment when do we stop to take in the effects

260
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:59,839
of that incident that arose today yesterday on tuesday

261
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:07,680
and before that where do we tuck away the horror story

262
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:13,200
that we witnessed or the daily infractions that got stuffed down

263
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:20,079
packed on top of the other the other the other unresolved stories now

264
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:25,839
absorbed in the body awaiting their time when attention will be turned in that

265
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:31,200
direction you know living like this is to

266
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:38,559
constantly stub the toe and not take the time to attend to it

267
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:49,839
in the rush of getting to the next task

268
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:57,119
today in the quiet of our homes for those of us who have homes

269
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:02,480
we get to turn over this rock where the slippery lizard of privilege

270
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:08,640
remains hidden from sight you know lately we've heard a lot about

271
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:13,920
white privilege but privilege is not only white

272
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:20,000
each one of us has a degree of privilege that others do

273
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:27,000
not have if we are listening the current

274
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,480
circumstances can help us tremendously to bring our

275
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,520
awareness to where we fall on that scale

276
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:44,079
where do we stand when placed amongst those who experience these circumstances these dire

277
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:50,160
circumstances as a continuation of the threat of death that has always

278
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:59,838
been there

279
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:10,000
you know before the pandemic hit i said oh good goodness

280
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:20,559
there are more and larger tint cities everywhere all over the place

281
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:29,520
as i turned the key to come into my home that i've made

282
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:36,400
comfortable and a beautiful refuge safe from the outside world

283
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:45,119
and now on the few times that i leave the house and drive down the street

284
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:55,839
the ten cities are still there but they're much smaller

285
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:09,839
what does that mean

286
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:20,240
i think it means that i've had the privilege of being

287
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:26,799
sheltered away sheltered away from death and disease

288
01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:33,920
for a few moments and that there are many who had no

289
01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:50,720
shelter no shelter in place no access to medicine

290
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:57,760
these words that i'm sharing with you are about memory and what it means to remember what it

291
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:04,000
means to turn a kind attention

292
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:12,720
to all about us all around us to wake up to see

293
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:19,839
to remember all that it is that we have forgotten

294
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:26,078
as the vaccines take hold in our lives begin to open up a bit

295
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:33,599
can we can we remember what it was like to stop

296
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:38,240
and bring awareness to our stub toe

297
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:45,119
will we choose to return to the abnormal life of rushing to make plans and

298
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:51,680
cramming as many tasks as possible into the time frame of each moment

299
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:02,480
will we examine the ways in which we ourselves contribute to systems of harm

300
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:07,839
in the world through our livelihood and our speech

301
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:15,119
and through our actions

302
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:23,359
and should we choose to engage in those examinations will we ask ourselves for forgiveness

303
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:28,559
for the ways we've been complacent and contributing to systems

304
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:33,920
and institutions and ways of life that are harmful

305
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:40,559
to all beings and to the earth we all have a part in this

306
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:50,960
perhaps as our world reopens little by little we will be we will welcome with open arms

307
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:58,880
the innate compassion that has been waiting to fully emerge from within

308
01:08:00,559 --> 01:08:07,200
have you felt the beautiful qualities knocking at your heart's door

309
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:13,119
qualities that have been waiting to be shared with others

310
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:25,359
even those beings outside of our chosen beloved communities

311
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:32,400
maybe this life experience this trial just maybe has shaken us up

312
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:39,520
just a bit out of our conditioned trance in a way that we might

313
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:46,400
cherish the pure gold of this breath of this time this very brief

314
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:50,158
time of our lives

315
01:08:51,600 --> 01:09:01,040
maybe we will deepen the practices necessary to explore the essential parts of our

316
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:10,560
being the time is now

317
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:19,520
it's always now the time is always now but the time is now to draw upon

318
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:25,920
our deepest most precious resources that we have been practicing and saving

319
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:30,560
up especially for this occasion

320
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:35,838
what have we been practicing for

321
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:45,679
to re-imagine to draw upon all of our intuitive

322
01:09:46,839 --> 01:09:54,640
wisdom to remember the wisdom of the ages that flows through our veins we recognize

323
01:09:54,640 --> 01:10:00,480
the truth when we hear it it resonates in our bodies

324
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:05,678
it perks us up because it's there

325
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:12,400
this is the time to re-imagine a new world

326
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:22,719
not a remaking of the old world but something never before seen to envision how we can live

327
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:28,239
in the deepest most beautiful way possible

328
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:36,080
you know i want to share this quote from clarissa pinkola estes my friends

329
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:43,040
do not lose heart we were made for these times

330
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:49,760
i have heard it from so many recently

331
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:54,320
who are deeply and properly bewildered

332
01:10:55,040 --> 01:11:02,000
they're concerned about the state of affairs in our world now ours

333
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:09,600
is a time of almost daily astonishment and righteous rage over the latest

334
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:18,000
degradations of what matters most to civilized visionary people

335
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:25,199
you are right in your assessments the lustre and hubris some have aspired to while

336
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:30,239
endorsing acts so heinous against children

337
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:37,440
elders everyday people the poor the unguarded the health the help the

338
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:46,400
the helpless is breathtaking yet i urge you gentle you

339
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:54,239
to please not spend your spirit dry by bewelling these difficult

340
01:11:54,239 --> 01:12:00,080
times especially did not lose hope

341
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:09,840
most particularly because the fact is that we were made for these times

342
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:24,800
she goes on to say that when a great ship is in harbor and

343
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:30,320
moored it is safe there is no doubt

344
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:37,120
but that is not what great ships are built for

345
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:41,678
let us not forget that we are great ships

346
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:50,080
so on this first day of spring

347
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:55,760
let us join the prayers of many in the northern hemisphere who honor the

348
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:00,800
spring equinox and plant during the time of the growing

349
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:05,840
moon and set a collective intention to create

350
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:10,719
to fashion a better world

351
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:18,560
with our words with our actions with our deeds to bring the ethics of the dharma of our

352
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:26,159
practice into these areas of our lives

353
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:33,840
to create a world free of hatred and the violence of terrorism

354
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:46,000
this starts in here because we are the contents of the world

355
01:13:46,000 --> 01:14:01,840
it is an internal as as sylvia borstein says it's an inside job

356
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:18,719
thank you for your kind attention i'd like to just take a moment to

357
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:25,600
let the words fall away to bring your awareness to the resonance

358
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:32,000
in your body to notice what is activated or what has

359
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:42,880
arisen there to drop the story lines

360
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:48,880
the questioning the judgment the interrogation

361
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:58,158
to free ourselves of any anything that we don't need

362
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:11,840
and simply listen to the wisdom of our bodies

363
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:38,038
[Music]

364
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:52,960
and as we close

365
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:57,440
i'd like to bring a dedication of merit

366
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:07,840
today we have generated good deeds that entitle us to a spiritual reward

367
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:16,000
as an act of generosity we offer the merit generated from our actions today

368
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:22,640
to radiate outward into the world at large and to land upon and rest with those who are less

369
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:29,440
fortunate than we are may it reach its long tentacles through

370
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:35,040
the illusion of space between all that there is and defeat the

371
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:40,640
enemy of wrongdoing may it land in the hearts and minds of

372
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:45,840
those who are steeped in suffering those who are stalked

373
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:52,080
and hunted those who are hungry and imprisoned in the trance of

374
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:58,159
ignorance we offer the fruits of our merit to all

375
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:04,719
living beings who crawl on the earth and swim in the waters of this world

376
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:11,440
all who fly and hop who walk and climb

377
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:18,960
all those who see without eyes and hear without ears we offer the merit of our practice

378
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:25,199
to all creatures above us below us to the right and the left seen in the

379
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:32,560
unseen the known the unknown in the unknowable

380
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:37,760
may all beings all beings

381
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:45,840
be free

382
01:17:52,350 --> 01:17:59,840
[Music] so

383
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:05,760
you
