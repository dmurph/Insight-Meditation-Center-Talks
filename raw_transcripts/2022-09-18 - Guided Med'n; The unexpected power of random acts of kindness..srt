00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:09,480
I'm bringing your awareness in Word to the breath moving moving through your

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,660
body

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,180
moving through the abdomen

4
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,739
the entirety of the in-breath the entirety of the out breath

5
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:56,538
aware

6
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:13,140
and you don't need to make a project out of breathing it happens on its own

7
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,680
it does not need to be effortful at all

8
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:34,340
relax soften the body

9
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:44,360
let go of any tightness or tension and just receive the breath

10
00:01:44,659 --> 00:01:53,659
receive the entirety of the breath in your abdomen and your whole body

11
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,700
Let It Be nourishing Let It Be soothing

12
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,140
calming grounding

13
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,780

14
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,580
receiving the breath and the forceful Act

15
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:51,900
but as if each breath was a gift the receiving a gift

16
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,360
of kindness that keeps this body alive

17
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,260

18
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:16,580
relaxing receiving

19
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,300

20
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:31,280

21
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:13,040
then if though to rise you notice the mind is now

22
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:19,859

23
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:29,960

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:13,860
spaciously spaciously thoughts too are like sounds

44
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,360
arise and pass

45
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:29,040
just as we don't need to get entangled with

46
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,860
every sound that arises and passes

47
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,060
every passing car

48
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,079

49
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:51,500
passes

50
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,320

00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:15,559
and as we bring the sitting period to a close

62
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:25,520

00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:45,260
during the sit whether you were distracted or sleepy or

66
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:52,500

[Music]

78
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:47,600
so good morning

79
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:58,440
it's good to be with you in person as I was sitting

80
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:05,960
this morning the reflection came up for me that um

81
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,740
it's been two and a half years since I have sat here and taught in person

82
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:20,460
two and a half years away where did that go it seems like it was yesterday I was sitting here with people and teaching so

83
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:27,360
just an appreciation just an appreciation of being back together in person and

84
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,600
um it's also an appreciation for this miraculous

85
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:41,760
human life the mystery of it time passes where did it go it's always

86
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,940
now and we're often so caught up with what

87
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:55,340
is happening in our minds with the challenge we're dealing with but it's the magnificence of it all

88
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:00,779
magnificence the chance of being human being alive having

89
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:08,159
this precious human birth with all its difficulties and challenges but such a gift

90
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:15,299
to be human to be with other human beings even if they Annoy Us and push their our buttons it was but what a gift

91
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:20,640
really what a joy what a joy

92
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:28,700
just really appreciating that so for today's reflections

93
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:38,600
I wanted to um talk about

94
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:45,679
the unexpected power of random acts of kindness

95
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:54,559
so if you have listened to uh

96
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:00,240
Buddhist talks before um you would have probably heard at some

97
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:08,340
point about the three poisonous roots of unwholesome actions and the three

98
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:15,120
poisonous Roots being greed hatred and what's often translated as

99
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:22,320
delusion or confusion or ignorance which is by the way the root of the other two

100
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,320
so greed is pretty easy to understand wanting more grasping more and more

101
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,500
hatred is easy to understand pushing away hating ill will and that that

102
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:41,159
delusion or confusion often confuses people like what is that deluded

103
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:47,000
well one way to understand it is in um

104
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:54,600
not knowing any better and not knowing any better not just with our minds but with our hearts

105
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:00,600
another way I like to think of it is um cognitive bias

106
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:07,860
in the most radical sense so in Psychology there is this idea of cognitive biases that we have

107
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:12,960
there's for example the recency bias what has happened the most recently we

108
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,120
think oh yeah this is oh yeah yesterday I was sad oh I'm just going to be sad for the rest of my life well you don't

109
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:23,880
remember the last week you were really happy with joy right there's a reason to say bias we have so many different

110
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:30,600
biases biases psychologists have have

111
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:36,840
studied them but I like to think of our cognitive bias

112
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:43,260
this this delusion as a radical really the most fundamental cognitive bias or

113
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:49,440
perception bias the perception that greed will make us happy

114
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:56,580
hatred is a good thing or somehow it's going to make us happy and and

115
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:01,980
so really the the delusion or the confusion is the root of the other two

116
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:07,320
is this cognitive bias not knowing like really what really makes us happy

117
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:14,039
and what really serves what really helps us wake up

118
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:20,580
another way to understand these three is by their opposites in in Pali the language of the Buddha

119
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:27,240
there's the um the prefix ah that is put between whatever word you put it in

120
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,380
becomes negative so

121
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:42,440
so agreed non-greed generosity

122
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:49,380
generosity being the opposite of it hatred the opposite of it love loving

123
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:54,539
kindness and delusion or confusion or this

124
00:33:54,539 --> 00:34:00,600
cognitive radical cognitive bias of of um not

125
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:08,179
knowing what leads to Freedom ease Liberation the opposite of confusion

126
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:13,579
wisdom wisdom okay

127
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,158
oh so to think of the to consider the

128
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:34,560
remarks I'm going to offer today about random acts of kindness in this context

129
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,618
of we don't really know we have a cognitive bias and that's what I want to

130
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:47,520
talk about today we have a cognitive bias serious delusion

131
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:54,859
of not knowing how much actually random acts of kindness

132
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:01,440
help us in our Liberation in our freedom in our happiness in the free in the

133
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,740
happiness of others so that's the the framework

134
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:13,079
so also

135
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:18,240
I'll bring in a bunch of studies in in my Dharma talk today and that's what I

136
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:25,339
usually like to do be having a background as a scientist especially when there's studies that that

137
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:31,560
corroborate what we already know to me that is so interesting to me that is the

138
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:39,480
Dharma because Dharma is learning studying the way things are and science tries to

139
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:45,660
do the same thing studying the way things are learning discovering the way things are so

140
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:54,000
finding um a lot of confluence

141
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,320
so so there have been a lot of research in the

142
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:06,500
past many years done on how

143
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:12,800
acts of kindness practicing loving kindness meta

144
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:19,640
the the Brahma viharas the the four practices of the heart compassion Etc

145
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:27,780
they um they lead to more happiness for us when we become Kinder

146
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:33,359
we become less stressed in all the ways that all these practices

147
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:40,320
are good for us so I'm not going to go so much into that today because there's there's a lot there but what I want to

148
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:48,900
focus on today is our understatement our under on underestimation

149
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,680
of how much are small acts of kindness actually make an impact in the world

150
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,960
and that's what the some new research that has just been published which is so

151
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:08,640
interesting so so here we go and then and there was a recent article in the New York Times on

152
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,859
September 2nd uh the title of it being the unexpected power of random acts of

153
00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:19,099
kindness that reported on this so through pointers for you

154
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:24,780
for later so this this paper was published recently in the Journal of

155
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:29,880
experimental psychology and I love the title of this research

156
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:36,240
paper a little good goes an unexpectedly long

157
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:44,180
way underesti underestimating the positive impact of kindness on recipients

158
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:53,339
I like the the paper already so they did the scientists did a bunch

159
00:37:53,339 --> 00:38:02,339
of different experiments um and in so many setups basically

160
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:07,460
um the um

161
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:16,260
there and and as I mentioned their premise was that yes um we know that the Performing act of

162
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:21,960
kindness already increased the happiness um in the givers and receivers but but

163
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:28,980
but the givers systematically undervalue undervalue the positive impact on the

164
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:36,240
recipients so so they set up these different experiments they

165
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:44,520
um had a setup where they had on a college campus they hired students

166
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:50,640
offer classmates a ride from home to campus or bake cookies or or buy someone

167
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:58,560
a cup of coffee and in in that experiment again ever everybody

168
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,859
all the people who did these acts of kindness they didn't quite they and they had them fill out questionnaires how

169
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:12,180
much do you you know from zero to ten zero being really insignificant very small to 10 being very large how do you

170
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:18,980
predict that the recipient's mood would change from negative

171
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:24,660
what kind of an impact it had on this on the scale and also what impact would it

172
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:30,359
have on their mood and and systematically consistently people would

173
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:37,140
underestimate the impact of these simple acts of kindness random acts of kindness

174
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:44,280
and then they did another experiment um they had this this is actually a very

175
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:49,500
interesting one so they had a um in they had they recruited 200

176
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:56,160
participants um in Maggie daily park I think it was

177
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:03,780
the big Park and they had a control group of 50. and these 50 people simply received a

178
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:10,700
cupcake for being part of the experiment for just showing up they received a cupcake

179
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:16,200
and then they had another 50 people um

180
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:22,500
that um 50 people who did not receive a cupcake

181
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:28,980
but they raided how the people who received a cupcake how they would feel so they're they're having this really

182
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:35,040
complicated setup of trying to figure out how people are estimating right how other people are feeling about these

183
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:40,220
impacts of kindness so it's a very interesting sophisticated setup

184
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:45,359
and then they had a third group of 50.

185
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:51,060
a third group of 50 that um they were that they were told that

186
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:58,920
they could give a cupcake away to a stranger and they were asked to rate both their

187
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:04,800
own mood for doing this act of kindness as well as the recipient's mood for

188
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:12,619
receiving the the small gesture so so it turns out

189
00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:21,420
that the people who received the cupcake they were impacted but the people who

190
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:27,720
received a cupcake from someone else so let me say that again so the people who

191
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:35,780
received a cupcake as and participate just that because they have participated in the experiment

192
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:41,579
their impact on them the change in how they appreciated the how happy they

193
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:48,599
became was less than if they received a cupcake from a random stranger

194
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:55,260
because not only did they receive a cupcake so the people who received a copy were already happy but if you received as an act as a random act of

195
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:01,859
kindness you felt oh Somebody went out of their way to do something kind for me

196
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:08,000
and so the impact of the random act of kindness not only is it bigger but

197
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:14,880
consistently people underestimated how the recipient would feel receiving the

198
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,099
random act of kindness so there's a lot of do you hear there's a lot of different conditions here a lot of

199
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:26,700
measurements they're doing but the point I want to make is that

200
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:34,380
um the people who received the the the random act of kindness

201
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:41,220
they considered the gesture to be significantly more meaningful because

202
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:45,200
somebody did something nice for them

203
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:54,599
so we tend to underestimate we tend to underestimate the impact of our small

204
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:59,640
acts of kindness or small quote unquote small random acts of kindness

205
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:05,940
on ourselves and how it actually improves our own happiness and and

206
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:11,640
well-being and freedom and they'll talk more about that and how it impacts

207
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:18,359
others there's another study where

208
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:25,859
people that were another experiment where

209
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:32,700
simple researchers did a study on simple acts of connection like texting your

210
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:38,940
friend or picking up the phone and just a simple call and again in that study

211
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:44,579
also they had they asked the people who were just sending a text to a friend how

212
00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:51,060
are you thinking of you right we do this right we do this but maybe we don't do it enough

213
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:56,400
we don't do it enough so they they asked they recruited almost

214
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,640
I forget uh thousands of people I don't have in my notes anymore but I was looking at it last night I recorded

215
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:08,640
thousands of people so this is a pretty statistically significant study and they asked

216
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:16,920
people to estimate the impact on the recipient and then they asked the recipient how how their mood was shifted

217
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:23,520
how appreciate how much they appreciated how it brightened their day to receive this random text of how are you thinking

218
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:30,740
of you and again and again statistically significantly people

219
00:44:30,740 --> 00:44:35,880
underestimate how sending a text to A friend is going to

220
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:42,060
to have an impact how it's going to improve their mood their make them happy

221
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:47,099
make them feel cared for increase that sense of connection so we have this

222
00:44:47,099 --> 00:44:53,640
radical radical cognitive bias this radical delusion

223
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,400
let's put it in Buddhist terms we have this radical delusion

224
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:07,800
about our impact or rather lack of a better impact and on others we

225
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:14,339
don't really realize how powerful we are how powerful we are

226
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:18,140
just how powerful we are

227
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:29,220
some researchers think that maybe for example in the case of texting

228
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:35,160
with a friend reaching out to a friend one reason for it is a liking Gap we

229
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:41,220
have again this delusion or this tendency to underestimate how well-liked

230
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:48,540
we really are oh do they really want to hear from us we underestimate how well-liked we

231
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:52,760
really are take that in for a moment

232
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:59,220
this underestimation of how much

233
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:04,680
people care about us and how happy they become when we reach out it seems very

234
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:10,920
simple but it's really through recognizing our power not just with

235
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:16,859
friends and texting Etc but with with the Ripple effects in the world

236
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:21,960
So speaking of texting while I'm on that um I recently was was quite sick I

237
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:27,300
actually had covered a few weeks ago and I was quite sick and

238
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:34,740
um and what a gift it was to be so sick and have a high fever and have friends

239
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:41,339
send texts and call are you okay what do you need even if I was I was too tired and sick to respond to them right away

240
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:47,579
like I don't can't even respond but it was just yes yes the sense of connection

241
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:53,460
being cared for and and perhaps the friends who sent didn't

242
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:59,880
realize how meaningful that was for me this sense of meta feeling held in meta

243
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:08,940
that probably really helped me recover oh yes I'm not forgotten people are texting calling asking so let's not

244
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:15,420
underestimate our power each and every single one of us has so much power

245
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:20,359
power of kindness and we can do that

246
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:26,220
there's so much that as

247
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:33,359
that can be taken away from us and and I'm thinking of those of you who might

248
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:39,720
be familiar with um a man's search for meaning

249
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:47,839
this amazing book written by Victor Frankel who was a psychologist who

250
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:54,420
was who went through the Holocaust survived the Holocaust and

251
00:47:54,420 --> 00:48:00,020
um he wrote This Book

252
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:05,400
remarking and observing that so many people had so much taken away from them

253
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:10,680
they had their belongings taken away they had their

254
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:16,079
um their family their friends they had so much taken away

255
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,420
but many people still they well the one

256
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:27,060
thing that cannot be taken away from us is our choice is our choice how we think

257
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:32,700
how we feel and how we act in the world is it with more

258
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:40,980
kindness or is it with with greed hatred and delusion so these choices cannot be

259
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:46,200
taken away from us all the things can be taken away but the choice how to be in

260
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:54,780
the world how to perceive and how to act with kindness cannot be

261
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:57,740
taken away from us

262
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,599
so

263
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:18,780
so the hope that that the researchers have with this study and and I have with

264
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:26,220
bringing it up is that by by realizing by appreciating how much

265
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:32,160
our acts of kindness in the world actually make a difference for others

266
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:38,180
um that we become more open to to be kind to to

267
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:44,520
exercising our powerful kindness there's a little story actually that I

268
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:49,800
would read and I trust I bet we have our own stories every single one of us I bet

269
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:56,040
we have our own stories but in this New York Times article it starts with a little story I'll read for

270
00:49:56,040 --> 00:50:02,300
you in late August Aaron Alexander 57 sat in the parking lot of a Target store

271
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:09,060
in Fairfield California and wept her sister-in-law had recently died and

272
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:15,119
Miss Alexander was having a hard day a barista working at the Starbucks

273
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:21,540
inside the Target store was two the espresso machine had broken down and

274
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:27,119
she was clearly stressed Ms Alexander who had stopped crying and gone inside

275
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:32,760
for some caffeine smiled and ordered an iced green tea and

276
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:39,119
told her to hang in there after picking up her order she noticed a message on the cup

277
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:46,079
Aaron the Barista had scrawled next to a heart your soul is gored golden

278
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:52,920
your soul is golden I am not even sure I even necessarily

279
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:58,680
know what your soul is golden means said Miss Alexander who laughed and cried

280
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:03,839
while recalling the incident but the warmth of that small and unexpected

281
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:10,980
gesture from a stranger who had no inkling of what she was going through moved her deeply

282
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:16,440
of course I was still really sad Ms Alexander said but that little thing

283
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:24,000
made the rest of my day how many of us have had our day made by

284
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,040
a small random act of kindness just I know I have

285
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:36,000
I know I have so many stories so many instances

286
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:43,920
um one just randomly came up I remember some time ago I went to have my blood drawn and having

287
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:52,279
my blood drawn for a test is not my favorite thing in the world I have to do it often and it's just like oh still

288
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:59,579
feel strange and and um this this person at the blood the

289
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:04,920
phlebotomist was so nice was so nice

290
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:11,700
he made my day he really made my day I was so happy I didn't feel unhappy that

291
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:17,460
I was sick he just made my day I was just like coming out of having my blood

292
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:24,240
drawn lots of vials like wow I feel like I had been graced I had been touched by

293
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:30,839
Grace with just this person being kind going out of their way to make me feel

294
00:52:30,839 --> 00:52:36,599
comfortable so many examples so many instances of

295
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:43,559
just kindness random acts of kindness everyday kindness can completely change

296
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:50,160
people's lives there was another story I read um some time ago and this was

297
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:57,680
um someone who was quite depressed and and perhaps even

298
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:05,400
you know thinking you know Hanging On by thread and they would go for a walk every day and

299
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:13,200
every day on their walk they would see a neighbor who would just give him a big bright smile big bright smile the

300
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:19,740
neighbor and later they reached out to the neighbor and said you know that big

301
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:25,200
bright smile you gave me every day on my walks it kept me going it keep me going

302
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:31,619
that there was kindness in the world that there is goodness in the world it just that was the threat that kept me

303
00:53:31,619 --> 00:53:36,660
going so that just uh

304
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:45,619
on not underestimating the power of simple acts of kindness just a smile

305
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:55,280
we underestimate that's the point I want to make today we

306
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,300
underestimate nah now science says

307
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:05,880
with these studies we underestimate the impact we have on each other the impact

308
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:13,500
on how we have on each other so so that's one aspect of what I want

309
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:18,900
to discuss but there is another aspect of it so we underestimate two ways we

310
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:23,940
underestimate both the impact it has on others the gift

311
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:30,480
that we make for others and we also underestimate how much of an impact it

312
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:36,059
makes for us completely underestimate

313
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:42,960
so so another research paper I want to

314
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:49,619
bring in which talks about that other side is one by um

315
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:58,280
um Michael Norton Professor Michael Norton from Harvard Business School and this was a 2008 study

316
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:05,220
which showed up in Science magazine um

317
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:12,300
and the title of this is spending money on others promotes happiness

318
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:17,520
who would have thought right and here again I won't go through too much detail

319
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:26,099
but they they have it's a very interesting and sophisticated setup they have lots of different setups and

320
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:31,980
um and basically what they find is that

321
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:38,300
maybe I'll just talk about one one of the studies that um

322
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:45,420
they um when they ask a group of students how much you know if

323
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:51,359
um how much they think um spending the money on themselves versus

324
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:56,940
spending the money that or so in this study they're giving a bunch of giving group of students some money five

325
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:02,400
dollars twenty dollars so this is not a big amount of money it's a small amount of money it's just a token right it's

326
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:08,700
buying someone a coffee right it's not a lot and and they um they ask the

327
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:15,240
students okay what do you think how much your happiness would increase if you spend it on yourself versus you spend it

328
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:23,280
on others and again we have this delusion of thinking spending the money on ourselves makes us

329
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:29,579
more happy and sure enough when you actually spend the

330
00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:35,040
money on others it makes you happier it makes you happier than spending it on

331
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:40,460
yourself but of course I mean again there's a lot of detail I'm leaving leaving out

332
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:46,380
is there is the self-care that we need to take care of ourselves etc etc I'm

333
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:52,740
not talking about that but that extra level of oh do I get myself a gift or

334
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:58,140
somebody else a gift that that turns out it makes us happier

335
00:56:58,140 --> 00:57:04,800
to make other people to be generous with others and again this is this is the um

336
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:12,119
the delusion we have because if when I tell you we're like no I don't think so like yeah I want to spend it on myself right that's the delusion we have but

337
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:18,839
actually when we do it when we actually do it and we and then we get asked the level

338
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:24,480
of gladness happiness is is more so

339
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:32,240
so if you're feeling down if you're feeling unhappy

340
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:38,640
the fastest way to to get a jolt of joy

341
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:43,819
gladness is to do something nice for somebody else

342
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:50,220
to do something nice for somebody else so if you're at home if you're feeling

343
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:56,760
unhappy or stressed oh poor me poor milk will reach out take your phone perhaps

344
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:04,260
reach out to a friend how are you how are you doing I heard you were sick or you're having a hard time Reach Out do

345
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:10,140
something kind for someone else both you're underestimating how happy it

346
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:15,359
makes them and you're underestimating how happy it'll make you and also this

347
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:18,558
the sense of social connection

348
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:27,839
so in row so Rose by Any Other Name so to I've

349
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:32,940
been talking about loving kindness right practicing loving kindness today

350
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:40,380
about loving kindness and it may not necessarily be just sitting on the cushion and wishing you're wishing

351
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:46,920
yourself well or wishing other people well which is beautiful loving kindness is a wonderful wonderful practice

352
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:55,319
I love practicing it I love teaching it during happy hour please come join us every day of the week 6 to 7 P.M online

353
00:58:55,319 --> 00:59:01,619
and and some people say well I don't have the time to come and join happy hour or sit on the cushion and practice

354
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:09,480
loving kindness no problem go out into the world you have so many opportunities

355
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:15,720
to be kind for random acts of kindness in fact um

356
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:23,780
I saw this this is a fun one um a grammar in Florida in Tampa Florida

357
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:28,920
started a smile and wave Challenge on

358
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:34,260
their next door I think you're from next door is this app is this a community

359
00:59:34,260 --> 00:59:41,460
Forum where each neighborhood you can send email or posts to your neighbors

360
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:46,619
you're nodding so many of you know what next door is so so this this person in

361
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:53,040
Tampa Florida started the smile smile and wave challenge so

362
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:58,260
so um and got the whole neighborhood just

363
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:03,839
everyone you see smile and wave smile and wave and she said she had she got

364
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:10,319
about 75 percent of people to smile and wave back and that was that 25 that she wanted the help of everybody else in the

365
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:16,799
neighborhood to to reach to just smile and um and it's it's a it's a nice quote

366
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:23,819
that she says if someone doesn't have a smile then give them yours if someone doesn't have a smile then

367
01:00:23,819 --> 01:00:30,059
give them yours especially nowadays if someone doesn't

368
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:33,799
have a smile give them yours

369
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:43,680
so we underestimate our power we underestimate our power for for good

370
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:48,780
no need especially if you ever feel powerless

371
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:55,740
you're underestimating your power your impact your likability you're underestimating

372
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:59,359
so much impact you have

373
01:01:02,520 --> 01:01:08,940
the Buddha says practitioners people knew as I know the fruits of

374
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:14,160
sharing gifts they would not enjoy their use without sharing them

375
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:21,059
nor would the taint of singiness obsess the heart even if it were their last bit their

376
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:26,700
last morsel of food they would not enjoy its use without sharing it

377
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:31,578
if there was someone else to share it with

378
01:01:31,940 --> 01:01:37,680
AKA 18. so

379
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:42,720
kindness loving kindness which is intertwined with generosity in Buddhism

380
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:50,579
really it's the generosity of the heart that when we feel like okay we we have we

381
01:01:50,579 --> 01:02:00,059
have so much to share every single one of us has so much to share so so of course you know this idea of of

382
01:02:00,059 --> 01:02:06,180
um random acts of kindness doesn't mean now okay now all right now do I have to go learn bake you know how to bake

383
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:11,640
cookies or buy everybody coffee no it doesn't mean that whatever is part of

384
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:20,460
your wheelhouse part of your what you naturally do if if you love baking cookies sure please do that but maybe

385
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:29,460
maybe you have the skill of of listening again reaching out or or whatever you

386
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:37,680
already have in your Wheelhouse in your skill in your um your bag of skills that's what you can

387
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:42,720
be generous with you can be kind with you can have an impact

388
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:49,859
you are you're already so wealthy each of us is so wealthy in in the ways that

389
01:02:49,859 --> 01:02:56,220
we can be kind a couple of other things I want to say

390
01:02:56,220 --> 01:03:03,059
before closing one is also and um

391
01:03:03,059 --> 01:03:11,640
the Buddha and the sutta of a persons of integrity's gifts

392
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:17,720
he says there are five um

393
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:25,619
there are five ways that a person of Integrity gives a gift

394
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:30,780
and what are those five a person of Integrity gives a gift with

395
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:38,180
a sense of conviction with a sense of conviction

396
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:44,640
a person of Integrity gives a give attentively

397
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:51,299
especially like this one actually I like all of them so with a sense of conviction like a sense of conviction

398
01:03:51,299 --> 01:03:57,920
right giving the gift giving and an act of kindness with conviction

399
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:03,900
attentively so it's like you know if you're giving someone a gift you don't give them a gift like ah you're looking

400
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:10,380
elsewhere like you look at them you you give it to them you give it with both hands now with just one hand like oh

401
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:16,260
here I have I have a gift for you whoops still I go here take it look at there

402
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:22,619
you give it attentively right there is a way to to honor another one with an act

403
01:04:22,619 --> 01:04:29,579
of kindness or or a gift or generosity the third a person of Integrity gives a

404
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:35,460
gift in season a person of Integrity gives a gift with

405
01:04:35,460 --> 01:04:41,460
an empathetic heart I love this one empathetic heart and the last one is a

406
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:49,859
very interesting one the last one the person of Integrity gives a gift without adversely affecting themselves

407
01:04:49,859 --> 01:04:56,099
or others so this is an interesting point here

408
01:04:56,099 --> 01:05:03,839
also so an act of generosity kindness not to adversely affect oneself and

409
01:05:03,839 --> 01:05:07,760
others so to keep that in mind

410
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:16,440
so I want to close with a poem by

411
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:24,180
la nusa lamaris it's called small kindnesses

412
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:30,540
I've been thinking about the way when you walk down a crowded aisle people

413
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:38,099
pull in their legs to let you by or how Strangers still say bless you

414
01:05:38,099 --> 01:05:43,440
when someone sneezes a leftover from the Bubonic plague don't

415
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:49,559
die we are saying we sometimes and and sometimes when you

416
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:56,040
spill lemons from your grocery bag someone else will help you pick them up

417
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:02,220
mostly we don't want to harm each other we want to be handed our cup of coffee

418
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:07,680
hot and to say thank you to the person handing it

419
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:14,940
smile at them and for them to smile back for the waitress to call us honey

420
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:22,680
when she sets down the bowl of clam chowder and for the driver in the red pickup

421
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:29,880
truck to let us pass we have so little of each other now

422
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:37,380
so far from tribe and Fire only these moments only these brief

423
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:43,200
moments of Exchange what if they are the true dwelling of

424
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:49,020
the Holy these fleeting temples we make together

425
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:57,780
when we say here have my seat go ahead you first

426
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:00,920
I like your hat

427
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:09,480
what if they are the true dwellings of the Holy

428
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:14,059
these fleeting temples we make together

429
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:29,839
what if what if these brief moments of of Exchange

430
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:36,359
these fleeting temples we make holy fleeting temples

431
01:07:36,359 --> 01:07:40,160
we can all make them together

432
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:51,960
and the last quote from Helen Keller believe when you are most unhappy

433
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:59,880
that there is something for you to do in the world believe when you are most unhappy

434
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:04,819
that there is something for you to do in the world

435
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:13,980
so long as you can sweeten another's pain life is not in vain

436
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:21,080
so long as you can sweeten another's pain life is not in vain

437
01:08:21,299 --> 01:08:26,600
let's just sit together for a minute the word settle

438
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,880
