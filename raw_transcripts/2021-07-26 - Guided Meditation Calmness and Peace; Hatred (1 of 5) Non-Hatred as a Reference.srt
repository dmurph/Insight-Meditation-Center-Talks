1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:17,920
hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:28,080
one of the states of being that are is often associated with meditation

3
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,280
is calmness and perhaps sometimes calmness is

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,960
misunderstood and therefore underappreciated

5
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,680
it isn't that calmness has to characterize all of ourselves that all

6
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:53,198
of us is come but rather it's more like the

7
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:01,600
the containers come it isn't that

8
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:10,840
everything in the room everyone in the room is calm but the somehow the size of the room

9
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:18,799
the emptiness of the room the clarity in the room something there's a calmness in the room that

10
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:27,200
holds or includes someone who is not calm so the same thing in ourselves

11
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:34,079
we could have a lot of energy good energy engaging energy and sometimes the calmer or more

12
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,280
peaceful we become in meditation it releases a kind of beautiful

13
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:46,960
kind of flow of energy or aliveness in us that very clearly is

14
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,799
held or supported by that calmness

15
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,799
so if we're looking for something very placid and peaceful everywhere we might miss the calmness

16
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:06,399
that's already here and some of that has to do with the

17
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:13,599
awareness the mindfulness that knows that holds

18
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:20,000
our experience and that can become

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,280
it's somewhat like someone who uh there's a lot going on a lot of busyness or

20
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:31,440
important things to happen but you watch this person you see that they're completely engaged in what

21
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,040
needs to be done but their eyes are calm their eyes seem

22
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,160
just settled and peaceful and engaged they're not there's not a constriction around the

23
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:49,680
eyes or our eyes are not darting around just they're calm and settled gazing

24
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:58,160
upon what needs to be done in a calm way while they work quickly and strongly

25
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,319
so sitting up or assuming a meditation

26
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:15,920
posture that allows you to be externally

27
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,560
still externally with a body so the body can be still

28
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,840
so that some part of your body offers calmness peacefulness even if there's a

29
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,959
lot of agitation in the body maybe there's something

30
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:43,360
about the stillness that the body is in it also is there together with the agitation

31
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:54,239
and gently closing the eyes and taking a few long slow deep breaths

32
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,560
and as you exhale see if that can be

33
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,159
an exercise in calming settling

34
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:18,000
an exercise of knowing recognizing something that's calming about the

35
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,560
exhale

36
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
settling

37
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,960
and as you breathe in fully deeply

38
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,800
in that whatever calmness that's there welcome the experience of breathing in

39
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:57,840
welcome the inhale

40
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:15,039
then letting your breathing return to normal and with a normal breathing is there in

41
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:22,479
your experience some reference point for calmness

42
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:31,520
peacefulness maybe not all of you maybe much of you is not calm or peaceful

43
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:37,120
but is there somewhere within or somewhere in your capacity for

44
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,400
mindfulness that supports you to gaze upon your

45
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:53,840
experience calmly peacefully

46
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:21,840
and not a calmness or peacefulness that pushes anything away

47
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:30,720
but rather something that allows what's there without getting caught in

48
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,080
it agitated by it

49
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,840
and then settling in further with your breathing

50
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,080
perhaps there's a way of continuing to relax the body

51
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:03,599
some of the tensions and holding in the body

52
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:11,759
on the exhale softening releasing whatever holding there might

53
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,840
be

54
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,720
and then settling into your breathing

55
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:56,840
and part of the function of focusing on breathing is not to deny anything or push anything

56
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:05,759
away but support us in not getting involved or entangled or reactive

57
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,599
to anything because the energy of attention

58
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,960
steadily calmly

59
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:27,840
moves with the breathing

60
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,120
and helps us to find the calm center

61
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:41,839
or the peaceful container

62
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,160
with which we can we can gaze upon whatever needs our attention

63
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,080
calmly without agitation

64
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,519
seeing clearly forever long that's useful

65
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,360
and then returning to the breathing

66
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,200
relaxing with the exhale

67
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:23,839
welcoming the inhale

68
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,840
is there accessible to you

69
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,799
a capacity for more calmness peacefulness

70
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,840
somewhere within or somewhere in the container of it all

71
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:43,840
some way that you can be mindful in a calm open

72
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:57,840
peaceful way

73
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,919
you

74
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,840
so then as we come to the end of this meditation

75
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:17,840
one of the benefits of recognizing calmness or peacefulness

76
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,600
is that it helps purify our love

77
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,159
imagine when we're caught in agitation and fear and anxiety and

78
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:37,919
hatred and greed the simplicity and purity of love

79
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:44,960
is hard to tap into but the calmness the peacefulness that

80
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:53,440
we can experience makes room for the simplicity

81
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,840
and the clarity of love of kindness

82
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:07,440
warmth loving kindness compassion

83
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:15,919
the whole range of caring emotions and caring motivations

84
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,919
that can well up within us

85
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:29,440
the simplicity of love that includes ourselves includes others includes the whole world

86
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:42,720
the buddha call love meta

87
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,320
has a form of wealth that we carry within us

88
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:57,360
and so as we come to the end of the sitting perhaps we can

89
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:11,600
extend our calm gaze onto the suffering of this world

90
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:20,799
anywhere that her eyes land our gaze

91
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:27,840
lands locally in our own family or local communities or around your country

92
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:36,399
or the world and the calmly allow your care

93
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,600
your good will your compassion

94
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:51,840
take in the suffering the world

95
00:30:52,000 --> 00:31:00,240
and at the end of the sitting meditation it's good to evoke some motivation

96
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:07,919
that to have your meditation practice support you

97
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:18,159
in helping to alleviate that suffering in the world

98
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:26,158
even if it's in the smallest possible ways that's accessible and easy for you

99
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:33,440
may it be that this meditation practice we do supports us to live

100
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:38,398
for the welfare and happiness of this whole world

101
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:48,640
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

102
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:56,399
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere

103
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:01,840
be free

104
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:12,149
[Music]

105
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,360
this week for the dharma talks

106
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:35,679
the theme will be um the second of the three

107
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:45,518
unwholesome roots second of the three poisons and that is hatred or hostility

108
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:52,960
and so the three are greed hatred and delusion and so last week we went through greed

109
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:58,720
and this week we'll go through hate and it's phenomenally important in the

110
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,279
buddhist course of practice to understand these three poisons greed hate and

111
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:12,320
delusion because these are the primary

112
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:20,560
conditions or sources or catalysts for human suffering

113
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:27,040
and to and to alleviate to to end suffering to decrease the amount of suffering in ourselves and the world

114
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:33,040
around us it makes a huge difference if we understand greed hate and delusion

115
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:39,839
and are able to decrease it and even eliminate it completely which is one of the purposes of buddhist

116
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:46,800
practice is to really bring it to an end a remarkable achievement it is possible

117
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:53,760
and so as i did last week for greed i'm not going to

118
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:01,440
start the first talk this today not by talking about hatred directly

119
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,960
but by talking about non-hate because this contextualizes the discussion about

120
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:12,520
hate so the word for hate is dosa a

121
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:17,920
d-o-s-a and non-hate in nepali

122
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,560
in the buddhist the discussion is a dosa a d-o-s-a so not hate

123
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,560
non-hate and now that's more than just the absence of

124
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:37,680
hate it's understood in the tradition that it's the presence of something wonderful that somehow the

125
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:47,280
absence of hate doesn't leave us neutral doesn't leave us empty in some kind of void uh impoverished way

126
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,920
that it's the opposite that the presence of hate is what's impoverishing for us

127
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,960
and that as we release it wonderful states arise and now the primary one that's

128
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,240
associated with this is love that is loving-kindness

129
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:12,560
and um it's also associated with patience with

130
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:18,880
calmness and with peace and um and there's a

131
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,400
wonderful verse that uh famous verse from the dhammapada it's

132
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:31,200
the third verse in the this anthology of buddhist poetry from the ancient times

133
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:40,800
and it goes something like this hate is never overcome by hate

134
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:49,920
by non-hate only is hate overcome this is the ancient truth

135
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,920
so the word non-hate as i said implies the positive corollaries to that

136
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:03,119
so some translators will actually translate it that way so they'll say hate is never overcome by hate by love

137
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:09,040
alone is hate overcome this is the ancient truth

138
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:16,160
and that particular verse was very impactful after

139
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:24,560
world war ii because in the early 1950s 51 52 i think there was a big international

140
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:31,599
conference in san francisco to decide on the fate of japan japan had lost the war

141
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:39,839
united states had occupied japan and was governing the country and many of the countries 40 countries i

142
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:47,359
think came who had been impacted by japanese aggression during world war ii came to san francisco to decide

143
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:53,119
on the fate of japan should japan be divided up into multiple countries should it be

144
00:37:53,119 --> 00:38:00,800
different different countries take over parts of it you know what should happen to it and

145
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,880
there was kind of a stalemate at this conference until the foreign minister from sri

146
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:14,400
lanka came up and evoked the principle of of caring for everyone and

147
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:22,320
and and including for the japanese people and he recited that verse

148
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:28,800
and when he recited that verse the way the report goes everything settled down and the

149
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:34,160
conference then went ahead and decided to grant japan its independence

150
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,680
and the kind of expression of love and expression of good will

151
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:48,800
and maybe even a trust that there was another way possible after the aggression of the world war ii

152
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,800
and so um there's a plaque in tokyo uh it's commemorating this event

153
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:01,200
that has that verse um on its own on the stone

154
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:07,920
so um the so as we meditate or as we have other

155
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,280
means in our lives from time to time maybe we begin tapping into

156
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:19,119
a degree of calmness or peace a capacity for love and all the different manifestation

157
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,880
of what love might be a capacity for deep patience

158
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,160
and that uh that begins showing us something very

159
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,599
important and it shows us that when there's hatred

160
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:42,960
that it diminishes us it impoverishes us it it brings with it suffering

161
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,000
that hatred is a fire that burns the person that's

162
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:56,000
uh hostile that the one exit one

163
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:04,000
analogy is that picking up hatred is like picking up a hot piece of coal and of course uh not everyone who

164
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,680
hates or has hostility recognizes that partly because of the intense focus on

165
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,359
the object of hostility that that sometimes blinds us to the

166
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,480
impact that hate has on ourselves and also doesn't lead to very clear

167
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,520
thinking calmness on the other hand peacefulness love

168
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,839
tends to produce wiser trains of thought not necessarily always but it tends to

169
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:36,960
help us think more wisely and by including

170
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,599
what the impact our behavior has our feelings have our emotions have on ourselves and those

171
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:49,520
around us and um and uh and we can feel then

172
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:56,319
the diminishment of our own well-being so rather than talking about for this

173
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:02,640
week talking about hate uh in a in a critical way or in a way

174
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:07,760
that's uh condemns hate or is puritanically like we should just get rid of hate

175
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:15,200
because it's the wrong it's bad what i want to emphasize the perspective we have on hate when

176
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,720
we are really rooted in a place of peacefulness of calm or love

177
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:27,520
and in that kind of situation we can look upon hate not as an enemy not as something that we

178
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:34,240
need to judge in some negative way but rather almost like it's an illness

179
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,440
almost like it's a something that needs to be addressed but

180
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,920
we don't have to condemn ourselves or condemn other people for it but we do want to address

181
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:53,920
and find an alternative and find a way of settling and relaxing and and supporting ourselves and others

182
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:01,359
for the best qualities of heart to come forth and to meet the world if we want to try to help

183
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:07,839
support the world to suffer less human beings to suffer less we really need to figure out some way to

184
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:15,680
show that the suffering of hostility the suffering of hate and one way to do that is to really know

185
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,720
the opposite to really know this thing of non-hate to recognize and

186
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,720
even if it's in small halting ways at first to keep coming back and recognizing

187
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:34,319
where we can find in ourselves our capacity for calmness for peacefulness for

188
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:41,680
for uh for love for generosity and uh and not to make that help us

189
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,680
become passive because of that but maybe it's even empowering to step

190
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:53,200
forward in that way in that peace in that love

191
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,640
and to learn the wise ways of doing that and the engaged ways of doing that

192
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:05,839
and so as we go through this week and focus on hostility which you know is maybe not not necessarily a

193
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:12,000
pleasant thing to talk about or reflect on it is uh

194
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,480
something that if we if we remember that we're looking upon it and exploring

195
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:25,760
it from our capacity for peace love calmness that then we can kind of look

196
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:32,079
and see um in the the topic as something which

197
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:38,800
moves us into greater capacities for those things greater capacities for love for kindness

198
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,960
for goodwill for compassion we have a wide range of

199
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:51,440
of wonderful feelings inside of positive feelings connected to non-um

200
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,839
non-hatred so for the buddha or for the buddhist tradition the

201
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:03,760
quality the state of non-hate is refreshing or for or enlightening

202
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,359
like the full moon that comes or they're actually the expression from the ancient text is

203
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:18,079
pleasing like the moon full moon is pleasing so imagine the full moon on a clear night um

204
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:23,839
is his analogy for your non-hate in the clarity of an

205
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:29,760
unobstructed heart and mind it's uh this non-hostility is

206
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,240
characterized by the absence of violence

207
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:41,920
it's said to be gentle like a good friend and it's the cause of friendship so

208
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:48,319
rather than simply the absence of hate there's something here that supports friendship uh in this kind of this approach the

209
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:54,079
state of non-hate and it's said to be like a smell like

210
00:44:54,079 --> 00:45:00,800
sandalwood sandalwood has a wonderful smell it's used for perfumes or different things but it uh sandalwood

211
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,800
normally doesn't harm anyone and so the same way that the non-hate

212
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:15,920
someone who lives in non-hate there's a kind of non-harming perfume or atmospheric mood

213
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:22,319
that somehow can waft from them that is palpable sometimes

214
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:28,960
they say that um when there's non-hate we never harm ourselves or harm others

215
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,560
not intentionally or knowingly and uh

216
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:40,400
in fact uh the opposite exists that we're interested in promoting welfare

217
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,680
for self and others that's one of the functions uh manifestations of

218
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:52,480
non-hate and finally a couple of other things about non-hate

219
00:45:52,480 --> 00:46:01,280
the tradition says that it's a condition for youthfulness that the fire of hatred

220
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:08,079
speeds up the aging process and they talk about the ancient texts talking about when there's a lot of hatred that

221
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:15,040
there's a quicker gathering together of wrinkles and gray hair to be a little bit careful with

222
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:20,640
this kind of idea that don't assume just because someone has wrinkles or gray hair that

223
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:28,640
that there's hate there but the speeding up of that process is what the ancient texts say um

224
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:35,200
and that um having non-hate discovering non-hate is like having a

225
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,839
tight knot that's unraveled and set free

226
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:46,000
so may you come to appreciate your capacity for non-hate

227
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,880
as a untangling of the constrictions and knots in your heart

228
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:59,119
and your mind and to discover your capacity for peace and love so that

229
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:06,560
the way we gaze upon hatred is not hateful but rather brings the

230
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:14,160
medicine of goodwill and

231
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:20,319
and care so tomorrow we'll we'll talk more specifically about this

232
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:25,760
and there's the same plan as as last week to go through um the five

233
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:31,760
different aspects of this i'll i'll share that tomorrow again

234
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,599
that plan so thank you
