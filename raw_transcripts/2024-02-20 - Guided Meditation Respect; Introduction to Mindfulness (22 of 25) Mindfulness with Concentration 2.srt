1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:10,559
so hello everyone and Welcome to our meditation session and for this uh session I'd like

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:19,359
to uh convey um visually a teaching that I offered at

3
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:27,960
this Last Retreat I taught at Insight retreat center and but it's meant today

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,440
to offer for kind of distinction between mindfulness and

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,280
concentration these are two partners in the practice and they work together but

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:47,960
they're distinct in some ways and uh so to begin this kind of

7
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:55,000
visual demonstration we begin with the notion that occasionally we human beings

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,519
are entangled in our concerns we're caught up we're stuck we're attacked

9
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:06,560
attached and um it could be with people we're entangled with people uh we are

10
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,880
codependent we are upset with them we're just kind of wrapped up around our concerns around them or with things in

11
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:20,680
the world or even with ourselves and aspects of ourselves and the demonstration for this would be like the

12
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:26,600
fingers in our hand coming together to hands and being and locking together

13
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,640
just like really locked together and it can really quite make a knot out of it

14
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,520
but uh they're like if I wrap them around and bend them around each other then pull apart I just can't get them

15
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,759
apart if I'm really holding on gripping on tight that then I can't get them

16
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:50,920
apart I have to release the hands to be able to get them apart so entangled in

17
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:57,399
things it's possible to be so in the middle of the drama of it all that we're

18
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:03,039
kind of in it and entangled in something and the metaphor the classic example for

19
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:08,560
me is being in a group of people who are caught up in an argument about something

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:15,440
and for some reason stepping away maybe leaving the room and coming back in the edge of the group and watching them

21
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:21,160
argue and feeling like wow that's quite something they're caught up in it and they don't even know it and but from

22
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:27,920
that distance seeing clearly what's going on that so we somehow find a way

23
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,319
to step away to see from a distance what is it we're

24
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:39,920
concerned with and that's the mindfulness it is a kind of stepping

25
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,480
away so we can see what's happening we can perceive be aware of what's

26
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:52,000
happening almost like we're making breathing room for our experience that we can't do if we're caught up in the

27
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,760
middle of there's no room to breathe no room to see or to feel but to step back and so we can see the see what's

28
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:06,879
happening concentration is to come back and make

29
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,319
contact again like this and I like this image

30
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:20,920
because it's an it's a gesture of respect in Buddhism and um and so we're not being

31
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:26,799
aloof from experience but we're not being entangled in it we're seeing it

32
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,599
clearly and in that seeing and our respect for what's there to get to know

33
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:38,560
it better we stay there we get close to it we feel it and then the soft tender

34
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:45,519
parts the sensitive parts of the hand can touch what's there in uh some classic Buddhist text

35
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:54,120
they talk about uh like being like um having a cloth and rubbing a bronze bowl

36
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:01,760
and just kind of taking it coming together just gently kind of staying with it to feel it to be with it but for

37
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:09,480
today I'd like to suggest the idea we're we're not being aloof we're being distinct when we're

38
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:16,840
being separated enough to not be defined by whatever is going on not

39
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:24,520
by not be shaped by it not be identified with it but also not disrespectful and

40
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:31,199
aloof just enough so we can see oh that's here here's awareness I'm

41
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:39,000
aware or if you prefer I'm here even and my concern my emotions my thoughts

42
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
they're there and I can see them and then coming together and think and

43
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,400
approaching this is a kind of a gesture of respect that concentration is a gesture

44
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:58,600
of respecting what's there so we can stay and feel and sense make room for it

45
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:08,080
so mindfulness is not just being aware and then going on to the next thing to be aware of mindfulness is to recognize

46
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:15,720
what's there and then get to know it better come closer feel it sense it so

47
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:23,560
the concentration is lingering with something and that lingering can be a long time it can feel

48
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,919
really good it can be a kind of absorption but it's not absorption like

49
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:35,319
this it's absorption of just really being resting there together with

50
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:43,638
experience so assuming a meditation posture and

51
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,000
uh gently closing your

52
00:05:53,199 --> 00:06:02,680
eyes and taking a few moments just by mental Act of

53
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:10,479
recognition that you are here now at a time and

54
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:18,120
place that your mind is not need to be caught in things that are there and

55
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:23,599
then there's a definitive recognition here

56
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:33,400
now is the place for awareness and have that grounding and

57
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:41,840
here unentangled here in your

58
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,520
body feeling the weight of your body against the surface that holds it up

59
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,520
that receives its

60
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,479
weight and to take a few long long slow deep

61
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:06,639
breaths and relax and let go into this

62
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:24,360
body the clarity of taking your

63
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,960
place meaning in wherever you're meditating this is your place

64
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:38,199
that you belong that you for now is your

65
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:47,199
place take your place here now so that you can be

66
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:55,720
independent of other things around you other things in your life for these

67
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:05,520
minutes letting your breathing return to normal and on the exhale continue to

68
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,360
relax the

69
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
body

70
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,800
and then centering yourself on your

71
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:46,000
breathing recognizing the

72
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,240
sensations of breathing in sensations of breathing

73
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,880
out and how those Sensations are different from each

74
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
other

75
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,839
recognizing the distinct characteristics of an

76
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,240
inhale of an

77
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
exhale

78
00:10:00,079 --> 00:10:06,079
and for a few moments here to imagine that your ability to

79
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:11,279
perceive breathing or or to know that you're

80
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:18,519
breathing is distinct from the breathing itself two different

81
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:24,079
processes one physical one

82
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,079
mental almost as if if you can step away

83
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:40,160
from the experience of breathing and observe

84
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
it

85
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:34,480
and then as if two palmed hands The Palms come

86
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:41,600
together respectfully gently let your

87
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,680
awareness become closer to the

88
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:55,320
breathing almost as of awareness is there to respect and care for each

89
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:00,959
inhale and each exhale

90
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,079
so the awareness is

91
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:12,680
gently massaged or rubbed

92
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:16,600
by the experience of

93
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,639
breathing where it's clear that awareness mindfulness

94
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,839
attention is both distinct

95
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:38,959
from breathing and in touch with

96
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,440
breathing lingering in the experience of that

97
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:55,920
contact between awareness and

98
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
breathing

99
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,880
without entanglement without being defined by it

100
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,160
or troubled by

101
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:27,760
anything respectful awareness respecting each

102
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,880
breath and as we sit

103
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:40,120
here if you become aware of Body Sensations or

104
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,519
emotions or

105
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:52,839
thinking know it mindfully by knowing that you're in

106
00:13:52,839 --> 00:14:00,759
some way apart from it you're not defined by it you are not it

107
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,639
but you can be with

108
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,880
it and lingering with

109
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
it

110
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
e

111
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
e

112
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
for

113
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
for

114
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
for

115
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
e

116
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
for

117
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:29,080
a synonym for concentration is

118
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:35,960
being steadied steadying

119
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:43,559
yourself in the awareness whatever you're present for at

120
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:45,760
the

121
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
moment

122
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

123
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

124
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
for

125
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
for

126
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

127
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

128
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

129
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

130
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

131
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

132
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

133
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:25,039
and then as we come to the end of this

134
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:32,840
sitting take a three breath

135
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:41,840
Journey but with each breath with each exhale steady yourself

136
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,398
here settle yourself

137
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
here

138
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,640
and to whatever degree you feel steadied or

139
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:29,600
settled grounded here

140
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:36,960
prepare yourself for ending this meditation by turning your attention

141
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,840
outward into the world around you to the people in your

142
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:52,559
lives strangers neighbors the people you might encounter

143
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:59,600
today and gaze upon them steadily calmly

144
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:13,879
with a steady gaze gaze upon them

145
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:25,520

146

and appreciation to gaze upon others with

147
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:44,919
appreciation wishing that they fulfill their capacity for joy and

148
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:51,360
happiness may all beings be

149
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,519

peaceful may all beings be

152
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:26,440
[Music]

153
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,200
free thank

154
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
you

155
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:41,200
so welcome to this second day of the fifth week

156
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,679
introduction to mindfulness and these first few day

157
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:55,159
couple of days this week I want to emphasize the partnership of mindfulness and

158
00:29:55,159 --> 00:30:01,000
concentration Sati and some and that

159
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,399
um these two work together and

160
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,960
um and uh the concentration or samade brings a

161
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:18,080
steadiness brings a ability in the steadiness of mind to have a continuous

162
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,159
awareness of something mindfulness kind of opens the space to be

163
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:30,880
aware and and concentration of keeps us connected so that there's a kind of a

164
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,399
chance to really uh feel and sense something to really get absorbed in

165
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:41,679
something uh to really stay present without being

166
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,760
distracted by the baggage as I talked about yesterday that we carry or picking

167
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:53,720
up baggage or without becoming distracted from what we're paying attention

168
00:30:53,960 --> 00:31:00,919
to the um uh when we the mindfulness being the initial kind of awareness or

169
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:06,240
recognition of something uh can be engaged in different

170
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:13,600
ways and it's helpful to think of sometimes that the knowing of mindfulness the being aware of

171
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:20,159
something that uh with the Mind's Eye the mind's sense um we can have the

172
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,559
sense that we're get really right close to something like really right there

173
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:31,440
with the sensations in the body are right there with the emotions as they're experiencing in the

174
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,919
body or we can step back 1 2 3 feet

175
00:31:36,919 --> 00:31:46,039
steps and just kind of from a distance be aware of something we don't have to be iMed or right up against something

176
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:52,440
sometimes it's helpful to step back and um like with fear uh if we're really

177
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,639
really close to fear it might feel like it's too much and almost like it is more

178
00:31:57,639 --> 00:32:07,000
activating activates more fear but if we can step back and uh and with a wide perspective

179
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,200
what lots of room for the for the fear then maybe the fear is manageable we can

180
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:18,320
stay with it and feel it and I've known people for whom uh they did the exercise

181
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:25,720
of imagining uh how far back what they have to be in order to feel able to stay

182
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:32,240
present for something those very difficult and some people talk about you know being you know across the street or

183
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:38,760
up on a hill nearby looking back at themselves sitting and meditating and then they can be with it but if they're

184
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,799
really right in the middle of the challenge it's just too much for them so

185
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:49,639
awareness mindfulness can kind of adjust the lens that we're we're present for

186
00:32:49,639 --> 00:32:57,399
the lens can be uh close up the lens can be uh maybe panoramic almost stepping

187
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:04,600
back quite far and getting the big picture uh it's possible to uh for the

188
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:11,760
the mindfulness to feel uh very uh kind of uh like a close-up that's a very

189
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,080
little piece of something and it's possible to take in again the panoramic

190
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,480
the big picture and learning how to adjust the aperture adjust the distance

191
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,960
the lens that we're using is very very skillful because some things are

192
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,159
difficult to be present for some things are may be much easier to be with but

193
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:38,919
even there the useful mindfulness and different circumstances is at a

194
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:45,720
different distance or different aperture different closeness and uh so for example if

195
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,399
there's a lot of agitation in the mind um it might be best just to step back

196
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:59,679
and take the big picture oh here's an a here's an agitated mind here's an agitated body and to go in getting close

197
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:07,080
to any one particular sensation of agitation just agitates us more but other times it might be

198
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:13,240
something that is uh um that is very particular in the body and mind is

199
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:19,358
fairly steady and then it could be interesting to bring the attention really close in and just even in a

200
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:24,720
little square centimeter in the body just be there to feel what's

201
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:31,919
there and then the the concentration then is the steadiness with whatever

202
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,960
aperture whatever lens we're using for mindfulness To Be steady so that we

203
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,398
don't bounce off easily or get distracted easily so how do the function

204
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:48,679
of concentration is to steady that awareness stay right here and or to or

205
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:54,280
or to bring a kind of respect whereas where concentration is kind of the act

206
00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:01,839
of respect that keeps us being present for something um I've been at uh social

207
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:08,200
Gatherings where someone sees me a little bit across from a distance and and uh like you know someone who just

208
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:13,920
has to go say hello to a lot of people and they um they see me and they look like they're delighted to see me and

209
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,200
they come over and by the time they're shaking my hand their hand has gone limp and their eyes have gone over to the

210
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:25,480
next person and so I I wasn't met it was like we were getting ready to meet and

211
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:32,560
see each other clearly but the person just glances off and so we don't want to do that with our inner experience when

212
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:39,720
we meditate we want to like to have time to really know hear this with respect so

213
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:46,520
the concentration is a steadiness the the subtleness and that subtleness and

214
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:52,760
steadiness of mindfulness can be done at different aperture so the example I'm using of coming together like this might

215
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:59,599
not be you know what's called for maybe it's like this sometimes maybe it's just like from a distance say

216
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:05,200
hey hi I see you over there and that sense of hi I'm here and you're way over

217
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:11,280
there can make it easier to be with sadness or with anger or something that

218
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:18,560
is uh or just a spinning mind that uh kind of settles something helps us to be

219
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:25,520
with it and present and um and so mindfulness is a little bit

220
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:31,599
more um I think of it closer closer to wisdom

221
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:39,400
that the knowing of mindfulness helps us decide what form of mindfulness what

222
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:46,319
aperture lens we use and also it helps us uh to decide uh how to settle on the

223
00:36:46,319 --> 00:36:51,560
experience do we settle through our whole body being grounded here and that

224
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:57,520
sense of being grounded and settled gives us a kind of an independent feeling that I'm I can can be here with

225
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:04,480
whatever comes up or is a steadiness more mental like just that somehow the

226
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,560
the uh the attention of the Mind relaxes or settles in the into the experience

227
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:18,920
right there another way of thinking of all this is that concentration is left hand and

228
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:24,920
mindfulness is right hand and they come together to in a cup hands like this and

229
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:32,240
so then we hold The Experience difficult experiences like maybe a lot of fear um

230
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:39,079
can just be held by both of these and because they're together there's a little bit more uh fullness a little

231
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:44,760
more subtl more more something that can receive in the moment and through

232
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:50,440
moments there's a continuity and uh all along the way that

233
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:57,560
uh this continuity and subtleness and attention can be supported uh sometimes

234
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:03,680
is to breathe with the experience or breathe um into the experience or

235
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:11,200
through the experience there's something about the continuity of breathing coming and going that creates

236
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,599
kind of like it's kind of like the Beat of the Music there's both the the tune

237
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:23,240
and the beat somehow and and so and so the beat kind of just keeps going and

238
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:28,640
and uh studies or kind of grounds the music in a certain kind of way and

239
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:34,319
so the the beat is the continuity of this rhythm of breathing that protects

240
00:38:34,319 --> 00:38:39,720
us from getting caught in thoughts and reactivity and also uh keeps the

241
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:45,400
awareness little bit present and supports the concentration supports the

242
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:51,480
the respectful attending staying lingering just being with it and if you

243
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:59,359
have this idea of a three breath Journey there can be for whatever you're aware of just be aware for three

244
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:06,560
breaths sometimes that's enough for it to be fully acknowledged and no longer need to more

245
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,800
attention sometimes we give too much attention to some things where we get

246
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:17,079
confused between thinking about something or trying to fix something

247
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:22,440
make it go away and mindfulness itself and to have just three breaths with

248
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:28,800
something makes it easier just to keep it really simple know it and then let it be and come come back to just grounded

249
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,160
just in the breathing if that thing is still calling attention do another three

250
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:41,839
breath journey of course you can stay longer with things but there's something um protective about just three

251
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:47,040
breaths and then gently Begin Again with just the breathing and then three

252
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:53,280
breaths with something else or the same thing and come back and if that seems too complicated or too busy then of

253
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,880
course you don't have to do it but it might um a nice Rhythm for helping you

254
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:04,880
stay here present with uh Mindful

255
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,240
and and steadied mindful and

256
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:19,800
concentrated Mindful and uh centered concentered on here this present

257
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,359
now so um

258
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:33,560
um so the blending or the marriage or the partnership of mindfulness and

259
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:38,880
concentration is a great support for this practice and so all the things we've been I've been teaching these last

260
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,079
few weeks each step along the way uh can be

261
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:51,560
um partnered with a little bit of lingering of staying of steadying steadying with experience steadying

262
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:56,839
ourselves with Body Sensations with breathing steuding ourselves elves with

263
00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:03,960
emotions studying oursel not with thinking so we think more but studying ourselves we're

264
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:09,680
studying awareness mindfulness with the experience we're studying all studying

265
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:16,720
all of ourselves with here to be here so we can discover how to be

266
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:24,680
independent of what is known how they can be uh we can know but that knowing

267
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:32,160
that awareness is not entangled with what is known it stands independent and

268
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:39,359
in that Independence we can provide more respect for each and everything if we're

269
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,480
entangled there's no room for respect even though you might think that

270
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:52,880
this is respect to be kind of all caught up with someone but if we're like this then the

271
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:58,839
meeting of whatever awareness knows can be done with

272
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:07,160
respect so may mindfulness may you keep mindfulness

273
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:12,480
close to you throughout the day so that whoever you

274
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,680
meet whatever activity you're doing whatever objects you're involved in

275
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:24,160
washing the dishes that you do so with respect for each and

276
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,160
everything thank you
