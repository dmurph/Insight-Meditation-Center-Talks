1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:07,200
okay so we'll go ahead and get started I know some folks are still continuing

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,360
to join but let's go ahead since it's the top of the hour

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,400
uh this week the theme is I'm going to

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,160
call it flavors of the Dharma and I'll say a bit more about that term flavor

5
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:30,300
after the sit when we when we get started but just as a little Preamble

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,940
um Dharma teachings and Dharma practice can have

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,899
distinct flavors or emotional tones at different times like the way a poem or a

8
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,000
scene in a movie could have a flavor you know like it could be dark or joyous or

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,260
suspenseful but of course the difference for the Dharma is that there tend to be flavors

10
00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:01,500
that support practice in particular ways and maybe part of the art of practice is

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:06,960
to know what tone to take when relating to experience

12
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,000
so each day this week we're going to take up one flavor and there will be a

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,080
couple aspects to exploring it we'll look at some sutus where the tone of the

14
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:26,580
teaching conveys that flavor because the Buddha had a variety of teaching styles to fit the circumstances

15
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,220
and then secondly we'll consider when in our practice it might be appropriate to

16
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:39,420
bring forth that flavor or that emotional tone and today's flavor will be very

17
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,900
foundational we're going to look at love or compassion it's a flavor

18
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:52,520
um but first let's meditate together let's get started on that

19
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:59,700
so settling in for to your meditation posture

20
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,659
and if it's comfortable to do so gently closing your eyes so that the attention

21
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:14,400
comes inward and the meditations for this week

22
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:23,160
will touch into what are called the elements in Buddhist understanding and these are

23
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:30,140
not literal substances materials but they're really actually more experiences

24
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:35,280
that we can find in the body and and even in the mind

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,220
to some degree so we'll highlight one element each day

26
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:46,980
and they might have a connection to the flavor or emotional tone that we'll be

27
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,340
exploring each day we could maybe imagine a connection

28
00:02:53,099 --> 00:03:00,140
so again touching into the sitting posture

29
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:07,319
that you've taken perhaps feeling the contact points

30
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:13,620
where you're sitting so your seat against the chair or the cushion or if

31
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,379
you're lying down you're against what you're lying on maybe your legs or feet

32
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:27,120
are against the floor and so you have a sense of the contact

33
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:33,720
with where you're sitting and allowing yourself to feel into the

34
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,360
stability of that the groundedness

35
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,980
perhaps even softening into those touch points

36
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:58,519
so that you feel yourself giving over your weight to what you're sitting on

37
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:02,540
and ultimately to the Earth

38
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,060
it's useful at the beginning of a sip to take just a moment to

39
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,419
really get balanced where you're sitting so you can even shift from side to side

40
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:29,419
or forward and back just to really align

41
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:44,400
and then we can notice the way the body kind of Rises up from the stable base

42
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,560
as if it's buoyed upward or maybe like a sea plant off the sea floor

43
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,280
allowing ourselves to be drawn upward or if you're lying down you can sense the

44
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,740
natural straightness of the spine when you've tuned yourself into a meditative

45
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:13,440
mind I'm just softening various areas that we

46
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:20,160
may hold habitual tension softening the eyes and the eye sockets

47
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,660
softening the face

48
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,240
the jaw

49
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:46,560
softening the shoulders letting them drop maybe Imagining the

50
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,259
shoulder blades sliding down the back

51
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,460
allowing the arms and hands to relax

52
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:18,320
and down into the chest area

53
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:24,440
letting that be soft open

54
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,160
or if you feel tension just being okay with that

55
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:40,199
releasing what can be released in the belly in the low back

56
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:47,120
letting both of those perhaps soften on the out breath

57
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:00,440
and down into the hip joints

58
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,800
the groin muscles the thighs

59
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,539
that place that's supporting you if you're sitting up just letting that open

60
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:18,180
a bit more down into the lower legs and all the way

61
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:24,840
into the feet just inviting

62
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,759
some ease through this body

63
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,699
and now as you as you look through the body if you will

64
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:08,160
with mindfulness notice any places that feel

65
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:17,240
warm like often the core area may feel warm

66
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,639
the hands are warm and others not

67
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,639
generally areas that feel warm and also you may notice in cooler places

68
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:35,880
contrast and this quality of heat

69
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,959
or coolness is called the fire element

70
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,959
it's an experience in the body that's often there there's often a

71
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:54,140
temperature associated with parts of the body

72
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,260
so that just notes the presence of fire element

73
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:08,660
one of the constituents of form the material world

74
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:21,139
so you can then bring attention particularly to the heart area

75
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,279
maybe imagining breathing in and out of the

76
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:35,459
heart area not the literal physical heart but notice that area

77
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:39,500
energetic area of the body

78
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:46,200
and if it's a little weird to imagine breathing in and out of the front of the

79
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:53,040
chest you can imagine how the air coming into the lungs flows around the

80
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:59,420
heart area naturally lungs lungs around the heart

81
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,399
and scenting into whatever quality of fire element is present in the heart

82
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:19,519
maybe it's a lot maybe it's a little after seeing if you can detect that

83
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,019
no continuing with a little bit of imaginative practice

84
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:06,839
just imagining gently spreading the heat around the

85
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,940
body the fire element from the heart area using the breath

86
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:19,620
so as you breathe in perhaps feeling a gathering of the energy and on the out breath

87
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:26,480
and biting it to spread throughout the system

88
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:37,459
perhaps it's more natural on the in-breath to spread the Heat

89
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:43,079
throughout all the little tissues of the body just the natural heat we have we're

90
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:48,420
not engineering anything but just allowing it to spread through

91
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,540
the body as it wishes to

92
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:32,040
maybe as you feel warmth or heat touching a certain area

93
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:38,100
like if it's spreading into your legs or feet allowing it to

94
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:44,899
there to be relaxation as the heat spreads in

95
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:56,339
keep working along with that a sense of care for yourself

96
00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:04,200
Just As You Are no sense that anything needs to change about how you are right now

97
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,440
they might call it a very basic sense of positive regard

98
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,839
or this being right now

99
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,399
we'll we'll let go of that imaginative and more directive part of the

100
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,500
meditation and just settle into feeling the breath in the

101
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,540
body relaxing my mind and opening to

102
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,500
receptive mindfulness

103
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:19,820
but maintaining perhaps that gentle sense of positive regard that sense of

104
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,560
caring through the heart area

105
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:32,240
and now just letting the breath energy spread through the body

106
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,360
and being receptive to experience as it comes and goes just simple mindfulness

107
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,720
practice

108
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:51,980
staying with the flow of experience

109
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,480
in the present moment

110
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,740
if the mind has wandered away into thought

111
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:46,919
just gently returning to the breath perhaps touching into the heart area or

112
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:53,700
the sense of warmth in the body letting the fire element be a reminder

113
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:59,880
of the present moment and softening into that

114
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,880
sense of warmth

115
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,240
foreign

116
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:42,659
foreign foreign

117
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,000
foreign

118
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:31,880
foreign

119
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,159
foreign

120
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:12,440
and in the last few minutes of this meditation

121
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:19,559
again inviting in our imagination to sense

122
00:27:19,559 --> 00:27:25,679
the fire element in the body as a direct experience actually it

123
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:32,880
doesn't need imagination [Music] sensing the direct experience and then

124
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:39,419
imagining kind of spreading it throughout the body inviting it to

125
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:44,240
touching to all aspects of our being

126
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:54,840
and what would it be like to carry this sense of warmth and Flow

127
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:02,960
and a connection to our heart area out into our lives today

128
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:11,539
what would it be like to let whatever degree of warmth is there

129
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:19,799
spread out to meet other beings to meet the Earth the environment

130
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:28,460
it's not about how much there is but really how we use it

131
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:34,279
using it well

132
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:44,279
bringing some sense of warmth the softness of care

133
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:47,360
into the world

134
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:55,440
not with an agenda or a course

135
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,900
but simply because that's the way we are today

136
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:09,120
to the degree possible and see the result of that see how just that natural degree of heat

137
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,419
to whatever it is can have an impact

138
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,720
in a very simple way so that's an invitation to

139
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,000
to try out today if it's of Interest

140
00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:22,140
okay so the first question is were you able

141
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:30,179
to hear the Bell I've been having some trouble sometimes with the Bell not transmitting on over

142
00:30:30,179 --> 00:30:36,659
the Electronic Connection so if you didn't hear it the Bell did ring

143
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:43,278
and please let me know in the chat so that I will know what to do tomorrow

144
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:52,220
and in the meantime we'll go ahead with the talk

145
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:03,779
so this week is called flavors of the Dharma as I mentioned

146
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:09,559
novel okay thank you we'll fix that tomorrow

147
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:15,960
um this week is called flavors of the Dharma and I mentioned just briefly before the

148
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,419
sitting but in case you weren't here we'll be exploring how certain teachings

149
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:29,580
have a distinct emotional tone or flavor that is meant to support practice

150
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:35,159
um and the the reason I've chosen this particular lens or way of seeing it is

151
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:42,179
that there is a a precedent for it from the aesthetic culture of ancient India

152
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:47,880
um the Buddha was teaching in a cultural context that included a highly developed

153
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:53,460
aesthetic sense so he was in this environment and of course spiritual

154
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:59,760
teachings are distinct from art like poetry but still there was this context

155
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:06,600
surrounding the presentation of spiritual teachings if you will which also have an emotional tone of course

156
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:13,620
and there was a word for this it's called rasa r-a-s-a which means nectar

157
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:20,520
or Essence or taste and it it's the emotional experience that's evoked in

158
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:27,960
the listener and there was a standard set of Rosas that were evoked in art this was kind of

159
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:33,960
understood and people in the sort of high up in Indian society would have

160
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:42,480
known about these Rosas and we see them some of them reflected in the sutas

161
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:52,500
so today we have the rasa of Love or Compassion or more generally care and

162
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:58,980
all of these in a spiritual sense of course in the regular Arts they would include romantic love or other things

163
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:06,779
like that but within the sutas we do see a flavor of care in a spiritual sense in

164
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:12,799
a way that would support or practice or path toward Liberation

165
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:20,220
and so um you know with each of these flavors we'll look at sutas that are examples of it and we'll consider when

166
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:26,460
and how that flavor is useful in our practice so I hope that will be of of Interest this week

167
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:33,000
so this Flavor of Love or care it really underlies and supports Dharma practice

168
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,720
at a base level there's a suta about the king of kosova

169
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:46,200
whose name was King vicinity and he was a follower of the Buddha a devoted

170
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:51,299
follower but not a great meditator very sincere nonetheless

171
00:33:51,299 --> 00:33:58,740
and in this teaching he is talking to his Queen whose name was Queen Malika

172
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:05,039
and he says to her my dear Queen is there anyone more dear

173
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:11,099
to you than yourself and apparently he was hoping that she

174
00:34:11,099 --> 00:34:16,398
would say why yes you are more dear to me than myself

175
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:23,099
but that's not what she says actually what she says is there's no one great

176
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:29,099
king more dear to me than myself kind of straightforward and then she

177
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:35,520
asks him the same thing and says well well King is there anyone more dear to you than yourself

178
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:41,220
and given how the conversation has go gone up to that point he has to reply

179
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:47,820
and kind well no actually there is no one more dear to me than myself

180
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:54,000
and he's a little um taken by this conversation and so he

181
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,500
goes to the Buddha and he says everything that happened in that conversation and the Buddha excuses it

182
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:08,220
as an opportunity to offer an ethical message of care you know so the Buddha

183
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:13,920
approves of what the queen said and he says having traversed all quarters with

184
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,820
the mind one finds none anywhere dearer than oneself

185
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:27,540
likewise each person holds himself most dear or herself most dear hence one who

186
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:35,460
loves herself should not harm others so we see that this sense of you know

187
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:42,660
being dear to ourself is actually in this suit up pointed to as the basis for

188
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:49,440
caring for others so at a base level we are generally dear to

189
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,140
ourselves we care about ourselves in some way and this is normal and is in

190
00:35:55,140 --> 00:36:00,599
fact the basis for wholesome conduct so the Buddha is praising this the

191
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:06,540
Queen's assertion of self-love um

192
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:15,780
in another suta with this same King vicinity the king notes that people who engage in

193
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:22,740
unwholesome actions treat themselves as a foe even if they say they are holding

194
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:28,740
themselves dear and also people who engage in wholesome

195
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:36,960
actions treat themselves as dear even if they say they regard themselves as a foe

196
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,540
and the Buddha again agrees with him so

197
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:47,880
so our actions you know if we are

198
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:54,180
behaving poorly out in the world we're lying or we're manipulating people or

199
00:36:54,180 --> 00:37:00,540
we're being unkind in some way even if we say we're doing it because we care about ourselves we're standing up for

200
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:07,859
ourselves we're I don't take care of myself who will we're treating ourselves as a foe

201
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:15,119
because we're engaging in these harmful actions that actually have an impact on us even if we think we're helping

202
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:24,720
ourselves and people who attempt to live ethically who try to be kind who don't lie or

203
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,660
steal or manipulate um sometimes people like that will say

204
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:36,119
that they're unhappy with themselves and um you know that they don't love

205
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:43,859
themselves so much but these very actions of trying to care wanting to care are good for us they help us at

206
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:52,020
some level so we could get in better alignment actually by also loving ourselves also being kind to ourselves

207
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:58,859
so we see that the Buddha is quite clear that ethics and positive self-regard overlap

208
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:05,880
ethical conduct is the basis of bateful path and so is care for ourselves and

209
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:10,920
others there's another suta that says this in a

210
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:16,859
nice way there's a story of a newly ordained Monk who keeps having

211
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:24,420
difficulty following the monastic rules because there's so many of them right but the other monks so he's always kind

212
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:31,200
of making mistakes and looking awkward the other monks are you know he didn't

213
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:38,760
do that right but they sense that he is proceeding from deep love and faith in

214
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:44,880
the Buddha you know he's ordained out of really deep faith and so you know when

215
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,940
they think about it they decide not to discipline him very much because it might dampen his faith and love and they

216
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:56,040
don't that would be more harmful for him so they're they're kind to him and

217
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:02,700
eventually he grows into being able to manage the monastic life and and live up

218
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:08,579
to all the rules that there are so we have this sense again that deep

219
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:15,980
love and faith as a basis for practice really help things to unfold well

220
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:22,800
if we look across the suit as [Music] probably the case that the Buddha rarely

221
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,380
displayed what we would conventionally consider to be love here in the west

222
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:33,960
many of his teachings were a little analytical or a

223
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,540
little tough sometimes to wake people up a little bit but many of his teachings

224
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:44,839
you know really were profoundly caring he met people right where they were

225
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:50,339
using language that they could understand that in and of itself is an

226
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:56,579
act of care and love and compassion you know for example there's a story of

227
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:03,240
I think many of you know the story of Kisa gotami who was a a woman who whose

228
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:09,599
child had died and you know she she wasn't really a practitioner at that

229
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:17,160
time but and she was so distraught that her son had died that she was actually carrying him around while he was dead

230
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:24,839
and trying to get somebody to to help her and people were turning away and she finally

231
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:30,780
found the Buddha a little bit when she was a little bit crazed and he said to her okay okay

232
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:36,599
um I can help you so she's oh thank goodness and he says go to a

233
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:43,320
house uh find a mustard seed from some household where no one has died and

234
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:49,040
bring me that Mustard Seed and so she sets off to do this task right

235
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:55,619
and you know Mustard Seed is hardly worth anything everybody would be willing to give her one but she goes

236
00:40:55,619 --> 00:41:03,800
from house to house and of course there isn't any household where no one has died so she learns in that way

237
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:11,160
that her situation although difficult is just real it's normal that's how it is

238
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:18,720
and that that was so much more profound of a way of learning it than anything

239
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:25,380
else you know that could have been offered it could have been told to her or explained to her or

240
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:33,420
um anything like that so this is a way where the Buddha was being profoundly carrying although you know somewhat uh

241
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:38,940
strong tough and she comes back and understands and is willing to bury her

242
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:44,160
son and she becomes a nun and becomes awakened as these stories go

243
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,800
so there are many many examples of love and compassion and Care in the Buddhist

244
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:56,400
teachings it's threaded all throughout and it also comes forth explicitly in some of the cases like the ones that

245
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:03,780
we've explored today so you know when is it appropriate to use this flavor or Savor maybe we could

246
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:09,660
say rasa is sometimes called Savor also Savor of Love or Compassion or care

247
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:16,260
I mean there are so many right but we could just name a few which is you know we need to give ourselves

248
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:21,660
we need to give ourselves time so we need to just do the practice

249
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:28,260
without seeking results or achievements you know it's it can sometimes seem

250
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:34,380
a little distant you know why am I sitting here trying to be with the breath I really need to think about this

251
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:39,480
problem that I have I have to work on this relationship that's what keeps

252
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:45,420
coming to mind but if we just stay with the breath stay with the body stay with the

253
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:51,359
mindfulness practice that we're doing uh it has a way of affecting us more

254
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:58,200
profoundly than we realize you know like going to house from house to house asking about a mustard seed

255
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:05,880
that was so much more effective than say grief counseling if you will

256
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:13,560
um you know when that instruction was given by the Buddha and she was willing to do it so you know there's this this doing of

257
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:19,560
the practice just to give ourselves time to unfold to let it let it do its work

258
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:25,079
that is profoundly loving and of course at moment when there's a

259
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:30,300
lot of duka we can bring self-compassion directly to our situation

260
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:37,680
um sometimes that might look like self-care in some way or or maybe just seeing clearly that what is what is

261
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,780
happening is the most loving thing that we can do we may not need to bring in ideas about

262
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:48,720
our story and other things but to see directly and feel feel how it is yeah

263
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:56,819
it's really hard right now without a story it's just this is it deeply compassionate

264
00:43:56,819 --> 00:44:02,520
and also you know love and care is the indirect basis for so much of cushion

265
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:08,579
practice there are so many cases where um in kind of in a standard sequence of

266
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:13,619
sitting down to get ready to meditate some of the sutures will say that the

267
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:19,260
practitioner sits down has an upright posture establishes compassion for all

268
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:25,560
beings and then brings mindfulness to the fore and begins to meditate so we

269
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:33,480
can do this also is have a sense that we're meditating out of compassion for ourselves and all others

270
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:41,940
so I really see this as a foundation for so much of what we do it helps so much unfold when we have a basis of love or

271
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:50,000
care and I'm careful to use those General words so that we can find our own way of meeting that

272
00:44:50,579 --> 00:44:57,720
today in the United States it's a holiday it's Juneteenth which celebrates

273
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:04,319
or commemorates the emancipation of African-American slaves in 1865.

274
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:09,960
and so maybe it's appropriate that we talk today about ethics and love and

275
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:15,359
compassion and care as a basis for ourselves our

276
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:21,680
life our relationships and indeed our whole society

277
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:27,540
so tomorrow we'll be on to a different flavor a different rasa five of them

278
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:33,660
this week and I hope you'll enjoy this tour of some of our some of the emotional tones

279
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:40,099
that we see in the in the Buddhist teachings will be well
