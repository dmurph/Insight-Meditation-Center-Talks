00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,920
hello everyone

2
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:28,380
I appreciate the opportunity to be here with you and to offer these words and

3
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,940
to have a sense of so many of you who are participating have been doing so for a very long time and

4
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:43,399
it's a I feel like it's a wonderful thing we share here and thank you for the opportunity

5
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:50,760
so some of you most of you know that when often usually when I start these

6
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,300
guided meditations I put some emphasis on relaxation

7
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:04,619
if I one of my preferred things to add is that we relax with a posture that has

8
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:10,200
some uh expression of alertness

9
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,020
and um and there's many ways of doing that of course and we have to have a posture

10
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:23,340
that works for us but even if you're sitting back in a chair or for example

11
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,799
um maybe you can put your hands in a place in a way in your lap on your thighs

12
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:36,258
in such a way that like it it kind of expresses I am here

13
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:44,180
but the emphasis I want to make today is I often start with relaxation

14
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:50,579
and there's a way of understanding Dharma practice

15
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:56,579
that uh it involves a con ever deepening process

16
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:02,159
of relaxation of loosening dissolving Letting Go

17
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,819
releasing and that relaxation is just one way to describe this

18
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:15,420
and so rather than dismissing relaxation as being kind of um you know

19
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:22,160
a beginner meditation or something simplistic or

20
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,640
maybe to appreciate that it actually contains within it the profundity of the Dharma

21
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:37,440
it uh all we're doing in a sense is ever deepening relaxation until the final

22
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,920
relaxation is an opportunity to let go of all ways in which we hold tight that

23
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,040
were caught up that we are preoccupied that we are attached

24
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,640
so I say this as a way of appreciating the beginning appreciating the

25
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,860
relaxation there's something about it in it with it

26
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,260
that has a goodness to it that has a ripeness that has a pleasure

27
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:13,860
trust that take time to feel that let that be a guide for you

28
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:20,220
so taking an alert posture even if you're laying on your back you

29
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:27,420
could maybe stick your point your hands up to the ceiling with your elbows on the side resting in something

30
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,400
but the forearm pointing up

31
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:43,939
and then to gently close your eyes

32
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:51,599
and take a moment to feel your body before doing any relaxation at all or doing anything

33
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,000
as a way of respecting yourself respecting your body

34
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:06,980
respecting this moment take a few seconds here just feel and sense what is here for you

35
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:27,600
and then taking some long comfortably long inhales

36
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:34,919
and relaxing the body on the exhale could be the whole body or particular

37
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:37,400
places

38
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:25,139
and then letting your breathing return to normal and I'll guide you if you want to follow

39
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:30,240
with relaxing different parts of your body

40
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,780
and even if all you can do is soften around that part rather than relaxing something

41
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:44,160
see if you can appreciate whatever pleasure goodness a sense of this is

42
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,660
right that comes with that relaxation even if the relaxation reveals some

43
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:58,500
discomfort maybe there's some rightness to it knowing it to feeling it rather than

44
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:07,460
ignoring it so on the exhale relaxing the face

45
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,160
maybe relaxing around the eyes

46
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,539
the eyes themselves letting them rest in their sockets

47
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,979
not looking with your eyes at anything

48
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:41,340
the looking can rest

49
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,720
the back of your eyes

50
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,819
relaxing the shoulders

51
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:10,020
and even if they don't relax maybe your shoulders appreciate

52
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:15,680
care that relaxing expresses

53
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,160
on the exhale relaxing in the chest

54
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,840
relaxing the belly

55
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:27,979
relaxing the thighs and down the legs

56
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:46,399
relaxing the arms down to the hands

57
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:08,040
and then again relaxing in the shoulders but this time

58
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,760
as you do so also relax the relaxing

59
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,420
the way that you relax let it be relaxed

60
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,180
without expectation without needing the relaxation to happen

61
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:34,760
an impulse and signal to relax that is very

62
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,240
relaxed itself

63
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,620
and then doing a relaxed way relax the thinking mind

64
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:13,160
if there's any tension or pressure or preoccupation around thoughts

65
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:22,519
relax any tension or pressure associated with that

66
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:51,620
and relax the Mind as a whole so the mind is

67
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,399
calmer or Stiller

68
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:03,380
without needing to be directed anywhere just here

69
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:21,139
in in whatever degree of calm the mind has

70
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:29,779
allow the inhale the experience of inhale

71
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:37,399
to show itself in the mind to be known in the mind

72
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:49,920
so the mind doesn't go to the breathing the experience of breathing comes to the

73
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,279
mind

74
00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:00,860
receptive available

75
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:22,820
and then on the exhale relax with the exhale release let go

76
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:29,880
anywhere in your body and mind where it feels good to do so

77
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,839
it could be just in the breathing itself in the exhale itself

78
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:25,880
relaxing on the exhale giving yourself over to the relaxation

79
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:37,500
so at the end of the exhale that your awareness is more ready and

80
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:43,160
receptive for the inhale

81
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:08,120
taking a moment to feel your mind

82
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:14,840
if there's any ways in which to feel tight or contracted

83
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:20,000
Hard Solid tense

84
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,700
as you exhale

85
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:33,360
let it dissolve let it soften

86
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,299
maybe first it softens on the edges

87
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:38,000
if you are involved in thinking

88
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:47,940
that's a sign that something within could use relaxing softening

89
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:24,720
and then as we come to the end of the sitting take two three four breaths

90
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:31,559
on the exhale to relax as deeply in your being as you

91
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:37,620
can maybe if it's a long little longer than

92
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:45,799
usual exhale to Exhale from the surface of your body all the way to the Core

93
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:29,820
and then from whatever feeling for relaxation that you have

94
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:34,100
feeling of being softer perhaps

95
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,399
to open your awareness

96
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:50,899
to take in the room you're sitting in the building

97
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,240
neighborhood

98
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:04,980
wider community your attention goes out receptively out

99
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:11,820
into the whole land the whole continent

100
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,019
the whole world

101
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:24,259
and letting that open attentiveness to the whole world around you

102
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:31,820
be the medium for carrying your good will

103
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,740
you're well wishing for the world

104
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:47,039
a simple idea that it would be wonderful for people to be happy and safe

105
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:54,000
free and peaceful how wonderful and

106
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,240
that you would like that there is a wish for you

107
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:06,080
may all beings be happy

108
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:11,179
may all beings be safe

109
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:17,240
may all beings be peaceful

110
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,000
may all beings be free

111
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:31,080
and even if such a broad Universal wish could never actually be

112
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:36,840
accomplished it makes a difference

113
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,158
to have that wish

114
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:49,279
for many people it makes a difference for them to know that there are people who care

115
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:59,640
enough to wish them well may all beings be wished well

116
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:07,039
may all beings know of people who wish them well

117
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:14,179
may we be well wishers

118
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,380
[Music]

119
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:42,679
thank you

120
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,799
so hello and to the second talk

121
00:30:55,799 --> 00:31:02,460
on these five wholesome States

122
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:10,320
of receptivity of softness of these are five areas of inspiration

123
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:19,220
that are considered wholesome mental states to develop to evoke

124
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:26,760
and um and these are the kind of focused of states which are self-protecting

125
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:33,120
meaning that as we cultivate these they protect us from the opposite

126
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,059
so yesterday that team was a Readiness a receptivity

127
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:45,059
that if we try too hard to be ready strain or something to be receptive

128
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:52,620
we actually diminished the receptivity the Readiness the Readiness has to have within it a

129
00:31:52,620 --> 00:32:00,059
kind of letting go of a certain kind of straining intense unwholesome effort

130
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:07,320
so today the topic is the wholesome state that are really helpful for this

131
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:12,600
process of the practice and even listening to the Dharma

132
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,640
preparing ourselves for the deepening today's wholesome

133
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:24,120
state is malleability sometimes the word is sometimes is

134
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,640
translated as soft so becoming the

135
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:36,000
the beeswax become soft enough that it can be made into something shaped into

136
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,960
something and I love telling the story so some of you have heard it many times I apologize

137
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,240
but the when my son was in kindergarten once a week they would make little

138
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:54,779
animals with beeswax and the beeswax that they were going to use was up by the shelf and when they went to get it

139
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:59,820
it was always very hard and you couldn't really shape it and

140
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:05,820
they instructed to hold it in the palms of both hands kind of hold the

141
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:11,220
the beeswax between the two hands and then the teacher would proceed to tell a story

142
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:16,700
and by the time the story was finished the beeswax was soft enough for them to

143
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:23,519
malleable enough to to make into something beautiful little animal

144
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:30,000
so same with our mind if we can hold it in the Embrace of awareness of

145
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:36,679
mindfulness uh without reacting without forcing without doing but just really stay there

146
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:41,820
our whole being will begin to relax the mind will beginning to relax

147
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:47,220
and relaxing the body is a way of softening the mind

148
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:53,580
so it's very important not to undervalue the relaxed body undervalue relaxation

149
00:33:53,580 --> 00:34:02,760
itself we want to become acutely sensitive in this practice to attention to strain to any kind of

150
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:10,440
stress involved in how we practice so it can be relaxed and soft but not so relaxed that we fall asleep

151
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:18,060
or that we are become kind of complacent there is a Kind of Wonderful balance between being

152
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:23,580
upright being alert physically and mentally and letting that alertness

153
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:30,358
relax letting that kind of soften not collapse but kind of settle deeply but

154
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:35,940
staying alert and um so one of those qualities of this kind

155
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:42,240
of wholesome mind is a malleability softness it's sometimes often in the Buddha's

156
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,878
teachings it's paired up with a word that means workability

157
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:53,158
sometimes translated as a wheeledness but uh the ability to make something

158
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:58,500
with the mind um the word the words come from the word Kama to make

159
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:04,460
and um and so there's a time in meditation practice where the mind is so

160
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:11,820
ready peaceful we're so present we're here and there's a feeling oh no I can start

161
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:18,180
a kind of applying my attention with more freedom with more ease it's not a

162
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:26,820
struggle there's not preoccupation uh you know or a strong Tendencies to be caught up in thought now I'm really here

163
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:33,180
and with because I'm here there's a the mind the attention the awareness there's

164
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:38,640
a a wildiness it's a workability it can be

165
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,980
applied it can be engaged there's some kind of way in which the home mind

166
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:49,500
becomes malleable and uh the example I I like for this

167
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,540
malleability is in my early years being a Zen student

168
00:35:54,540 --> 00:36:00,680
we would sit in a very particular kind of posture very upright very straight

169
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:06,980
and and very balanced posture kind of a yogic posture almost

170
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:12,480
and we got up very early in the morning sometimes like before 4 30 in the

171
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,760
morning we're awake in the monastery and we went to bed at maybe nine o'clock

172
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,980
so you know I would people are often tired

173
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:30,540
and um but uh there was a custom of teachers to walk around and adjust people's postures

174
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:37,859
during meditation you know just in case it wasn't just lined up it was leaning or slouching or something

175
00:36:37,859 --> 00:36:43,200
and um and uh we would be you know the teachers would

176
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:49,320
come from behind we were sitting and what they would do is uh gently put their hands on the back of our shoulder

177
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:55,440
one shoulder just to let us know they were there and then they would proceed with both hands to kind of usually from the back

178
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,839
the shoulders or the back to adjust it and all done silently

179
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:07,560
during meditation and there was an interesting phenomena that if I was preoccupied in my thoughts

180
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:13,740
during meditation and I felt that hand on my shoulder I would startle

181
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:19,740
um and it was like a physical startle reflex but if I was really present I was not

182
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:26,640
preoccupied in thoughts and then it would still be just a surprise to feel the hand on my shoulder

183
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,820
I wasn't expecting it I didn't it would just come out of the blue but it would touch my shoulder and

184
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:38,160
immediately my whole body would become softer and a receptive and it would be this

185
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:45,900
kind of softness that they're just like almost like I was already soft and just ready to kind of flow and move with that

186
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:51,300
whatever movement the teacher wanted to put on me so I learned from that the impact of

187
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:58,980
being preoccupied that when I'm preoccupied in thought and concerns that I don't become so fluid so

188
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:05,040
flexible I become inflexible I come fragile I become startable

189
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:11,660
and so to learn to uh to not be preoccupied

190
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:19,980
is a very important part of this process and it helps by taking time not to

191
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:25,380
dismiss being preoccupied and caught up in thought but rather to see it as a

192
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:32,720
valid area to be mindful of do when you do feel yourself really caught up in thoughts and ideas

193
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:39,660
is to start feeling the Mind feeling the body to feel how it might be tight how

194
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:47,519
it might be tense how it might be assertive or there's pressure in it or

195
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:55,680
um stress in it all these things that kind of would be not malleable not soft it's kind of the

196
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:03,420
thing is something is hard and we get to know that because if you know it that's like taking the beeswax

197
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:09,480
off the shelf and holding it in your hand so take the hardness of the Mind

198
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:16,500
and attention the pressure and don't make it a problem but make it something that you are willing to kind of hold

199
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:21,599
with the warmth with kindness with receptivity with the very thing we're

200
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:27,240
trying to develop this malleability this workability this receptivity see if you

201
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:33,359
can bring that to the places in your mind where you're not that way

202
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:39,240
see if that will soften it if it's easy enough to relax it relax

203
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:45,000
many people will meditators will learn to let go of thoughts without learning

204
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,579
to relax or soften the underlying pressure to think

205
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:56,099
and so you can let go of thoughts all you wish and that pressure will just pump out more thoughts

206
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:01,980
so we take time to soften and begin to appreciate then the softer

207
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:10,619
mind the receptive mind the malleable mind the mind that something surprising happens and it's the mind is not stunned

208
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:16,140
or shocked or or Frozen it's like the mind can just go with whatever's

209
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:24,240
happening oh okay like that um you know I think that certain uh

210
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:30,720
activities we do like maybe sports or playing music or uh maybe taking a walk

211
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:37,380
in nature being outdoors within a reason reasonable way there's

212
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:45,480
there's a way in which new things arise and it can be folded and included in this malleable wieldy a soft receptive

213
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:53,099
mind and it just kind of included as part of the whole so this uh cultivating and developing

214
00:40:53,099 --> 00:41:00,859
and appreciating a soft mind a malleable mind a wieldy mind a workable mind

215
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:06,660
and to know that this is a radical difference between a hard mind and a

216
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:13,200
soft mind an unreceptive mind and a receptive mind a

217
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:21,359
and be inspired by the possibility of a soft mind a malleable mind a workable mind

218
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,820
um attention awareness which has that quality awareness that maybe is like

219
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:31,859
mine may be a little bit like um soft butter and whatever happens it's

220
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:39,060
just like a knife going through soft butter just no pressure is needed or maybe as uh your hand moves through

221
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:44,460
water the water doesn't really offer much resistance and it's just there kind

222
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:49,920
of to softly there's softness and water to let the hand move through

223
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,099
so in the same way the awareness in the mind let that be soft for things to

224
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:02,280
happen and occur um being ready for anything surprised by nothing

225
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,980
um just kind of available and um

226
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:13,400
and part of the theme for this week is that these are states of inspiration

227
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,420
something that's a beautiful qualities of mine

228
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,940
that um so is there some way that you can be inspired by these by the softness

229
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:31,260
some ways you can cultivate it so appreciate it so I'd like to propose for homework

230
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:38,720
today that um that uh all of you assume

231
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:46,800
that into some degree you can evoke a softer mind than you

232
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,859
have in any given moment you can make it more malleable softer and more receptive

233
00:42:52,859 --> 00:42:58,200
and take some times through the day to make it so

234
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,839
don't think it's dramatic but what it requires is pausing it requires taking

235
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:10,680
some time to do this and I know for some of you taking time to do something like

236
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:16,319
this is very expensive it really is interrupts the efficiency of doing a lot

237
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:23,099
of things and doing the things that you're under pressure to do but uh I think it's well worth the

238
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:29,099
investment to take the time quality time to just even if it's just

239
00:43:29,099 --> 00:43:37,800
like two minutes to uh see if you could kind of soften the mind some and uh and get a sense and

240
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:43,859
feel of even small movements in that direction because in the long run

241
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:50,900
we live our lives much more effectively with this soft malleable mind that's

242
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:58,319
receptive and it's a more creative mind and um

243
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:04,079
so I hope that this is something you can have some feel for and some ability to

244
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:11,720
tap into and this would be a great day to do it so thank you very much
