warm greetings to everyone who is

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,560

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,880
also those of you i want to agree to will be listening to this later and

4
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:29,599
i also want to welcome you to this time and

5
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:36,160
i think we're all together whether it's in so many different places but also in

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,600
so many different times the amazing way in which

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,360
we can share this practice

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,719
in this electronic age

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,559
one of the

10
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,640
very significant very effective ways of engaging in mindfulness practice

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,560
whether it's on the cushion or in daily life is to develop the

12
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,759
orientation the dedication the love

13
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,159
for doing one thing at a time and then when you're doing something

14
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,680
to within reason unless something you know the something dramatic happens the

15
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,960
building starts burning or something and you know uh within reason uh stay with it and see it through to

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,640
the end to do one thing at a time and see it through to the end

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,320
so in meditation that can be as simple as

18
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,240
being present fully for the in-breath and seeing it through to the end staying

19
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,798
there really having a sense a kind of an attitude a

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,560
orientation a dedication a valuing

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,479
a um savoring a

22
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,000
love of just seeing it through to the end that in-breath

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,040
and then when the out-breath comes just that seeing that through the end

24
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,040
one thing at a time and sometimes we we do it kind of

25
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,319
renew it every in-breath and every out breath and a different way of continuity

26
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,400
develops and the continuity of okay now i'm going to just stay with the in-breath and out-breath without leaving at all

27
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,120
that kind that may be too big of a goal but the goal of just seeing this one thing through to the end

28
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,800
this one through through to the end and

29
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,480
and if that's the primary activity here then that's a wonderful place to be the

30
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,200
place where you do one thing at a time if you're doing the

31
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,400
first tetrad of being with a breath knowing it

32
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,599
and then experiencing the whole body and then relaxing the body

33
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,280
each of those steps that's what we dedicate ourselves to and perhaps it's a

34
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:28,560
it's uh again it's kind of like the in breath and out breath it's kind of temporary

35
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,599
we're just there for this relaxation this moment of experiencing the full body

36
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,799
and then renewing it this gentle renewing loving renewing

37
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:45,519
we're renewing and starting with the next moment the next activity next you know thing that we're going to

38
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:52,080
moment we're going to see it to the end even if it's just one even the same thing over and over again

39
00:03:52,080 --> 00:04:00,360
can be a very effective way of building and developing settling in to this mindfulness

40
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,560
so to

41
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:18,639
begin with doing one thing at a time just give yourself over to your posture

42
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,960
to establishing a meditation posture

43
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,320
with the details of posture kind of

44
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,360
cared for tended to

45
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,639
feeling how the weight of the torso is centered on the

46
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,400
sitting bones is are you leaning forward with

47
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,080
leaning backward or do you have a sense that the your weight is

48
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,199
balanced on a kind of vertical center of gravity

49
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,840
maybe sitting up a little bit straighter

50
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:25,080
breathing in breathing out adjusting where the hands are and the arms the elbows

51
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:31,759
noticing if the elbows are a little bit locked in or tense there's a way of just kind of flapping

52
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,800
your elbow slightly like your chicken or something just to kind of make sure it's loose in

53
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,840
the arms

54
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,639
you can kind of also just kind of

55
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:58,600
shake your ever so slightly shake your hands to see if they're loose

56
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:14,639
making some care for how your head is on your that the

57
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,560
that somehow the meeting of the back of your neck and your skull

58
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,680
doesn't feel scrunched like you're lifting up

59
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:34,720
like you're lifting up your chin and kind of opening the space there and the last vertebrae in the skull

60
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,000
being careful that the chin is not pulled down or your head is not tipped down too much

61
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,039
so there's a kind of a pressure in the front of the neck underneath the

62
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:50,319
jaw from being crunched a little bit

63
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:01,800
and if you haven't don't have your eyes closed to gently close them if that's comfortable

64
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,599
and then to do one thing at a time

65
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:17,720
take a one deeper in breath as if that's the only thing that's important

66
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,240
and then one full exhale just doing that to all the way to the end

67
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,639
breathing in breathing out

68
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,840
on the exhale relaxing the body

69
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:07,360
and letting the breathing return to normal and again on the exhale

70
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,520
take a few breaths to relax the body the whole body parts of the body

71
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:20,080
but to do the relaxation on the exhale as if it's the only thing happening

72
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,680
giving yourself over to this one thing breathing on the exhale relaxing on the

73
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,840
exhale

74
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:17,440
and then settling into breathing

75
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,640
and seeing if there's some way attitude of attention

76
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:32,320
that maybe makes attention to the breathing enjoyable

77
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:41,120
maybe a friendliness a love

78
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,600
maybe a peacefulness or a tranquility

79
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,800
whatever way that maybe it's enjoyable to really take in

80
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,560
the breathing on the in-breath

81
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,879
just the in-breath that one thing all the way to the end

82
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:22,399
on the exhale the one thing that you give yourself to

83
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,959
gently

84
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:34,959
receptively all the way to the end

85
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,680
and then start over

86
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,560
and if something takes you away from your breathing

87
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,680
let the knowing of that thing be the one thing that you do

88
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:05,120
just knowing thinking just knowing feeling

89
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:17,560
patiently openly and then begin again with the breathing

90
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,800
um

91
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,840
to help you do one thing at a time

92
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:54,000
while you're breathing just the inhale just the exhale

93
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:01,120
you can gently say the word one count up to one

94
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:06,960
on the inhale then start over again counting up to one

95
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:15,679
on the exhale just long gentle one

96
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,919
to really be there for this one thing

97
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,720
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

98
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,640
to shift the focus of attention

99
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,158
to the dedication of our efforts

100
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:29,279
to benefit others through this practice we benefit

101
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:35,520
ourselves and the more we benefit ourselves the more we have

102
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,720
to offer others may we benefit ourselves so we can

103
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,000
better benefit others may we benefit others so we can benefit

104
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,840
ourselves may this wonderful

105
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:58,158
circle cycle wheel of mutual care

106
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,960
keep rolling in our world

107
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,080
and so as we come to the end

108
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,840
evoking the wish the desire the good will

109
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,039
that wishes everyone well

110
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:36,960
which is the best for everyone may all beings

111
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,880
be happy may all beings

112
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:49,679
be safe may all beings

113
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:58,039
be peaceful may all beings be free

114
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:05,760
and in so doing may all beings be free of their suffering their

115
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:12,600
oppression their poverty their illness

116
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:21,039
may all beings have the opportunity to breathe easily

117
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,000
and have their heart be at ease

118
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:33,518
[Music]

119
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,919
you

120
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,279
so we're still staying with this third exercise the

121
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:17,518
at the buddha taught in the discourse on the four foundations for awareness

122
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,799
and it is um

123
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,200
and um it's easy to overlook overlook this exercise because

124
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,960
uh the four foundations for awareness are often taught as meditation practices

125
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,480
and so people will kind of focus on the parts that have more directly to do with

126
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:46,159
meditation and here it's not meditation that's being focused

127
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:52,480
on but rather activity and so it's mindfulness in daily life mindfulness

128
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,640
and activities we do and it's it's worthwhile take some time with

129
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,640
this and to really begin to appreciate how this can be done in practice in our lives

130
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:12,399
because there's a mutual relationship between how we develop our attention in meditation

131
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:18,480
and how we develop it in daily life and they support each other and they certainly support each other in

132
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,799
that both places are places where it's getting stronger and expanding our capacity to be present

133
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:30,320
but it's also uh important because the two areas kind of highlight different

134
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:36,799
aspects of life at different aspects of ourselves if all we ever did was meditate we go to

135
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:42,960
monastery and just meditate all the time it might be wonderful but it would just

136
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:50,159
be a very partial experience of who we are not a few people have gone off on retreats and been able to meditate all

137
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:56,720
day and hello wow this is great and i'm so wonderful and i'll never be challenged again because

138
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,240
i'm so balanced and clear and peaceful and then within a day of leaving they're

139
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:07,279
angry and upset and yelling at other drivers or

140
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:13,279
you know or they find themselves completely consumed with desires and

141
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:18,960
and um and so they've certainly learned to settle themselves on retreat but they

142
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,159
haven't learned how to bring attention to what happens in daily life and how to

143
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,519
be in a daily life so that uh mindfulness carries the day not our

144
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,279
reactivity and so to uh so in one in meditation we

145
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:42,480
get to look at part of who we are in daily life we get to look at other parts of who we are and find a way to live

146
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:50,000
wisely in both ways in both both both situations so in terms of

147
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:58,080
[Music] mindfulness in daily life in activity one of the great ex

148
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,519
approaches is to do just one thing at a time whatever you're doing just do that

149
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:09,839
and um uh and part of the advantage of kind of going on retreat or going and living in

150
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:17,040
a buddhist monastery is that uh the situation there is tends to be set up the ambiance the

151
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:24,079
the atmosphere the dedication the what's happening around you it supports uh more often than in daily

152
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,280
life just doing one thing at a time and when i was in the monastery there

153
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,118
was kind of understood if you're sweeping the monastery grounds just sweep if you're [Music]

154
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:42,240
washing dishes just do the dishes and it's represented by the story in japan when i was in the monastery there

155
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,358
where i went into the kitchen in the evening for something maybe a little snack or

156
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:52,398
something and um and there was a one of the other monks

157
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:59,200
was preparing the vegetables for the next day's meal and he was chopping them away

158
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:06,000
and i stood opposite the table where he was chopping and faced him and asked him some question i

159
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,240
have no no memory of what i asked him and and what i remember was that he put down

160
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,359
his knife that he was chopping with and he stood up straight and looked at

161
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:24,000
me and answered me in a very matter-of-fact nice way and then he picked up his knife and started chopping again

162
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:30,480
and that's why i asked the second question he put down the knife stood up straight faced me and answered

163
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,839
the question and i sway so not really understanding what was going

164
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:41,200
on i asked him a third question and so he put down his knife again

165
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,320
and faced me and he said gilson he said gil the

166
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,320
you know i'm here in the kitchen to just you know to chop the vegetables this evening and

167
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:57,440
and if you're going to talk to me then i can't really do my work focus on it

168
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:03,760
and so then i so then i bowed and apologized and and left he was just doing one thing at a time

169
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,359
when he was chopping he was just chopping when he was talking to me he was just talking to me and he was

170
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:15,520
dedicated to that so this was not really the ordinary time to have a conversation so it was reasonable that he wanted to

171
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,440
dedicate himself to his work and it was the evening he probably wanted to get ready to go to bed

172
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,720
and um so um

173
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,760
so that story kind of represents this kind of dedication to just doing one thing at a time

174
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,880
and of course um it can be overdone and there are times of course when the

175
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:42,400
one thing we do is a number of things and but then just do that i think i

176
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:49,680
think i told a story yesterday being a fast order cook and i just did one thing not one thing just one

177
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:56,480
job and i was absorbed and just doing the job just surrendering to everything that was needed i was tracking multiple

178
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,520
things but i was just cooking and

179
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,359
so exactly what one thing means various context or context but the principle of just when you're

180
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:14,000
doing something just do that and don't be involved in things which are extraneous to it

181
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,000
this one thing this one practice um can enhance the experience of daily

182
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,839
life so that it it begins to approach the kind of wholeheartedness

183
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:31,520
that uh monastic life has not that it's monastic life it's just kind of getting some of the benefits

184
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,119
because a big part of monastic life is this ability to just really do one thing at a time

185
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:44,079
and then one of the ways of really uh getting into this is i add to it the idea of see seeing

186
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,599
that one thing through to the end so like if you're walking in your house

187
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:56,880
from i don't know the living room to where the laundry is to move the laundry from the washer to the dryer

188
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,960
and you're walking that's the task just do that and if you see that something needs to

189
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:09,520
be cleaned up along the way or something grabs your interest along the way you see that there's a

190
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,560
something male has arrived and you want to check the mail the

191
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:20,880
uh if you're doing this one practice at a time seeing it through to the end practice since you set yourself on the course to

192
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:26,079
go to the laundry room and cha move the laundry just do that

193
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:32,480
and it might be a little bit less efficient than doing something along the way but it's more efficient in terms of

194
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:38,880
cultivating mindfulness just do that and if it's important to do something else along the way then of course then

195
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:45,200
switch and do that but just kind of practice more and more just seeing one thing one thing through to the end

196
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,480
and then when you're finished then go look at the mail and do that that one thing

197
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:58,079
and at first it might seem a little artificial but as you get into it you will find that

198
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,119
that there's kind of enhancement of awareness of presence it helps kind of

199
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:09,520
uh evoke the various capacities we have when we're fully present for something just

200
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:15,280
being there it can be very relaxing uh it can be very uh freeing of the

201
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:22,079
preoccupations and the stresses of the day because a lot of the stresses of the day don't have so much to do with what often

202
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,359
i don't have to do with what's happening in the moment but have to do with our imagination our projection into the

203
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:33,599
future or fantasy or anxieties that are uh you know more have to do with a

204
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,720
thought world then they have to do with what's happening right here and now

205
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,880
so to be able to just kind of just see this thing through to the end and develop that capacity can be very

206
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,839
freeing in terms of what builds up stress in our minds and then to learn to enjoy doing that

207
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:59,040
to learn how doing just one activity how embody in that embodying that with awareness

208
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:06,160
so it's not a duty it's not like a mental thing like okay now i should you know just be here it's a embodied

209
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:12,640
all-body thing just the body is there for itself and this also represents in the moment for

210
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,920
me the experience i had in the japanese monastery where

211
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,480
sometimes it was my job to bring the food from the kitchen to the dining room and tape where we would eat

212
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,720
on the table bring food to them and um sometimes i was given the rice to carry in the big pot of rice

213
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:36,560
and it was you know kind of big but it was i could carry it with one hand and so i would carry it with one hand

214
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:43,359
and it seemed like a fine thing to do and it was doing the job and and um and whenever i did that some

215
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:50,640
other monk would come along and say gilsan when you carry the pot carry it with both hands

216
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:57,040
just really be there and um so in in zen also if you're drinking tea

217
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,880
you wouldn't just drink it with one hand you would actually be there fully to drink the tea just the tea seeing that

218
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,960
tea just all the way with both hands something about using both hands which uh contributes to this embodiment

219
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:16,160
this like let's just let's hear be here for this this thing and um

220
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:21,200
and then also with our posture that uh there's a posture that

221
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,520
maybe is relaxed enough but the posture is not participating in what we're doing

222
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:35,119
so it's not just a matter of doing one thing with attention but also how much of our whole being can we

223
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:41,440
gently lovingly bring along to do something so that there's a begins to be a feeling

224
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,480
a sense of being absorbed in one something and the more we of ourselves we bring to

225
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:52,319
the activity actually the more pleasurable it tends to become the more it tends to enhance

226
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:58,560
our capacity for presence and so certainly i can

227
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,960
you know sometimes it's nice to be the one thing we do is to relax the end of the day and then sitting in a nice easy

228
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:12,000
chair and maybe just reading something or having tea and just reading and having tea and drinking kind

229
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,839
of mindlessly the tea because you know you're doing that one relaxing thing that's completely fine because you know

230
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:23,520
this is what i'm doing but there's qualitatively a very different thing if

231
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:30,400
you say okay i'm really going to just now i'm going to really the one thing i'm going to do is drink tea

232
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,680
and you sit up a little bit straighter so your kind of spine is involved too

233
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,119
and then you pick up the the cup with two hands and you really kind of

234
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:47,760
meet it and really go this is what you're going to do with two hands with your whole body

235
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:54,560
and there are times when that begins awakening a very different kind of

236
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:01,440
mindful presence awareness embodied awareness then the idea of that mindfulness is a mental activity of just

237
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:07,040
knowing you know knowing i'm lifting knowing knowing the cup knowing a feeling

238
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:14,160
and that's sometimes part of what mindfulness is but it's and then it's kind of a partial awareness it's a using

239
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,319
just one faculty but to bring our posture our body into what we're doing and feeling it and

240
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:26,640
sensing it is um is how a sense of absorption or pleasure

241
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:33,680
in the activity can grow and then in doing so

242
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,760
can over time you find that actually the result of doing it

243
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:46,079
is that you have more clarity more wisdom more understanding more

244
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:52,240
ability to tune in to your environment and be in harmony with it or be wise with what you do

245
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:57,599
doing enjoying one thing at a time is not hedonistic

246
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:03,119
it's um it's uh it sets up the conditions

247
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:09,920
for wisdom and for freedom and for clarity so doing one thing at a time one

248
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:16,240
activity at a time and and then kind of seeing it through to

249
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:25,200
the end so within reason of course

250
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:31,520
so thank you very much and uh and we'll continue a little bit more on

251
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:38,079
this topic of mindfulness activities because we'll see that at the some of the lessons we learn here

252
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:44,880
uh are then uh relate to what we learn in meditation practice and and uh we learn to apply

253
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,480
that there as well and um and it supports the meditation so

254
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,200
thank you very much
