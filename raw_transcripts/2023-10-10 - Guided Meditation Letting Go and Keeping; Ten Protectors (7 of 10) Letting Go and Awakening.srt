1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:09,920
good morning or good day and Welcome to our meditation

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:16,198
time and as I usually do I like to do a little introduction and then uh as a as

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,599
a background or a introduction to the meditation

4
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:29,480
so one of the central concepts for Buddhist

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:36,680
practice the practice we do meditation we do the way we engage in the

6
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,960
Dharma is to distinguish between what is helpful and not

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,120
helpful what serves us and what doesn't serve us and that begs a question

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:57,160
helpful for what reason or serves us and for what purpose and uh there's many many ways to

9
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:03,559
answer that and from a Buddhist point of view but one way is that it leads us away

10
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:09,040
from suffering and towards happiness and with the ultimate H

11
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,320
happiness is Liberation Liberation from the causes of all

12
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,400
suffering and a profound leads us away from agitation moves us towards peace

13
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:28,840
where peace is the the highest pieace is again the freedom from suffering freedom from all the agitation that produces

14
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,479
suffering and so uh and then uh to love the

15
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:41,200
Dharma is to love the practice and uh and to love the practice

16
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,240
of of making this distinction and delighting in the opportunity to uh to

17
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,040
move in the direction of what serves us what is helpful and part of the Delight is to know that it's not just for our

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,079
own sake but um it we do it for the sake of others as well that uh whether we

19
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,560
intend to or not moving in this direction towards peace towards the

20
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:14,599
absence of suffering to the presence of Happiness the absence of greed ha and delusion to the Pres presence of um

21
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:19,879
generosity and love and wisdom that uh of course it's going to benefit the

22
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:26,400
people around us so to make this distinction and then one way of

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,879
meditating which is the proposal for today is to imagine

24
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:39,560
yourself um as being a someone who sorts uh uh food sorts

25
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:49,599
fruit uh and I've done this little bit before and but imagine that you're on a there's a conveyor belt that brings uh

26
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,840
and a gentle relaxed flow brings you maybe

27
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,000
apples and um that have recently been harvested and some of them are clearly

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,519
defective and can't be used for selling as fresh produce or selling as for

29
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:13,080
applesauce or anything and um and some are useful and will serve many people in

30
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:20,159
in feeding them and so you stand the end of this conveyor belt and the apples come and the ones that don't serve are

31
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:28,560
not helpful for human consumption are used for other purposes they are composted to

32
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:38,599
and the ones that are going to be sered serve us are are picked up and put in a box on maybe on your right and the love

33
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:44,360
loving job of just Cho picking them out this goes for the compost this goes for

34
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:50,480
for others without any judgment without any uh hostility or aversion towards

35
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:59,159
anything without any greed that in sense one is better than other it's really good to to uh to create compost and it

36
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,400
supports the the soil and some people love making compost it Delights them and

37
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,640
some people you know love uh you know uh

38
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:16,519
picking the fruits that are going to serve many people and imagining who it's going to serve so in this way sitting and

39
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:23,840
meditating today maybe there's a way of sitting quietly and uh focusing on the breath

40
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:30,360
focusing on being present that appreciates present moment attention like just being here here and being

41
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:37,759
present in a kind way in a wise way in a generous way and uh distinguishing

42
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:45,360
between what arises in the mind what's happening to us emotionally um and distinguishing in

43
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,840
ways that we relate to what's happening that's the Apple not what's happening but how we

44
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:59,919
relate to it and some ways we relate we have aversion we have fear we have criticism

45
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,400
we have uh conceit we have greed we uh

46
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:13,039
and some uh you know are really just good for the compost and just put that aside and some ways I

47
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:19,440
relate are the the fruit of practice that have great fruit and benefit and um

48
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,240
and that that's useful to keep for for for for later for now and so if we can

49
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:33,479
meet whatever is happening with kindness with uh openness with um nonhostility

50
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:39,440
with a clear mindfulness clear open receptive

51
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:47,199
attention um transparent attention where things just go right through without being stuck on us uh if we can meet

52
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:55,440
things with wisdom um relate to what's happening in a wise way one wise way is to see it as

53
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,759
just phenomena that's rolling through it's the stream the flow flow of Life coming through and now it's this and now

54
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,440
it's this and there's no need to get reactive to it or get greedy to it or

55
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,520
make any conclusions from it oh this means that I am you know

56
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,280
X not taking it personally making it into something personal just phenomena

57
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:28,400
happening um and uh so um so to imagine sitting

58
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,120
here present but attentive

59
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:41,599
to what goes in the compost and what we

60
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:48,560
keep so to gently close your eyes

61
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,319
and taking some care and maybe some love

62
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:03,240
for a suitable posture for meditation a posture that serves

63
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,160
you a posture that's

64
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:19,560
helpful and taking some long deep breaths relaxing on the

65
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
exhale

66
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,639
and letting the breathing return to

67
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:55,800
normal and continue to relax the body the mind the

68
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:03,360
heart maybe for the next dozen or so exhales relaxing

69
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,360
settling

70
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
softening

71
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
e

72
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
e

73
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:45,640
and then as we continue is there anything about how you

74
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,800
are right now that would be good to acknowledge to

75
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,240
recognize clearly so that it doesn't have

76
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,399
a an undue influence on how you're

77
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:11,760
present how you practice the mindfulness how are

78
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,440
you and how are you relating to how you

79
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:35,480
are What attitude do you have to what you find how you find

80
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,320
yourself and is the attitude the relationship you have does it serve you

81
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:55,120
or doesn't serve you is it helpful or not

82
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,760
helpful can you change if it's not helpful can you let

83
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,040
that go into the compost and find a little more helpful

84
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:15,160
way of being present for how you

85
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:23,079
are and even simple mindfulness is

86
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:30,959
helpful just aware non-judgmentally not taking it person

87
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,959
L and settling into your breathing again

88
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:04,399
maybe imagining breathing is the conveyor

89
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,680
belt and whatever it

90
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:24,079
brings meet it with a useful attitude with the relate to it in a helpful

91
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:30,560
way and if how you relate to anything that's happening

92
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,839
doesn't serve it's not helpful put it aside for

93
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:48,440
compost and find evoke arouse a helpful

94
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:55,800
attitude a helpful way of relating the simplest

95
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:01,959
being non-judgmental receptive

96
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760

for

121
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:43,640
as we come to the end of this sitting to

122
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:48,200
appreciate that we have a

123
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:56,039
choice when we have the choice between speaking or not

124
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:00,759
speaking do we or not doing

125
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:15,520
something thinking or not thinking something the choice between having one

126
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,960
attitude or another attitude

127
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:29,520
between having an attitude which is unhelpful

128
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,278
and do we avoid acting on it in any

129
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:46,120
way the ability to make choices what we do and what we don't

130
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,200
do what we act on and what we don't act

131
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,880
on can give us the choice to act on love

132
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:06,960
on generosity on kindness to not act on ill will and

133
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,480
greed and

134
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:24,120
conceit and to make this Choice calmly openly

135
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:34,799
relaxedly so that how we are in the world doesn't contribute to more Strife

136
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:41,799
doesn't cont contribute to more people being

137
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:48,640
challenged may we instead learn how to monitor ourselves to make the

138
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:55,559
choice to avoid harming and when it's

139
00:28:55,559 --> 00:29:01,720
appropriate to live from from generosity and love and care and

140
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:06,559
respect in a way that brings peace into the

141
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:15,480
world bring safety for others may all beings be

142
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:24,480
happy may all beings be safe may all beings be

143
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:29,320
peaceful and may all beings be free

[Music]

145
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,840
thank

146
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
you

147
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
e

148
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:52,320
I have to go uh push a button somewhere else to make it work right

149
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
back

150
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,159
e

151
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:07,720
so warm greetings from IMC and and uh to this series on the 10

152
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:13,880
protectors and yesterday that the protector what protects us is uh a love

153
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:20,559
of the Dharma and that of course can have different meanings depending what you mean by Dharma and different people

154
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:26,440
do have different reference points for this wonderful word and the and what I

155
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:31,880
offered was that uh uh the core aspect of Dharma is

156
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:39,919
non-harming and um and then the that's pretty powerful in itself but

157
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,559
the companion to that is to do what's beneficial to to do that which is the

158
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:54,399
opposite of harm and uh this protects us and this protects the world around us now with

159
00:32:54,399 --> 00:33:03,240
this idea with operating idea of love I think is fantastic um so to do this with

160
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:11,080
love to have love for this so that the way we approach it the way we meet the world is something healthy and and

161
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:19,519
nourishing for us and for others so now we come to the next protector which is uh sometimes and when

162
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:26,039
I first first many years I was introduced to this uh it just seemed too Technical and it seemed a little bit too

163
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:31,639
uh technique for focused or some felt very different than for me than just U

164
00:33:31,639 --> 00:33:37,760
having open mindfulness and presence for whatever is here um and uh it seemed a

165
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:43,919
little bit judgmental it seemed a little bit more difficult but I've come to really appreciate that uh this what's

166
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:49,519
coming next here is really again also very fundamental to the Dharma and the

167
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:56,399
the traditional way of of translating into English is to um to abandon what is

168
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,760
UN wholesome and arouse to awake awaken what is

169
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:09,118
wholesome and uh sometimes it's said to be abandon what's unskillful and awaken

170
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:15,760
Rouse what is skillful and um and uh this I like to

171
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:23,480
think of this as to let go of what is unhelpful and uh pick up what is helpful

172
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:30,358
do what is helpful and uh sometimes like to say put down what is unhealthy that we our mind

173
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:37,079
and speech and body can be doing and and pick up what is healthy that we where we

174
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:44,440
can pick it up and so this distinction uh makes a huge difference if we don't see this

175
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:51,480
choice we have uh in any kind of situation in our life between what is unhelpful and and what is helpful uh why

176
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:58,520
would we kind of stop doing the unhelpful if um if if you uh have a

177
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:03,960
thorn in your foot and you don't see that it's you know that it's helpful or

178
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:09,560
serves you to take the thorn out and you just keep walking on the thorn uh then

179
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:17,640
um then you know you eventually you can get infected and might cause lasting damage so the idea is to um you know we

180
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:23,079
we constantly make this distinction in our life we sit in the chair and we feel

181
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:31,079
what it's a nice way of sitting that helps us to relax and what maybe is not like nice maybe there's a kind of some

182
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:36,920
painful pressure against part of our body in a certain way of sitting in the chair so we make an adjustment so this

183
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:43,760
constant adjustment that we make is pretty much human nature and but when we apply it uh in

184
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:50,920
Dharma practice is we're learning how we relate to our our experience and the things

185
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:57,440
that we do that come out of us is uh so as opposed to looking about the world and changing the world

186
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:04,560
Dharma practice has a very Central thing of taking responsibility for what comes out of us

187
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:10,280
and if what comes out of us is a um not helpful for the world or not helpful to

188
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:18,839
us then there's the Art of Letting Go of it if it is helpful or if we awaken what

189
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:24,200
is helpful then please continue doing that with

190
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:31,599
enthusiasm and so making this choice so and one of the things that for mindfulness practitioners is it's always

191
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:37,319
helpful always wholesome to be mindful if the mindfulness is clean if the

192
00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:42,760
mindfulness is not does not come along with um unhelpful attitudes of judgment

193
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:49,480
or criticism or or greed or expectation the simple

194
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:56,280
mindfulness and so to um uh to track this for ourselves is a way of being our

195
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:04,640
own person protector uh because the the deepest harm that we can do to our deepest harm

196
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:10,680
that we can experience as adults is harm that we do to ourselves even if there's horrendous

197
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:17,200
things that happen to us outside in our in our deepest heart it's how we relate

198
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,800
to that that really counts in the end and um really has lasting language a

199
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:29,240
lasting effect on us so if we react with uh uh resistance aversion deep in the

200
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:35,400
heart if we react with hostility and hate if we react with greed and

201
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,880
desire in some deep way that that you the the greed has a kind of tension and

202
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:47,720
suffering in it and of itself then we can create lasting harm but if we can

203
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:54,079
the deepest places within if we can meet with love with care with um

204
00:37:54,079 --> 00:38:01,640
generosity with uh nonc conceit with non shutting down um then there can be a

205
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:07,079
lasting benefit to us and this is of course very difficult to appreciate when

206
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:14,480
when the horrible things happen to us but uh the Dharma practice when we really get into it really understand it

207
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:21,560
well is we understand that we are becoming the custodians of our own hearts and that whatever happens around

208
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,920
us we begin developing the strength to really stay close to that heart of ours

209
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:33,079
and keep it um uh free keep it clean

210
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:39,520
keep it non-reactive in such a way that we're actually compounding the the

211
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:48,720
challenges by adding second arrows to ourselves and uh and so um this ability

212
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,560
this Choice seeing where we don't add the second arrows and and stay close to

213
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:02,040
that is a way of protect protecting ourselves so um so then uh what I love

214
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:09,119
and what I find fascinating and just delightful is that in this uh you know

215
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,800
stand standing there and just choosing between what goes into the compost what we don't want don't need is

216
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:22,480
unhelpful by calling it compost we don't have to think of it as abandoning it as just kind of another form of a

217
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:30,359
aversion everything has a use some things are just useful for compost

218
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:36,079
and so when when I have if I have anger if I have greed if I have these things that I don't think they're

219
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:41,720
useful if I kind of let go of them and and drop into my body feel it all in my

220
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:48,880
body the body has a way of composting it I don't have to reject it exactly or um

221
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:56,119
take it have an attitude that's that it's awful or bad or wrong it has a use

222
00:39:56,119 --> 00:40:03,000
that's somehow if I I can let go of it in such a way by letting go of it into the body where it gets kind of

223
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,480
transmuted or settled or supportive for something beautiful to

224
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:17,480
happen and then picking Awakening what's beautiful breaking what's helpful so the way to do this to

225
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:26,240
abandon to let go of and to awaken and maintain is that is done uh skillfully

226
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:32,319
that that's done in a helpful way that's done in a way that's nourishing and supportive that feels

227
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:39,000
wholesome so rather than making this distinction and navigating this distinction one more difficult

228
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,200
exhausting thing to do it's the attitude the approach the way we relate to that

229
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,760
is supported by the love of the Dharma that we just love doing this practice we

230
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:57,680
love doing something that um avoids further harm and creates more benefit

231
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:03,839
how lucky we are that we can do this if we don't have the some kind of healthy

232
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:10,200
attitude for how we make these distinctions and navigate this kind of natural distinction between what's

233
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:15,920
healthy and not healthy then it's hard to sustain it uh

234
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,480
it can be exhausting it can be debilitating it can be um feel like a

235
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,960
burden and uh but if we can find a healthy way to do this distinction to

236
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:33,680
navigate this it can be a delight a joy kind of like the joy of maybe paddling

237
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:42,079
down the current of a river and just kind of enjoying just staying in the current as we go and um and just that

238
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,400
little choice we make stay in that healthy current stay here be here this is

239
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:56,200
delightful so um so I love it I love it that the um uh this idea of uh abandon

240
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:02,880
abing the UNH wholesome Awakening the wholesome follows in this

241
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,640
list uh love of the Dharma and maybe that's a guide for how to do this very

242
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:15,960
fundamental practice of usually called in Buddhism right effort and um it's one

243
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:21,880
of the pieces of the e-fold path so it's pretty Central to it all and in doing

244
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:28,760
this uh we become our own protector and that is one of the I think really uh

245
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:34,920
significant uh stepping stones in Dharma practice is learning how we can be our

246
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:42,200
own protector we protect ourselves from ourselves as we do this we also will

247
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:50,359
become a protector for others and we're protecting them from us we become a safe person and maybe

248
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:55,720
this seems uh a trifling thing in a world that's full of horrendous

249
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:02,079
suffering and challenges as we as we're kind of very sensitive to many of us right now what's happening in the

250
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:09,400
world but um someone has to be this kind of person someone has to be able to

251
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:14,960
enter into the world so that we're safe for others and who is better than this

252
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,880
than ourselves if it doesn't start with us can we does it make sense to continue

253
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:27,040
to uh only expect it from others that other people will make the world a better

254
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:33,040
place um but if we can do it if we can be a safe person for the world if we can

255
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:40,079
um uh then maybe we have a a uh a u a

256
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:45,599
stance upon which to stand that can begin encouraging other people to do it

257
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:52,160
and and speak up about let's let's let's meet with let's meet each other

258
00:43:52,160 --> 00:44:03,040
peacefully kindly and let's try to stand in um um um actively stand

259
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:09,559
in not in opposition exactly but stand

260
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:15,920
uh convincing people that violence doesn't work that hate doesn't work

261
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:21,599
greed doesn't work let's speak up about that but only if we can be know how to

262
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:27,839
be uh a safe for all people including the people we disagree with

263
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:34,760
so um and then we'll continue on these 10

264
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,880
protectors tomorrow thank

265
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:46,319
you
