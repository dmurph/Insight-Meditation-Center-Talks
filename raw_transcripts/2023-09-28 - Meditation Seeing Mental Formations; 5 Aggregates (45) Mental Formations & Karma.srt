00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello friends greetings sa happy to be with you in this moment

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,639
in time and uh practicing together so today we continue to

3
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:23,320
explore the five Aggregates the constituents of our experience as human

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:30,880
beings and today we uh turn our attention to the fourth

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,120
aggregate um the Saras often translated as mental

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:47,960
formations or volitional formations um and they include both the aspect of

7
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:54,079
physical Behavior physical speech including internal speech as well as

8
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:02,440
thoughts uh mental behavior and um they include both what is um intentional in

9
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:10,520
the way of per purposive aspects of our mind as well as a reactive aspect of

10
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:16,720
Mind including um especially with psychological Behavior our thoughts the

11
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:25,040
proliferation of thoughts um as well as cultivating thoughts of um compassion

12
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:35,439
kindness uh Clarity mindfulness so there it it it um this bucket of experience

13
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:43,280
is um the it leads with volition with this this even if the volition seems to

14
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:49,000
be mild in the moment but as a a part of

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
pattern of behavior that has built up internally and again in our practice

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,439
this this morning the guided meditation I'll guide us to to turn attention to

17
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,240
um to noticing the the movement of the mind or

18
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:16,480
the movement of the Body for example if you want to if there intention there is intention to to move to pay attention to

19
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:23,440
that volitional formation for that movement or or if you you uh notice that the mind

20
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,959
has been distracted and uh and there's volitional formation to pull the mind

21
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,160
back to bring it back or yank it back or hopefully not yanky but if if that is

22
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,640
the case to notice all these volitional uh formations in the mind and

23
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,800
in the body as well as internal speech that that that pool that pattern that

24
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,840
pulls us into particular patterns of of uh experience anyway that is the frame

25
00:02:52,840 --> 00:03:01,760
for today's uh practice so so let us arrive let us arrive

26
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:11,799
letting go of these words these explanations and

27
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:18,959
just arriving arriving in your experience in this

28
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,680
moment making a moment to fully arrive

29
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,159
and

30
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:47,920
settle with the body making sure the body is sitting

31
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,599
comfortably shoulders are rolled back

32
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,640
perhaps the spine is straight with a sense of integrity

33
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,840
and the body is relaxed the body is

34
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,080
soft bringing awareness to the Poise of the

35
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,400
body what is the Poise of the

36
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
body

37
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:40,759
what is the Poise of the Mind mind heart chipa translated as mind

38
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:49,639
heart hyphenated what's the Poise of our heart mind in this

39
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,960
moment I'm

40
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,759
aware and is it possible to

41
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:13,360
release to soften to calm these poises of the body and mind

42
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,638
and

43
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:31,479
heart with gentle intention setting Our intention at the outset of this practice

44
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,000
setting wholehearted intention to be

45
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,360
present fully present to be

46
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,160
kind being

47
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,560
undistracted not following

48
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,960
any distraction or sound

49
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:22,440
or or alluring thought that arises sending an

50
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:30,199
intention for gentle persistence gentle

51
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:36,280
with kindness and ease with each

52
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
breath

53
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,479
as we feel relaxed in the body and mind bringing

54
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,239
awareness all the volitional [Music]

55
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,680
formations our sphere of

56
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,760
experience if you're turning your awareness to know the

57
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:07,600
breath there is volitional formation there in this intention this

58
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,000
volition to be

59
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:28,480
aware if you find the mind is lost in thought there is some thinking that's

60
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,120
happening

61
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:41,959
it is relational even if it may be reactive based on patterns of thinking

62
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:48,839
in this way for years notice

63
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
notice

64
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,079
it is helpful to have a relaxed posture in the mind and the

65
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:14,759
body and let this stream of experience of the stream of volitional

66
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,839
formations be

67
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,959
known as if you're watching a movie of your

68
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
mind

69
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,880
relational or mental formations

70
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:45,000
other recall and this moment is the storm of mental volutional

71
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:55,959
formations become aware of the landscape and recognize this constituent

72
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:00,839
of Human Experience

73
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,040
clearly it's like this being

74
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
human

75
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,039
if you notice there is some discomfort perhaps in the body and there is

76
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:48,480
the desire the intention the volitional formation to move pay

77
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:55,519
attention pay attention to that get to know

78
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
it

79
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:11,720
and if and when you move notice the volitional formation in this

80
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:19,440
behavior of movement how it shows up with this bodily

81
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,480
action slow it down slow it

82
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
down

83
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:45,880
don't let it be reactive stud

84
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
it

85
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:29,120
are there familiar patterns of [Music] sounds internally thought thoughts

86
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:38,760
really internally arising the Saras this familiar pattern

87
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,600
set into

88
00:21:50,240 --> 00:22:00,039
motion noticing its energy movement or maybe it's calling

89
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,880
the volitional formations are calm

90
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
notice

91
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,600
notice if the Mind picks up a pattern

92
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,919
as if picking up a

93
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,200
stick as if it's used to doing that there's leftover

94
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,440
energy volition from doing it before and it just does that automatically

95
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:24,799
seemingly now this pattern of thinking

96
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:34,278
engaging get to know this and can it be released if it's not helpful or healthy

97
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,519
skillful

98
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:12,720
as we turn to bring this sitting to a close

99
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:23,600
together can we give rise can we cultivate

100
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:30,960
appreciation thoughts volitional formations mental formations of

101
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,320
appreciation gratitude Goodwill and

102
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:46,640
kindness for ourselves for others who practice with

103
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:55,559
us and all beings everywhere Wishing Well sharing the goodness of our

104
00:29:55,559 --> 00:30:04,120
cultivation regardless of of how we may judge it to be today distracted

105
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:10,000
sleepy doesn't matter you showed up there's goodness

106
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,120
here trust it sharing this goodness with all beings

107
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:26,880
everywhere may my practice may my cultivation be of benefit to all

108
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,320
beings may all beings be free may all

109
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,600
beings be happy including

110
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:55,320
myself spray your practice everyone and take a moment to transition

111
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,240
the recordings

112
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:51,000
hello and good day so today we

113
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:58,799
continue exploring the five condas the five heaps

114
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,919
um translated as heaps um often these

115
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:10,000
five constituents of our experience also Aggregates which is this funky word five

116
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,559
Aggregates um the constituents of our

117
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:24,480
experience and and today we come to the fourth one which is the

118
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:33,240
Saras uh translated as formations as volitional formations or

119
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:40,039
as mental formations uh or sometimes as as

120
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:45,600
volition because volition is the leading one volition is the leading one in this

121
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:53,039
formations in in this bunch of them um and sometimes in this category we

122
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,679
perhaps simplify it and think of it as as with mental formations we just think

123
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:04,679
of thoughts just this tangle of thinking that often we

124
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:14,000
experience in our experience of being human so um more generally it's helpful

125
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,720
to think of the the Saras as both um as I mentioned both as

126
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,559
not just reactive but also the purposeful the purposive aspect

127
00:33:27,559 --> 00:33:34,080
of the mind that both include intention as well as Behavior so both of those

128
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:40,240
aspects and intention is an important aspect of it even though I'll put an asterisk here sometimes you might say

129
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,880
well I'm not intending to have all these thoughts they're just coming so there's no volition or intention here so is this

130
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,159
still quote unquote volitional um formations yes it is it it

131
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,639
also has to do with with the patterns that have been in place the volitions

132
00:33:57,639 --> 00:34:02,880
the way we've been thinking or doing it it also has to do with Karma so I'll

133
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,720
talk about that it's a big asterisk I'll get to in a moment but in terms of definitions as we

134
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:16,638
set set it up so so also so examples of this both

135
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,679
reactive and purposive aspects of the mind that both include intention as well

136
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,878
as Behavior Uh it includes both physical Behavior

137
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:33,280
any activity any intention to move for example it it

138
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:40,679
includes um intention for verbal behavior for any speech uh gentle or not

139
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:48,079
gentle wise or unwise as well as this third category which is our our thoughts

140
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:53,679
our um the psychological Behavior the psychological

141
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:59,079
behavior and includes the pro PL PL

142
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:06,400
proliferation of thoughts for example or again cultivation of of thoughts of uh

143
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:13,880
of mental behaviors of kindness Goodwill compassion Clarity stability release

144
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:21,920
calm all of that so so with with

145
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:28,800
Saras um it both includes again this is really important and we can get to see

146
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,680
this in our own practice and experience it both includes this volitional this

147
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:44,200
intentional movement of the mind for example you sit and you turn you there is this movement of the mind of the

148
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:51,880
mental behavior that you're turning to say calm to um if you're practicing meta

149
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:56,960
thoughts of good willll kindness uh etc etc either during your

150
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:03,480
practice or in daily life you can see these uh volitional the the way these

151
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:10,680
formations there's volition there's a tiny bit of volition in there or maybe a lot of volition for example if you're in

152
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:15,920
the middle of um say Mind Storm thinking thinking thinking and it's very

153
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,280
unpleasant and and wisdom comes and it says no no stop thinking about that this

154
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:27,839
is not helpful or stop doing this stop just stop that there's can be very

155
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:34,079
strong volitional formations uh in the mind at that point so you can notice the

156
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:42,800
the strength of these these Saras these volitional formations either in in our mind States

157
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:53,000
or or or trying to shift our be turn um uh to to um form our Behavior physical

158
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:58,720
Behavior as well as speech uh our behaviors in terms of speech I can

159
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:08,440
there's always volition there's always these Saras there's always Saras volition uh before we speak um forming

160
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:15,880
our speech or stopping our our our speaking sometimes it's it's of course wiser and Kinder not to say anything um

161
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:23,240
and you might think that oh sometimes I open my mouth and just say something which I regret later and or there is no

162
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:28,560
volition there yet there is volitional formation Cara there having to do with

163
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:35,079
the patterns in which we have done things in the past so so um so we have

164
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:41,480
to talk a little bit about uh Karma you cannot talk about Saras without talking

165
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:50,760
about Karma they're just they're so connected to one another so again karma is this big huge topic

166
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:57,480
and yet the what I want to bring in as a cliff notes of our ex as as our of our

167
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:04,079
understanding it is not skillful to think of karma as oh what I've done in

168
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:11,079
the you know in the past life and it's not affecting me or whoever this person was in my past life and it's my karma

169
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:18,280
it's my bad karma my good karma that is not helpful way to understand this

170
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:26,599
teaching the helpful way to understand the teaching of karma especially as relates to Sankara is habit pattern and

171
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:33,280
and also think of the teaching of karma as an empowering teaching which is

172
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:39,599
whatever you engage with right now in this

173
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:48,079
moment it sets into [Music] motion the tendency to do the same thing

174
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:55,720
to continue in the same way in the next moment and in the next moment and we can see that in short moments right if you

175
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:03,280
are uh feeding say thoughts of anger and you're really juicy and you're just

176
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:09,119
thinking angry thoughts okay this mind moment then the the next moment was

177
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:16,280
likely going to be an angry moment so you're seating it's it's it's you're cultivating this pattern the Saras the

178
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:22,960
volitional formations you see how they're connecting Karma and Saras volutional formations you're

179
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:30,000
you're you're creating you're putting you're solidifying these volitional formations in the next moment the next

180
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,640
moment and next moment so that maybe a day from now a week from now a month

181
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:41,920
from now oh yes when you think you know the stimulus comes to mind this perception you know perception of this

182
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:49,599
particular person say or thought comes to mind remember yesterday Sonia perception um then oh these volitional

183
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:56,079
formations with think like oh I don't want to think uh Angry thoughts about this person but you but we've spent a

184
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:02,000
lot of volition intention you engaging and and and planting these seeds on

185
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:09,400
wholesome seeds so so these seemingly this this um mental formations it seems

186
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:14,440
like there's little volition but there's still left over energy it's left over

187
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,640
energy left over karma from when we really engage so think of karma in this

188
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:25,760
way it's it's really our we're air to our own actions and decisions not from a

189
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:32,599
past life just not don't don't make it too magical but really taking responsibility I'm responsible I am

190
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:39,440
responsible I take responsibility for my own um the way I think and I behave and

191
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,599
I act whether with kindness or or in skillful ways or unskillful ways so

192
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:52,400
these thoughts are just coming so karma is actually very um skill is is is an

193
00:40:52,400 --> 00:41:00,319
empowering it's an empowering teaching um and the Buddha and the dhap has said

194
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:05,920
and I love this line whatever you Ponder and reflect upon

195
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:13,720
frequently that becomes the inclination of your mind so what we ever P whatever

196
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:18,880
we Ponder upon what whatever we Ponder and think about frequently that becomes

197
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,839
the inclination of our mind that's who we become this is so powerful this is

198
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:31,640
the teach in of karma in in this empowering way because yeah we can it's

199
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:38,680
like yes it's it's it's actually good news yes you can change the inclination of your mind you know this been showing

200
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:45,880
up to these teachings 7 A.M Pacific Time teachings for a while you know that the inclination of your mind throughout the

201
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:53,520
day starts to shift and change you can shift this inclination of your mind these Saras these volitional formations

202
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:58,720
this fourth aggregate that we're talking about today

203
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:06,920
so so so and and also know that in the present moment we are shaping forming

204
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:12,480
these volitional formations of our mental formations mental thoughts our

205
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,680
speech our patterns of speech the way we speak the way we act whether it's

206
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:24,359
mindful whether for example a discomfort arises in our body in the middle of say meditation and we just jerk like oh yeah

209
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:43,040
Sandbox for us to see our volitional formations in the making which is it's a

210
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:50,920
um a Sandbox for when say you're in in a um interactive in a social situation and

213
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,920
formations when you're alone when you're meditating when there's not the pressure

214
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,000
and the interaction of the social interactions then you can get to see oh
