1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,319
hello on this Monday morning

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:13,320
uh and welcome for those of you who were here on

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,720
Friday apologies for our technological challenges here at IMC and uh things had

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,480
been changed in the recording uh equipment and not put back

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:35,440
together properly so that it took a while to figure out what the issue was and so we didn't really do last Friday

6
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:41,840
and and um works out well because uh I'll finish the series

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,680
today and then um uh I have a four-part series for the

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,239
rest of the week so that works out

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,800
so the topic last week was the Four Noble Truths

10
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:16,200
and the Buddha has this very uh strong orientation to look at conditionality to

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,960
look at how one thing conditions another one thing sets up the conditions for

12
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,880
something else to arise and so uh

13
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,439
suffering is not all bad bad in the Buddhist

14
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,880
teachings because suffering is the necessary condition to

15
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,960
really understand suffering to see it to stop for it to care for it sets up the

16
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,200
conditions for having an inspiration a confidence a

17
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,360
faith uh in a path to the ending of

18
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,680
suffering and uh and that is a beautiful thing to have and to have an inspiration an

19
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:12,120
enthusiasm a confidence a trust the classic word is

20
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:19,120
Sada which is often translated to English as Faith so whichever one whichever one of

21
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,239
those words works for you and so as we start the meditation

22
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:32,720
today to call upon your whatever confidence whatever

23
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,480
trust whatever enthusiasm and inspiration Faith you have in this

24
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:48,760
practice as a way of addressing the challenges of this life so that you can give yourself more

25
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:55,879
wholeheartedly to the Simplicity of mindfulness the Simplicity

26
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:01,840
of being aware here now

27
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,959
and it's a powerful thing to be mindful to be aware to understand and know and

28
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:14,440
feel what's happening because that kind of offering of presence offering of

29
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:20,400
attention uh re uh takes away some of the energy

30
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,840
of preoccupation of anxiety of desires of

31
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:34,080
attachments of being lost in thought and takes this life energy of who we are and

32
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,280
begins putting it in a good direction the good direction of simple

33
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,360
awareness so to assume a meditation

34
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,480
posture think of it as a posture of

35
00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:01,159
attention and whatever way that works for you whatever posture works for you

36
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:09,519
assume that posture with some care that it feels like your whole body

37
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,439
is going to be

38
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,400
attentive gently closing the

39
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:34,840
eyes and take taking a few gently long

40
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:43,080
breaths just comfortable enough to feel the rib cage the Torso

41
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:05,280
expand and as you exhale maybe a [Music]

42
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,120
longer exhale than

43
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:18,638
usual so that you can relax let go settle in here

44
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,280
and letting your breathing return to

45
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:56,000
normal and continuing to relax and as you relax the

46
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,479
body feel like you're relaxing into

47
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:08,400
some inner depth some place deep

48
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:16,160
inside that where you feel stability

49
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,199
steadiness

50
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,199
subtleness relaxing face shoulders belly

51
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,080
chest as it works for you

52
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,919
and then letting your breathing breathe itself and letting

53
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:36,479
yourself be quiet quieter and Stiller no longer making any effort to

54
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:43,159
relax Stiller quieter attentiveness

55
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:50,080
here to the body breathing maybe an

56
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:58,440
attentiveness a sensing from within the body

57
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,479
itself for

58
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,199
and in the quiet of sitting here

59
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:06,279
can you find or remind yourself touch

60
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:14,399
into whatever you have that's

61
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:21,519
a gentle yes to being

62
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,920
mindful to being present with

63
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,200
attention to be aware

64
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:43,920
here and that yes might be a confidence and

65
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,440
awareness a trusting and

66
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:58,760
mindfulness an inspiration or enthusiasm for simple attention

67
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,920
it might be the faith in this path of

68
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:14,279
practice whatever it might be I'm summarizing it with the word

69
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,560
yes is there some place in your

70
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:27,320
body that's the home that's a source deep inside for

71
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:34,160
that yes for that inspiration

72
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:52,000
confidence and if there

73
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:01,240
is rest there

74
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:06,920
breathe with that place breathe through

75
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:20,320
it let your yes arise from the place of Faith or

76
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:28,000
confidence to support simple

77
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,320
awareness of what is here

78
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,560
now maybe with a Simplicity of

79
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,160
breathing in the midst of all other things that you're going

80
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
on

81
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

82
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120

83
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120

e e

89
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,920
whatever is challenging for you difficult for you

90
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,800
thoughts feelings if they should have rise as you

91
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:57,560
meditate remind yourself of your ability to say

92
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,360
yes to being

93
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:13,280
aware yes to putting your life energy into being

94
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,000
aware rather than

95
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
preoccupied

96
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

97
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

98
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

99
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
for

100
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
e e

101
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,600
letting your mindful

102
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:10,960
flow out of a quiet gentle

103
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,120
yes to being aware

104
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,559
here e

105
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
now

106
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

107
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440

for

110
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,360
e e

111
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:20,159
and then as we come to the end of this sitting to appreciate that it's quite

112
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:27,440
rare for people to stop to be really attentive and aware of

113
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,240
their experience and even more

114
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:39,000
rare that they know something about how to hold their suffering their stress

115
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,679
their tensions their challenges in

116
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:52,159
Awareness nonreactive awareness an awareness that

117
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:59,158
clarifies awareness that allows some deeper healing and understanding

118
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,519
an awareness that

119
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:12,559
interrupts the train wreck of just thinking over and over

120
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,480
again in ways that perpetuate

121
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,919
suffering and this ability to be

122
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:34,000
present for challenging es is a growing capacity we learn from

123
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,399
this practice and it becomes a gift that we can give to

124
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:46,320
others and we can be present without perpetuating the

125
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:54,960
reactivity that others have that just groups of people have that we can be a calm

126
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:01,679
clear presence to see

127
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:09,559
clearly that maybe helps others to be Cal for helps others to be See

128
00:28:09,559 --> 00:28:19,840
Clearly to helps others to be seen well so we don't see them through our

129
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,760
reactivity may it

130
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,039
be that in our yes to

131
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:37,440
awareness there can well up within us the wish for others

132
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:46,440
happiness may all beings be happy may all beings be

133
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,399
safe may all beings be

134
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:58,320
peaceful and may all beings be free

135
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:08,559
and may we find a way today to contribute this into our

136
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:15,880
world no matter how small the gesture the attention the care that we

137
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:24,320
give may we support the welfare and happiness of those we meet

138
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:37,169
[Music]

139
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,279
thank

140
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,039
you e

141
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:58,880
so hello and today I'm going to conclude the five-part series that I started last

142
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,559
week on the four noble truths to the end of

143
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:11,600
suffering and um and so the fourth Noble Truth is the

144
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:19,720
noble truth of the practice the way the method that leads to the end of

145
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:28,639
suffering that goes to the end of suffering and um and uh the the the the

146
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:35,919
way the practices that lead to it are defined as the or described as the

147
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:41,000
eight-fold path and these are

148
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,679
amazing uh practices that are not exactly only

149
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:53,399
practices they are states of beings qualities of

150
00:31:53,399 --> 00:31:59,639
character almost that can build up inside of us so that at some point they

151
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:06,960
are not practices but rather who we are they're so integrated into the

152
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,200
fabric of our being fabric of our character our

153
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:20,720
personality that um they're no they are no longer practices but at first they are

154
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:27,080
practices but I say I make this point because um the idea is that this is not

155
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:32,559
importing a practice from outside it's an it might feel like that

156
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:39,679
way at first but it's really learning to awaken something inside that uh can flow

157
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:45,559
through us that can uh be kind of our own that of course we're this

158
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:55,519
way and um so uh the uh eful path begins with of

159
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:04,080
course I'll be present for suffering of course I'll attend to it

160
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:10,799
because to not do that will make it worse now if attending to suffering does

161
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:16,200
make it worse then maybe that's not the right call for now something else is

162
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:22,559
needed then some other preparation work but some point in this for Noble Truth

163
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:28,360
process there's a yes to being present for suffering

164
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:36,399
being present for it so that we can start seeing the cause in attachment and

165
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:42,880
craving present forward so we can notice first the moments and then the longer

166
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:50,480
periods where the suffering is no longer there appreciate that it's not constant

167
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:57,440
but then in some kind of way more attentive more careful we are here in the present moment the more we can see

168
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:04,519
that um it it does wax and Wayne and when it decreases that's

169
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:11,398
something important to see and if it decreases enough sometimes by accident sometimes because we're distracted it

170
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:18,280
shows us it's we're not NE necessarily stuck in our what we call

171
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:24,679
suffering and so willingness to say yes to attention yes this is called right

172
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:31,158
view right to attention to suffering and then as we become become more

173
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:37,599
sensitive to ourselves there comes this right attitude or right resolve which is

174
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:43,800
to avoid um being cruel avoid being

175
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:50,720
unkind avoid being attached and caught up in all kinds of addictive sensual

176
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:58,760
behaviors and actions there's a sense that there's something here deep within that does not

177
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:05,680
want to harm ourselves or harm others through acts of Cruelty and so care and

178
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:12,520
compassion become prominent doesn't want to be unkind but rather wants to be

179
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:19,839
friendly doesn't want to be caught up in addictive behavior wants to be free of

180
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:26,000
them there's uh as we practice there then it follows then that we want to be

181
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,400
careful with our speech this our speech should should be kind

182
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:37,839
speech should at least avoid lying our speech should not be harsh speech should

183
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:43,320
not be um slander not because it's a should that

184
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:49,319
we have to take on because it grows out of this practice of sensitivity to

185
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:54,400
suffering and to stress and to the ouches of what are in of course we don't

186
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,839
want to create more stress for ourselves of of course we don't want to create something that's going to harm

187
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:07,520
ourselves and the height heightened sensitivity we have we can feel that um

188
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,319
harsh language lying language slanderous language is

189
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:18,480
um harms something within ourselves it diminishes something it closes something

190
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,599
it limits us and the same thing with um right action which is to avoid killing

191
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:29,720
and stealing and sexual misconduct that these things

192
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:38,079
also limit us harm us cause difficulties and so uh so if we want to

193
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:44,000
continue this heightened sensitivity of mindfulness heightened sensitivity to suffering in the end of

194
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,119
suffering we want to live in a way that doesn't go against the grain of that we

195
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:57,079
want to live in a way that doesn't decrease our sensitivity but actually increases our sensitivity to uh be more

196
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:05,560
attentive more careful same thing with uh the way we live our life livelihood and Lifestyles

197
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:12,119
to be careful with those that those don't cause harm and then there's a right effort

198
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:18,520
which is to be very careful now of inner states of Mind inner states of being

199
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:25,280
that we can sense and feel the difference between UNH wholesome ways of being and wholesome healthy ways of

200
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,560
being states of mind and unhealthy healthy so we can have the sensitivity

201
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:38,240
keep growing because unhealthy states of Mind decreases our sensitivity to the path to the freedom

202
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:44,480
to the end of suffering wholesome wholesome ones increases

203
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,760
it develop concentration develop mindfulness right

204
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:56,920
mindfulness and right concentration these all support this movement to a greater presence greater sensitivity to

205
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:03,599
this experience here and so the Eightfold the the the fourth Noble Truth is doing those

206
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:10,599
practices that cultivate the conditions for a greater attentiveness sensitivity

207
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:16,200
so that wisdom can arise within so a deeper understanding can arise so we

208
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:21,760
become sensitive to and inspired by a yes to

209
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:28,880
suffering being present for it and seeing it seeing the cause of it and

210
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:35,040
seeing the sensation of it letting go letting go more deeply letting go of all

211
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:41,960
the things that involve some kind of self harm all the ways in which we

212
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:50,040
contribute to our suffering our anguish our distress our anxiety the whole gamut

213
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:55,960
that's under the umbrella term Dua suffering the emotional pain that we

214
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:01,280
contribute to and so knowing that there are these eight

215
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,400
practices um and they're practices that are pointing us back to ourselves not

216
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:14,240
taking us away so we have to be very careful how we practice them that they're not holding on to them to like a

217
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:20,800
like a um life ring keeping us afloat and just uh or as

218
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:28,640
a you know as a something to do that takes us away from ourselves the four the eight full

219
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,200
eight practices of the eight full path are practices that really help us be

220
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:40,280
here in Awareness in attention the heightened sensitivity to this life of

221
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:47,079
ours and they create the conditions these eight practices that create the conditions for greater and greater

222
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:52,720
capacity to understand to have Clarity to be present and develop kind of

223
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,880
strength behind the mindfulness a strength behind our presence as strength

224
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,079
behind our dedication to a path that ends

225
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:08,440
suffering and it's not just for ourselves we do this path but we also

226
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:15,079
can do it for others as we do this path and develop along the Buddhist PR practice at some point it doesn't make a

227
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:22,240
lot of sense to keep doing it if we only do it for ourselves at some point the inspiration

228
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,319
that comes to keep doing this practice even for yourself is for the benefit of

229
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:35,400
others so you can be a conduit to benefits you can be an inspiration you could be someone who doesn't cause harm

230
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:43,760
someone who lives for the welfare and happiness of others so um the hateful path don't

231
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:49,440
cause Awakening but they lead to Liberation

232
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,599
they are a gradual path that leads to heightened care sensitivity a heightened

233
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:03,000
wholesomeness heightened letting go that supports us to eventually uh see and

234
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,240
experience the end of suffering in a very dramatic and full

235
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,480
way and at that point the e-fold path

236
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:18,640
takes on a very different uh flavor very different nature because at some point

237
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:26,359
it's really clear that the eful path it uh is not not practices anymore but are

238
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:33,280
ways of living that emerge almost naturally almost part of who we are that

239
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:39,680
we live this way rather than we have to do them and um and that's a amazing

240
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:47,640
Tipping Point that brings a tremendous amount of Happiness so that will be the topic for

241
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:53,079
the next four days of this week I'll start a new series of four part series

242
00:41:53,079 --> 00:42:00,359
um called um for happiness and and uh and this is the uh

243
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:08,280
what what I'm calling kind of a little bit my own categories but the four truths of happiness or the four noble

244
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:15,200
truths of happiness because it's directly ties into um the the fruition

245
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:22,079
of the four noble truths and now there's the four noble happy Noble happinesses

246
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,559
so that'll be the topic and um I will look forward to start starting

247
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:32,720
that uh tomorrow and um I thank you very much

248

249
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:47,480
Faith this inspiration or enthusiasm or confidence you have in mindfulness and

250
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:53,800
see if you can bring it into your life so that it just you you naturally find

251
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:01,000
yourself more sensitive more aligned with the Eightfold Path the

252
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:06,559
