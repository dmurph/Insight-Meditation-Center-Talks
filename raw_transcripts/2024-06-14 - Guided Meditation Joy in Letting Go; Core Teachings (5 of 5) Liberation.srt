1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,000
so good morning again and uh I was saying that I'm feel

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:16,520
kind of delighted to be here partly from having done the half an hour walk from my house to IMC in this uh wonderful

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,279
clear cool morning there's something about

4
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:28,080
uh um the Simplicity of walking in the early morning

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,640
and having Many Things Fall away and just being

6
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:40,600
here and breathing the cool air and the Simplicity of just being that is a

7
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:47,480
delight so to prepare for this meditation um if

8
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:54,640
someone uh keeps their hand tight in a fist for a long

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,199
time and then somehow or other they have the occasion for it to un to

10
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:08,159
relax uh it can be a tremendous relief and that relief can come with a surge of

11
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:17,040
uh kind of J Jo Joy or Delight or that is just uh uh almost distracting from

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,159
distracting us from our distractions pulls us away for a little bit from all

13
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,840
the concerns we have and preoccupations and the the thoughts that may be ideas

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,360
that were causing us to tighten up the f to begin with and uh it's almost like for maybe a

15
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:41,680
second or two it's like being on a slide and sliding down and everything kind of stops for the purposes of just you know

16
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,040
wishing down the slide and and uh so there's the relief and

17
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:56,159
maybe even Joy of everything being letting go of everything so as we do this

18
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,920
meditation um let go just let go of

19
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,960
everything let go of anything you every time you let go of your thoughts look

20
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:16,840
for the relief look for the the moment of Joy the moment of being on that slide

21
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:22,599
ah as you exhale there's a kind of letting go and there and I sometimes

22
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:28,640
particularly feel like there's a slide is kind of as the the sensations in the

23
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,760
Torso in the chest in the belly and diaphragm of releasing the the breath gets

24
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,959
released and um and uh the inhale too can be a

25
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:48,120
letting go if you let go into the uh into the breathing in the body breathing

26
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,239
in uh let go of preoccupations if there's physical pain

27
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,840
as you sit and ache uh maybe you can't let go of the pain but maybe let go of

28
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,400
the resistance to it or the aversion to it if there's desire for something maybe

29
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:11,599
that thing you don't let go of but maybe the desire for it for a moment or two can be let

30
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:17,920
go let have letting go be what you do on this

31
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:23,360
meditation that every time you be with a breath you've let go of

32
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:30,840
thoughts but as you do so see if you can enjoy it find the relief

33
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:39,400
and if you're straining and trying too much to meditate or to follow these instructions maybe the relief in the the

34
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:46,080
Delight can come from letting go of these instructions and then continuing to

35
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:53,760
meditate letting go again and again and again but see if you can find the relief

36
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,799
or the enjoyment that somehow um keeps you

37
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:08,000
contented here and now in the present moment with your direct experience

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,400
now so let go

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,199
enjoy and if you whatever you might need

40
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:28,520
to let go of you might have to turn the attention back some deeper

41
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:35,440
way into the mind to find out where the stage director is off seemingly off

42
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:42,919
stage commmentating judging coming to conclusions and maybe letting go is

43
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:48,880
bringing the stage director on the stage so it's seen

44
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:57,680
clearly and you let go then let go and enjoy let go and feel

45
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,880
the relief

46
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:11,880
and don't make anything big about this if you're able to let go don't let start thinking about it let go again and

47
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,440
again so assuming a meditation

48
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,560
posture gently closing your

49
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:31,360
eyes and in a moment taking a deep breath and relaxing on the exhale

50
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:39,759
before doing that what is it that you can release physically mentally

51
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:47,520
emotionally what can you release as you exhale so taking a deep

52
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,160
breath and letting

53
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:01,639
go taking a deep breath and letting go into the body into the present moment

54
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:19,080
here and after taking a few long slow deep breaths and

55
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:27,960
relaxing see if you can ever so slightly enjoy now letting go of breathing

56
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,000
deeply letting go of that

57
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:44,319
effort and breathing in a normal way on the

58
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:50,599
exhale maybe there's a relaxing in the body relaxing in the mind that is a form

59
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:59,039
of letting go too enjoy it

60
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,199
the Deep breath and just breathing in breathing

61
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:44,080
out is there some releasing of thought or the grip gripping to

62
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:56,360
thought letting go of thoughts and letting go into the

63
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:03,680
breathing in a way that's a relief a

64
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:12,120
joy you've probably spent enough time in your life thinking it can be a

65
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:19,479
relief to let go for this few minutes of your preoccupations in favor

66
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:23,919
of the joy of Letting

67
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:31,440
Go Here and Now

68
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
for

69
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360

e for

82
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,650
perhaps it's useful to let go of

83
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:14,798
[Music] whatever's caught your

84
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:21,558
attention whatever you're caught in at every

85
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,840
exhale maybe it's letting go of physical tension in your body

86
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,559
or letting go of the aversion

87
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:44,600
or to the tension letting go of

88
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:52,480
thoughts or letting go of being bothered by your thoughts

89
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:04,200
maybe Letting Go takes a form of

90
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,799
softening and as you let

91
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:21,120
go notice the

92
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,799
relief or the joy of Letting

93
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,279
Go however slight it might

94
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
be

95
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

96
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640

97
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

98
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,559

99
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

100
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,480
e e

101
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:58,799
and as if when you let go

102
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:05,240
if you feel any relief or Delight in letting

103
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:12,480
go allow yourself to have a ever so slight

104
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,278
smile turning up the corners of your

105
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:26,120
lips just enough so there's a kind of delight in your face

106
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:35,120
and keep keep letting go with every

107
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,760
exhale maybe with every

108
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:47,000
inhale and let whatever Joy or relief that

109
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:54,760
is in that Letting Go let it be registered in your

110
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,080
body your heart

111
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,360
let it be like a wind of

112
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:13,000
wellbeing that blows through your very being

113
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:03,880
and as we come to the end of this sitting may it

114
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:14,159
be that the joy of Letting Go allows us to be more present for

115
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,159
others in a way that appreciates

116
00:26:20,919 --> 00:26:30,240
them where we take the light in the loveliness of other

117
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,960
s or where our joy and our

118
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:45,559
wellbe is the manner by which we through which we see

119
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:52,679
Others May we bring joy with us into the

120
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,840
world and in so doing

121
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:08,519
maybe may we be the conditions to support the well-being and happiness of

122
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,559
Others May all beings be

123
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:21,879
happy may all beings be delighted in feeling

124
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,840
safe may all beings

125
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,600
be free of their

126
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,679
suffering may all

127
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:53,480
beings let go enough to

128
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,919
experience the appreciation

129
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,200
the respect that you might offer

130
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:11,398
them may all beings be happy

131
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:31,270
[Music]

132
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,960
thank you

133
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,399
so so welcome to this fifth talk

134
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:40,600
on where I try to offer the a description or explanation of the core

135
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:47,799
teachings that I base my rest of my teachings on the kind of the foundational

136
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:55,200
teachings and maybe what uh you know in some ways animates or motivates me to to

137
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:03,519
teach so um so review what we that I've done

138
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:10,679
this week so far that um I I place the uh

139
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:18,159
attention sensitivity to suffering and the end of suffering at the center of

140
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:24,919
the Dharma that I teach that um the possibility of ending suffering the

141
00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:31,640
possibility of meeting suffering in the world and oneself uh in a deep way is one of the one of

142
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:38,480
the most profound things that I know a person can do that they're many wonderful things to do in the

143
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,320
world but I believe one of the most fundamental wonderful things is bring

144
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:54,960
suffering to an end and either for oneself or working to support others to do that and um and that uh then whatever

145
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:02,039
other wonderful things we do we do in ref reference to that freedom from suffering and then it makes everything

146
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:08,799
else more meaningful or more more valuable because uh it conveys then that

147
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:14,200
possibility for others as well and that

148
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:21,679
um and that that uh end of suffering is supported by not holding on to any views

149
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:28,519
any fixed views that there's a freedom from use and certainly human beings do

150
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:34,440
tremendous amount of projecting onto others onto reality onto themselves of

151
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:40,200
Concepts ideas judgments and bias and we do that with our religious practice

152
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:48,039
spiritual practices as well and one of the key qualities of the kind of Buddhism that I really kind of uh

153
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:55,240
oriented towards is uh not holding on to any views uh as being ultimate religious

154
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:01,880
views this is the even the idea that this is the truth is a kind of um uh

155
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:08,720
dangerous kind of territory that lends itself to one more view to put on top of

156
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,880
things and um certainly there are understandings and perspectives that are

157
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,039
invaluable but there's a way in which as we practice goes deeper that we rely

158
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:25,240
less and less on perspectives less and less on views and interpretations and even Buddhist

159
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:30,679
teachings and um ultimately we need to be freed of Buddhism

160
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:36,880
too and then uh to uh um the

161
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:43,600
um the um the naturalis naturalistic aspect of

162
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:49,279
all this that by the absence of views uh there's a way in which we're being very

163
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:54,960
present here and now that there is a natural unfolding there's a natural way

164
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,000
in which we operate and um and and that we can stay close to we don't have to

165
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,760
rely on things that require views including views of the supernatural or things we can't know directly for our

166
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:13,440
own experience so this this direct connection to direct experience because

167
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:21,440
it's not just direct experience in and of itself but direct experience is a medium through the Natural Healthy

168
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:29,880
processing unfolding evolving of our heart our mind our spirituality our freedom can

169
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:36,039
occur and so we want to stay close to that and part of that uh naturalism that

170
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:42,559
we stay close to is a natural capacity for positive emotions positive social

171
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:50,799
emotions that involve care care itself compassion loving kindness um empathy

172
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:57,200
for empathy that this is part of the Awakening of that happens in Buddhism

173
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:03,919
The Awakening of the sensitive heart Awakening of the heart that can be attuned to the welfare of others to the

174
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,079
suffering of others to ourselves but to do so without being distressed without

175
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:14,358
being troubled to without being caught up in views of self and others and

176
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:19,960
meaning and victim and and uh even the views of responsibility and obligation

177
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:26,158
to others there's a radical way in which the we're setting free this beautiful

178
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:32,040
human sensitivity that can inform us and guide us and motivate us that is part of

179
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:39,560
the naturalistic movement not the the projected movement of responsibilities

180
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:44,878
obligations should shouldn't uh good person bad

181
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:50,040
person and and so the and so as the sensitivity to suffering

182
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,599
deepens uh so it does to ourselves and the remarkable thing about the path of

183
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:03,680
Liberation is that it becomes a more and more subtle uh sensitivity to uh suffering

184
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:11,119
which at some point doesn't be really you can't really call it suffering anymore maybe in the in the way that

185
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:16,720
popular world thinks of suffering as big big St big things but it's becomes a

186
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:22,440
very subtle very deep stress or tension that we carry deep in our psyche deep in

187
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,480
our in our minds that underlies everything that we're also addressing in

188
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:35,680
the path and then we come to today where uh the one of the fundamental orientations

189
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,960
I have in teaching is that there's Liberation and a path to

190
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:47,079
Liberation and that that the path to Liberation is a naturalistic path that

191
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:53,640
unfolds it opens up that shows itself as the mindfulness as the stability as the

192
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:59,000
concentration this steadiness of the heart and mind becomes deeper and deeper

193
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:05,119
that um we can feel that onward leading nature to the end of

194
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:11,760
suffering and um and that there's a call there's a motivation there's a a desire

195
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:18,079
for that end that it's not a projection that's not a attachment but a completely

196
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:25,240
naturalistic desire that uh is he healthy to adhere to or healthy to go

197
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:30,680
along with and um and so in this naturalistic way that I like to teach or

198
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:39,480
like to understand I use a very physical uh ordinary example that uh could be

199
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:47,200
seen as somewhat reductionistic or materialistic even but it's speaks to the naturalism naturalistic nature of

200
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:53,839
what happens in this deep kind of path of Liberation and that is uh the example I

201
00:36:53,839 --> 00:37:00,920
often like like to use um is to hold on tightly to your fist really to hold

202
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:06,960
tightly on it and um and if you hang on to a tight Fist and do a really good job

203
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,960
with a tight fist like like almost so like your hand's going to go numb or it's going to hurt without without

204
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:20,680
injuring yourself and uh what you'll start feeling uh is a natural tendency to

205
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:26,359
relax the grip so if you can do that if you want to do this as an exercise um to

206
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:35,040
really like do a good job like you're going to NE you're proud of how well you can keep that hand constantly tight and

207
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,599
then I'm going to tell a story of uh how in Ancient India there

208
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:45,640
was a way of catching monkeys now it turns out that monkeys apparently love

209
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:52,720
sweets so a monkey Hunter would uh cut out a carve out a slot in a coconut

210
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:58,240
carve out the inside of the coconut enough to put a candy in it and so the

211
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,640
monkey and then you tie the coconut to a tree the monkey comes along and knows

212
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:11,599
the candy is in there and can only get the hand in through that slot by having the hand flat and it goes in and and

213
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:17,280
holds on to the candy but then the hand is kind of bunched up and now it tries

214
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:24,440
to pull out the hand and it can't do it and it doesn't want to let go of the candy and it can't get free of the

215
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:30,400
coconut and the coconut is tied the Hunter just comes along and picks up the

216
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:37,040
the monkey and it's caught so as I told that story were you able to maintain

217
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:42,079
that tight fist were you a little bit distracted by me and by the story and if

218
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:50,160
you were then you probably felt a little release You Can Let Go Now of your fist if you'd like a little release of uh

219
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:57,000
Letting Go the natural tendency of tension of holding on tight in the muscles is that muscles want to relax

220
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:05,640
and let go go so whether it's physical tension or emotional tension or mental tension the

221
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:11,200
nature of that tension is to want to relax and maybe I'm anthropomorphizing a

222
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:17,200
bit to call it that it wants to let go but that's the onward leading nature of it it has the nature it has the

223
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:24,280
characteristic of of it takes energy to keep it going and so and the energy is

224
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:31,240
tiring to keep expanding so the movement is towards to letting go of any

225
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:36,880
tension all suffering comes with tension all suffering comes with a certain kind

226
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,920
of work believe it or not and so as that we can feel the work we can feel the

227
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:48,160
tension and how it there's almost like a desire to let go to

228
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:54,480
release and um and so that's the path of Liberation opens up through being

229
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,200
sensitized to this and seeing and following the the the movement towards

230
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:05,560
us deeper and deeper letting go and uh it's what our system our whole

231
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:11,440
psychophysical system most wants more than any other

232
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:18,440
desire and um and what we find is that that desire is a natural desire it's a a

233
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:25,920
desire that comes without tension desire that and I call it again this reductionistic way the biological

234
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:32,319
imperative to liberation and in the process of uh uh my own

235
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:39,480
practice and my own path of Liberation um I it's made a huge impact on me how

236
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:46,240
deep and thorough the possibility of freedom from suffering can be that the Buddhist teaching that there's an end to

237
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:53,720
suffering this is real it is possible to end suffering and uh the completeness the

238
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:59,599
fullness of that's possible uh has taught me that even though sometimes it's

239
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:07,200
temporary uh and suffering comes back afterwards uh it's a radical transformation to experience that uh

240
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,880
even temporarily this very full complete letting go that this tradition points to

241
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:20,440
as possible and that that becomes then the guide for all the rest of this that

242
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:27,720
uh yes there is uh uh it's important to address suffering directly and to uh

243
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:35,280
bring it to an end yes views no matter how subtle get in the way of the deepest

244
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,640
letting go that we can do yes this is a kind of a natural

245
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:48,040
process we're involved in that we cannot um orchestrate that we cannot in the end

246
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:54,880
uh uh make happen and uh yes this natural desire

247
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:02,000
for end of suffering is is a deep form of care deep form of compassion and love

248
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,200
and yes there is a path yes this deep deep Liberation is

249
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:14,119
possible and uh and uh and so this is

250
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:22,440
what uh underlies in the background of what I teach and uh there was a time before we

251
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:28,119
kind had to remodel IMC that in the wall opposite with it where I sit teaching

252
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:34,400
there was a for the teacher sake high up in the wall was a synonym for Liberation

253
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:42,440
uh reminding that me reminding teachers that all the teachings are in some way or other are moving in that direction as

254
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:48,680
well and um and that uh this is what uh this is

255
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:55,920
about and um and everything else in Buddhism I'd like to believe um is an

256
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:03,400
extension of this or Builds on that is founded on this uh and

257
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:08,599
um and I operate under the I teaching that that this is really a worthwhile

258
00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:17,000
goal for the world that we don't just do this Liberation for ourselves that um we do it uh to benefit

259
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:23,839
and support everyone that some of us need to take this path all the way to the end so that

260
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:29,440
everyone sees that it's possible there's hope there's possibility it we don't have to keep living in a

261
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:35,280
world of strife and animosity and greed we don't have to always kind of be

262
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:42,200
caught in ourselves and kind of building up the self or protecting yourself in a certain kind of way there's a radical

263
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:49,520
Freedom that is possible that uh that um we can

264
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:54,559
experience so that it's kind of equivalent to the airlines who say put

265
00:43:54,559 --> 00:44:00,720
on your uh air mask for yourself first and then uh help

266
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,319
others so um so I hope that these uh teachings

267
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:14,920
have been useful for you to understand at least me and what's underneath my teachings and um and uh I'm very

268
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:20,839
grateful for this opportunity to teach this way and let you know and very grateful for all my opportunities to be

269
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:28,040
able to teach I feel so fortunate that um that uh I have these opportunities to

270
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:36,079
share something that is so profound for me and something that allows me to um to

271
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:45,920
give expression to my care and compassion for this world that we live in so thank you very much
