1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:10,960
so hello and i some of you uh probably miss the

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:16,800
meadow the hillside and spirit rock where i was this last few days and i miss it as well

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,920
and i would love to do this

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,359
broadcasting and meditation and teaching in the natural world and

5
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,760
i haven't figured out how i can do it with the urban life that i live here

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,640
and um but this is uh it was a nice taste for those three days

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,239
so um

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:54,000
there's a whole class of mental states and mental

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,640
practices in buddhism that fit underneath the

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,479
is in the family of tranquility peace tranquility calm

11
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,720
subtleness stability all kinds of things where things get

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,200
still stillness quiet peaceful that come along with a deep sense of

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,400
reassurance and confidence and trust and

14
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:31,280
sense of at-homeness the famous story of the buddha touching

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,600
the earth and i think today is

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,280
john muir's birthday but touching the earth

17
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,240
and and you know to feel our

18
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,680
belonging here that's so intimate that isn't that we ever don't belong we're

19
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:02,079
just we are part of the earth and um

20
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:09,119
the um so the subtleness has come in this process of uh

21
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:16,879
of the factors of awakening there is at some point there's joy

22
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,400
and a very important movement is how joy is a bridge

23
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:30,080
to happiness where happiness is more more

24
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,519
simpler more refined more embodied more

25
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:42,239
associated with a very deep contentment whereas joy has more to do is more

26
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,440
associated with the bubble bubbling and excitement of something

27
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:53,440
and so in this process of the satyabatana the process of

28
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,080
seven factors awakening we're going through uh this phase of um

29
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,720
of tranquil of tranquility of relaxing and uh calming

30
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,280
uh our whole system but in particular uh the texts talk about calming the body

31
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,640
so i'll do i will do a i'll do offer a guided meditation

32
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,159
through the first five

33
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,560
factors of awakening and coming to tranquility and and that kind

34
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:40,000
of happiness maybe and if you don't follow don't worry about it

35
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,200
maybe imagine use your imagination to participate as if

36
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,280
you can feel or imagine these things and then someday you might

37
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,840
recognize them

38
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,720
so assuming a upright alert posture

39
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,680
and even though later there will be a process of relaxing

40
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,840
relaxing can begin right at the beginning

41
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,280
and to take a few deep breaths

42
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:47,000
on the exhale let your body settle in to the spot in which you're sitting

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,479
taking a deep breath and relaxing releasing the

44
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:12,960
whole body as if there's a big ah

45
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:20,600
as you exhale here now

46
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,560
and then let your breathing return to normal

47
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:47,360
and part of the function of relaxing at the beginning is to

48
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,960
awaken a certain kind of

49
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,880
healthy awareness in your body

50
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:06,960
healthy sensitivity that works best when the body is relaxed

51
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:13,440
and so to relax and feel if there's a shift in

52
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,800
sensitivity sense of awareness

53
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,280
in the parts of the body that you relax

54
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:33,000
so the exhale softening the muscles of the face

55
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,199
and as they soften different sensations are there than if

56
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:49,400
this face is tense and different receptivity

57
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:03,680
as you exhale softening relaxing

58
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,840
the shoulders

59
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:30,720
and feeling with whatever softening relaxing releasing of the shoulders you can have

60
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:37,199
if there's now a little bit more awareness in your shoulders

61
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,840
more ability to sense and feel in a certain way

62
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,919
perhaps on the exhale you can soften the chest

63
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:11,080
and awaken a certain kind of attentiveness awareness

64
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:20,599
sensitivity to certain kinds of feelings that come with the relaxation

65
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,560
and then the same thing with the belly relaxing

66
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,560
softening

67
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:48,240
and even if the relaxation brings

68
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,360
sensations that are not so comfortable maybe

69
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,920
appreciate the heightened sensitivity

70
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,680
and then using the same process in the mind

71
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,800
as you exhale relaxing the mind the thinking

72
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,800
energy

73
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,399
and if you're thinking quiet and the mind

74
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,120
settles a bit

75
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,000
is there some kind of shift in how the sensitivity the awareness of the

76
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,640
mind is present for you

77
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,800
and then now for a little while connecting to your breathing

78
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,160
maybe relaxing on the exhale

79
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,600
and with whatever heightened sensitivity that that relaxation provides

80
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,839
receive the sensations of breathing in

81
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,760
breathing in and breathing out

82
00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:01,920
on the exhale letting go of your thoughts

83
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,040
as if your thoughts can drift away

84
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,800
and with whatever degree of calm you have

85
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,120
let your awareness be sensitive to

86
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:56,480
the contrast of any tension that your whole body mind system might

87
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:05,480
have and almost like there's a conversation between the calm and the tension

88
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,120
the subtleness and the agitation

89
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:47,600
and to whatever degree you can choose the part the calm

90
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:56,160
way of going choose being quiet and peaceful

91
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,160
non-reactive

92
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:08,000
instead of letting your mind choose agitated thoughts or

93
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:16,279
stress tension follow the trail

94
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,160
of peace relaxation

95
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:48,720
and if you can see the difference between being caught in thoughts and not caught

96
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:57,040
between following a path of stress and agitation

97
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:04,079
versus following a path of calm instability peace

98
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,160
you see that difference

99
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:14,399
that can be a source of joy

100
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,399
of delight that you just see the possibility of

101
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:29,480
following a trail towards peace

102
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:47,759
the joy that you know an alternative

103
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:57,120
to being stressed or preoccupied caught up

104
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:05,839
and while it's not always easy to follow the alternative path of peace

105
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:14,360
it's a inspiration to know it exists that you can see the difference

106
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,760
and if you do feel some inspiration some joy

107
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,840
at this difference maybe allow yourself to have a little

108
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,440
quarter smile with the corners of your lips

109
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:56,320
move up a little bit to share in the delight and the joy

110
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,400
of having this practice to practice

111
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:57,440
and then see if you can know relax your body even more

112
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:08,640
as if before you're relaxing the surface parts now something deeper

113
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:17,000
deeper in the face relaxing and softening

114
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,360
deeper in the shoulders

115
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,279
deeper in the chest

116
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,840
he deep in the belly

117
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:23,840
the relaxing of the whole body that is also letting go

118
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,080
into a kind of contentment

119
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:36,080
simply being here present connected

120
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,640
with a sensitivity that comes from being

121
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,640
relaxed

122
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,799
with each exhale

123
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:20,240
letting the body and mind become more tranquil

124
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:25,120
even if it's infinitesimal movements

125
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,039
we're in the inhale you're present for

126
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:38,720
any of the non-tranquil ways you are in the body

127
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,600
and mind however subtle

128
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:52,480
on the exhale you relax soften

129
00:23:54,400 --> 00:24:00,279
let go into whatever piece that's here

130
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,120
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

131
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,320
to feel or imagine

132
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,200
any degree of peace that's present for you

133
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,440
or with imagining remembering

134
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,480
a feeling of peace that you've had sometime in your life

135
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,880
deep tranquility

136
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:18,320
and imagine that your calm and your peacefulness

137
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,600
can be felt by others

138
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:34,158
that it is a gift that spreads from you into the world

139
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:42,158
and may it be that in known and unknown ways

140
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,039
your experience of peace

141
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:57,679
supports others to also know peace or to feel less anxious

142
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,000
may it be that our peace and our contact with peace and deep

143
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:13,840
tranquility is shared with the whole world

144
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,679
may it be that it spreads from us for the welfare and happiness of others

145
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,679
may we be a source of peace for this world

146
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:36,720
may all beings be happy may all beings

147
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:45,120
be safe may all beings be peaceful

148
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,720
and may all beings experience freedom

149
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:03,080
and may we contribute to that possibility

150
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,000
[Music]

151
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,559
so today i will

152
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,559
cover the tranquility factor of awakening and the

153
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:54,320
concentration factor of awakening so that um

154
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,399
six the fifth and sixth factors and these

155
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:05,520
factors of awakening the way that the instructions are in

156
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,039
that satipatana sutta it does not say evoke these

157
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:18,799
make them come forth or it says recognize when they're present

158
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,159
and then when they're present support them and maintain them

159
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:32,320
and uh and i think the reason why it says that is that this the seven factors awakening

160
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,240
are a byproduct of doing mindfulness practice and as the practice begins to have some

161
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:46,080
momentum it it brings forth within us

162
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:53,120
a clear and clear capacity for awareness so mindfulness practice

163
00:29:53,120 --> 00:30:00,320
is bringing forth a an abiding a living in

164
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,159
a state of awareness a way of being aware that's

165
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,200
maybe very individual how different people recognize that they are aware some

166
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,200
people may be more with thought some people more with other perception perceptive

167
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,960
ways of being some people feel awareness is more like consciousness it's just a

168
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:29,760
broad feel the state of attention there's a heightened sensitivity

169
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:37,919
that comes naturally it's like whatever for you that is awareness that if you relax deeply

170
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:44,080
you can't turn it off uh in a relaxed quiet state that's not distracted in thoughts

171
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:49,520
the awareness will be there just uh no way not to have it

172
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:56,720
and so this natural state somewhat natural state becomes strong becomes pervasive

173
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,720
it's kind of like if someone um

174
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,679
you know it's like now it's gotten light outside so or light in this room if you i come

175
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:15,679
in here and it's dark i don't see anything and then slowly the light

176
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:21,600
the sun comes up and slowly gets more more light until finally

177
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,960
maybe you don't say it this way but the natural state of the room when the sun is up is to be able to is

178
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:35,760
to have light and be able to see it the whole room is then in awareness in a kind of effortless way

179
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,919
so the sun of awareness dawns and grows within us

180
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:48,159
until awareness becomes stronger and there's heightened clarity of what's happening in the present

181
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:54,399
moment and that heightened clarity lets us distinguish between

182
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,600
the trail that leads to suffering the trail leads to stress and reactivity and

183
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:05,360
the trail that leads to peace to wisdom to to

184
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:13,279
happiness and and to be able to see that distinction

185
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,480
then it can bring a lot of joy because then there's we know

186
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,519
where the path is we know the trail to take we know what trail to avoid

187
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:30,240
um and so it might not be easy to avoid the old habits

188
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,240
but at least we know there's a difference some people don't even know and then slowly we break the old habits

189
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,159
and we begin following a healthy way of being the trail to happiness into peace and

190
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,279
this brings a lot of joy into so very much associated with the joy of being

191
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,960
able to practice finally i have meditation and i know meditation is a good thing

192
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,799
and and the way i was living my life didn't work or there's there's no peace or no

193
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:05,360
freedom and the preoccupations being lost in my life meditation seems to be

194
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,399
a path of of happiness of following a trail

195
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:15,679
towards something that's really good i feel so much calmer and subtle when i meditate and it affects the rest of my

196
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:21,039
life most of my day so a certain delight and happiness can arise

197
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:26,320
of knowing this possibility to practice as we really start coursing in this

198
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,760
practice more and more there's a way in which that joy that the light gets stronger and stronger

199
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,880
and and it's almost as if it's the

200
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:44,000
it becomes not just an evaluative joy like oh i'm so glad i have this practice but there's a kind of a joy that comes

201
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,240
from being absorbed in the practice just just kind of coursing

202
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,279
cruising in the practice and it's almost like uh as an analogy are

203
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:01,279
given of petting the cat as we stay with the practice day with the practice the cat within us begins to

204
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:07,919
purr that kind of wonderful delight and joy comes up and that's uh

205
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:16,079
some people then describe surprised by this strong feeling of joy that wells up as they meditate

206
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:22,000
sometimes it can be somewhat intense and some people call it rapture or something

207
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:28,240
at some point the movement of this factors of awakening is that um

208
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,599
we're following the path of tranquility and so things calm down

209
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:40,720
the whole body mind system begins to calm and so the excitement the the enthusiasm

210
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:48,480
the inspiration of joy quiets down and the joy becomes kind of a happiness

211
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,320
that's more embodied that's more like a deep contentment a

212
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,720
sense of being cozy and connected in some soft embodied way

213
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,079
and um it's uh that hap and that happiness

214
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:12,640
is then the foundation for the sixth factor of awakening which is

215
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:18,640
concentration or samadhi and and uh

216
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,880
and this is important to realize because some people think that they're going to develop samadhi concentration by huffing

217
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:32,079
and puffing by straining and trying and and uh but rather the the dharmic way of

218
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:38,960
developing concentration is to have in place the conditions that support the mind

219
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,560
wanting to get settled wanting to become unified and absorbed and focused on something

220
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:50,720
and that's a mind that is in body that's tranquil and has a certain kind of happiness in

221
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,440
it and and that happiness is the foundation for deep concentration

222
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:03,760
and so we're just happy to be here there's not a question about being present here now because it's the better

223
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,520
alternative than wandering off in thoughts and thinking about our daily concerns or the past and the

224
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:15,280
present being connected here this body this mind this heart

225
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:21,839
feels so rich so satisfying that of course we want to

226
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:27,280
settle in of course we kind of then almost natural to settle in to relax to

227
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,800
give ourselves over to this process of meditation for example

228
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:39,119
and there's that happiness that comes with this factors this path to the factors of

229
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,320
awakening then you know

230
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:51,359
unifies brings together all the fragmented parts of ourselves so that

231
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:58,640
the unfragmented way of being is samadhi

232
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,760
and because they were absorbed we're all unified connected collected

233
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:11,599
and and then we have the the samadhi factor of awakening

234
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:18,400
so what's remarkable about this we've been doing this sati patana now for i know this is like the almost a 60th

235
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:24,880
maybe 60th talk on it that are given gone through all these exercises

236
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:30,240
and um and i've said this before but it's worth saying again i believe that we're we're

237
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,240
building on the momentum of having done the practice all along even if you go back to the very

238
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:42,800
beginning of it and just do the first exercise with the breathing it's powerful thing to do and if you do

239
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,079
it consistently it just keeps showing up and taking your meditation posture and

240
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:54,400
engaging over and over again there's a natural process

241
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,520
that can begin kind of opening up and moving through you

242
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:06,640
you move through that eventually can be recognized as being the factors of awakening

243
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:11,760
when practice is really strong and for me it's been mostly been on

244
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:19,119
retreat that i feel this the meditation retreats sometimes that the the predominant

245
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:25,680
experience of the present moment by far the predominant is the seven factors of awakening

246
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:32,400
and what a cool wonderful thing to do to not be anxious about

247
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,640
what's happening tomorrow or what happened yesterday or be angry with anything it just be really

248
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,880
peaceful and settled and all your all the the focus of the mind is on this

249
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:52,079
beautiful qualities of of uh mind and body the seven factors of awakening

250
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:59,200
and so this is natural process that unfolds but it requires practice practicing well

251
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,000
sincerely practicing subtlety

252
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,680
learning how to practice mindfulness how to bring attention how to recognize what's

253
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,839
happening learning how to relax deeply how to

254
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:20,880
get concentrated to some degree learning all this all this kind of the

255
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:27,599
path the world of meditation so that more and more you can trust that

256
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:33,040
there's this natural process that's emerging this unfolding that can happen

257
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:38,640
that we allow for if we feel like we're the agent responsible for everything that happens

258
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:45,760
in meditation we're actually shortchanging the process of meditation a lot of meditation is letting go of

259
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,280
thoughts enough being subtle enough that we can trust and open up and allow for

260
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,320
something to move through us and these seven factors awakening is one

261
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:03,520
way of discussing this so i did talk about tranquility being a

262
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:09,680
bridge between joy and happiness and which it is

263
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:16,160
and then i went from tranquility to concentration factor of awakening so where is the happiness

264
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:23,920
so there are other lists that go from joy tranquility happiness concentration

265
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:30,160
the same factor of awakening leaves the happiness out not because it doesn't happen on the process but for some

266
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,839
reason it doesn't need to be there or maybe or maybe the number seven was a special number they wanted

267
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:41,760
to so that shows the most important parts but um so it goes so

268
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,119
what we've done so far there's the awareness that's often called mindfulness

269
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:53,520
the ability to differentiate between what's healthy and

270
00:40:53,520 --> 00:41:00,400
not healthy in our practice skillful and not skillful there is joy in being able to do that

271
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,800
there is no there's the energy the effort then to choose the healthy path there's a joy of

272
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:14,240
being able to do that then there's tranquility and then there's a concentration

273
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:19,839
so then tomorrow we'll do the last factor of awakening

274
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:25,920
which is equanimity and tomorrow also um

275
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,800
we'll do a quick q a question and response session after the

276
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:38,960
this youtube we'll do it on zoom and i'll post the zoom link

277
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:46,400
