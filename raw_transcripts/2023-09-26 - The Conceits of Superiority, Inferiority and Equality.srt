1
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:54,080
good evening and welcome welcome

2
00:07:54,599 --> 00:08:01,139
as you know we'll have a silent sit now so Jim will ring the bell for us in 45

3
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:07,580
minutes and then I'll give a talk we'll see you in 45 minutes

4
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:46,460
foreign and welcome welcome

5
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:53,819
maybe I'll say that you're welcome to sit wherever you would like if you feel like oh the chairs are not in the right

6
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:59,220
place some you can move chairs around or move cushions around or something like this too we never know exactly who's

7
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:04,880
going to arrive so we just chairs around so

8
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:15,020
I mean if any of you have had this I'm sorry my ears

9
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:29,220
there we go I'm wondering if any of you have had an

10
00:54:29,220 --> 00:54:36,839
experience like this that uh something to me like early in my practice coming to meditation centers or

11
00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:43,619
to Retreats when there's these long uh silent sits there would be this you know

12
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:49,800
meditating and then like wow that person in front of me is so still

13
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:54,859
I can't be that still oh this is awful I can never do this how can they do that

14
00:54:54,859 --> 00:55:00,960
they'd never move at all and then a little bit later there's

15
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:07,800
somebody who's ruffling in their purse looking for something making lots of noise and like then this thought I am

16
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:14,640
such a great meditator I never make those kinds of noises or something right how we like end up comparing ourselves

17
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:20,160
to others and sometimes we feel like oh we're just awful and then feel like we're fantastic

18
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:26,220
and going back and forth and of course it's not only in meditation right where

19
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:33,359
this happens happens every all areas of Our Lives

20
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:40,200
probably isn't an area in which there isn't a subtle way in which this is happening

21
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:46,020
or an obvious way in which this is happening because there is this um

22
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:52,619
this pattern that's really deep and really uh persistent in humans

23
00:55:52,619 --> 00:55:59,700
to compare to compare themselves to others

24
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:06,960
about anything oh that's a nice haircut maybe I should get my hair cut like that or oh those

25
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:12,960
are great socks oh my socks are better than that person's socks it's like whatever it is right we're always

26
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:20,240
finding something something to compare ourselves with

27
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:27,660
so there's this way in which sent in the Buddhist teachings we talk about this idea of self and not self or even have

28
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:33,839
this expression like selfing and we could say the experience of

29
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:39,900
selfing and measuring are synonyms and the way

30
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:45,300
that is is that if we're going to compare ourselves maybe I should say

31
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:51,900
measuring comparing selfing these are like all the same if we're going to compare ourselves to

32
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:58,859
others then we're making a very distinct I'm like this and they are like that

33
00:56:58,859 --> 00:57:05,640
and so and we might think that we're better or worse or the same but there's this really sense of a making a

34
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:11,220
distinction between me and everything else that's

35
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:18,059
not me and a part of you might be saying well of course of course we are that silly Diana why are you even mentioning

36
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:26,160
this well there's a way in which we don't need to have such always be holding

37
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:32,940
these clear distinctions there's times when it's really helpful when you go to put your shoes back on it's helpful to

38
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:39,960
recognize these are my shoes and not somebody else's shoes or when you go home get to the car whatever

39
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:47,460
it is right there's these things in which it occasion situations in which it's enormously helpful to have a very

40
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:54,300
clean clear distinction this is me and this is not me

41
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:59,420
but we don't have to do that all the time

42
00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:06,720
in fact it turns out that there's a lot of difficulties and I'll use this word suffering Duca and I'm using this word

43
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:11,819
suffering to mean a really giant range of something that's

44
00:58:11,819 --> 00:58:17,460
just yeah a little mildly troubling to some really awful

45
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:25,338
torment or suffering so I'm using this one word to represent this whole range

46
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:30,260
so there's this what

47
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:48,240
so this deeply embedded and this very tenacious

48
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:54,900
pattern of comparing ourselves to others is something that the Buddha recognized and

49
00:58:54,900 --> 00:59:01,740
that he spoke about and talked about kind of the suffering that's inherent there and I'll talk a little bit about

50
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:08,760
this but I want to also say that some of you may be familiar with this there's this

51
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:17,579
list of Fetters this word Fetters is a list of 10 that are these underlying

52
00:59:17,579 --> 00:59:22,799
tendencies that humans have and then as the progression to more and more freedom

53
00:59:22,799 --> 00:59:31,140
more and more Awakening more and more Liberation these Fetters are released abandoned and

54
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:36,180
no longer arise and they're in a particular order and

55
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:44,339
they're let go of in a particular order and the last one before you become an arhot

56
00:59:44,339 --> 00:59:50,579
a completely awakened person like a Buddha is this comparing mind that's the

57
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:58,740
very last so I just want to highlight that this is a universal thing that all humans do

58
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:03,780
but a part of the reason why I want to talk about it is because there's a way in which we can reduce some of the

59
01:00:03,780 --> 01:00:09,660
difficulties or suffering that's associated with it and there's also even a way in which we could reduce the

60
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:16,578
amount of the way that we do this and that we're comparing ourselves to others

61
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:26,220
so there's this uh idea that like maybe I'll just say this again this idea when we're measuring

62
01:00:26,220 --> 01:00:31,319
as a way and we're also kind of like me in we're making a me

63
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:37,799
so comparing is also the sense of there's a me and not me

64
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:44,579
so there might be a way in which we feel like we're smarter than others or we have more expertise than others or might

65
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:51,180
be a way in which we feel kind of clumsy or unworthy or maybe there's ways in which we feel like we're the same as

66
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:57,660
everybody else but in all three of those scenarios we're comparing ourselves to others so it doesn't matter whether you

67
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:04,920
think yourself you're better you think you're worse or you think you're the same it's the activity of comparing it's

68
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:10,380
the activity of measuring and you know what I'm wondering if we

69
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:16,920
can turn off the air conditioning here yeah I could I'm seeing everybody's body

70
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:22,799
language and everybody's like this thank you Tim

71
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:28,020
if there's a way we can turn a feed it comes from uh these uh

72
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:33,299
Vents and it's really really forcefully

73
01:01:33,299 --> 01:01:39,780
just to note there are microclimates here so if you're someone who's really sensitive to the cold you can like sit

74
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:46,079
on the stage because that's on the other side of those vents it's a little bit warmer over there just a heads up

75
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:48,920
thank you Tim

76
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:59,099
okay so I want to talk a little bit about this uh superiority comparison when you compare

77
01:01:59,099 --> 01:02:05,579
and you think I'm better somehow so and in the um Buddhist

78
01:02:05,579 --> 01:02:12,299
language this comparing this making this me and measuring they this word Mana

79
01:02:12,299 --> 01:02:17,760
gets translated as conceit it's not the best translation because in English we

80
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:23,160
think of conceit is always when you think that you're better but this is pointing to just comparing

81
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:30,240
in general whether you think you're better you think you're the worse or you think the same it's the same word is used for all three I want to talk a

82
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:35,660
little bit about these three but there so this superiority

83
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:41,400
conceit is I think most of us are familiar with what this is this idea you

84
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:49,020
think that you're better better than others or above others in some kind of way and somehow this feeling that we're

85
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:55,200
more competent or more worthy or more deserving or whatever it is we might

86
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:00,299
know people who have this we might see it in ourselves in some certain

87
01:03:00,299 --> 01:03:06,660
situations but there's a way that it also can show up in a subtle way

88
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:12,000
and this way that we have this maybe subtle belief somehow that we're special

89
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,940
or that the way that we do things or the our views our opinions are the right

90
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:24,660
ones or maybe we have this sense of kind of like being invulnerable or like I can do

91
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:31,920
this I'm going to go out and do this no harm is going to happen to me I I can handle this or there's these subtle ways

92
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:37,680
in which this superiority conceit uh shows up kind of like in our inner life

93
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:42,839
like the views that we have about ourselves and then I think all of us

94
01:03:42,839 --> 01:03:48,119
recognize this in the world we see of this people show up with arrogance or

95
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:53,160
bragging or you know proclaiming how great they are they know things and of

96
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:58,260
course we can see this in the way that they treat other people that are in the in

97
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:03,420
service the wheat stuff the Barista whomever we can see this showing upright

98
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:10,440
and how they treat them but there's also a way in which you have

99
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:17,339
the superiority conceit is that you expect others to treat you a certain way

100
01:04:17,339 --> 01:04:24,420
right that matches the view that you have of yourself and have you ever tried to change the

101
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:31,260
whole world so that they behave exactly how you think they should it doesn't work right it doesn't work

102
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:37,260
I'll talk a little bit more about that so one of the

103
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:46,319
obvious some one of the disadvantages besides irritating everybody around you of uh having this superiority conceit is

104
01:04:46,319 --> 01:04:51,960
that there's a way in which if we see somebody who's having some real difficulties

105
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:57,480
whether we know them or we don't know them whatever our relationship is with them somebody that's having some real

106
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:03,720
difficulties and a person might have some compassion for them and we wish that their

107
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:10,740
difficulties go away and wish that they could have some happiness and well-being

108
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:16,079
and so this wish is compassion it's when loving kindness meets

109
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:22,140
difficulties it turns into compassion this wish for beings to not suffer but

110
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:30,839
if you have this superiority conceit then instead of compassion it turns into pity like you have pity for other people

111
01:05:30,839 --> 01:05:36,059
and nobody likes that right nobody wants to feel like they're being pitied and

112
01:05:36,059 --> 01:05:44,640
also it's just not a pleasant experience it does it doesn't help anybody it only makes others feel

113
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:51,900
bad probably even the person who's having that experience to feel have pity for others it's supposed

114
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:59,700
to have compassion and having the superiority conceit also like it gets in the way of allowing

115
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:07,740
people to listen deeply I know some people who that they're kind

116
01:06:07,740 --> 01:06:13,680
of like often sometimes like interrupting before a person has been finished finished speaking and they'll

117
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:20,339
say yeah that's right yeah right right yeah right but even they'll say that even if the other person speaking is

118
01:06:20,339 --> 01:06:26,760
telling something about their own personal experience that the person that has the superiority can see would know

119
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:33,119
nothing about so why are they saying yeah right right yeah yeah yeah yeah kind of dismissive this way so there's

120
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:38,280
this way in which you don't really listen deeply to others

121
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:47,460
and often you aren't connecting with others in this kind of ways this superiority conceit and it also kind of

122
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:52,920
like gets in the way of being able to hear criticism in a way that allows us

123
01:06:52,920 --> 01:07:01,680
to have our best life that allows us to recognize oh I'm causing harm here or oh

124
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:08,819
I have this big blind spot whatever the harm or the blind spot might be we have the superiority conceit we don't

125
01:07:08,819 --> 01:07:15,180
get to hear that or see that okay so that's the superiority you can

126
01:07:15,180 --> 01:07:20,819
see what about this idea that inferiority can see this idea that we

127
01:07:20,819 --> 01:07:27,059
feel less than turns out not to be so uncommon in fact

128
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:33,119
I would even say it's common I would say in my role as a Dharma teacher I hear about this a lot so maybe it's just

129
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:39,078
people who come to meditation centers at meditation practice but I don't think so

130
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:45,420
so there's this way in which we feel less worthy less knowledgeable less

131
01:07:45,420 --> 01:07:51,900
attractive less valuable less anything you could whatever right it's

132
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:58,079
un that seems like the list is Limitless all these ways in which we can feel less

133
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:04,140
than in some kind of way and it's very painful I'm sure all of us have had

134
01:08:04,140 --> 01:08:10,680
this experience it's a really painful experience to be stuck in

135
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:16,440
this feeling of good enough maybe I shouldn't even be here

136
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:22,679
and I remember in my professional life back when I was in Corporate America

137
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:28,980
I um was part of this committee and I just felt like wow everybody else has so

138
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:35,100
much more experience and so much more senior than me well you know what am I doing on this committee and I just like

139
01:08:35,100 --> 01:08:40,980
when is this going to leave I just wanna I hope nobody asks me a question and I dare to speak and I couldn't wait for it

140
01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:46,380
to be over and then uh afterwards somebody who I don't really knew a

141
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:52,199
little but came up to me and said why were you frowning so much during that whole meeting

142
01:08:52,199 --> 01:08:57,238
like oh yeah if I showed up just because I was feeling like you know I didn't

143
01:08:57,239 --> 01:09:04,738
feel like I belonged on that committee or that meeting that group or something like this so it just it's such an

144
01:09:04,739 --> 01:09:10,580
awkward feeling this terrible of like yeah not enough

145
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:18,600
inadequate in some kind of way and so this shows up as this way that

146
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:23,640
can be uh maybe even a little bit subtle maybe it's obvious can also be in some

147
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:30,600
subtle ways in which that we feel like we don't really have the right to vouch

148
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:36,900
for ourselves we don't really have the right to express our views or our

149
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:43,258
opinions or share our thoughts or maybe we don't uh

150
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:49,199
feel like oh what I have to say isn't that important or it doesn't really matter

151
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:57,420
nobody else you know we'll just let everybody else speak or something like this somehow kind of like devaluing what

152
01:09:57,420 --> 01:10:03,840
we have to offer devoting maybe even our life experience our wisdom we all have

153
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:12,140
wisdom you can have not gotten to this age in your life without some wisdom right we're all adults here right

154
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:19,260
so there's a way in which we might be Adept at praising others or seeing their

155
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:25,020
strengths or seeing their accomplishments but somehow we can't

156
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:30,840
quite acknowledge in ourselves some of our own strengths our

157
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:39,540
accomplishments or some of the ways that we show up in the world that are hopeful for others

158
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:44,880
some of the way that we show up in the world that helps to

159
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:51,540
not solve problems or maybe just isn't negligent just takes care of your

160
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:58,620
responsibilities as opposed to making it that somebody else has to take care of your responsibilities and

161
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:04,080
and there's this way in which when there's this inferiority conceit it

162
01:11:04,080 --> 01:11:09,420
often comes not always but it often comes with this sense of

163
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:16,980
well this is how I truly am and this is how I'm going to be for the rest of my life you know there's this kind of sense

164
01:11:16,980 --> 01:11:22,380
of yeah I'm always going to be inadequate and I'm doing this with my body right it kind of feels like this

165
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:29,640
this burdensome like oh yeah this is how I am this way we kind of like are diminishing ourselves but not only

166
01:11:29,640 --> 01:11:35,520
diminishing ourselves we've kind of like glued onto this idea and this is the way

167
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:40,940
that it will always be or this is just this is how I truly am the real me is

168
01:11:40,940 --> 01:11:48,380
inadequate insufficient not worthy or something like this

169
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:55,800
this hurts this is an awful

170
01:11:55,800 --> 01:12:03,000
experience to have this feeling and to have these ideas

171
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:09,860
I'll talk a little bit more about that this in a moment but I also want to talk about the

172
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:17,400
equality conceit this idea of oh we think that we're the same and you might say well clearly that's

173
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:25,260
like the middle way you know I'm betting that's what the Buddhists are saying to do this uh equality conceit

174
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:33,659
but not so because it's still the problem isn't that uh how we come up

175
01:12:33,659 --> 01:12:39,780
with the comparison the issue is the fact that we're comparing it doesn't matter what the results are

176
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:45,120
it's the fact that we're comparing which is where this kind of integral

177
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:51,960
um it's this cell phone that doesn't allow for greater freedom but there's to be

178
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:57,900
sure there's uh there is suffering in whatever the outcome of the comparion is

179
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:04,800
the superiority inferiority or equality so we might say that you know equality

180
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:12,239
can see it is a great thing partly because you know democracy is based on this this idea that everybody

181
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:18,000
has an opportunity to participate that all citizens have the same rights you

182
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:23,100
know this is a integral belief for democracies across the world there's of

183
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:28,260
course there's absolutely nothing wrong with this of course not of course not right there's nothing

184
01:13:28,260 --> 01:13:36,360
wrong with that but there's this way in which sometimes we use this equality conceit as a way to

185
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:43,800
Define ourselves I'm the one that's like them

186
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:50,880
I'm the one that's part of this group not that group over there

187
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:56,000
there's this way in which there's still this strong sense of there's a self here

188
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:02,219
and it's uh even so maybe I'm the same as all of these but all of these people

189
01:14:02,219 --> 01:14:10,020
are different than those people over there and there's this way is that it can feel

190
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:15,780
like reassuring of course it does and and we do want to normalize people's

191
01:14:15,780 --> 01:14:24,300
experience and recognize the common Humanity about there's so many things that are common to The Human Experience

192
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:30,960
but there's this so it can't feel reassuring to feel like we're the same as others

193
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:36,600
but there's this way in which we're also making others different and that we're

194
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:44,760
like limiting ourselves like I'm I'm just this and I have to defend this

195
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:49,800
because there's always this well do I really belong to this group that person

196
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:55,500
didn't greet me the way that I thought that they should because I'm part of this group too but maybe not or you know

197
01:14:55,500 --> 01:15:00,600
there's this way in which to feel like we're belonging to the group requires

198
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:06,300
that other people behave in a particular way in the same way that the superiority

199
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:11,760
conceit we kind of have this expectation that people will you know treat us like

200
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:17,219
we deserve like we expect but with equality conceit we also are expecting

201
01:15:17,219 --> 01:15:22,980
other people to treat us as equals or that we belong or that we're part of

202
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:29,040
the group or something like this so there might be a way in which we have

203
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:34,739
this equality conceit that shows up and that we say okay well we're all equal in

204
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:40,199
this group so therefore no one deserves any preferential treatment

205
01:15:40,199 --> 01:15:47,059
which in theory sounds nice but in order for there to be

206
01:15:47,159 --> 01:15:53,159
um I wrote down this word here so fairness

207
01:15:53,159 --> 01:15:59,460
and maybe we'd even say like justice that we can say you know some people who

208
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:05,100
have disadvantages maybe need something that's a little bit different than what the other people who don't have some

209
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:12,480
disadvantages just so that we can maintain this equality we need to make sure that these individuals still get to

210
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:20,219
go to school and have a job or move around town or whatever it is there's just one example that we want to think

211
01:16:20,219 --> 01:16:25,980
like everybody should be treated exactly the same but you know for some people have disadvantages then they would be

212
01:16:25,980 --> 01:16:32,780
completely left behind and that's not right that's not what not what we want to do

213
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:43,320
or maybe there's another way in which this equality conceits can be problematic is if we decide oh all human

214
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:49,920
beings are selfish or you could say make up anything you

215
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:56,580
want or just you know looking out for number one or lazy or whatever it is

216
01:16:56,580 --> 01:17:02,460
there's this way in which we can use these blanket statements to say oh yeah

217
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:09,500
all human beings are the same I'm one of them and everybody else is have these uh

218
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:17,659
inherent qualities that are bad or unwanted in some kind of way

219
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:23,400
and there was this um let's see I had a note about this but

220
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:30,380
it's not here so I guess I won't say it then

221
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:37,620
so there's this so what is some of this suffering that's

222
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:42,780
associated with these conceits I've been talking about this the suffering of

223
01:17:42,780 --> 01:17:50,460
making ourselves really distinct but certainly early in my practice that just did not make any sense at all to me

224
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:57,719
and so it might be like some this is something that's maybe a little pointed to

225
01:17:57,719 --> 01:18:04,500
um with practice when we notice like for example when the we're doing something that we love one of our favorite things

226
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:10,080
a hobby there's just a sense of ease and whatever's needs to be done is

227
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:15,840
being done dancing the next move needs to be done Sports the next move needs to

228
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:21,360
be done knitting the next knitting gardening you know whatever it is

229
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:27,540
there isn't a sense of me doing there's just doing

230
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:32,640
and so that doing right there's more ease and freedom and openness and

231
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:41,580
spaciousness and just that doing is happening as opposed to I am doing that

232
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:48,239
so this is a subtle difference and so this um there's so there's

233
01:18:48,239 --> 01:18:53,940
suffering and doing this measuring this mean and comparing having this conceit

234
01:18:53,940 --> 01:19:00,780
because we're creating a self that is separate from everything else but I want to highlight some of the

235
01:19:00,780 --> 01:19:06,719
other ways and that this brings in some suffering and one is this cognitive

236
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:11,940
dissonance that arises alluded to this earlier when people aren't treating us

237
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:17,940
the way that we are viewing ourselves this is really painful

238
01:19:17,940 --> 01:19:23,520
you know to be disrespected or to be somebody to be dismissive of us

239
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:29,820
when we were thinking there's why are they treating me that way I'll like I'm

240
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:36,480
just asking for a cup you know coffee and maybe the Baristas being dismissive or actually this happened to me just

241
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:42,239
recently at the grocery store I don't know why but this one person like wouldn't even

242
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:47,340
acknowledge my existence and didn't even ask if I wanted bags or you know like

243
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:52,679
this didn't and just like beep beep beep and then just stood there and when it

244
01:19:52,679 --> 01:19:58,560
was done and I had to look and see how much it was and you know it was just kind of I felt like oh it was kind of a

245
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:06,239
weird thing I kind of expected to at least be acknowledged that I was there you know it's a little ritual that

246
01:20:06,239 --> 01:20:13,440
we do right with the grocery clerks when we're there so there can be this cognitive

247
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:18,600
dissonance and sometimes we are just dismissive of them when people don't

248
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:24,420
treat us the way that we expect or but maybe they are also seeing something

249
01:20:24,420 --> 01:20:31,080
that we don't want to see in ourselves and that of course is also really uncomfortable but

250
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:36,179
I'd like to uh here's a quote from Paul Fulton

251
01:20:36,179 --> 01:20:42,239
who's a Dharma teacher also and this is part of I would say selfing

252
01:20:42,239 --> 01:20:48,000
in general and superiority conceived in particular

253
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:55,080
Paul Fulton writes the pleasure of feeling Superior is always precarious subject to being

254
01:20:55,080 --> 01:21:01,320
erased with one untoward interaction once this comparing mind arises it

255
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:06,360
threatens to negate any nourishment we may have gained from our accomplishments

256
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:13,020
self-esteem is in constant renegotiation never a truly finished product immune

257
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:21,120
from fluctuation So This Is Us trying to make sure that we're getting training everybody to treat us in a

258
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:26,760
particular way I think that's once easy to see but this

259
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:35,640
the suffering of equality conceit is this way that it also depends on others

260
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:43,739
and there's a way in which we are if we do think that we are equal to

261
01:21:43,739 --> 01:21:49,560
others or then here's the note that I was looking for earlier there's this way that we can have this

262
01:21:49,560 --> 01:21:57,239
disillusionment with this with human potential there's a way in which we can feel like there's this mediocrity like

263
01:21:57,239 --> 01:22:04,020
well they can do it so I I probably can't either or there's a way in which

264
01:22:04,020 --> 01:22:13,260
we have this resignation or cynicism like yeah everybody is just out for themselves

265
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:20,760
and there's a way that the suffering with the inferiority you can see that one's obvious but the

266
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:26,219
superiority can see trying to always keep it up and the equality conceit the

267
01:22:26,219 --> 01:22:32,040
way that um it's there's a way in which it can have this cynicism

268
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:38,580
this these ways they undermine us they undermine our

269
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:45,480
help us like lose our ground lose our uprightness lose our alignment

270
01:22:45,480 --> 01:22:51,840
because we're trying to in some ways kind of like manipulate the

271
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:57,360
environment or manipulate our thoughts to support these conceits to either get

272
01:22:57,360 --> 01:23:04,500
away from the suffering of them or try to maybe that's it basically just trying

273
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:09,719
to get away from the suffering of them and then of course not to mention that

274
01:23:09,719 --> 01:23:15,840
life experiences can shatter these conceits these ideas that we have about

275
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:21,540
ourselves long-term relationships end and all of a

276
01:23:21,540 --> 01:23:27,659
sudden like wow are these ideas about ourselves that maybe we discover

277
01:23:27,659 --> 01:23:32,820
maybe they're not true or maybe illnesses or accidents and our

278
01:23:32,820 --> 01:23:38,699
capabilities are diminished or different and we feel like oh I always thought I

279
01:23:38,699 --> 01:23:44,280
was capable but now I'm not capable in this realm and all the difficulties

280
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:51,900
associated with that so how do we practice with this how can

281
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:59,940
we practice with this so in some way as I said you know conceit is the last Fetter to go before

282
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:07,739
complete Awakening so this is something that won't we can't expect it to go away this measuring is

283
01:24:07,739 --> 01:24:13,440
not going to completely go away until we're completely awakened but is there a way we can diminish the

284
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:21,120
suffering and this is something that yakan Nakamura she's another you can Nakamura

285
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:29,900
the third Dharma teacher she lives in Switzerland and teaches in Switzerland and in the UK and a little bit at IMs

286
01:24:30,600 --> 01:24:37,620
she had this idea that what if we notice the differences in people

287
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:42,900
it's like different flowers and I don't know why I kind of my when I

288
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:48,980
heard this I felt like that's right like it's different flowers have different

289
01:24:48,980 --> 01:24:54,719
qualities and we don't necessarily going around and you know saying this one's

290
01:24:54,719 --> 01:25:02,940
better or worse like maybe some are better for they last in the vase longer but maybe they're also these

291
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:10,380
are more beautiful or the scent is good or there's different qualities we don't just say with uh particular flowers like

292
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:15,780
oh this flowers this flower is good and we just say

293
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:21,120
different people are like different flowers because of course we are still

294
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:26,219
going to distinguish people we're gonna have discernment about people of course

295
01:25:26,219 --> 01:25:32,219
we are we're going to notice people who have skills that we don't have we're going to notice people have

296
01:25:32,219 --> 01:25:39,540
knowledge that we don't have maybe we have the knowledge and they don't have or age right people have you know age

297
01:25:39,540 --> 01:25:46,320
differences and therefore they have different life experiences so the objective here is not to like get

298
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:53,340
completely stop comparing because we need to compare it just makes sense it's how we move

299
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:58,980
through the world and it's how we can learn from others it's how we can teach others

300
01:25:58,980 --> 01:26:04,620
how we can help each other and there's this uh

301
01:26:04,620 --> 01:26:11,340
rule that the monastics have many of you know reg the um monastics in this tradition they all

302
01:26:11,340 --> 01:26:16,920
their meals with alms around so they have alms bowls so they only are allowed

303
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:24,120
to eat what gets put into their bowl every day and so one of the rules is that you

304
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:30,540
can't look in somebody else's Bowl you only look at what's in your bowl

305
01:26:30,540 --> 01:26:37,260
so we might think of that as a way of you know not being so worried about what's happening with others is there a

306
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:45,239
way that we can say that okay you know they have their own path they have their life maybe we don't even know you know

307
01:26:45,239 --> 01:26:51,900
what brought them to this moment and what are we doing with our life

308
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:57,120
our path you know what are our priorities and

309
01:26:57,120 --> 01:27:02,699
how can we have a life go the direction that we wanted to go

310
01:27:02,699 --> 01:27:08,040
so this encouragement to focus on what's relevant for us

311
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:15,239
comparing will happen but maybe there's a way that we can hold it a little bit more lightly

312
01:27:15,239 --> 01:27:21,780
this recognition this is what humans do and we don't have to say it means that

313
01:27:21,780 --> 01:27:28,320
we are like inherently inferior or inherently Superior just just okay at

314
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:35,820
this moment this person seems to have a skill set to knowledge capabilities that I don't have at this moment I have these

315
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:42,179
particular skills knowledge capabilities that somebody else doesn't have

316
01:27:42,179 --> 01:27:47,760
at this moment we're the same we're all doing whatever it is that we're doing

317
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:55,320
together so one is to notice people's different types of flowers the second is to

318
01:27:55,320 --> 01:28:01,260
there's something about the common Humanity like we all do this

319
01:28:01,260 --> 01:28:07,139
and we don't have to believe the conclusions that we come to when

320
01:28:07,139 --> 01:28:12,860
these comparisons are made maybe just like that a little um

321
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:18,960
anecdote I gave at the beginning where you think like oh my gosh I'm a terrible meditator and then just a few moments

322
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:24,840
later like Oh I'm a great meditator right it depends like who we're comparing ourselves to so we don't have

323
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:30,840
to like hold on to say this is inherent about who I am

324
01:28:30,840 --> 01:28:37,800
and then there's also a way in which we can use this conceit in a skillful way there's a way in which we can use it as

325
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:44,159
a support because it's not going to go away until we're completely awakened so there's a way we can harness this to

326
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:50,840
support us and one is to be inspired by other people

327
01:28:51,719 --> 01:29:00,239
I've told this story a number of times but it's getting back to meditating to my very first Retreat I didn't even know

328
01:29:00,239 --> 01:29:05,400
it was humanly possible to sit still like that I didn't even know like now I

329
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:12,900
can just because I've been doing it for all these years but the beginning it's like humans can do this they can sit

330
01:29:12,900 --> 01:29:18,239
without an odd in a chair you know with a back street for that long I was and I

331
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:24,120
felt first I felt really bad like oh my gosh this is a disaster I'm a disaster

332
01:29:24,120 --> 01:29:30,300
but I also felt inspired like okay this is possible people can do this

333
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:37,920
there are people who have you know been practicing for a long time and you can sense the ease and the peace the

334
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:44,159
spaciousness that they have and you can say okay this is possible

335
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:51,300
to have more and more freedom in our lives have more and more ease in our life so we can be inspired

336
01:29:51,300 --> 01:29:56,340
and we can be inspiring for others

337
01:29:56,340 --> 01:30:01,739
right there's a way in which we show or just showing up in certain ways

338
01:30:01,739 --> 01:30:06,960
we influence each other whether people are saying walking up to us and saying

339
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:13,920
you're so inspiring I can't believe that you did X Y or Z there's a way in which we can help um

340
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:20,159
like be the change we want to see in the world and show up in a way that has openness

341
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:25,860
spaciousness kindness and we can Inspire others

342
01:30:25,860 --> 01:30:31,320
and we can be inspired by others so this is a way in which conceit can be part of

343
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:37,380
our practice there's also some of you might know this

344
01:30:37,380 --> 01:30:44,159
um part of that Brahma vihar is that these are heart practices or heart qualities

345
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:49,920
or both practices and qualities and earlier I talked about compassion is

346
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:56,159
When Love or warm-heartedness and care love meets suffering it turns into

347
01:30:56,159 --> 01:31:01,739
compassion this wish for the suffering to end in the same way and the opposite happens

348
01:31:01,739 --> 01:31:06,780
when love meets somebody who's just having a fantastic time

349
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:13,320
maybe they got the job they wanted or maybe somebody in their family married somebody who is such a great partner for

350
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:19,620
them and we're really happy maybe there's um we something we've got great news

351
01:31:19,620 --> 01:31:25,620
from the doctors from the test or something like that it's like something really good has happened so when love

352
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:30,719
meets there's something really good happening in somebody else it turns into

353
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:37,739
appreciative Joy we're happy that they're happy so this way there's this conceit that oh

354
01:31:37,739 --> 01:31:45,679
they have something that maybe I don't have but I can be happy for them

355
01:31:45,719 --> 01:31:52,020
I can join in their well-wishing and wish for their happiness to continue

356
01:31:52,020 --> 01:31:59,100
because just think how the world would be if people were happy

357
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:06,360
if some of their wishes were coming true with what they really wanted just think how this world would be so of course we

358
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:12,540
want others to be happy we appreciate it when they're happy so when we see that

359
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:18,019
we can just allow ourselves to feel the happiness too

360
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:27,360
so in some ways we could say all of Buddhist practice is to help us with this conceit and then I'll just say

361
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:34,800
briefly I'll just drop in a few words practicing with impermanence noticing how things change

362
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:40,920
Everything Changes there are not exceptions Everything Changes

363
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:46,679
the only things that don't change right are ideas but actual experiences and

364
01:32:46,679 --> 01:32:53,460
objects and things those change but so the ideas

365
01:32:53,460 --> 01:32:58,860
this you know the next moment is going to be the next moment it's going to be different

366
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:05,280
and so we might feel inferior we might feel Superior we might feel equal like if we pay attention to how we compare

367
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:12,600
all throughout the day we'll just see that it's all over the place better worse the same

368
01:33:12,600 --> 01:33:19,320
and just remember this like it's it's not like uh inherent to how we are we're not one

369
01:33:19,320 --> 01:33:25,199
way or the other so just to notice how it's always changing it's always changing

370
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:31,679
and there's this recognition that when we notice it's always changing as well as recognize that this is something that

371
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:40,500
humans do we don't have to hold on to it so tightly like yeah okay right now I feel worse I feel like I can't play the

372
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:46,679
flute as well as this other person okay that's how it is this moment

373
01:33:46,679 --> 01:33:52,460
a few moments I will feel differently but that's how I feel right now

374
01:33:54,139 --> 01:34:01,620
conceit superiority conceit inferiority conceit equality conceit all three of

375
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:07,440
these have some suffering in them because we're making a self that's separate than

376
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:13,020
everything else but there's a way that we can just recognize that okay this is what humans

377
01:34:13,020 --> 01:34:19,080
do and not draw any conclusions that this means this about me

378
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:27,440
it doesn't it just means at that moment you're having that comparing the way that you're comparing

379
01:34:28,620 --> 01:34:36,600
so I'll stop there and maybe I'll open it up to see if there's some questions or comments I have a few minutes

380
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:39,199
here

381
01:34:46,440 --> 01:34:49,460
you don't have to

382
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:06,480
hi thanks for the talk um when you were talking about the author who spoke about self-esteem I

383
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:12,239
forget his name Fulton or something like that it reminds me of a talk I heard by psychologist Kristen Neff and she had

384
01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:19,040
talked about how a self-esteem is very fickle and I guess the American school system had taught self-esteem to kids

385
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:24,600
for however long and so her her sort of feel the study is a self-compassion it's

386
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:29,940
kind of the antidote because you can have a great day and then something goes wrong self-esteem goes down the drain

387
01:35:29,940 --> 01:35:36,900
but for her it was a self-compassion was kind of the new new thing and sort of antidote to that though but thanks for

388
01:35:36,900 --> 01:35:42,060
the talk thank you thank you for bringing in that idea of self-compassion and Kristen enough yeah she you know

389
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:48,260
she's a Buddhist practitioner as well as a as a psychologist yeah thank you thank you for bringing that in

390
01:35:48,260 --> 01:35:54,080
self-compassion to have compassion for ourselves we have a lot of suffering

391
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:59,179
anybody else have a comment

392
01:36:05,639 --> 01:36:11,900
okay so oh here's a comment over here your homework

393
01:36:11,900 --> 01:36:17,219
[Applause] can you use conceit in a skillful way be

394
01:36:17,219 --> 01:36:24,600
inspired by other people and can you maybe when you feel like you

395
01:36:24,600 --> 01:36:31,080
have something that uh to offer the world maybe you feel like oh I have a skill or knowledge or something that

396
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:37,320
others is there a way that you can share it but without feeling like you know you have to teach others there's a way of

397
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:43,199
sharing so maybe that's one the second is to notice how it changes notice how

398
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:51,480
this comparing changes it's all throughout the day because sometimes we might fall into a idea

399
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:57,000
about ourselves or even about ourselves in one particular regard about

400
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:02,280
meditation or knowledge or whatever it is whatever it is is is that helpful as

401
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:07,820
homework more

402
01:37:07,980 --> 01:37:15,360
you said yeah well there's so much rights that about uh how to kind of let go or soften this idea of a self that's

403
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:23,219
distinct and separate and has to be bolstered and supported and protected you know this self of ours there's we

404
01:37:23,219 --> 01:37:30,120
could say like almost all Buddhist teachings are pointing to how actually there's suffering involved with that and

405
01:37:30,120 --> 01:37:35,880
it's extra we don't need to do it so lots of Dharma talks lots of Derma

406
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:43,698
books are pointing to this okay thank you

407
01:37:44,580 --> 01:37:49,340
if you have more questions you're welcome to come up here and ask me

408
01:37:52,980 --> 01:37:59,219
this isn't working when I'm pushing oh [Laughter]

409
01:37:59,219 --> 01:38:02,719
I had a grade for stubborn
