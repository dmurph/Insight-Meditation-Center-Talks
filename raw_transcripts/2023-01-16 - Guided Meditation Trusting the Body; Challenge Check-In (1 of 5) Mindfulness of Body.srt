1
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:12,179
oh yes reminded that Martin Luther King day it's one of my favorite holidays and

2
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,699
Martin Luther King is one of my heroes and I appreciate him so much and

3
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:24,480
part of it is um all kinds of reasons too celebrate him

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,960
for myself I I I've put tremendous value in the

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,059
in the people who have advocated for non-violent

6
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:42,059
a change they're dedicated to non-violent civil disabedience and

7
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:47,640
and the courage to do that against tremendous odds and violence

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:55,038
then how what a powerful lesson it is for us that there's an alternative to violence

9
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:01,100
takes a lot of Courage and um

10
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:07,320
that I think that uh I'd rather

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:15,439
not live in a world where the first choice to settle disputes is violence

12
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,959
so

13
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:27,900
hello everyone and welcome to this Monday and it's a holiday here in the United States

14
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:34,940
celebrating Martin Luther King Jr and um

15
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,819
I think it's one of my favorite holidays for what though all the tremendous good that represents in the values that

16
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:49,760
Martin Luther King stood for and I wish we could have more celebrations of such values

17
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:56,580
so so these weeks

18
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:03,120
the focus on these 7 A.M is is how to practice with challenges

19
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,280
and we're still laying down the foundation for doing so

20
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,739
and today for the meditation I'd like to suggest that one of the very important

21
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:19,080
foundations for living with challenges dealing with challenges is our physical

22
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:26,459
body and well I shouldn't say physical body I should maybe say the body that we

23
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:32,459
experience the experience body if I say that because the way we

24
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:37,980
experience the body is a is a Cooperative Enterprise of the mind and

25
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:43,560
the body they participate in our sense or the way we experience our bodies not

26
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:50,280
separate from how the mind processes it and registers it

27
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,860
and this experienced body that we can feel and sense and know

28
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:03,959
uh is not static it's not it's a lump of Flesh it's something that's dynamic

29
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:09,000
and wise and it's not just the recipient of

30
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,879
challenges like a victim of challenges uh it's a

31
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:23,160
it's Instinct it's kind of nature is to is to respond and process and work with

32
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,440
whatever is coming and there's a tremendous uh

33
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,320
movement in this body to homeostasis to Healing to wholeness

34
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:42,360
if we allow it and so when there's challenges it's it's quite powerful to especially like in

35
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,180
meditation um to keep coming back and how is a body

36
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:55,500
experiencing this and not only experiencing it but how's the body processing it

37
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:01,020
I like the expression composting it how I feel what the chat what the

38
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:07,919
challenge feels like in the body uh but trust the body

39
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:15,360
don't uh don't um kind of just be the recipient and just

40
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:23,160
kind of the person who's the burdener burdened by whatever's happening allow the body

41
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:30,840
to trust the body trust how the body make room for the body feel it in the body

42
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:37,500
and there's a number of things that can happen one is that they can be very grounding

43
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,620
it's very easy they get ungrounded now uncentered disoriented

44
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:50,160
by being in our thoughts and stories and ideas and spinning around and being in

45
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:57,780
the body is an alternative for being repetitively glossed and caught up in the spinning mind so being in the body

46
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:04,880
is grounding being in the body gives us a more

47
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,940
sensitivity to what's really happening there if the if that sensitivity what's

48
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:20,820
happening there is too much for our degree of sensitivity then it's useful to uh move the body

49
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:28,199
let the body's movements allow things to be easier to be with and for people

50
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:34,080
doing mindfulness practice the two meditation practices that are embodied

51
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,720
embodied practices is sitting meditation we really feel it's all here but if it's

52
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,960
too much then to stand up and do a walking meditation and let the walking be the movement that holds it all

53
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,840
perhaps there's more to be said like this but this is the basic ones

54
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,860
and um but keep referring back to the body refer back to the body

55
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:04,919
Let the Body be the center and don't ignore everything else but see

56
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:10,919
if the body if you trust the body of the body can somehow make space

57
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:16,740
make room for the challenges you're feeling Within

58
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,639
so the trainings are huge training and mindfulness so training and mindfulness of the body

59
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:29,180
awareness embodied awareness so that's what we'll do today

60
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,919
so taking a meditation posture

61
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,740
and this posture we take is such an important resource support

62
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,860
for how we can be what challenges to take a posture

63
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:53,639
that expresses confidence Express is a kind of

64
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:59,220
I can do this dignity

65
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:05,840
value confidence in the posture

66
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:11,580
even if you don't feel confident it's possible to assume a confident

67
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:17,720
posture and that makes a difference

68
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,460
and then to gently close your eyes

69
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:39,240
and to begin inhabiting the body discovering the body

70
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,360
to take long slow deep breaths

71
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,360
feeling the rib cage stretch and expand as you breathe in deeply

72
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,760
maybe expanding of the belly

73
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:25,579
maybe a lifting an expansion of the back rib cage

74
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,220
and as you as you inhale all as you inhale

75
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:39,740
then as you exhale let it all relax

76
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,139
letting your breathing return to normal

77
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:14,399
and continue to relax the body and the exhale and as you relax it

78
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:23,420
let that be an occasion for sensing and feeling more fully the area that relaxes

79
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:30,019
feeling it and sensing it with a silent mind

80
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:37,279
on the exhale relaxing muscles of the face

81
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,940
relaxing the shoulders

82
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:14,000
relaxing the belly

83
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:36,680
relaxing your legs thighs calves

84
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,620
so that you're not Fighting Gravity

85
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,740
you're going along with gravity so your legs feet

86
00:11:52,740 --> 00:12:01,220
feel more grounded on the surface that supports them

87
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:27,560
and then gently become aware of the body breathing

88
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,139
imagine the sensations of breathing in the body

89
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:54,680
is the center of all things and you stay close to that Center

90
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,760
staying close to breathing

91
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:18,300
around the edges of that Center through your body

92
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:26,820
how are you feel your way into how you are right now

93
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:33,139
while being centered breathing in and breathing out

94
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:51,959
and whatever Way You Are feel it how it is

95
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:55,880
in your body to be this way

96
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:08,579
with breathing being a gentle massage or a gentle stroking

97
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:15,139
touching how you are in the body

98
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:22,519
but staying primarily with the breathing

99
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,160
so you don't get lost in concerns about how you are

100
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,320
foreign

101
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:28,339
and if anything takes you away from your breathing

102
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:39,839
that concern or preoccupation is there any correlation any way that

103
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,420
has shifted how you feel in your body

104
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:56,120
know the distracted mind physically

105
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:06,319
know your emotions as they appear physically

106
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:13,438
trust the body feel how it is in the body whatever is happening

107
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:20,120
Sound Outside what's happened in the body

108
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:31,220
feeling the body while continuing to breathe in the room

109
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,220
mindfully

110
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:05,940
trust that the most important thing now

111
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:12,500
is to experience your life as felt by your body

112
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,900
and perhaps that's a protection

113
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,140
from spinning out in thoughts

114
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:29,660
even a protection from Fear

115
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,500
becoming too strong

116
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:52,400
and if there is fear or distress in the body

117
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,539
feel it as long as it's comfortable to do so

118
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:09,960
or feel elsewhere in your body places of stability

119
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,640
spaciousness calm

120
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:21,679
that can support you with a challenge

121
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,260
okay

122
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,900
okay

123
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:44,480
imagine for the last five minutes of the meditation

124
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,900
that your body has a tremendous confidence

125
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:58,940
to be present for itself

126
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:05,120
to feel it's embodied existence

127
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,559
and all the sensations and emotions and activities

128
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:20,179
the body can sit still and quiet process it all allow it all to be

129
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:28,520
allow it all to move sit with this embodied confidence

130
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:38,480
with the mind starting to become more quiet and still

131
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,679
and as we come to the end of this meditation

132
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:56,179
to bring your attention in your body

133
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:02,960
to where there might be a tenderness or a gentleness

134
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,360
maybe where there is a love or care

135
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,600
good will

136
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:21,020
and how does that live in you how do you feel this in your body

137
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:41,779
is there some way that you can for a minute or two here make a room

138
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,020
for kindness and Good Will towards others

139
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:56,940
an embodied sense of kindness gentleness attentiveness

140
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:27,600
and to wish to well have well wishes for others

141
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:34,380
no matter who they are or where they are do we be nice if they could be safe and

142
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:40,080
happy even our enemies might be nicer to

143
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:46,700
everyone if they were safe and happy and peaceful

144
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:51,919
may we share this human life together

145
00:31:53,779 --> 00:32:00,559
offering our good will sharing it with everyone

146
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,600
perhaps we never know we might be planting seeds of Good Will and kindness

147
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,700
all over wherever we go who knows how they will sprout

148
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,658
after we're gone

149
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:25,398
may all beings be happy

150
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:30,799
may all beings be safe

151
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,779
male beings be peaceful

152
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:43,519
may all beings everywhere be free

153
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,660
[Music]

154
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:06,679
thank you

155
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:21,300
so good morning or good day and we'll continue this ongoing series

156
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:28,858
on practicing with challenges in any challenge at all from the minor

157
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:36,179
to the extreme though the extreme might need Extra Care and attentiveness and and uh

158
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:41,820
any kind of a specialty to it but maybe we'll get to that later in this ongoing

159
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:47,638
series but we're laying down the foundation now and um

160
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:55,159
the elements that are really helpful for being able to address whatever challenges we have

161
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:02,640
so today this week I want to focus on What's called the four foundations of mindfulness I think most of you know

162
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:10,740
what they are and I've taught about it here before the body feelings mind States and mental

163
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:16,380
processes and and how they can be a tremendous

164
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:22,020
support Foundation kind of a grounding for working with challenges

165
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:27,060
and to introduce this idea I want to tell you a Buddhist Fable kind of an

166
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:32,400
Tale that of it's kind of like that Chicken

167
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:37,619
Little and the sky is falling there was a rabbit in the ancient world

168
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:44,280
who would who was um sleeping taking a nap under and mango

169
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,579
tree and at some point a mango

170
00:35:49,579 --> 00:35:56,640
a big big mango from high up in the tree fell on the ground right next to the

171
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,339
head of the rabbit was sleeping and with a big bang and a shake and a

172
00:36:02,339 --> 00:36:07,800
woke the rabbit up and the rabbit immediately assumed that

173
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:14,160
the sky was falling so the rabbit jumped up and started running away yelling the sky is falling

174
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:23,520
the sky is falling came across a a school the whole herd of rabbits

175
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:30,000
and uh and when they heard that the sky is falling they started screaming and running along too a sky is falling the

176
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,119
sky is falling in they went further and they came across a us a whole bunch of

177
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:42,720
deer and the deer heard about this and they started running too the sky is falling and they went further along and

178
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,359
they saw the water buffaloes and the water buffaloes and elephants started

179
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:54,599
and the Elephant started and everybody started running all of them thinking they about to run fast because the sky

180
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:01,560
was falling and um and uh high up on the mountain on a

181
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:09,900
cliff overlooking all this that was a Lion and the lion could see that this

182
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:16,380
huge mass of animals was running right for a cliff and would kind of jumped right a fall right off if they kept

183
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:22,380
running at the speed so the lion kind of quickly got in front of them jumped in front of them and

184
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:30,540
roared and said stop and then he asked you know what you know the elephants why are you running oh

185
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:35,700
because the water buffalo said the sky is falling as this as the water buffalo

186
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:44,339
and they said oh it's because of the deer and the deer said oh it's because of the rabbits and then why did why were

187
00:37:44,339 --> 00:37:52,560
you running the line asked the rabbits and all the rabbits looked at the first rabbit and said well we heard him say

188
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:59,520
that sky is falling and um and the uh

189
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:06,599
and that so then the lion said well let's go investigate where were you sleeping

190
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:11,940
so they went to investigate went back to the tree and there right next to where

191
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:17,579
the rabbit was sleeping was the Big Mango and everyone realized that there was no

192
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:24,960
sky falling it was just a mango that had fallen so uh in this jatica tale this birth

193
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,119
story the story of course the Buddha was the lion in a previous lifetime

194
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:35,579
but the important thing was this idea of knowing to investigate

195
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:40,619
and if we if we don't have them the Mind capability to investigate what's

196
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:46,680
happening then with challenges we're kind of sometimes caught up in the swirl and the agitation of it all and the

197
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:52,260
preoccupation and and more importantly the assumptions we have around what's

198
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:57,660
happening the concepts the abstractions the future the plannings the predictions

199
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:02,820
the the kind of all kinds of fixed ideas

200
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:11,760
about who we are and what's happening to us and so the ability to stop before we go

201
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,540
over the cliff and investigate to take a good look what's Happening Here

202
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:25,260
requires knowing where to look where is the grounding where is the useful places to bring attention

203
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:31,500
and and so the Buddha offered these four areas what's called four foundations for

204
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:37,800
establishments for mindfulness and so when we're in challenges

205
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:44,760
we can check in with ourselves uh how are how are these particular

206
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:50,640
areas being experienced how is it being felt in the body

207
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:57,359
is this Pleasant or unpleasant what kind of mind state is operating when I'm caught up in this involved in

208
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:04,859
this challenge and what are the mental processes that are reacting and and and uh

209
00:40:04,859 --> 00:40:12,960
to the challenge and what are the mental states that are supportive of being with the this Challenge in a better way

210
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,720
so those four areas is an alternative to the abstractions we

211
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,760
live in the big stories and predictions and ideas that are generated by fear and

212
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:30,420
by anger and by confusion it's a particular subset of the total

213
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:36,060
whole Gestalt of it all a Gestalt which is often

214
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:43,079
infused with imagination with assumptions with

215
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:48,359
predictions with thoughts and beliefs and ideas about self

216
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:55,920
and some of the ways that we enter into challenges actually limit our ability to it wisely actually part of what makes it

217
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,980
the challenge so much more difficult is the ways in which our inner life

218
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:07,740
responds to it and lives with it and is confused by it or caught up in it and all that

219
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:14,400
and because that's so much of the challenges the challenge is not the challenge challenge out there or the

220
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:19,980
challenge but rather what we can call the challenge but rather how we are in

221
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:25,200
relationship to it it's so powerful to do the mindfulness

222
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:31,200
check-in check in with ourselves go through the checklist if you like such things

223
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:38,099
okay this is challenging now how does this how is this being felt in the body

224
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:46,099
what is activating the body where am I tense in the body where am I contracted in the body

225
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:54,500
am I even connected to my body or am I disconnected to my body with all this what's happening here with the body

226
00:41:54,660 --> 00:42:01,980
uh what's happening with the feeling tone is this really unpleasant is it really Pleasant more than a physical

227
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:08,119
experience the predominant experience is the unpleasantness of it all

228
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:15,359
what's happening with the Mind States that you know is it confined contracted

229
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:21,720
is the Mind filled with desires and greed and wanting something so desperately needing something so

230
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:28,200
desperately or is the Mind angry and blaming and upset and guilty all the

231
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:35,760
kind of kind of forms of aversion is the Mind confused perplexed lost

232
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:43,320
is the Mind narrow and tight is it expansive and open how's the Mind state

233
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:49,380
and then or then the mental processes is there are we operating with the hindrances

234
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:54,900
is there ill will is there consensual desire or covetousness is there sloth

235
00:42:54,900 --> 00:43:02,640
and torpers their agitation restlessness remorse is there doubt

236
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:09,119
it or is there calm can there be calm here is their mindfulness can there be mindfulness

237
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:15,000
here is there a curiosity and investigation

238
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,700
is there Joy is there Tranquility is there some ability to stay focused here

239
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:28,260
and centered concentrated what about equanimity so as we do this check-in

240
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:34,619
we can discover which of these predominates and sometimes what predominates or what

241
00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:39,900
or where which of these four needs the most attention we're Gathering the information together

242
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:46,920
about how we are so that we can know how wisely to respond to the situation

243
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:52,500
this presupposes we do this check-in not in the middle of a traffic accident in

244
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:58,800
the middle of having the accident when we have to take care of things but we're doing it when we can like in

245
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:05,040
meditation or when we're not right in the middle of the fire of a challenge that we have to put out the fire

246
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:12,240
other times do the mindfulness check-in and notice which of these four

247
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:18,839
predominate know how they operate then you're in a better position to

248
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:24,420
respond and know what to do after the check-in and the check-in can

249
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:32,819
go quite quickly and it might be the responses to go for a walk or call a friend or do

250
00:44:32,819 --> 00:44:39,480
something really nice or it might be to go to bed and put the sheets over your head it might be all kinds of things

251
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:45,000
that you do it might be to go meditate but you're Gathering the information to

252
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,599
see how it's happening here and you're breaking the trance of the minds kind of

253
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:58,020
overall picture and fear and concern of what it is you're beginning to break that caught upness in the assumptions

254
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:04,560
and the sky is falling kind of attitude it's very respectful to do this kind of

255
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:10,920
check-in to really get underneath the surface of the assumptions the beliefs that are operating with it all

256
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:17,040
did you find out what's Happening Here and then based on that deciding what to

257
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,680
do but if what you're doing is mindfulness like mindfulness meditation

258
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:29,099
then as we see which is most predominant or which is most in need of being really

259
00:45:29,099 --> 00:45:34,920
present for and one of the the defaults that is many

260
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:42,660
times is useful not always is to stay close to how it is in your body

261
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:47,760
feel the embodied nature of it uh what's happening in your body trust

262
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:54,300
the body don't treat the body as a static victim or res just a receiver of

263
00:45:54,300 --> 00:46:00,300
experiences it's a participant in experiences it has its own wisdom it has

264
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:07,020
its own goodness its own its own um what what it brings to the ex to

265
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:12,540
what's happening if we allow it if we make room for it if we're willing to kind of drop into the

266
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:19,200
body get centered grounded in the body and then let the body process what's

267
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:24,420
happening and some of this is because when we're challenged there's can be a lot of

268
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:30,539
reactivity a lot of tension and tightness and contraction

269
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:38,040
in the body and so by feeling the body the body wants to relax and as we allow ourselves

270
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:43,200
to feel it's kind of like we get out of the way we're not continuing to direct

271
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,839
attention from the mind to the body the mind is lighting up so the body has a

272
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:54,780
chance to relax so um

273
00:46:54,780 --> 00:47:00,540
so the mindfulness check-in it's a way of uh changing the

274
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:06,240
perspective of what's happening for us that's useful to do

275
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:12,180
at the right time as I said earlier when we're not right in the middle of having to deal with

276
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:20,760
something but you know when it we take it home with us or you know when we're more in this quiet situation

277
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:26,400
and um and maybe there's a time and place to do the mindfulness check-in the

278
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:32,040
four foundations and see what you learned from that and so for this week we'll go through

279
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:37,200
this checklist we'll go through and see how to use these four foundations

280
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,780
as a way of bringing it a useful perspective

281
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:48,359
to our lives when we're challenged um it's an alternative perspective

282
00:47:48,359 --> 00:47:54,000
then maybe the perspective that we usually bring and by doing the checklist approach this

283
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,400
other perspective it might highlight for you the perspective that you were bringing

284
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:05,040
you might you might then see it more clearly and maybe see that some of the

285
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:12,599
perspectives some of the assumptions and beliefs that go into how we respond and see a challenge maybe our

286
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:19,020
optional provisional not needed that actually interfere with their ability to

287
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:24,260
be wise and how to care and take care of challenges

288
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:30,240
so mindfulness checklist and um and uh

289
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:36,859
so for the next days we'll go through these four and emphasize its value of each one and tomorrow we'll do

290
00:48:36,859 --> 00:48:41,880
a very important topic the four challenges which has to do with

291
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:47,700
mindfulness of of the pleasant and the unpleasant

292
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:52,800
where the pleasant actually has a very important role

293
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,900
so thank you and may you

294
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:04,260
go through the checklist today periodically and see what it does for you in different circumstances

295
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,740
thank you
