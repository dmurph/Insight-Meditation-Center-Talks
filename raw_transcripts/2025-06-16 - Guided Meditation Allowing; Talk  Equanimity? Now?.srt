1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:08,600
so settling in into your body

2
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,720
just connecting with how you are in this moment

3
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,680
can there be a a sense of allowing yourself to be

4
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,480
just as you are

5
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,600
sometimes I I feel like meditation

6
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,960
and mindfulness can be like a dear friend

7
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:18,240
who comes and sits with you and is really curious open

8
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,200
wanting to be there with you and saying "How are you

9
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,439
how are you right now

10
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:39,759
and that friend not judging how you are

11
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,840
not trying to fix or change anything about you

12
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,640
just willing to be with you i'm here i'm here with you

13
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:01,078
mindfulness can be like that friend in a very deep way

14
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,399
opening to this experience

15
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,080
the body with its sensations and feelings

16
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,040
with a breath

17
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,680
and the mind receiving

18
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,120
experiencing

19
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:24,920
[Applause] How are you in this moment

20
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,319
can there be that friendliness of

21
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,200
connecting with how things already are in this moment

22
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,640
receiving whatever is simple

23
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,680
easy to connect with in this moment

24
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:02,439
for many of you that may be the breath or body sensations

25
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,840
receiving

26
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,238
what's here

27
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,840
what has come to be

28
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,199
body sensations as they have come to be

29
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,960
the breath as it has come to be

30
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,960
emotions perhaps even thoughts

31
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,080
can be recognized as they have come to be

32
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:18,320
all of our experiences arising

33
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:25,879
lawfully in dependence on conditions

34
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,000
what has come to be has come to be independence

35
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,840
on everything that's led up to this moment

36
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,600
and how we are relating to it in this moment

37
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:03,000
so receiving what's here

38
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:15,800
what's obvious easy to connect with

39
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,720
at times our mind settles and connects with an experience like the breath for a

40
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,199
period of time

41
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:02,758
and the attention is often also drawn to other experiences

42
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:15,360
we can notice that shift of attention recognize

43
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:26,120
that the attention has been drawn to some other experience and then just know that receive that

44
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,039
that's what has come to be

45
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,560
it may be something that's lasting for a short time such as a sound that comes

46
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,880
and goes

47
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:55,240
or it may linger a little bit and hold the attention for a little while

48
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,960
this friendly receiving

49
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:13,360
recognizing this is what's here this is what has come to be

50
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,680
and for many of you the attention may also gravitate back to the breath

51
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,640
and that's fine just receiving how you are

52
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,200
in this moment

53
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,000
another piece of how we are in this moment

54
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,200
is noticing recognizing what our relationship

55
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,959
is to this moment's experience

56
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:27,440
so often our habits of mind of wanting things to be a certain way of

57
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,640
wanting to hold on to things that are pleasant get rid of things that are unpleasant

58
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,880
of confusion or perhaps ideas or beliefs about what should be

59
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,200
happening

60
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,839
so often those habits of mind are so familiar that we don't recognize them i

61
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:02,519
kind of come up behind the scenes and start

62
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:13,240
evaluating and judging what's happening without our consciously recognizing it

63
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,399
and so it's useful from time to time to check in

64
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:29,880
how am I with what is happening not just what is happening but how am I

65
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:38,200
is there a wanting something to happen a wanting something to stop happening

66
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,240
a confusion an idea

67
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:55,200
or perhaps there could be a relationship

68
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:04,680
to the experience of allowing it's okay what's here

69
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:26,040
if we notice a relationship of wanting or resisting

70
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:34,720
the very noticing of that the exploration as a friend oh that's

71
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,920
what's going on for you right now that's okay

72
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:48,920
something unpleasant is happening and resistance is happening that's what's going on right now

73
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:58,160
what begins to open us to an allowing attitude

74
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:05,720
to even resistance and wanting and confusion

75
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:14,560
it can be quite interesting to see what happens when we become aware

76
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,720
of wanting or resistance or confusion and know it like that friend oh yeah

77
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,759
that's what's here i can be with you with that

78
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:37,399
there can be some spaciousness and ease that holds that experience

79
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:49,760
and we can be in a space of seeing how does that relationship then change or

80
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:56,120
transform through the simple meeting

81
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:04,079
of experience that's what's happening right now that's

82
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,199
what has come to be

83
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:29,120
and then we can touch into and recognize the experience of the allowing

84
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:36,600
this is what it feels like to not be in conflict with what is happening

85
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:45,639
our hearts understand this is a helpful direction

86
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:56,000
in that space there's learning that happens around

87
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,920
what has come to be understanding

88
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,440
that begins to arise that helps the mind to begin to

89
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,440
transform

90
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:21,000
in the space of that friendly attention

91
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,800
resistance and wanting held in that space of friendly attention

92
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:34,920
they begin to fade begin to weaken

93
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,839
get a little thinner

94
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,160
hand in that space of friendly attention

95
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,079
the qualities that come along with allowing

96
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:05,800
attention warmth friendliness wisdom patience

97
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,680
compassion they strengthen

98
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,680
And there are definitely times when something comes up so strongly

99
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,880
an aversion a resistance a fear a confusion

100
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:08,399
that it's really challenging to just simply meet it with allowing

101
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,480
it's like it overwhelms the mind

102
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,879
and when that happens

103
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,600
simply allowing is often not actually the right thing

104
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,040
because in that space we can just get pulled into the rabbit hole the

105
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:39,639
whirlpool of that reactivity and get lost

106
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,240
and so we have to know with wisdom

107
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:56,320
when we can be with something with that allowing attention and when

108
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,560
it's too strong

109
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:12,520
and when it's too strong we have some skillful means

110
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:19,038
redirecting the attention away from that difficult experience

111
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:27,079
to something that's easy to connect with easier to connect with

112
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,880
that may be the breath

113
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:44,280
it may be a more general sense of the body sitting here

114
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,320
it may be opening to the experience of hearing

115
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:00,520
something that lets you connect

116
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:11,600
and stay present not by pushing away or fighting

117
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:16,799
resisting or repressing the difficulty

118
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:26,280
it's more just of a redirect turn to another experience

119
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,400
basically our practice is really simple

120
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,480
we sit and receive

121
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,400
experience for many of you receiving the breath in

122
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,039
a simple way

123
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,519
noticing the experience

124
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:27,039
holding the possibility of a friendly allowing

125
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:33,480
perspective that meets

126
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,240
what's happening

127
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:50,759
mindfulness being like that friend i'm here

141
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:45,040
longtime SA member who um helped and was a former librarian named Mary Rodriguez

142
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:52,880
i've had a number of people ask about her recently and I just learned today that she passed on June 8th and in her

143
00:35:52,880 --> 00:36:01,800
memory I'd like to kindly remind people to return their library books thank you

144
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:08,160
thank you both of you so most of you probably know that the

145
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,200
entire center as well as our retreat center runs on donations

146
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:20,480
and all the teachings are offered freely so if you're inclined to make a donation there's a box near the front door with

147
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:27,920
the teacher's name and then another slot for operations and I believe our electronic kiosk near the library door

148
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,160
is also working and you can always donate online so our teacher this

149
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:39,920
morning is Andrea Fella she's a co-guiding teacher right here at IMC and

152
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,520
retreat practice and has done a number of long retreats both in the United

153
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,760
States and in Burma during one long practice period in Burma she ordained as

154
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:12,880
a nun with Zeda Shanaka andrea is especially drawn to the wisdom teachings

155
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:19,280

156
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:25,520
residential retreats for IMC and other retreat centers around the country good

157
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:33,079
morning Andrea thank you Martha hi everyone

158
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:42,560
so uh I'm happy to hear that the topic for the mindful parenting group is

159
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:49,599
equinimity that is also my topic completely unplanned we did not

160
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:53,240
coordinate this

161
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:01,520
yeah the uh the topic of equinimity um sometimes in

162
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:11,359
these you know conversations I'm having with people these days that there's the question how do I cultivate equinimity

163
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:18,960
with things as they are with the world as it is right now how do I cultivate that equinimity and then there also

164
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,320
might be the question do I want to cultivate equinimity

165
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,599
so I want to talk to that today talk a little about what equinimity is

166
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:38,160
what it isn't and maybe offer a slightly different perspective on equinimity

167
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:46,640
that um may shift your thinking about hopefully

168
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:53,400
maybe shift your thinking about do I want to cultivate equinimity right now

169
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,440
so the quality of equinimity one of the words the polywords oopa

170
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:08,480
often translated as equinimity there's a lot of words that we use in

171
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,760
maybe kind of synonymously with that so you know equinimity isn't a word that's

172
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:22,720
frequently used in our everyday life but words like allowing accepting

173
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,720
balance of mind non-reactivity

174
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:34,560
non-conlict those are words that can evoke some of

175
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:41,280
the quality of equinimity joseph Goldstein brings in the the

176
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,320
phrase impartiality not towards or against

177
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,320
anything

178
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:58,560
and so some of those words kind of have the sense of

179
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:05,240
like accepting allowing they have this sense of just

180
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:15,000
kind of almost the flavor of I have to be okay with things as they are

181
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,640
and I'm going to talk a little more about that in a moment but I want to also speak a little bit about what

182
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:29,280
equinimity is not so those some of those flavors like um

183
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,520
impartiality can have a little bit of the flavor of a little bit of stepped back disconnected

184
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:43,920
and that's not what equinimity is it's not stepped back it's not disconnected in fact equinimity can bring us closer

185
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:51,359
to what's actually happening it's not

186
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:58,079
indifference or apathy those we could think of those as kind of maybe the near enemy of

187
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,839
equinimity they kind of sort of have the flavor of equinimity that I'm okay with

188
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:10,160
things as they are but it's it's got a quality of being detached and not not

189
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,960
not connected fundamentally equinimity is a quality of being connected with

190
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:24,480
what's here and fully acknowledging

191
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,520
what's here is what's here and that's the piece I'd like to I'd spend a little

192
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,640
time with this because my understanding of equinimity

193
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:40,640
is that it's a a state of mind that comes from a space of very deep wisdom

194
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:46,880
that understands what has come to be

195
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:54,319
as what has come to be it's not fighting what has come to be

196
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:59,760
it's not denying what has come to be it's fully

197
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,880
recognizing what has come to be what's happening in

198
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:15,040
this mind in this body what's happening out there in the world conditions have led to that it has come to be

199
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:22,079
it has already come to be it's happening already

200
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,440
so the state of the world everything that's going on it is

201
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:35,520
happening equinimity understands that what is arising now

202
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:43,800
what is happening now has come to be in a lawful way based on conditions

203
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:50,079
we may not like what has come to be and I think too that this quality of

204
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:56,560
equinimity it's not it's not it's not about liking

205
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:05,280
or not liking what has come to be it is really about that cleareyed recognition

206
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:13,319
this is what is here this is what is happening

207
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:21,920
so it understands equinimity comes from the wisdom that understands the conditioned nature of experience

208
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,960
conditions conditions have led to this moment

209
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:40,319
some of those conditions are

210
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:45,440
related to human hearts and minds

211
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:52,160
this is the teaching on karma that um when greed aversion and delusion

212
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,520
arise in the mind it tends to put greed aversion and del create more conditions

213
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:05,359
for greed aversion delusion in this mind but it also puts greed aversion and delusion into the field

214
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:10,880
it puts anger hostility hatred into the field it puts desire wanting craving

215
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:18,560
clinging into the field there's a there's a we are not only a product of the of the craving and clinging and

216
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:24,400
aversion and greed and everything that's arising in this mind but we also receive

217
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,599
it from the world and contributed to the world when that's what's happening and

218
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:36,319
so this is a piece of the world this is a piece of what what

219
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:42,560
goes on is that there's this arising of our human conditioning and we don't just

220
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:51,480
condition ourselves we condition each other there's a back and forth kind of conditioning that goes on

221
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:00,400
there's also the conditions in what's you know in nature you know the weather

222
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:07,359
conditions of genetics conditions of the laws of physics all of that

223
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:16,240
what's happening right now is arising based on lawful conditions

224
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:23,280
and so equinimity one piece of equinimity One aspect of equinimity is understanding

225
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,720
and recognizing that what has come to be is what has come to be based on lawful

226
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,240
conditions and

227
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:43,359
resisting or fighting what has come to be kind of binds up energy

228
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:50,720
kind of creates a kind of tension in the system that um

229
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:56,800
kind of and it also resistance aversion greed to what's happening you know

230
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:04,640
creates a tension and a binding up of energy in our own hearts and minds and It also tends to put that resistance

231
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:13,599
that anger that frustration that wanting that greed that confusion out into the world

232
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:20,800
and so with the mind that understands this is what has come to be kind of like

233
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:27,599
in this moment in this moment there's no point

234
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:34,240
resisting what is already here because it's already here

235
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:42,160
and that you know if we resist it there's it resistance aversion greed they take so much energy

236
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:50,640
If we explore the possibility of understanding that not fighting what has

237
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,680
come to be again I'm talking about what has come to be to this moment

238
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:01,520
not fighting what has come to because I think when we fight what has come to be to this moment we're often like we're

239
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:10,040
fighting the past it's like we're trying to figure out how can I change the past

240
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:19,200
if we can open to the the space of okay this is what has come to be without

241
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:26,359
resistance with a cleareyed recognition yep this is what's here

242
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:33,560
that creates space for

243
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:39,200
wisdom to arise that

244
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:46,680
can step forward into the next moment with wise action

245
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:54,640
and that wise action can arise when the mind is not fighting

246
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:00,319
conflicted that wise action can arise connected

247
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:06,400
with compassion with wisdom with kindness with ethics with the

248
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,000
understanding of non-harming as a a ground

249
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,800
these qualities come quite um

250
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:27,280
let's say more not maybe not quite easily but more easily when we're not resisting what has come to be

251
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:33,440
i think sometimes we have the idea that equinimity especially with the words like allowing accepting you know we have

252
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:38,359
the idea that equinimity means non-action

253
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:46,640
but what a space of equinimity can do that really fully accepts and understands this is what has come to be

254
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:53,839
that space of wisdom then also understands that

255
00:48:53,839 --> 00:49:01,200
the conditioning going forward forward you know what what's happened to the past until now that has been lawfully

256
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:07,599
conditioned and what will move forward from this moment is also lawfully conditioned putting more greed aversion

257
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:15,040
and delusion into the world is going to create more greed aversion and delusion

258
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:22,640
in the world and so the the wisdom of equinim that

259
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:32,000
equinimity is grounded in not only understands that what has arisen to this moment is conditioned but that what

260
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,800
comes next conditions what happens

261
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:47,119
and the teachings of the Buddha point to compassion wisdom kindness

262
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:54,119
being um motivators of action

263
00:49:54,400 --> 00:50:00,280
i think we often think you know we we have this kind of sense of

264
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:07,960
action coming from Oh

265
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:15,119
so much of our action comes from habitually

266
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:20,960
spaces of greed aversion and confusion delusion

267
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:27,119
and we might have the feeling that if I didn't want something to happen why

268
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:35,480
would I do anything if I didn't want to get rid of something why would I do anything

269
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:43,440
those mind states which are so they're so human

270
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,480
we share these all of us share these motivations of greed and aversion and

271
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,599
and act on them and

272
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:59,520
when we are acting on them when when greed is acting on itself when greed is

273
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:06,720
is acting in our hearts and minds it cannot understand

274
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:13,440
the perspective of another possibility of something else that might

275
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,640
be able to act in its place

276
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:24,640
so greed and aversion when we are caught by those states of mind they cannot

277
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:30,960
fathom that there's another quality in the heart compassion

278
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:37,280
wisdom that want to act also

279
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:44,240
not out of hatred not out of confusion not out of fear not out of desire but

280
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:50,440
out of wanting to alleviate suffering

281
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:01,440
so equinimity is the mind state that's based in the wisdom understanding deeply

282
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:08,880
understanding conditioning not only the conditioning that has come to this moment but also the conditioning

283
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:15,599
going forward it also I think that wisdom also

284
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:22,400
understands you know even acting out of compassion acting out of wisdom

285
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:28,720
taking skillful action that there's so many conditions going on

286
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:34,960
in the world so many different you know the Buddha

287
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:40,240
talks about the just just in terms of the conditions around karma

288
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:47,680
the Buddha says that the web of the conditioning around karma is so vast

289
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:55,920
that if you try to contemplate it you will go mad you can't follow back and say where

290
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:03,040
did this this event come from you know like you you can follow some of it you can get some of a sense of where this

291
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:10,800
came from but it's such a vast interconnected web that it's it the

292
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,920
Buddha says it's one of the things that can't be fully contemplated

293
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:23,920
and so there's so many conditioning so much conditioning not only in karma but also in in the the laws of the world of

294
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:29,280
nature that this wisdom also understands that

295
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,599
actions that are put into the world

296
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,400
they they may or may not have the effect we want and the effect when we want them

297
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:50,720
but that doesn't stop us from continuing to be motivated to try to alleviate

298
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,839
suffering it doesn't stop wisdom and compassion from being motivated to try

299
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:02,079
to alleviate suffering to try to create conditions of well-being

300
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:06,680
internally and in the world

301
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:20,240
so I think there's some similarities in a way between what we cultivate when we cultivate equinimity in our own hearts

302
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:27,119
and minds one of the key ways to cultivate equinimity

303
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:34,960
is to notice what's getting in its way to notice the reactivity to notice

304
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,359
the tightness the constriction the confusion

305
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:48,480
and so when we when we meet that often you know when there's confusion

306
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:54,000
constriction tightness fears arising aversions arising uh unpleasant

307
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:03,720
situation unpleasant experiences arising pain is arising we often experience a resistance to that

308
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:17,920
internally what we can explore there as I I mentioned in the guided meditation you know we can explore the possibility

309
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:23,920
of first of all recognizing because habitually our minds will go to when

310
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:30,079
something's unpleasant it will go to aversion when something's pleasant it will tend to go towards

311
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:36,240
wanting leaning into and so those things come kind of quietly they they often are

312
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:44,000
kind of hidden behind the scenes in our minds and so we don't clearly consciously recognize them and so we may

313
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:51,520
begin cultivating equinimity cultivating this quality of understanding

314
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:58,000
the conditions by recognizing that there is the unpleasantness

315
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:05,359
in this example you know there's unpleasantness of pain for example and there's an aversion to it when we can

316
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:12,160
recognize by checking how am I with something how am I with this experience

317
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:18,640
in in our meditation this is in our internal experience how am I with this

318
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:25,520
experience oh there's not liking there's aversion sometimes when that aversion is clearly

319
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:32,000
seen there's the allowing of that there's a kind of the mind can be balanced with

320
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:39,920
that oh right that's what's happening there's painful s there's painful experience and there's aversion over and

321
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:47,839
over again I've seen when I've noticed that oh right aversion that's what's happening there can be a relaxation in

322
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:53,040
the heart and mind there's the there's a kind of a sense of okay yeah that's

323
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:58,880
what's going on this is this is the the quality of equinimity that allows the

324
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:06,799
mind to clearly recognize yes this is what's here there's pain and there's resistance to the Right

325
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:12,960
the seeing of it helps the mind to have some balance with it and then in that

326
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:20,640
space in our internal meditation sometimes that's all that needs to happen

327
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:29,520
we can recognize at times that just allowing the aversion to be there

328
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:35,680
creates the conditions for it to weaken for it to to to fall apart i've seen that happen over and over again it's

329
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:41,520
like when I recognize oh the aversion's there when it's clearly seen in our in

330
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:47,359
in our meditation often that aversion just you know it

331
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:53,440
doesn't have any traction anymore so it it falls away and then we get an understanding of what it means to just

332
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:59,440
be with the challenging situation with the mind that's balanced

333
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:05,280
with the aversion having fallen away so sometimes in meditation that's all

334
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,880
that's needed that quality of allowing and acceptance and just meeting this is

335
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:16,720
what's here unpleasant aversion that's what's here

336
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:24,160
oh aversion weakening aversion falling away unpleasant and okay

337
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:29,200
oh aversion coming back unpleasant aversion

338
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:34,880
allowing that that can be a process in in meditation

339
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:41,040
and there are also times when you know the aversion itself the situation the

340
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:46,079
aversion are so strong that we get pulled into the

341
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:52,079
uh the whirlpool of it into the rabbit hole of it and in those moments it's

342
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:59,119
useful to do something else to not simply I mean like the that the the

343
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:06,559
understanding the wisdom that comes with equinimity of understanding the conditions here are

344
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:13,040
overwhelming my capacity what's skillful what's a skillful action

345
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:19,920
so equinimity in that case isn't about simply what we we might think of as allowing

346
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:25,920
it's it's about skillful action the equinimity understands

347
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:33,200
this is you know this condition is pulling me pulling me out wisdom

348
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:41,078
understands that and so brings in some tools maybe redirecting the attention

349
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:47,599
there's there's there's I won't go through all of these but this one kind of popped into my mind during the during

350
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:57,200
the sitting there's five uh a teaching about five um methods for working with

351
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:03,440
things when things when thoughts and mind states get overwhelming and one of those is a skillful

352
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:11,040
redirection you know taking your attention out of that thing and putting it into something else and that's often

353
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:16,240
what I suggest in in the meditation there's several others and one of them

354
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:22,480
and these I think will be useful as we think about applying the these tools to

355
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:27,520
our relationship to the world and equinimity in relationship to the world

356
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:33,280
the the the first one is contemplating the drawbacks of the

357
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:38,960
reactivity contemplating that yeah this reactivity

358
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:44,799
puts more junk into the world puts more puts more you know reactivity into this

359
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:50,400
system so contemplating the drawbacks of of the

360
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:55,680
um the the challenging mind state and those challenging thoughts another one

361
01:00:55,680 --> 01:01:04,400
is to replace them with something skillful like meta for instance

362
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:11,599
so those are those are other possibilities those are kind of bringing in other tools in our in our practice to

363
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:16,720
allow us to navigate

364
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:23,119
when things get so strong in our hearts and minds that we

365
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:28,400
just can't settle back and know yeah this is what's here aversions arising

366
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:33,240
difficult situation and aversion is arising

367
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:44,079
we can take this kind of approach and I think that um

368
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:49,839
kind of exploration around the conditioned

369
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:55,200
nature of experience in the world

370
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:02,960
and that we condition each other to meeting

371
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:10,599
the suffering the conflict that's present in the world

372
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:17,839
cultivating the capacity to be with things as they are creates

373
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:24,559
the conditions for us to have more of a sense of balanced action in the world i'm right now going to read something i

374
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:30,160
was going to save this to the end but I'm going to read it now this is um

375
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:37,680
a reflection on he uses the word acceptance but he's really talking about equinimity this is

376
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:43,839
um a Zen teacher Daishin Morgan to accept means to receive what is

377
01:02:43,839 --> 01:02:49,839
offered circumstances of life give rise to conditions and our acceptance of these

378
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:55,359
conditions is just the acceptance of things as they are what is not meant by the idea of

379
01:02:55,359 --> 01:03:02,400
acceptance is any agreement or disagreement with the way things are acceptance is about basing ourselves in

380
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:09,599
reality not about making judgments of liking and disliking or of agreeing and disagreeing to accept the situation is

381
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:16,880
to be grounded in the actual state of things without getting lost in ideals or fantasies of how we would like it to be

382
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:24,960
we then have a good basis from which to see what action may be called for acceptance does not imply inertia on the

383
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:30,799
contrary to be grounded in reality gives rise to a true response

384
01:03:30,799 --> 01:03:36,240
and so this is what we can explore in our relationship to what is happening in

385
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:42,960
the world first I think it's crucial to meet what

386
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:48,359
is happening with a clear mind

387
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:56,000
to cultivate that capacity and understand too I think that conflict

388
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:04,240
conflict is a form of suffering there's a a teaching um in the

389
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:12,038
in the text that's um called the exposition of non-conlict

390
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:18,480
and in that in that uh teaching that's in the majica

391
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:23,520
it says that we need to understand the state with conflict and the state

392
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:31,720
without conflict so what do we think of as conflict we think of conflict as

393
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:38,880
resistance of fighting of disagreement

394
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,680
of wars

395
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:51,200
different perspectives different understandings that can't be resolved and we feel like

396
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:58,720
it either has to be my way or their you know it's like each each side seems to feel like it's it's their their side is

397
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:07,440
right and there's not a a kind of can we meet in the middle somewhere there's there's a kind of a a a

398
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:11,880
pulling to the the opposition

399
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:21,119
this teaching says the state of conflict is a state beset by suffering vexation despair and fever

400
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:29,680
and it is the wrong way and the wrong way here means the wrong way in terms of finding peace ease and

401
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:36,240
happiness so it's it's um again the Buddha all of

402
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:43,559
the Buddhist teachings are pointing towards non-suffering nonharming non-suffering

403
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:49,200
one of the interesting things I think about that um

404
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:55,920
that sentence is conflict is a state

405
01:05:55,920 --> 01:06:01,680
beset by suffering vexation despair and fever so it's a state

406
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:08,720
It's a condition that has come to be

407
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:13,839
it's a state and so this is something that can be

408
01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:19,200
explored we can explore conflict internally we can explore conflict

409
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:25,200
externally we can you know kind of look at what is going on here get to know the

410
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:31,119
conditions of it see how it has come to be so we explore it the same way we

411
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:38,680
might explore something happening internally a state of conflict happening internally

412
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:51,039
and so this space of exploring conflict in this way can help us to have

413
01:06:51,039 --> 01:07:00,000
a little bit more balance equinimity around what has come to be

414
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:08,280
and to look at from a place of

415
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:15,920
compassion nonharming what actions

416
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:21,520
are skillful to take in this moment remembering some of those other

417
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:28,079
teachings like pointing out the drawbacks of what's going on

418
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:36,559
that's probably a useful thing to do cultivating the wholesome qualities

419
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:42,000
and cultivating that perspective of wisdom of understanding the conditioned

420
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,920
nature of what's happening

421
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:54,160
i do believe that the world needs more of this

422
01:07:54,160 --> 01:08:00,240
approach of understanding

423
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:07,200
and action from compassion and care without deliluding ourselves

424
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:12,599
and also I I recognize that

425
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:20,960
we're going to need to act when we're not aquatamus so what do we do there you know what's

426
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:26,120
what's what's maybe skillful to do

427
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:33,520
internally in our meditation when we're not aquatamus we

428
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:38,960
we bring in some skillful means you know when it's too much when there's

429
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:44,080
too much um uh reactivity

430
01:08:44,080 --> 01:08:51,600
we bring in some skillful means about how can I balance the mind here how can

431
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:58,480
I balance the mind aware aware of our reactivity

432
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:06,719
can we ground in the intention of wisdom so aware in with reactivity that we tend

433
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:12,719
to act out of reactivity when reactivity gets strong and now speaking about

434
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:19,278
thinking about the world and acting in the world when reactivity gets strong

435
01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:28,000
we tend to act out of it it tends to be guiding our actions

436
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:33,920
there can at times be that recognition yes reactivity is here i'm I'm not going

437
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:41,040
to be able to you know um get past this reactivity right now but

438
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:46,798
it may be possible in this moment to ground myself in the intentions of

439
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:53,359
nonharming of wisdom of compassion

440
01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:02,880
and and committing to acting skillfully even even not not trying to

441
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:08,159
con convince our minds that we feel something that we don't but committing

442
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:14,600
to those basic ethical

443
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:20,560
conducts refraining from killing refraining from

444
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:26,080
creating harm out of speech refraining from harming through our

445
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:33,199
sexuality refraining from taking what's not given

446
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:41,360
those basic ethical ethical conduct can be our

447
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:49,840
our guide when we're experiencing reactivity so to to to try to act with the

448
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:58,320
intention of nonharming even if we feel reactive it is possible

449
01:10:58,320 --> 01:11:05,840
i've watched this in my own mind in small ways you know to see how it's

450
01:11:05,840 --> 01:11:11,679
possible to change it's kind of like I I I I pick up the intention of what the

451
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:18,400
opposite of what's going on in my in my experience is and I try to let not let

452
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:23,600
that reactivity leak out into my behavior into my action so I let my

453
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:30,840
actions be guided by the intention

454
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:37,840
while still fully recognizing yeah the heart the heart is not

455
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:43,360
balanced here the heart and this is this is

456
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:49,440
this is wisdom this is a this is the cultivation of

457
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:57,600
equinimity we understand that we we have the this happening in

458
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:03,760
our mind this is what is arising yes if I had the choice I would turn off the

459
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:10,880
hatred i'm not able to do that right now and can I act

460
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:15,158
from a different lens

461
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:26,920
so using ethics as a a kind of a guide

462
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:34,800
and then there's this cultivation of equinimity related to actions of others

463
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:41,520
that are causing harm how do we how do we deal with that how do we relate to that

464
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:49,280
i think a lot of the a lot of the understanding around this you know the compassion around this can arise when we

465
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:56,159
recognize that everyone is acting out of their own

466
01:12:56,159 --> 01:13:02,000
conditioning we see our own conditioning you know

467
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:08,239
that we we as meditators get to see how much

468
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:14,880
stuff is going on in our own hearts and minds we get to see the the aversion the

469
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:20,080
anger the hatred the confusion i remember at one time so clearly seeing I

470
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:25,679
was so angry at somebody and then in the the observing of it I couldn't turn the

471
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:32,239
anger off but I could I was watching it and in that watching that anger I saw

472
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:38,320
that there was a part of the mind that so wanted the other person to suffer

473
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:44,560
that like startled me it's like wow

474
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:50,960
that that was like it was it was a little bit of a moment of waking up and seeing the

475
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:56,000
seeds of war are right here

476
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:04,239
that wish for somebody else to suffer that's the seed of war

477
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:10,000
and seeing that was so humbling and it made me in that moment was like

478
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:18,159
"Oh my gosh no wonder the world is such a mess." Multiply that by 8 billion

479
01:14:18,159 --> 01:14:24,400
interacting with each other no wonder no wonder

480
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:30,719
that that moment gave me both the understanding and the appreciation for

481
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:38,400
my own conditioning but also of seeing this is not about just me this is and

482
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:46,239
this is what's going on in the world this going on multiplied by 8 billion

483
01:14:46,239 --> 01:14:51,440
so recognizing the conditionality

484
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:57,679
of what's going on in that conflict

485
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:03,280
the other side of the conflict that's been conditioned also our side's been

486
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:08,560
what what we're experiencing has been conditioning that their experience has been conditioned

487
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:14,320
and so that that for me creates some conditions of compassion and humility

488
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:20,159
if I had lived their life what might I be doing right now i don't

489
01:15:20,159 --> 01:15:26,239
know so that's a piece again that's that

490
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:33,760
that's the reflection on equinimity the the reflection on the conditioned nature of experience one of the main conditions

491
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:40,239
that leads to equinimity and just as we need to hold ourselves

492
01:15:40,239 --> 01:15:46,400
accountable for ethical action and I think this is an important piece in our

493
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:54,400
own hearts and minds we need to notice you know it's like yes it's conditioned and

494
01:15:54,400 --> 01:16:01,120
there's some capacity that this being has to recognize what is being what is being

495
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:09,360
put out from this being is affecting others and so holding ourselves accountable for

496
01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:14,640
what we what we how we are in the world and this practice this meditation

497
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:20,640
practice gives us some tools to kind of have a little bit of a gap before we

498
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:28,199
react to respond rather than reacting

499
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:37,640
so we need to hold ourselves accountable and we need to hold others accountable

500
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:48,000
accountable to behave in ways that are ethical

501
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,400
that are kind that are compassionate

502
01:16:54,320 --> 01:17:00,400
and that's a challenge right now i don't have the answers

503
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:06,800
but I do deeply believe and feel that the

504
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:13,440
the direction of greed aversion and delusion

505
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:19,679
is not the way and that the direction of wisdom

506
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:27,800
compassion kindness is the Okay

507
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:48,640
i'll just read a little bit of this paragraph again to end

508
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:54,400
to accept the situation is to be grounded in the actual state of things

509
01:17:54,400 --> 01:18:01,440
without getting lost in ideals or fantasies of how we would like it to be we then have a good basis from which to

510
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:07,440
see what action may be called for acceptance does not imply inertia on the

511
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:14,159
contrary to be grounded in reality gives rise to a true response

512
01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:21,760
may it be so thank you for your attention

513
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:27,760
and um I'm happy to hang out and talk with anybody who wants to afterwards for

514
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:35,960
a little while so but it's time to end so thank you all
