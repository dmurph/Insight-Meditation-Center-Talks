for practicing this week and uh we'll continue

12
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:32,560
today and um I feel like I've said a lot so maybe

13
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,920
we'll just dive in and I'll go through the arriving

14
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,799
sequence again and kind of uh sprinkle in the practice of a

15
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:52,439
pausing and uh incorporating a little more that I was hoping to incorporate

16
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:57,479
today so with the sound of a

17
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,640
bell let's

18
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,000
begin as the sound of the Bell Fades

19
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:28,480
away pausing pausing to

20
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,680
arrive arrive here and

21
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,480
now maybe a few long deep

22
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,239
breaths can support the

23
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,760
arriving

24
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,879
let the weight of the body settle towards the round

25
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,720
earth arriving arriving at the Temple of this

26
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,280
body mind and

27
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
heart

28
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:53,079
pausing so mindfulness sa can begin to

29
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:56,480
surface to the

30
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
foreground

31
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,040
maybe you feel some kind of a

32
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,519
presence there some kind of a presence that's felt in the

33
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,919
body may be felt in the heart

34
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
space

35
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,319
Mindful and

36
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,800
heartful there may be a felt sense of a slowing down or quieting

37
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:28,479
down maybe the energetic field feels

38
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
settling

39
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,240
maybe a myriad's kind of

40
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,560
experience without

41
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,120
demanding was that without setting

42
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:20,400
agenda simply steady study with a felt

43
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
sense

44
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:46,680
the felt sense of the posture may become more

45
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:53,999
clear as we stay with the [Music]

46
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:07,360
Sati this is how it feels like to be sitting in this

47
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:15,840
posture or lying down or standing or whatever

48
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,160
posture you're taking right

49
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:36,879
now the moments become available to

50
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,039
us are you available to the

51
00:07:54,759 --> 00:08:01,319
moments are you available to the movements of the breath

52
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:11,560
breath are you available to the fleeting

53
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:23,879
thoughts a sound is available to

54
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,560
you are you available to the

55
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:47,040
sound silence is available to

56
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,399
you are you available to the

57
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
silence

58
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:24,959
gently becoming available to the lift

59
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:31,120
experience Here and Now

60
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:58,120
feeling and [Music] sensing what it feels like to be

61
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
available

62
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:17,959
maybe certain kind of a holding or tightening can release in the

63
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,079
body maybe certain

64
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:39,360
tension around the [Music] head

65
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:44,320
face eyes can

66
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:05,360
soften and maybe the nerve systems around the

67
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:16,399
limbs the edges of the body can ease

68
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
up

69
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:44,560
being available feels like

70
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:54,720
this doesn't have to match with any of the words I

71
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:03,680
say trusting your own inner

72
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,560
experience being available may feel

73
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,879
tender and at times vulnerable

74
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,720
and so we deliberately choose to

75
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:51,800
align aligning aligning with our heart's

76
00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:02,720
aspirations aligning with our deepest

77
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,320
intentions aligning is not a goal

78
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:35,760
setting the L is a here and now kind of a

79
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,600
practice there is the there is a felt

80
00:13:52,759 --> 00:14:00,759
sense when we're aligning with our aspirations

81
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,440
in a directional

82
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:20,040
sense we feel the uplift in the heart in the

83
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:30,680
body they have a sense of rootedness in the body

84
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:45,759
there's a wholesome feeling when we're

85
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:06,839
aligned aligning with the Buddha Dharma and

86
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,560
Sanaa aligning with a

87
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
kindness

88
00:15:53,279 --> 00:16:00,600
we being available and aligned

89
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:08,720
our heart knows this is a protected

90
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:13,240
field from which we

91
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
practice

92
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:03,799
right here aligned in the B available our heart and

93
00:17:03,799 --> 00:17:11,839
mind can settle become

94
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,199
collected

95
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:30,400
composed and this is enough

96
00:18:50,320 --> 00:19:00,320
sometimes the felt sense of the body emerge so naturally in this field

97
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:18,320
feel the weight of the body settling

98
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:34,960
down there may be a firm

99
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:42,440
contact of the body with the Earth

100
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:48,279
floor or the whatever that supports the

101
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
body

102
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:18,240
if you choose you can turn and arrest your

103
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:27,159
attention and the contact of the body with whatever that supports

104
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:35,440
you this is a wholesome ground to

105
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:51,000
resting this is a good

106
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
enough

107
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:17,559
it's also natural the felt sense of the

108
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:24,320
movements of the body to become

109
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,880
visible felt

110
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:38,210
movements of the breath the [Music]

111
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:45,240
flow the dancing

112
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,840
Sensations pulsation

113
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
tingling

114
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:18,480
thring or just simply a sense of Al

115
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
liess

116
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:44,880
wavy emotions another form of

117
00:22:51,159 --> 00:23:00,720
aless thought bubbles yet another form of

118
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
aliveness

119
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:47,279
a poem by David White

120
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:56,120
enough enough this few words are

121
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:03,799
enough if if not this words this

122
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:12,520
breath if not this breath this sitting

123
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:19,200
here this opening to life we have

124
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:26,799
refused again and again until

125
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,799
now until

126
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
now

127
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
for

128
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,690
[Music]

129
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,679
so so this week I felt like I've said a lot in terms

130
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:38,200
of how to practice and my

131
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,440
invitation is um for you to stay in your

132
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,120
meditative bubble if you choose to do

133
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,320
that and maybe the words can flow in or flow

134
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:59,370
out whatever whatever may feel feel appropriate for

135
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:07,480
[Music] you I won't rain Bell to

136
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:17,440
transition and I have only a little bit on that what I want to share

137
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:28,279
today um when that's evoked um by the AOA

138
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:34,120
that I read on towards the end of a

139
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:39,519
meditation and that is wherever you are

140
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,840
however you are is

141
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:55,399
enough and remember that we're always practicing as best as we are

142
00:33:55,399 --> 00:34:02,679
able this is another another phrase that I received from a Philip

143
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:08,359
mothod practicing as best as we are

144
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:16,440
able just let that phrase drop in and feel and

145
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:23,800
sense what's happening as that phrase settle in your

146
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:28,878
system

147
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:37,358
practicing as best as we are

148
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:51,440
able when I first heard this phrase and my system kind of relaxed

149
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:58,480
from inside out maybe a little bit it or something

150
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:05,960
kind of got released maybe I wasn't quite conscious

151
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:11,000
that I was just striving for something to happen or I was trying to get

152
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:17,520
somewhere else and there's a kind of

153
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:25,800
undercurrent that got released Al there's a sense

154
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:33,520
of this whatever is here is

155
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,640
enough and maybe more than

156
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:46,760
enough it doesn't mean that unpleasant went away or the

157
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:53,480
pleasant continued or the hindred hindrances are

158
00:35:53,480 --> 00:36:01,280
gone but my relationship with what's here

159
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:09,240
shifted there is a sense of a more at ease with what is

160
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:16,280
happening Can You Feel The humility in

161
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:25,119
this you feel the humility in practicing as best as I'm

162
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,720
able we're not pushing around by our expectations

163
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:39,319
goals results or desires they're not

164
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:49,240
reality and goals and results uh tend to get us uh trapped um between the

165
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:57,920
failures and successes and and sometimes when we try hard

166
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:05,960
we get so exhausted when we practice as best as we

167
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:11,240
are able much less

168
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:18,800
pressure so much more space so much more

169
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,400
ease and the Heart can feel

170
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,920
unburdened and as we practice in this way as best

171
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:40,440
as we are able it doesn't mean that uh we're simply lazy or

172
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:47,160
unengaged but instead and the heart and mind are not in a big hurry to get

173
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,720
somewhere else we're more grounded in the reality

174
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,800
of our experience I remember one day I was

175
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:03,880
sitting in a guided meditation that the teacher spent a long

176
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:11,680
time simply to prepare our mind before the meditation went

177
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:20,280
on at some point it just dawned on me wow this teacher wasn't going to go

178
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:28,520
anywhere else and he was so sincere

179
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:36,720
and there was no some other states to get to or some other territory to get to

180
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,920
he was just practicing wholeheartedly

181
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:49,040
sincerely with whatever was up showing up for him right

182
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,880
there there's no need for shortcut um bouncing

183
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,680
around as I was so moved by

184
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:10,720
this practicing as best as we are able allow us to stay honest and true to

185
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:18,359
ourselves to how we are and we all know that the Habit mind

186
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:26,920
tends to want to skip over um things that it doesn't want or um Rush um

187
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:34,280
towards something that it wants to happen but when we stay true to our

188
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:40,760
experience we're practicing according to the Dharma that's the practice in

189
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:46,359
accordance with the Dharma there is kind of a through line

190
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:53,280
alignment with our heart's wish our heart's

191
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:02,359
