2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,639
zoom this morning but uh here I am nice to see you all if somebody could

3

thank you Jamie give me the heads up that you can hear me

7
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,920
yeah Zoom decided it needed absolutely had to be updated and I tried to

8
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:09,200
circumvented and just made it take longer but I'm here now I'm happy to be

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,880
here oh a slight Echo yeah I'm afraid that that I'm not sure what I can do

10
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,040
about that I think that's probably just the space where I am

11
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,840
sorry

12
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:40,680
I'll wait another minute or so just because logging on a little bit late

13
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,759
allow everybody to get on board and to say good morning or say hello right that's part of the best thing about the

14
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,439
7 AM is checking in in the

15
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,840
morning

18
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,680
way welcome welcome it's a pleasure to be here with you all on these 7 a.s though I have to

19
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:21,440
say right you know the pressure is high there's such beautiful wonderful teachers who do this 7 am teaching so

20
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:28,000
uh I'm just happy to be part of the team here supporting

21
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,439
everybody and today or this week um I thought I might title

22
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:42,040
the week like five fun faculties for fearlessness forever five fun friendly faculties for

23
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:49,840
friendless for for fearlessness forever you know just go a little crazy with the alliteration but um I'll just limit

24
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:57,680
myself to faculties for fearlessness and I want to talk about something that

25
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,400
we're all familiar with the five faculty but I want to look at them in a different way through a different lens

26
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,840
emphasizing different aspects that perhaps we haven't considered so instead

27
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:17,120
of introducing something new I'm sure many of you are familiar with the five faculties I want to introduce them in a

28
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,720
way that uh perhaps you hadn't considered that you already know and

29
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,720
that they can be a support for working with fear so that is a short introduction

30
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:36,080
let's do a guided meditation

31
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,638
so taking alert

32
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,720
posture settling

33
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:59,120
in once you've settled in is there a way that you could be just a tiny bit more

34
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:06,639
comfortable able bring a little bit

35
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,639
more Ease Into The Experience we're still maintaining the

36
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,080
meditative posture but there's no reason why it can't

37
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,800
have ease as well as

38
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,880
alertness and to begin we open your senses even though your

39
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,199
eyes are closed to open the

40
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,759
senses maybe there's Shadows or

41
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:50,199
shapes with the eyes even though the eyes are

42
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,319
closed feeling the sensation of touch or pressure

43
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,319
as the body rests on the surface that supports

44
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:16,520
it maybe that touch of air on your skin feeling of clothing blankets

45
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,120
against the

46
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:32,120
skin maybe there's just a general sense of heaviness or light in the

47
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:45,240
body opening the ears so to speak the sound of my

48
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:51,440
voice other sounds in the room or in the

49
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:00,919
environment allowing the sounds to just be received

50
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:06,479
not having to go out and get them but receiving

51
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:21,440
them is there a sense of smell or

52
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:31,319
taste toothpaste perhaps

53
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,800
having some ease with the senses open

54
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,360
relaxed and checking to see if there's a quality of

55
00:07:52,360 --> 00:08:00,120
wellbeing that you can tune into this moment might not be that dominant

56
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,800
experience might just be a sliver of your experience but can you tune into

57
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,720
any sense of

58
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:31,639
wellbeing that sense of well-being to get as big as it would like the key word

59
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:35,969
here is [Music]

60
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,760
allowing there isn't a sense of well-being can you bring to

61
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:02,959
mind a memory of a an occasion a

62
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:10,680
locasion perhaps in nature petting a cat or a

63
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:19,600
dog being with a loved one can you bring that experience to

64
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,880
mind and how does that

65
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
feel

66
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,720
opening to this experience of well-being

67
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,440
is maybe there's a feeling of

68
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,839
spaciousness in the

69
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,480
body maybe there's a sense of

70
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,640
softening relaxing

71
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
opening

72
00:10:55,519 --> 00:11:01,040
just know that you can always come back to this experience

73
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:10,160
tune in to this type of an experience during this guided

74
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,480
meditation maybe sometime during your

75
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
day

76
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,639
and we'll do a slight body

77
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:51,279
scan as I name a body part you can simply notice what you

78
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:57,519
feel that body part no judgment no need for it to be a certain

79
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:04,720
way just welcoming whatever experience there

80
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,040
is the

81
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,240
jaw the area around the

82
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,440
eyes these are Cal many areas we hold

83
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:41,120
tension maybe there can be some more ease maybe not

84
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,680
too

85
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
shoulders

86
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,600
noticing the experience of the

87
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,800
shoulders let them be away from the

88
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:26,000
ears the

89
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
chest

90
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,279
the

91
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,480
belly maybe you don't feel anything in particular or just

92
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,440
numbness that's okay maybe you feel a sense of

93
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,160
softening relaxing that's

94
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,240
okay maybe you feel a sense of aliveness

95
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:14,759
buzzing tingling energetic feeling that's

96
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,839
okay the

97
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
back

98
00:14:54,199 --> 00:15:01,440
pressure of the contact whatever the body body is contacting against the

99
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:08,800
body the Bic might be the back

100
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
legs

101
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,560
our feet Le with they are touching

102
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,519
contacting as well as the experience of having

103
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
feet

104
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,800
the

105
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
arms

106
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
hands

107
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,438
and then resting our attention on the sensations of

108
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:25,240
breathing feeling the movement of the body as it

109
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
breathes

110
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:03,200
breath doesn't have to be any particular particular way we're just

111
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,039
noticing the movement maybe in the chest or in the

112
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:17,519
belly for some of you might be feeling the air going in and out of the

113
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
nose

114
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:14,280
and if the mind wanders that's okay that's what happens

115
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:22,759
when we meditate and just very simply gently Begin

116
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
Again

117
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:44,360
it doesn't matter how many times we begin

118
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,919
again it's just the activity of coming

119
00:19:52,080 --> 00:20:00,240
back giving oursel over to the sensations of breathing

120
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
e

121
00:31:15,710 --> 00:31:19,710
[Music]

122
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:28,520
[Music]

123
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:38,820
[Music]

124
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:56,159
[Music]

125
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,159
is

126
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:14,240
welcome welcome this um first day it's a Monday

127
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:22,399
on a 7 a.m. here what a pleasure it is to be here to join you all it's funny

128
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:29,840
that we just call these the 7 a I don't know internally at IMC we call them the 7 A.M but for many of you it's not 7:00

129
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:35,200
a.m. but nevertheless so this week I wanted to

130
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,600
explore working with fear and specifically to use tools and

131
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:47,960
I'm going to use this word tools that we're already familiar with but maybe emphasize different aspects of these

132
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,760
tools or different uh views or perspectives on these views tools and

133
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,159
maybe combine them in a way that's maybe not novel or new way or a different way

134
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:07,440
and when I was thinking about this this week I was thinking like oh it's not very exciting or interesting but I hope

135
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,320
it's practical because sometimes what we need are just things to help us with some of

136
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:20,080
these rough spots or some of the difficulties right our lives have difficulties so the tools I want to

137
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:26,039
introduce are the five faculties I'm not going to go through the list of them right now because I'll introduce them

138
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:32,000
each day I will say that they are conventionally they're taught in a particular order but

139
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,600
I'm going to teach them in a different order and maybe talk about them in a

140
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:43,600
different way so that it supports specifically about working with

141
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,799
fear this recognition that when we have fear that we don't really have access to

142
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:56,080
our practice or our wisdom it doesn't matter how many teachings we've had sometimes we just don't have access to

143
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:03,240
them so my aim is to simplify or to bring things in in a

144
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:10,158
way that become really practical and as I said at the beginning of the before I started the guided meditation I did play

145
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:17,599
around with uh just maybe being silly and playful of ways to think about this and so many different alliterations I

146
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,560
came up with and now uh while I was meditating just kind of bubbled up now I forget the exact words but it was

147
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:30,040
something like you know five fun fabulous faculty for fearlessness for freedom

148
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:35,320
forever okay so in all seriousness and to say a little bit

149
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,800
about fear we all know what fear is but we may not really recognize what a large

150
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:48,960
role it has in our life this fear of not being understood or fear of being embarrassed or fear of failing you know

151
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,118
I I certainly have these fears and it's uh striking to to think about like what

152
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:01,760
a impact it's had on my life maybe things that I you know haven't done or tried because of these

153
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,760
fears and then say also maybe technically there's a difference between fear and

154
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:14,359
anxiety but for the purposes of here I'm going to kind of lump them together we could say that fear is a response to a

155
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:19,760
very specific imminent threat danger whereas anxiety may be a little

156
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,359
bit more unfocused and may not be a specific danger or threat that's

157
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:30,440
clear it's more like just going to the dentist and having some little bit of

158
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:36,599
anxiety before having to go to the dentist or but I'm going to treat these the same

159
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:42,440
essentially so the first faculty I'd like to introduce is

160
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:50,000
Sati conventionally or commonly translated as mindfulness and I want to introduce this

161
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:57,280
first because whatever we are experiencing it's even if it's mightily

162
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:03,119
uncomfortable and exactly what we don't want to be experiencing or maybe we're not even sure it turns out it's always

163
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:09,760
better to be present for our experience no matter what that experience is and no matter how

164
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:17,680
uncomfortable it is and even if it's the last thing we want to do and somehow to trust that to be aware

165
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:23,440
of what's happening is always helpful even if we can't really be

166
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,839
present for the experience itself maybe we can be present in a different way and

167
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:38,880
I like to talk about that a little bit here but first before I do that I'd like to just offer some questions to

168
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:46,160
consider what would happen if you got curious about your fear and worked with

169
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:52,880
it would it be uncomfortable would it build your self-confidence or what parts of your

170
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,319
life would it impact if you got curious about your fear and worked with it and

171
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:03,920
how might that set you free how might that bring more freedom

172
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:11,119
to your life so this mindfulness one thing I want to start

173
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,359
with it's maybe like the most course or the most obvious recognize what's

174
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:21,680
available in the present moment environment so that is like very

175
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,000
specifically right now I have this desk in front of me see a computer computer

176
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,640
monitor I have a light there's some books I have this dongle on my computer

177
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:39,240
very mundane things and this might feel like di this

178
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:45,359
is not very spiritual to notice this but it turns out it's incredibly helpful to

179
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:51,079
just be aware of our environment and if we're for particularly if we're feeling

180
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:59,440
particularly anxious it can be really helpful to notice particularly mundane things specifically

181
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:07,079
Corners where the ceiling meets the wall the corner of the doorway in the

182
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:13,160
lower left the corner of where the flooring meets the wall the corner of

183
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:20,800
the baseboard the corner of the desk here the corner of this dongle

184
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:27,040
thing so there's a way in which bringing our attention just to the

185
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,560
environment can really bring some grounding and some resources to our

186
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:38,040
experience and sometimes that's all we have access to when there's some fear or

187
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:44,400
anxiety maybe we don't have access to all these teachings and wisdoms that we've heard so the first is maybe to

188
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:52,520
bring to our attention to the environment and then to the bodily

189
00:38:52,520 --> 00:39:00,319
experience turns out as humans and contemporary humans we we've developed this incredible capacity to be

190
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:06,359
disembodied and what happens is the mind right is going um its own way with

191
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:12,480
thoughts and there's this fear and fear and anxiety which can build on itself and there can be this tremendous

192
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,000
momentum or maybe it's just this unending chattering bringing awareness to the

193
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,319
environment and then to our bodily experience interrupts that

194
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:30,680
momentum so what are some neutral maybe more readily accessible bodily

195
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:39,079
experiences such as feeling the feet on the ground feeling the pressure of whatever

196
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:45,920
is on is contacting the body feel that experience it can be pressure of what

197
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:53,280
you're sitting on standing on could be maybe the feeling of the clothing against the body again some other more

198
00:39:53,280 --> 00:40:00,800
readily accessible neutral experience es to bring mindfulness attention

199
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:08,079
recognition awareness noticing using all these syn synonyms that we might use for

200
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:14,599
Sati to just our experience in an uncomplicated

201
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:24,200
way you also might notice the breath and slightly just slightly extend

202
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:32,119
the exhale a little bit is this something else that can bring some more calmness to our

203
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:39,480
experience and interrupt this momentum of this fear or anxiety and certainly we know that the

204
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:46,640
Buddha did this right he brought awareness to his bodily experience when he was experiencing fear before he was

205
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:54,400
awakened he talks about like maintaining the same posture just knowing how his body was and just staying with

206
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,920
it now the second thing is the bodily experience first the environment second

207
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:06,440
the bodily experience we're coming closer and closer and then here's something that could be enormously

208
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:14,319
powerful recognize the strong sense of no I don't want

209
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:20,079
this no the sense of resistance like the sense of go

210
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:26,280
away and we tune into that and how does that show up for us

211
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:32,400
let me bring some curiosity what how does this no notice that I'm not talking about fear yet I'm just talking about

212
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:39,440
the no I don't want this go away and so how do you generally act

213
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:46,640
when fear arises do you believe it automatically do you recoil from it and shut down do

214
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:51,800
you avoid everything that makes you feel afraid do you attack do you get angry do

215
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:57,400
you become crit critical or blame do you feel bad about yourself

216
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:04,480
this idea well if I were a different kind of person I wouldn't be afraid if I was more of this less of

217
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:12,480
that so just tune into maybe noticing how you're reacting no need to judge it

218
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,560
and if you are critical of the way you're reacting can you notice the

219
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:24,559
criticalness how does that no I don't want this feel at that

220
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:31,280
moment maybe that's a sense of more energy coming up maybe it's a sense of energy going

221
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:38,880
away maybe it's a particular sensation in the body a tightness in the throat

222
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:47,880
or some something in the belly or in the chest can you be with that no

223
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:54,240
experience Again part of that is to tease apart Their Fear we're not looking at the fear yet we're just looking at

224
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:01,640
this big sense of no I don't want this nobody wants to feel

225
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:09,318
fear and then maybe even getting into maybe even a little bit more

226
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:17,400
subtle is what is it that feels threatened and this might be something that we'll do a little bit later when

227
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:23,880
we're not in the midst of the fear we could just stay with the sensation of no

228
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:29,920
and we'll notice that as we are with the sense of no then the sense of fear starts to obey we don't have to be with

229
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:36,720
the fear we can if that's available to you you can be with that bodily experience but it can just be with the

230
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:44,680
no and you'll notice how as we work with that strong sense of resistance the fear itself starts to Abate and

231
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:51,440
soften but also we can look at we feel fear when we're something which we're

232
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:58,839
trying to protect feels threatened so what are you trying to

233
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:05,520
protect what feels [Music] threatened maybe it's a inner story

234
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:11,119
about aging or health or how you should

235
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:18,920
be maybe it's a belief that it's dangerous to speak up it's dangerous to

236
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:24,040
Hope or ask for things or maybe it's a sense of wanting

237
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:32,160
things to be a particular way relationships security

238
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:39,720
health maybe it's a fear of dying these are all Perfectly Natural

239
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:47,119
legitimate fears but if there's a way that we could bring some specificity to the fears like

240
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:53,359
what is it that feels threatened and this can be a

241
00:44:53,359 --> 00:45:00,280
doorway to have greater freedom not only Freedom From Fear but just freedom in

242
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:05,880
general so bringing some mindfulness some curiosity to what is it that's

243
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:11,359
feeling threatened and to do this from a sense of

244
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:16,720
care in the guide meditation I pointed to some well-being if there's possible

245
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:23,119
to maybe have this inquiry not over in the midst of here maybe it's possible but maybe from a sense of well-being

246
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:28,520
when the fear Isn't So Paramount is there a way that we can bring some

247
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:34,079
curiosity what is it that brings some specificity I'm sorry that feels fear

248
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,160
what is it that's feeling threatened and can we bring some specificity to

249
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:45,160
that and maybe that comes to just dropping in the question what is it that feels

250
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:50,440
[Music] threatened and just allowing whatever

251
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:56,800
the answer might be to Bubble Up we don't have to do an archaeological dig to find it

252
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,040
but being present and honoring and respecting what comes

253
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,720
up so in this way STI mindfulness one of the five

254
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:16,520
faculties can be a tremendous support for fear anxiety and I talked about

255
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:21,960
going from the most obvious the external environment this is a common technique

256
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:29,160
for psychologist those people who work with trauma to help people to just start with what's in the room the plant the

257
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:35,640
picture on the wall the computer the desk like these are completely normal things and not to be dismissive of them

258
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:42,960
but to just like notice bring your attention to them and then maybe some neutral Corners

259
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:49,839
if that's helpful that will help the whole nervous system to calm down and then to our bodily experience

260
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:57,599
at that moment and in particular like where we feel contact some grounding

261
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,920
maybe this sensation of fear you don't have to because accompanying that fear

262
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:08,119
is the sense of no I don't want it tune into that sense of

263
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:15,680
no how does that feel and then to just have some Curious what is it that feels

264
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:22,160
threatened bring some mindfulness to that so here's the first faculty for

265
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:30,119
fearlessness for freedom forever and maybe you guys can come up with some other alliterations but wishing you all

266
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:37,440
a wonderful day today and maybe you'll have an opportunity to bring some mindfulness whenever you notice some

267
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:43,200
fear or some anxiety and thank you I look forward to

268
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:50,240
our journey of exploring these this week wishing you all a wonderful rest of the day thank

269
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,240
you
