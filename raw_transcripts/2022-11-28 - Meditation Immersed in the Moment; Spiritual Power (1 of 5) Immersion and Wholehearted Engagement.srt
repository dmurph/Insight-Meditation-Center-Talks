other over these couple years right and all over the world

25
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:52,080
so this morning the topic is

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,860
um in the week the topic is these series of steps or bases

27
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:05,040
roads sometimes that the Buddha talked about many times in the ancient

28
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,140
discourses that are supports for our meditation

29
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:16,920
progress prowess success and for a kind of a spiritual power

30
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:24,000
and [Music] um there are a couple of these that appear

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,760
in many different lists or appear multiple times in this

32
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,879
list the idipata and they are um

33
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:43,580
sense of immersion in practice and a sense of Engagement with meditation

34
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,140
so the invitation is to sit back find a

35
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:56,340
comfortable meditation posture and um

36
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:02,599
balance relaxation and alertness

37
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,519
I'm going to start with an image a couple of images

38
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,780
maybe close your eyes if that feels right and

39
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:21,799
imagine being in a vast field very relaxed

40
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:29,479
and as you're in this field a very soft

41
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:37,220
comfortable warm rain almost like a mist starts to come down

42
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:44,160
soaking the ground maybe some

43
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:52,100
hitting a roof above you or maybe you enjoy the sensations of it on your skin

44
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:59,100
but either way there's a sense of being soaked saturated

45
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,680
settled

46
00:05:06,419 --> 00:05:12,419
as you look across the field any dust or Haze that was there has been

47
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:17,479
washed away there's clarity

48
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:26,759
and in this way the invitation is to set a kind intention

49
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,759
an intention that your body your heart your mind

50
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:42,860
be saturated with filled immersed with awareness in the moment

51
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,500
and to support that it's helpful to relax often

52
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,699
perhaps softening your eyes behind your eyelids

53
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:05,539
foreign

54
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,198
your face and forehead

55
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:25,620
and even imagining rule of relaxation behind the eyes

56
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:31,759
spreading spreading through your whole body

57
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:43,819
allowing your neck shoulders torso to soften

58
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:54,240
your weight to be fully supported deeply supported on whatever surface

59
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:01,638
you're sitting on or lying held

60
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,460
save

61
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:20,400
noticing the weight of your body where it contacts the floor

62
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,580
perhaps the hip points the buttocks feet

63
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:36,560
rooted rooted Here and Now

64
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:52,160
and then a tuning attuning to a sense of this whole body

65
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:06,560
noticing the contact of air or cough on skin

66
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,120
all the sensations of aliveness vibrancy

67
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:34,459
allowing a sense of being immersed In This Moment

68
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:45,140
and then tuning in to the deeper Sensations in the body

69
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:53,000
movement we'll see

70
00:08:53,279 --> 00:09:00,920
tingling perhaps warmth of the body's core

71
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,060
and especially tuning in to the sensations

72
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,620
of this body breathing

73
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,920
settling

74
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:52,019
resting the attention wherever the breath feels most

75
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:58,380
pleasurable compelling

76
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:12,540
perhaps the movement of the belly diaphragm

77
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,120
gentle wave-like up and down

78
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:31,579
perhaps the expansion and relaxation of the ribcage or chest

79
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,019
or the refined Sensations of the breath of the nostrils

80
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:47,600
tip of the nose or top of the lip

81
00:10:56,579 --> 00:11:00,860
noticing the distinct qualities

82
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:09,980
of breathing in breathing out

83
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:37,940
noticing the difference between the sensations

84
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:44,060
but the fullness the top of the in-breath

85
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:50,940
and how they shift in the Letting Go the relaxation of the

86
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,420
out breath

87
00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:29,300
noticing too if it feels natural

88
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:40,760
the whole body of the breath in the very beginning to the very end

89
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,279
inviting awareness of all the little Sensations

90
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:56,480
aliveness through this whole body

91
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:02,959
of transpiration the whole body breathing

92
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,860
foreign

93
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:23,660
from time to time checking in

94
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,940
refreshing the awareness of the moment

95
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:39,980
acknowledging any mental processes kindly

96
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:52,220
noticing appreciating foreign

97
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:58,339
sensation of aliveness in the moment

98
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:03,740
in this body this breath

99
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:42,179
softening in to the moment

100
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:47,539
and from time to time checking in

101
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,320
what's this moment like

102
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:01,460
foreign

103
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:28,400
from time to time rededicating yourself

104
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:36,900
to close devoted attention to the sensations of this body

105
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,179
the arisings of this moment

106
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:54,980
allowing decent some connection

107
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,740
pleasure to be there

108
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,019
and allowing being with anything else

109
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,880
that's there with kindness

110
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,760
foreign

111
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:35,120
and as we approach the last moments of this meditation

112
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:43,940
invitation is to gather gather the attention the energy

113
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:53,840
in the mind and the Heart around the heart

114
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:02,840
perhaps even breathing as if you could breathe directly in and out of the heart

115
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:11,880
Gathering any goodness any sense of peace

116
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:18,440
sincerity from this meditation

117
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:25,760
and soaking in that for a minute breathing with it

118
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:37,260
and then as you open your mind to your inner eye

119
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:44,640
out to the other people creatures beings in your life

120
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,260
that you cross paths with

121
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:55,340
dedicating some part of this goodness

122
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:59,120
to them

123
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:10,940
May those in our lives benefit from this practice

124
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,940
breathing this beautiful intention outwards

125
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:59,240
May others in our lives be happy

126
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:09,320
May others be safe may they be peaceful

127
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:18,900
and may they be free May others be safe may this practice be

128
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,838
occasion for that freedom may they be peaceful

129
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:31,640
and may they be free foreign

130
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:41,859
[Music]

131
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:50,640
May others be safe may this practice be occasion for that freedom may they be

132
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:59,000
peaceful [Music] and may they be free

133
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:05,400

136
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:28,338

thank you for your prayers others be safe may this practice the occasion of

138

140
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:51,920
this practice the occasion for that freedom may they be peaceful

141
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:55,139
[Music]

142
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:04,819
sorry about that time so I didn't realize I could ring an actual Bell I couldn't ring an actual Bell

143
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:12,380
so the sound should have stopped looping by now

144
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:20,059
I'm diving at a moment

145
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,589
[Music]

146
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:40,880
thank you so

147
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:53,579
thank you all for the dedication of your practice the sincerity of your practice and for the technical troubleshooting

148
00:37:53,579 --> 00:38:02,240
I did not realize I was going to be experimenting with sound effects in this meditation

149
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:09,599
so the topic you'd like to talk about for the next few minutes is um

150
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,020
relationship between immersion and engagement

151
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:21,180
and just a quick overview this is part of the theme of the week

152
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:27,839
which is a series of bases or steps that the Buddha taught that were particularly

153
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:34,020
supportive for him before he was awakened and they are

154
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:41,839
wholesome desire energy or effort

155
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:48,560
investigation and quality of mind

156
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:57,060
and these bases these steps are sometimes called the roads to spiritual power

157
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:04,560
or the um bases for Spiritual power

158
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,680
bases for meditative success those are all valid translations

159
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:17,700
I hadn't paid a whole lot of attention to them over the years because of one of the translations that appears which is

160
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:23,220
the um bases for psychic power

161
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:28,980
and so I found that title a little off-putting and uninteresting but um

162
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:36,599
I'm seeing the list again recently I was struck how helpful for my own practice each of

163
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:43,140
these qualities were so these four or sometimes five faces

164
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:47,720
steps um

165
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:56,099
are conditioned for deepening practice for improving the efficacy of practice

166
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:01,200
and they can be kind of considered in tongue-in-cheek modern Parliament

167
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:07,200
superpowers for meditation when the Buddha's teachings include them

168
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,140
as psychic powers it's just important to notice the cultural context

169
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:18,480
to be aware of it spiritual power psychic power was a

170
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,700
currency for a lot of the ancient teachers in India as um in that very old

171
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:31,079
culture and it was kind of part of what was talked about it was very subjective kind of way of seeing the world and

172
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:37,800
understanding the world based on experience in the mind and um

173
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:43,020
the Buddha does bring them in but the only

174
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:51,180
power he recommends over and over again and is the power of insight

175
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:56,339
the power to free the heart permanently from greed hatred and delusion

176
00:40:56,339 --> 00:41:03,480
and it's almost like rhetorically as a teacher he's setting up how important that is by naming all of

177
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:09,900
these other capabilities so we can supposedly books developed in those

178
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:15,960
times as serious meditators the Buddha also discouraged his

179
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:21,300
followers from cultivating these other powers

180
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:30,300
and really focused in on insight and he went as far as to say that in

181
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:36,420
cultivating all of these attributes in the meditation a practitioner could expect full

182
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:43,440
Awakening in this lifetime or something very close so

183
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:51,660
each of these faces I'm going to call them is a bit of like a tripod stool

184
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:58,800
and each has three attributes the immersion and the practice or samadhi which is cultivated through a

185
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:05,220
wholehearted kind of Engagement a word in poly that's padhana

186
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:10,560
and then one of four things desire

187
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:17,940
energy or effort quality of mind or investigation investigation In This

188
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:27,599
Moment and these qualities all of them unfold a lot more fruitfully in a Marine

189
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:33,300
field relaxed content field

190
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:40,619
of contentment in the practice itself contentment just be immersed engaged

191
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:47,760
fully in the moment so an image will focus on these two legs

192
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,460
of the stool that are there in every base the immersion and the engagement

193
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:59,460
and imagine a Potter an artisan at a potter's wheel

194
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:05,099
and that their wheel is spinning looping the theme for today

195
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:12,839
we The Potter's Wheel is spinning the pot is spinning and their hands are gently on the pot shaping it

196
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:18,420
they're very engaged with the act of shaping that pot right

197
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:26,819
and they're also immersed in settled and concentrated on the process

198
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:32,040
so that's a little bit like the trade-off between the symbiosis between

199
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:40,260
the reciprocity between engagement and relaxation relaxation into this

200
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:47,900
immersion of samadhi wholehearted engagement

201
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:53,400
can be it can be helpful to understand it in terms of its opposite which for me

202
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:59,339
is boredom or disinterest a sense of kind of a separation from the process

203
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:04,619
and engagement is supported instead by

204
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:10,440
getting interested getting interested in the details of the process

205
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:17,480
the materials of the moment and how they weave together to create now

206
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:23,520
it's kind of by play in a way whether it's playing a sport or playing with

207
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:30,119
kids and it's an engagement that yes there's

208
00:44:30,119 --> 00:44:35,780
maybe an outcome in the back of your mind but it's not outcome focused

209
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:41,480
its engagement play for its own sake

210
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:48,300
so for me one of the most powerful lessons in this in my life was in many

211
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:54,180
many figure drawing sessions I went to back when I was more focused on being a visual artist

212
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:59,819
and a couple of times a week we would go to the studio and a group of us would get together and draw

213
00:44:59,819 --> 00:45:04,859
and in a way we're kind of doing the same thing every week

214
00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:11,220
just like we're doing the same thing with meditation every week but there's this engagement in the difference of the

215
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:17,520
materials how they worked together noticing different facets of what could

216
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:23,520
be seen and finding each day each drawing each meditation

217
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:30,300
a different way in a different way to connect the process be fresh with it embodied

218
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:36,420
with it each of you probably has an example of

219
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:41,640
this in your own life something that continually

220
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:47,900
I is rewarded by finding new details in it

221
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:55,260
skillful samadhi immersion is a softening into

222
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:01,440
softening into this kind of collectedness born out of the contentment of being engaged in the

223
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:08,220
process itself and earlier in the process it can be

224
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:14,520
a very active kind of Engagement and later in the process as a sense of

225
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:21,359
flow takes hold chicks and Molly's flow concept takes

226
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:26,760
hold then there's it has its own momentum and then the engagement is more

227
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:33,500
relaxed settled back right

228
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:39,960
skillful samadhi has qualities of calm and relaxation just woven right into it

229
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:48,180
it's not a bearing down or squinting a huffing and puffing instead it can be like that soft rain

230
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:53,280
softening field or a desert quiet can be softening

231
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,220
that very clay that ends up on the potter's wheel

232
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:04,319
and that is kind of a good simile we are the clay

233
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:10,280
and we are also the Artisan shaping our own mind

234
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:16,440
there's a malleability and a reciprocity that happened because

235
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:22,099
these two qualities continue to support each other

236
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:29,220
so when brought together with the other

237
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:35,579
four qualities we'll talk about this week Dharma desire or wholesome desire

238
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:41,099
energy balanced effort quality of mind and heart and thought

239
00:47:41,099 --> 00:47:47,940
and investigation these can become really powerful ways to cultivate both

240
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:57,540
of these foundational meditation qualities so look forward to covering that with

241
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:05,720
many of you in the coming days and tomorrow we will talk about desire

242
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:11,280
dharmic desire and falling in love with the practice

243
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:16,560
look forward to being back with you then thank you for the sincerity of your

244
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,000
practice and for being here
