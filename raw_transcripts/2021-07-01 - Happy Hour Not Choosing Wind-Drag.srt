3
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,640
invite us to explore a a theme we were exploring last week

4
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:31,439
from different aspects different dimensions and today again from another aspect another

5
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,440
dimension and that is putting down

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:46,800
what is extra what is not needed what is not needed as so so that we can make more space

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:54,480
for ease for peace for love for care for confidence for trust

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,280
putting down what is extra so one similarly that can come up is say

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:09,520
if it's in the summer it's already hot and you don't want to be wearing a

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:17,439
wool coat that is extra it's not needed to put it to put it down or the idea of

11
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:24,000
wind drag wind drag how if you well you're going through we're

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,119
all going through life through life and it's nice to have

13
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:36,560
ease freedom nirvana is another word for ease for freedom going through life

14
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,680
without wind drag and when we add what is not

15
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,799
needed for example hatred extra self-hatred

16
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,479
the hatred of others extra adds wind drag adds one drag or lack of confidence oh i

17
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,479
can't do this i can't do this i'm not good enough when drag when drag how about we just

18
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,680
down to it and gently put it down it's not needed

19
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,720
so so some of the invitations i'll make tonight during the guided meditation is a while

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:18,000
if you notice what's things that are extra coming up oh i forgot to do blah blah blah oh

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,680

22
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,760

24
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,720

25
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,680
and you might need to put down wind drag the what is creating wind drag this extra stuff

26
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:01,280
these extra layers many many many times do it every time joyfully putting it

27
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,840

28
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:14,159

62
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,959

95
00:17:45,600 --> 00:18:01,840
from the arrows that can cause harm when drag

96
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:29,840
just sit just here

97
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,480
especially when we're put down

98
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:41,520
any enmity any self-criticism self-hatred

99
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:48,400
self-doubt or judgments directed towards ourselves

100
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:54,720
or others but we put those down especially when we

101
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,960
release them we make even more space for love

102
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,679
care for ourselves and others

103
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:22,880
paulie the language of the buddha dosa ill will hatred

104
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,080
al dosa the opposite of ill will hatred

105
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:36,080
synonymous with loving kindness so when you put any of these

106
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:47,039
unhelpful unprofitable attitudes of the mind down release them

107
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:59,840
you're making more space for peace for love for friendliness

108
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:49,120
now i would like to invite you as a bridge between this practice and

109
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:55,840
the cushion in our daily life

110
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,000
to do a little visualization if you would

111
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:10,880
as you feel embodied sitting feeling your feet

112
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:19,360
on the floor your sit bones contacting the earth

113
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:28,640
your hands your breath moving through your body

114
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,320
bring to mind if you would a situation from today

115
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:42,158
where there was something you were to do

116
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:50,320
could be sending an email or washing the dishes

117
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:58,240
or anything going for a walk whatever but there was some wind drag in the mind

118
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:05,760
resistance either judgment inner judgment i can't

119
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:12,320
do this not good enough i don't know what to do

120
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,720
doubt or external

121
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,760
any situation where where there was one drag

122
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:31,279
feeling your body feeling your breath as you feel into the situation where

123
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:37,360

124
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,919

125
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,720
feeling your body what does your body feel like

126
00:24:53,919 --> 00:25:00,400
with this entanglement with this wind drag

127
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,360
you notice more tightness more fatigue

128
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,960
more exertion

129
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:17,919
more stress more dukkha

130
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,120

139
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:08,639

00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,480
when sitting i choose to sit

170
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:53,840
that's all

171
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:20,319
for the last moments of this practice

172
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,320
if any thoughts are coming up of judging your practice

173
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,440
considering it not good enough not worthy enough

174
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:43,280
these self-judgements these thoughts of ill will towards yourself where extra

175
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:50,800
are extra not needed putting them down

176
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:58,960
ah releasing letting go you did your best you showed up as best

177
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:06,640
as you're able to by letting go of self-judgment of dosa

178
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,279
you makes space for adosa

179
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:22,640
and paulie synonymous with metta loving-kindness the opposite of illegal

180
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:29,760
choosing choosing simply just this letting the

181
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:37,839
extra letting the wind dry go in this passing moment

182
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,800
in this passing moment just this

183
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,839
justice

184
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,839
thank you all for your practice

185
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:33,040
so for today's practice i was weaving a few different themes

186
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:42,079
as you probably noticed one theme was this theme of

187
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:49,359
what is extra putting down what is extra especially what is put down

188
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:58,079
the extra that's put down if it is it'll will again in polydosa dosa

189
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,760
the opposite of that in poly ah do so you add an a and it becomes the opposite r dose

190
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,800
is synonymous with meta so when you put any ill will doubt uh

191
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,160
uh uh uh all this extra wings especially when you put those down

192
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:20,400
ah making some more space for peace for ease for love for self-care it's the

193
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:27,839
most important protection meta we can offer ourselves may i be safe or

194
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:33,359
may i be safe from all this extra stuff that i keep

195
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:43,838
hurting myself with and hurting others with ah body can relax the mind can relax

196
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,960
another theme i wanted to bring in is the simplicity of just this with this beautiful poem

197
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,320
called in this passing moment

198
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:02,079
by hogan bays b-a-y-s it's pretty easy to find for those who

199
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:09,359
want to find it later and probably neil is going to send it to the google groups he has thank you neil

200
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:17,200
the theme here is no conflict just this just this

201
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,800
just as if you're sending an email oh all this extras you're washing the

202
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:28,560
dishes off just immersed in it just immersed with what

203
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:35,680
is no conflict no wind track again making more space

204
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:42,160
have you noticed the days that maybe you got the same amount done as another day but if there was a

205
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:48,480
lot of wind drag a lot of doubt a lot of internally externally you're much more

206
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,560
exhausted by the end of the day as if you've climbed a mountain but it's

207
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:00,880
all wind drag wind drag lack of freedom lack of freedom whereas putting down

208
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:08,960
what is extra what is not needed and recognizing what's not needed so so i've said plenty i would love to

209
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:16,000
hear from you what did you notice what did you discover you can type in that if it's typed

210
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,319
publicly i'll say your name if not just to me then it'll be private reflection i won't

211
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:28,960
read out your name you can also raise your zoom hand [Music]

212
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,400
ali says in what you created i got the message that the very act of choosing

213
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:41,200
eliminates so much of the extra then begging the question where am i not

214
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:48,000
choosing where am i not choosing in my life question mark great i love this context as an

215
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,000
as an access to simplicity and space beautiful beautifully put alley

216
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,640
beautifully put yeah i want to read the this part again

217
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,720
that it begs the question where am i not choosing in my life where where is wind drag

218
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,839
where is oh beautiful thank you for offering this

231
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,880
it's so full and it's delicious and it's just putting down other things

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:56,400
uh what's extra can become so easy beautiful yeah thank you in fact that reminds me i

233

238
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:39,599
what comes up when you hear and hold with community these three themes how did they work for

239
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:47,359
you what you observed uh benefiting from other people's insight and wisdom it's always

243
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,800
silently before you start speaking just holding yourself holding others with meta

264
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:43,040
this theme of letting go to make space to make space for care for love as a way to care

265
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:48,960
and love for ourselves it's amazing how connected the theme of letting go

266
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:55,680
is with meta with kindness even though on its face it doesn't seem like it as neil was

267
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:01,119
saying last week like at first like wait this is letting go this is not meta whereas it's like oh wait a minute

268
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:07,680
there's this moistening of the heart as he was also saying there's a moistening of the heart

269
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:13,119
a gentleness a sense of care so so it's so much fun to discover these

270
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:19,520
connections between these practices that at first might be hidden so

271
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:26,319
