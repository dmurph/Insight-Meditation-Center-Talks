1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:06,600
so I would like to talk about one of the

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,320
really basic practice teachings in our

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,119
vipasana uh

4
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,039
tradition and in general the teachings

5
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:21,240
we give tend to be practice teachings

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,720
they're uh teachings that really focus

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,960
on how to support people to practice

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,560
mindfulness that makes the most sense on

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,960
Retreats and uh where that's really the

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,719
focus and but that Retreat focus is so

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,800
Central to us that sometimes that spill

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,800
spills over and uh and it's one of the

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,520
primary things we're doing is giving

14
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,640
practice instructions that are relevant

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,039
for meditation and then indirectly

16
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,360
sometimes or sometimes directly we talk

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,280
about how it applies to everyday

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,879
life but these practice instructions

19
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:54,120
that are coming out of the teachings of

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,640
the Buddha um uh sometimes it's amazing

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,120
how modern they seem it's like wow this

22
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,160
this fits just into our world just as

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,560
well as it probably did 2500 years ago

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,200
but that's a long time ago and that's

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,799
like the bronze

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,600
Ages come to IMC and get teachings from

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,080
the bronze

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,119
ages I don't know if that would you know

29
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,720
give people maybe give people kind of

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,880
pause to come

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,119
here and um so in recent years uh I've

32
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,600
uh been very fortunate to have some

33
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,759
contact with uh some of the modern

34
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:37,399
developments especially here in the west

35
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:40,799
of new ways of understanding human mat

36
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,159
human maturation human

37
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:45,759
concerns um that's had a big impact on

38
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,000
me uh one of them is the developing

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,280
field of chaplaincy pestal care and uh

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,000
there's a whole set of values or human

41
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,880
needs that are cons that are uh seen in

42
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,079
chaplain SE is that the chaplain meets

43
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,520
in with people and that list is

44
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,239
different than any list that I've ever

45
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,479
seen in

46
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,440
Buddhism and but they're speaking to

47
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,400
fundamental things that about being a

48
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,360
human

49
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,040
being um I sit on a local in a hospital

50
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:21,200
Ethics Committee and I'm inspired by how

51
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,840
in the last probably 50 years the field

52
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,040
of medical e uh medical ethics has

53
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,400
really uh been de grown and developed

54
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,160
and there's very clear uh ethical values

55
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,519
that are held in hospitals these days

56
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,440
but and it's inspiring to to go to this

57
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,400
committee and hear doctors and nurses

58
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,200
medical staff uh reflect on how to care

59
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,720
for patients with these values and some

60
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,560
of those values also are not directly

61
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,640
spoken about in uh in uh in in

62
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,159
Buddhism and maybe even

63
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:00,680
avoided and then uh the other is modern

64
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,760
psycho psychology where there's been uh

65
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,000
ideas of uh human development the stages

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,799
of human development like Eric Ericson I

67
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:13,360
think he has five stages of human

68
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,440
development and and U and some of those

69
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,959
uh forms of psychology have positive uh

70
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:22,239
states that are kind of the Fulfillment

71
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,560
of these different

72
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,959
stages and some of those also aren't

73
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:27,480
touched on in Buddhist

74
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,439
teachings so so that's interesting so do

75
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:32,200
we just stay in Little

76
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,760
Buddhist

77
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,599
little um

78
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,599
enclave and be content with that or uh

79
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:43,120
or not and I find it very enlivening and

80
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,400
interesting to to have to see the

81
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,519
interaction between these two these

82
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,760
different

83
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,959
worlds and um and sometimes uh I feel

84
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,560
like I learned from them sometimes I

85
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,720
feel like the Buddhist orientation casts

86
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,599
a different perspective on other things

87
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:01,560
are developing in the West and gives me

88
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,480
pause or gives me kind of a different

89
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,959
slant to understand

90
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:09,519
them and uh so from um one of the things

91
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,720
that uh uh fundamental to

92
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,799
chaplaincy is a topic of meaning meaning

93
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,880
making meaning and purpose and many

94
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,880
times when meaning has been ruptured in

95
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,320
people's lives even when it's

96
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,280
unconscious the meaning they assign to

97
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,759
their life or have when that gets broken

98
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:31,080
and often in chapy situations where

99
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,919
Chaplin are needed it's because

100
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:34,840
something dramatic has happened that

101
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,320
what gives people meaning in their life

102
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,360
has been broken or ruptured and and uh

103
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:45,080
sometimes betrayed even and so um so

104
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,280
being able to respond and think about

105
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,680
points of view from meaning and purpose

106
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,280
and it's seldom that a Buddhist teacher

107
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,720
talks too much about topic of meaning

108
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,840
per se or purpose per se and when I was

109
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,639
a Zen student it was almost taboo

110
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,919
because the teachers would say someone

111
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:05,160
asked what's the meaning meaning of life

112
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,960
and they would bark back no

113
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,600
meaning and uh what's the purpose no

114
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,000
purpose and but what they didn't then

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,160
follow up on usually was to explain that

116
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,160
this teaching of no meaning and no

117
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,600
purpose fit in was within a larger

118
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,360
context that had a lot of meaning and

119
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,120
purpose um and so you had to kind of if

120
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,840
you didn't understand the larger context

121
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,000
of why they say say that it would be

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,319
just confusing sometimes and uh so there

123
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,960
was meaning and purpose there even

124
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
though that to say

125
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,240
that and um in um in the world of Ethics

126
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,160
one of the kind of the

127
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,600
fundamental uh ethical principles there

128
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,280
are autonomy and dignity that everyone

129
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,160
has autonomy and everyone has dignity

130
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,400
and uh and that is a little bit bit hard

131
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,280
sometimes to fit into for some people uh

132
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,160
if you've kind of spend too much time

133
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,280
listening to Buddhist teachers like

134
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,280
me and they've EMP emphasized that not

135
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,000
self not self realized not self and

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,280
suddenly autonomy and dignity seems like

137
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,400
but now we're back in the world of self

138
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,919
and how are these supposed to work

139
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,919
together and then uh in modern uh you

140
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:25,000
know psychology and stages of

141
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,400
development um you know there's the idea

142
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,280
of

143
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,599
maturation and uh and that exists in

144
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,919
Buddhism the idea of maturation

145
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,800
sometimes is called um uh ripening

146
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,639
because they use uh uh metaphor from

147
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:42,720
Plants fruit ripening to this process of

148
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,280
spiritual

149
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,520
maturation and um and I love the idea of

150
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,960
uh using the word maturation for um how

151
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,560
people develop in Buddhist practice

152
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,319
because um uh it some of the classic

153
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,840
ideas of the stage of development are

154
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,879
kind of quantum leaps and you you make

155
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:05,879
this big leap into a whole different way

156
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:09,080
of being that transformation and then

157
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,680
there's almost like a status difference

158
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,360
between people who enter these different

159
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,560
levels and people who don't and and it's

160
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,280
little bit arbitrary to make these kind

161
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:21,639
of absolute Quantum ideas of Leaping and

162
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,599
I think the idea of maturation is slow

163
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,000
and gradual process of of developing and

164
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
growing is much more um

165
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,639
peaceful it's much more socially polite

166
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,639
it's just much more kind of allows us

167
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,919
not to be so caught up in goals and

168
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:41,440
being a perfect or just being attaining

169
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,280
something we want to just allow

170
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,759
something to slowly grow and develop and

171
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,280
it might look like stages like Eric

172
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,720
Ericson has these five stages or phases

173
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,080
of human development but even there I

174
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,840
think it's a little bit problematic

175
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,360
because uh who wants to who wants to be

176
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,759
identified as someone who never grew out

177
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:02,479
of the first

178
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,759
stage you know when you're a little kid

179
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,039
and um but if you see them these uh

180
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,960
these things as being five different

181
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,120
areas of maturation and the with

182
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,039
different areas of where we need to

183
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:18,360
develop so the classic teaching I want

184
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,639
to mention today is called the five

185
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,000
faculties five capacities that we have

186
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,440
that can become strengths as they as we

187
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,080
mature and the class usual way of

188
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,959
describing these five in English is

189
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,240
Faith effort mindfulness concentration

190
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,959
and wisdom so I would like to present

191
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,479
them in a different way today I'd like

192
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,440
to present them as uh confidence Freedom

193
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,000
love

194
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,160
wholeness and meaning and

195
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,680
purpose so uh faith I want to call

196
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,120
confidence effort or energy or exertion

197
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,519
I like like to call

198
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:03,160
Freedom and the mindfulness I'd like to

199
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,120
call

200
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,480
love and uh concentration Som I'd like

201
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,800
to call

202
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,120
wholeness and uh and wisdom I'd like to

203
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,320
call meaning and

204
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,920
purpose and I think that switching the

205
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,880
words like that provide us a very

206
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,240
different orientation to understand how

207
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,399
profound these five faculties are these

208
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,200
five capacities we are are and how as as

209
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,680
they get developed and come into

210
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,160
fulfillment

211
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,160
become strong that uh they bring us

212
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,160
these wonderful qualities they bring us

213
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,519
confidence they bring us a sense of

214
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,600
Freedom they bring us love they bring us

215
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,720
wholeness and they bring us a meaning

216
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,640
and

217
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,959
purpose classically these uh five are

218
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:51,600
sometimes paired so that uh faith and

219
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,720
wisdom are paired and effort and samade

220
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,240
are appeared and then mindfulness is

221
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,959
never need doesn't need to be paired or

222
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:01,760
balanced with anything else it just

223
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,680
stands for itself so in this schema I

224
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,399
think it works the confidence and uh

225
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,120
meaning and purpose work together if we

226
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,720
have a clear sense of meaning what is

227
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,519
Meaningful for your life and what

228
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,839
purpose then we can talk about having

229
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,880
confidence for that meaning and purpose

230
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,519
if we have a clear sense of it so that

231
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,320
and then the pairing of of uh freedom

232
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,200
and

233
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,240
wholeness uh uh in my mind it it implies

234
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,120
that we can't really talk

235
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,800
about kind of a spiritual or really

236
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,560
mature humanistic kind of Freedom if

237
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,959
we're not

238
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,560
whole uh if um there's a lot of emphasis

239
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,560
in Freedom as many of you know in the

240
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,160
United States that it it's kind of

241
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,560
selfish it's kind of like you know I

242
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,600
should be free to do whatever I please

243
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,200
you know to be

244
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,320
politely and um and uh you know there's

245
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,800
the freedom to shop freedom to you know

246
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,120
what doing all kinds of things uh but um

247
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,399
but the

248
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,079
um but what I'd like to propose is when

249
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:18,240
it's selfish or self-centered Freedom uh

250
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,880
it actually is not healthy for the

251
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,240
person doing it because the person is

252
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,079
not whole if we have a sense of real

253
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:27,320
wholeness that comes from samade comes

254
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,920
from meditation practice then we'll feel

255
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,120
how we become divided in ourselves

256
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,639
fragmented when it's selfish the sense

257
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:38,680
of Freedom we have and but for freedom

258
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,399
to come out of sense of wholeness where

259
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,440
we don't fragment ourselves provides

260
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,959
much more meaning and purpose for the

261
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,079
freedom we

262
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,000
live and then uh mindfulness I I relate

263
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
to love and partly because that's what I

264
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,240
discovered in the years I practiced it

265
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,800
that it's hard sometimes to separate the

266
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,160
kind of clear attention to something

267
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,560
that is mindfulness from love that

268
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,079
somehow seeing clearly is an act of love

269
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:13,480
and as I've often have said uh this is

270
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,639
represented by the experience of young

271
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,079
children or adults who come and talk to

272
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:21,320
me and say that as young children they

273
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,720
feel they were never seen the parents

274
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,279
ignored them or you didn't Overlook them

275
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,920
or the parents was too busy or too angry

276
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:32,360
or too drunk or something and um and so

277
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,959
they felt like they never were seen and

278
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,399
cared for and not to be seen as a child

279
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:40,800
is equivalent to not feeling loved and

280
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,120
it can be really detrimental to be seen

281
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,079
is a form of love for adults uh maybe

282
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,040
the equivalent is to be listened to that

283
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,720
to uh to be really heard is is a way of

284
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,959
being is way to hear someone well is a

285
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,040
way of loving someone it's such such a

286
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,839
deep need we have to be heard and

287
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,160
understood and so mindfulness is that it

288
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,519
fits into this capacity to see and to

289
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,040
hear and to do that for ourselves to

290
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:16,079
really be mindful here clearly uh is a

291
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,680
way to have love for oneself to bring

292
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,519
love to see the world through the eyes

293
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,720
of mindfulness is a Kind of Love is a

294
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,800
kind of care for the

295
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,320
world so um so the first one

296
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,959
confidence paired with meaning and

297
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,440
purpose paired with wisdom is that the

298
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,639
the wi the idea of wisdom in Buddhism

299
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:42,279
early Buddhism in the bronze

300
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:47,440
ages is that um wisdom has to do with uh

301
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,440
understanding that we have a

302
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,079
capacity to not

303
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,079
suffer we have a capacity to not to do

304
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:58,440
things engage in activities that

305
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,759
afflicts us

306
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:02,959
that diminishes us that undermines our

307
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,959
well-being that drains

308
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,600
us and um and and we have the capacity

309
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,079
to do the opposite we have the capacity

310
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:13,880
to do the things that uh make us feel

311
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,759
nourished develop what's wholesome in US

312
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:20,120
develop a sense of uh well-being and

313
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:23,480
goodness in us rather than Badness in US

314
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,360
rather than under you know and that that

315
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,560
distinction is necessary in Buddhism for

316
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,839
the ultimate purpose of Buddhism which

317
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:36,959
is uh to grow and mature in a way that

318
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:41,199
brings us to the end of suffering to Dua

319
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,600
brings us to the end of the emotional

320
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,759
pain that we contribute to

321
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:49,040
ourselves there might still be emotional

322
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,079
pain but it's not something that we're

323
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,079
contributing to our heart is not adding

324
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,079
or suffering our heart is not divided

325
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:59,959
our heart is not Contracting our heart

326
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:01,839
is not involved in activities which

327
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,440
undermine us and to be able to see this

328
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,240
clearly well enough can give a

329
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,079
tremendous amount of meaning and purpose

330
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,360
to a life there's meaning and purpose to

331
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,519
come to the end of suffering there's

332
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,600
meaning and purpose to do the things

333
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,800
that allow our our life our inner life

334
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,120
our heart to thrive the budha use the

335
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,399
word Thrive to come into a sense of

336
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,279
abundance come into a sense of

337
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:29,720
fulfillment

338
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,600
to mature and grow and ripen in a to

339
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,880
become

340
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,480
full and so there's a very positive

341
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,680
orientation to the capacity of human

342
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,399
development in early Buddhism that that

343
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,000
that the guide for it the whole approach

344
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,800
to it is very simple it doesn't require

345
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
any Supernatural beliefs it doesn't

346
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,759
require any great metaphysical beliefs

347
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,839
it requires a heightened

348
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:00,880
sensitivity to feel how our body our

349
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,040
hearts our inner mind our inner life

350
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,720
prefers to be whole to per prefers not

351
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,000
to add pain and suffering to us add

352
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,920
stress to our system prefers to be

353
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,160
involved in those things which are feel

354
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,720
inspiring feel good for

355
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,680
us and um and maybe that's not enough

356
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,880
for some people to inspire some people

357
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,480
because they

358
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,319
want really Grand ideas spiritual IDE

359
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:32,240
you know Supernatural ideas Cosmic ideas

360
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,240
Cosmic Consciousness great states of of

361
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,880
Altered States Of Consciousness that's

362
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,920
the

363
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,680
purpose u in some ways Buddhism is a

364
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,079
pretty humble

365
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,600
religion because its goal is simply

366
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,120
only to end

367
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:54,319
suffering and so to have a sense of that

368
00:16:54,319 --> 00:16:56,920
possibility and then to have confidence

369
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,040
in that that that's meaningful to have

370
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,160
confidence in that as a

371
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,480
purpose without the confidence that this

372
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,400
is useful then why practice there has to

373
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,480
be some confidence and that's that's the

374
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,438
goal that's the purpose that's what's

375
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,438
possible and so those two go together

376
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,400
we're not talking about confidence in

377
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,360
some AB abstract way you know I don't

378
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,640
have enough confidence I'm supposed to

379
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,199
be more confident what but you know but

380
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,400
I don't know what I'm supposed to be

381
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,798
confident

382
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:29,400
in uh but this provides the wisdom

383
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,919
provides guide guidance for where we can

384
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,919
find our confidence where we can develop

385
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:36,080
our

386
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,720
confidence and as we develop as we

387
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,600
practice then not only we have

388
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,120
confidence in the purpose but we also

389
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,679
now have confidence in our capacity to

390
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,760
practice our capacity to make a

391
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,760
difference to engage and that comes into

392
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,240
the second faculty which is effort or

393
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,880
exertion or

394
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,720
application and which I tie to wholeness

395
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,240
and so to apply

396
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,000
ourselves in this practice like to do

397
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,240
practice mindfulness practice

398
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,400
meditation um because the meaning and

399
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:15,280
purpose was to not suffer not to add

400
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,720
stress we apply that confidently to how

401
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,159
we make effort in the

402
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:24,559
practice I've practiced you know sat

403
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,559
down to meditate with the idea that you

404
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:30,480
know I'm going to really get

405
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,200
really concentrated now I'm gonna really

406
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,720
kind of Blast away my you know all my

407
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,880
thoughts and and I'll just be like the

408
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,720
you know the Dharma the Buddha's gift to

409
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,480
my town my city and you know I get a

410
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,600
badge that says you look at gil I've you

411
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,600
know I'm the great Blaster way of

412
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,679
thoughts and can you know just not be

413
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,000
distracted and it'll be great I'll be

414
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,240
praised by

415
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,600
everyone you know maybe exaggerating a

416
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,799
little bit how I thought but it's there

417
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,559
something like that certainly went on in

418
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,520
my mind but those kinds of thoughts

419
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,679
added stress and I I those when

420
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,240
something like that was going on in my

421
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,159
meditation practice it I I it turned out

422
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:15,799
it was actually very

423
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:18,840
successful uh for me in terms of uh

424
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,360
creating a

425
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,320
headache so you know eventually I

426
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,080
learned that this doesn't work this

427
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,600
attitude I have about how to practice

428
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,480
straining and pushing um or sometimes I

429
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,320
was really trying to avoid something you

430
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,960
know really something was coming up in

431
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,520
my meditation some emotions some

432
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,200
unresolved emotions that I really needed

433
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,320
to look at um but I didn't want to look

434
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,480
at and I would put up walls I'd put up

435
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,960
resistance you know it's I I you know

436
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,400
tense up so I wouldn't have to feel it

437
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,440
and um eventually I learned that didn't

438
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,280
work either that what worked is to open

439
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,360
because the resistance is another form

440
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,280
of undermining myself is another form of

441
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,799
being divided is not understanding the

442
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:05,559
meaning of purpose is to open to

443
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:07,679
everything so we can find a way to

444
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,600
mature through it not to

445
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,280
avoid so this idea of having a clear

446
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,840
sense of meaning and purpose is a

447
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,799
protection for the effort we make so

448
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:21,720
that we kind of always checking out am I

449
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,919
practicing in a way that feels good that

450
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,600
I enjoy or seems right to me when I have

451
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,600
to face what's difficult

452
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,960
and then wholeness the idea that

453
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,480
wholeness is uh is we start discovering

454
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,960
all the ways we live in a divided way

455
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,640
fragmented way all the ways we pushing

456
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,400
things away or we're over prioritizing

457
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,600
certain parts of ourselves so we're not

458
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,120
present for the whole if we have strong

459
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,640
desires and ambition we might miss the

460
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,919
whole of who we are if we have strong

461
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:57,480
aversions and hates we miss the whole of

462
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,159
who we are because we're so so fixated

463
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:01,880
and focused on an object of our desires

464
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,080
the object of our aversions we don't see

465
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,799
the fullness of who we are and so it

466
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,159
turns out if you don't the fullness of

467
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,440
who we are the wholeness the undivided

468
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,480
the

469
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,320
unfragmented um that actually feels much

470
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,159
more nourishing it feels much more this

471
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,360
is the the soil or the ground in which

472
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,080
things can grow and mature and that's

473
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,559
part of the function of samade practice

474
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:31,520
in Buddhism is to create the conditions

475
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,799
that's creates the let's let's who we

476
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,200
are be all of who we are be

477
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,679
complete warts and all so that something

478
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,720
it can be fertile soil for something

479
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,640
grow and develop fertile soil for

480
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,360
something to wither away which doesn't

481
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,120
serve

482
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,960
us and then we come then to the the the

483
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,960
middle uh which is uh mindfulness that

484
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,919
that needs no balance needs no that

485
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,880
because mindfulness is often seen as a

486
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,200
form of

487
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,080
wisdom uh not the wisdom that you would

488
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,960
necessarily have articulate

489
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,120
through ideas of meaning and purpose but

490
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,799
the kind of wisdom that comes from

491
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,360
having direct immediate contact with our

492
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,679
lived experience here and now the

493
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,039
contact that get it feels that uh if you

494
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:29,720
step on a nail you would know you should

495
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,159
not push down with your heel because you

496
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,080
start feeling it going in oh better take

497
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,600
it out it's you you get the you get the

498
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,880
message right

499
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,640
away and uh so with mindfulness these

500
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,360
messages come in and the stronger the

501
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,640
mindfulness is the more subtle the

502
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,000
messages are from the psychophysical

503
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,720
system this is good this is not so good

504
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,440
this is nourishing this is Pleasant this

505
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,360
is enjoyable this brings happiness and

506
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,640
wellbeing this doesn't bring happiness

507
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,480
and well-being it brings the opposite

508
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,240
but to really get quiet and still to not

509
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,679
override the experience with a lot of

510
00:23:10,679 --> 00:23:13,120
thoughts and ideas and

511
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,640
expectations um and that ability to have

512
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,919
that kind of mindfulness that is so

513
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,640
sensitive to the caring of what's

514
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,200
supports us and what

515
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,600
doesn't uh maybe start seeing it's a

516
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,840
form of

517
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,000
love because we have inside of us

518
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,799
something inside here that wants to care

519
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:34,279
for you something inside of you that

520
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,480
wants the best in you that wants wants

521
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,320
to

522
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,919
avoid

523
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:42,039
harm you know it's not so different than

524
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:43,799
you know taking your hand off the hot

525
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,840
stove right away something inside of

526
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,360
your nose to do that they say that uh

527
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,400
that instinct to not take your hand off

528
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,919
the hot

529
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,480
stove never makes it to the brain or it

530
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,200
the the it responds before the signal

531
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,720
goes to the brain it's so basic in the

532
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,640
whole nervous system that's even you

533
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,480
know the brain the mind we don't

534
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,320
normally think of doesn't have to even

535
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,279
operate something very deep inside of us

536
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,760
something built into our very structure

537
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,880
of Being Human Being I believe has

538
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,679
something in it to want to care for us

539
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,200
there's there's and that I would like to

540
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,840
call

541
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:26,080
love so we all so the

542
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,799
possibility as we mature as we develop

543
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,600
in this practice is to bring these five

544
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,760
areas to

545
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,360
fullness it's possible to come into a

546
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,000
fullness around

547
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,279
confidence it's possible to come into a

548
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,840
fullness around a sense of Freedom a

549
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,520
freedom to be able to

550
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,720
act without

551
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,240
restrictions at least through our hearts

552
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,039
what our hearts motivated to do as part

553
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,919
of our

554
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:58,120
wholeness uh fulfillment in love and

555
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,760
care care and

556
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,120
compassion a fulfillment in terms of a

557
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,559
sense of wholeness being

558
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,320
complete now that I'm getting to be

559
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,720
old you know I'm 70 now so some people

560
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,200
consider or on

561
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,360
edge approaching it depends how old you

562
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,039
are what you think 70 is I'm

563
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:24,320
approaching when I was 20 I would have

564
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,039
looked and that's

565
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:28,840
old so

566
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:32,120
changes but uh but you know it is an age

567
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,960
where I begin thinking about you know

568
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,880
the end of life and you know what my

569
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,360
life has been like and and I feel kind

570
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:41,080
of a certain satisfaction and feel like

571
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,000
I've had a good life and that feels full

572
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,679
that's felt full because there sense of

573
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:46,799
wholeness in it so that's a nice thing

574
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:49,960
to come to and but it's not enough to

575
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:54,000
rest on that because I'm still the

576
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,039
system that I have still wants to

577
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:59,080
practice it's a constant coming into

578
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,039
wholeness coming into Freedom a constant

579
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,480
kind of reference point to what's

580
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,039
meaningful and

581
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,520
purposeful so maturing into wholeness is

582
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,320
is always a

583
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,640
process and then uh

584
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,840
fulfillment coming into completion

585
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,480
fulfillment or a matur maturity into a

586
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,320
real sense of meaning and

587
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,640
purpose so that's kind of at the root

588
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,799
we're rooted in it we're dedicated to it

589
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,320
it informs us yes yes the purpose

590
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,919
there's a real purpose that I want to

591
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,279
stand in and be part of that's different

592
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,240
than um going on

593
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,279
Netflix or shopping on

594
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,240
Amazon different than what a lot of

595
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,399
people tend to do fill their time with

596
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:48,399
but what if that meaning and purpose is

597
00:26:48,399 --> 00:26:51,039
like that's what has most meaning for

598
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,600
you is what you fill your time with and

599
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,240
that's one of the things this practice

600
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,080
can be part of some people feel like

601
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,279
this has gives the life the most meaning

602
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,960
most purpose and it's not

603
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,039
selfish because in this system in this

604
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,399
meaning and purpose built into this

605
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:12,039
psychophysical system in the love of it

606
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:14,840
all and the care of it all is love and

607
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,840
care for others and for the world it

608
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,440
can't be any different because our own

609
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,039
well-being is intimately connected to

610
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:25,399
our

611
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:27,880
connectivity to others and if we're

612
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,919
living being in the lived experience we

613
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,240
really know how to sense and feel and be

614
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,559
be present to listen and to see others

615
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,640
so that our seeing and listening is an

616
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,000
act of Love are people's well well-being

617
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,559
is kind of like our own so of course

618
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,120
there's going to be love in how we live

619
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,440
our

620
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,080
life so these are the five areas that we

621
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,000
become strong and develop and this is my

622
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,600
attempt to try synthesize bring

623
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,880
together Bronze Age

624
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,880
psychology

625
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,880
with the concerns of Pastoral

626
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,080
Care Medical

627
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,159
ethics and uh and modern

628
00:28:19,159 --> 00:28:22,600
psychology I hope that was okay to

629
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,559
do

630
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:29,559
so confidence

631
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,600
Freedom

632
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,960
love

633
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,320
wholeness and meaning and

634
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,840
purpose which of

635
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,240
those is the strongest for you maybe

636
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,600
none of them are strong but which of

637
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,799
them is

638
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,799
strongest and which is the weakest maybe

639
00:28:49,799 --> 00:28:51,399
they're all strong but which is the

640
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:53,600
strongest and which is the weakest in

641
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,720
you which of the five you think is can

642
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,240
be improved you could work on

643
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,840
which is strong that can be applied to

644
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,919
the others to bring them

645
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:07,880
along

646
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,880
confidence

647
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:12,679
Freedom

648
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:17,760
love wholeness meaning and

649
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,840
purpose

650
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:28,120
so I've come to the end of what I want

651
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,320
wanted to say and um thank you for being

652
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,320
here
