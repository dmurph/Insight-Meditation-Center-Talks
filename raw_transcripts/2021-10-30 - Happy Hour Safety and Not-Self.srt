1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,720
okay so so hello dear sanga

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,400
hello and good evening good morning good afternoon so many time zones you're

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,160
joining from so lovely to see you and to be with you

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:25,039
so so for today's practice

5
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,840
i wanted to to bring in the theme of safety more

6
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:41,600
as we've talked about safety as a part of meta one of the meta wishes

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,039
and it's so important the more i practice with safety and think about it

8
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,399
and and sit with it i realize how important it is

9
00:00:52,399 --> 00:01:00,079
and now with the comment that was made about uh no self versus not self i'm also

10
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:07,119
inspired to bring that in a little bit somehow tonight weave that into our

11
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,159
meta practice um so let's see how it goes all these

12
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:20,159
inspirations that you bring into your sangha your uh with the co-creation so

13
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:28,399
so so these two themes so regarding safety

14
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:36,640
as um you know already may you be safe may you be safe from inner outer harm may i be safe it's one

15
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,159
of the meta wishes as well as wishes for happiness health

16
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:48,399
and ease taking care of oneself happily and sometimes some teachers put safety

17
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,758
at the end we start with happiness may you be happy

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,399
in the sense that oh happiness is the most important one or we're leading with that

19
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,000
and yet having practiced with the different orders and different variations

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,680
over the years it's become clear to me that there is a reason why

21
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,120
may you be safe may i be safe traditionally is the first phrase

22
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,440
because there needs to be a sense of safety we need to offer ourselves

23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,360
a sense of safety in order for us to be happy and healthy

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:36,480
and have ease safety is fundamental offering the sense of safety

25
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,120
um and there is research by john bulby i think

26
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,599
he's john his first name bulby definitely balbi's the last name um

27
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,840
regarding uh the attachment theory the balbi's attachment theory with with the young

28
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,519
children how safety is so fundamental and how

29
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,879
kids develop with their sense of safety with their

30
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:14,640
psychological development or their sense of autonomy etc etc so safety that sense of safety

31
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,680
really being fundamental for all of us and we're all grown up we you know we're kids we're

32
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:30,640
in some ways we are grown up and in some ways we are still those children who need safety so offering ourselves safety

33
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,080
so fundamentally important so

34
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,519
offering safety to our poor minds

35
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,440
so that when the mind wanders off or there is fear

36
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,720
or there is um sadness or

37
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,239
there is suffering or anything that comes up there is a sense of well okay

38
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,879
stop it now enough but offering safety for everything to be for everything to

39
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:12,319
be to be cared for with metta cared for with metta

40
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,880
with kindness with warmth with with warmth now

41
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,400
so that is the primary theme and then i felt inspired at the beginning where we

42
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,080
had this little exchange about self versus no self which is actually

43
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,280
not self because no self is a denying of

44
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,720
there being a self whereas the buddha never said there is no self there is a

45
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,320
self you are here you have an address you have a profession you have

46
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,600
a body there is a self and yet it's not self it's not personal it's not about

47
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,759
you it's not about me that's one way there's so many different

48
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,919
ways to approach and understand not self this impersonality

49
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:12,639
this ungovernability so

50
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:19,680
and one way to feel into this not self is that it's impersonal yes

51
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:27,199
it is personal i am here there is a self here this person this being whom i need to care for i need to offer

52
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:33,919
safety to and and

53
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:40,880
why why do we do this why do we cultivate meta it's not to have a big head it's

54
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:47,919
not to have a cell to self-aggrandize but it's not about it is about us and

55
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:55,680
it's also not about us it's about this being who lives and dies and suffers

56
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,039
to serve both this being and all beings

57
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,400
that are inter-connected to us so

58
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:13,120
maybe that sounds like a koan a bit like what is she talking about don't worry about it don't don't try to think i'll

59
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,960
try to bring these themes in a little bit in the guided meditation and um

60
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:25,280
for now let it go let all the words go and let's just

61
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,280
start practicing together i think i've said enough to set the frame

62
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:39,199
and whatever you need will be offered to you in the guidance so let go of thinking let go of

63
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,120
thoughts and let's just practice together let's arrive together

64
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,759
ah so arriving arriving

65
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,960
arriving in this body

66
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:15,960
jiggling letting go letting go of all the words of all the thoughts

67
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:22,639
all the thinking that has come let go not needed in this moment

68
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,599
the seeds have been

69
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,120
planted no need to attach even to the dharma

70
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,479
ah release release turning

71
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,160
turning the awareness inward

72
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,440
first land first to arrive

73
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,960
and this body feeling our feet

74
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,599

75
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,240

76
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,640

77
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:46,080
earth the earth mudra we touch the earth

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:52,000

releasing the jaw the chin

85

130
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,920

131
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,199

132
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,399

135
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,880
letting the breath be received

136
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,840
entirely of the in-breath the entirety of the outbreak

137
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,000
is like a soft

138
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:24,919
blanket

139
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,320
the breath coming in

140
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,240
permeating throughout the body

141
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,360
holding wrapping each cell

142
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,120
each cell of the body

143
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,600
offering safety offering goodwill

144
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,559

145
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,080
just letting yourself be breathed

146
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:54,960

151
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,600
and if judgments arise internally externally i can't do this i'm

152
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:46,400
distracted i'm sleepy i don't know what i'm doing

168
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,600
may i be a safe refuge may i be a refuge

169
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,520
may i serve as a refuge

170
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:24,000
or i offer myself safety or simply it's okay

171
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,799
it's okay whatever arises it's okay

172
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,240
you safe dear thought

173
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:18,559
see if offering the space of safety

174
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:27,799
especially if judgments become disarmed if you smile at them

175
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,799
not believing the judgments what if you didn't believe the judgments

176
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:11,000
the arrows that are thrown what if you didn't believe them

177
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,960
and you smiled but it happened like it happened for the

178
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:28,559
buddha the arrows would turn to flowers

179
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,200
before they land

180
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,640
it is said that night buddha's enlightenment

181
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,679
morrow through so many arrows arrows of doubt

182
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:32,480
the buddha but so much meta

183
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:41,278
the sense of safety ease that they got transformed to flowers before they landed

184
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:49,600
the doubts the slings and arrows of our minds

185
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,240
met with a smile met with safety

186
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:03,600
transformed yes yes

187
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:14,960
trusting in our buddha nature yes possible for me

188
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,440
here and now

189
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,799
this is wrapped in a blanket every cell of the body

190
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:09,120
every thought the whole body wrapped the blanket of safety

191
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:13,760
it's okay it's okay

192
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:19,880
you can relax you can rest

193
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,840
like to invite you to try something on if you wish

194
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:41,039
trying on a perspective for a split second perhaps

195
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,799
if you wish as an experiment

196
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:57,720
what if what if this universe

197
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,799
is inherently safe above and beyond our imagination

198
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:13,000
in ways we can't fathom

199
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:26,720
that it is inherently safe living is safe

200
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,840
that dying is perfectly safe

201
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:47,360
what if this offering safety it isn't about us

202
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,279
doing giving it's just is it's the way things are

203
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:58,640
through this practice we're acknowledging

204
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:07,039
acknowledging the dharma with small d the way things are

205
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,518
reminding ourselves of something we deeply know

206
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,200
our heart our buddha nature deeply knows

207
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,398
that it is safe it has always been and always will be

208
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:36,279
through this formal practice we are just reminding ourselves

209
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,200
something we once knew

210
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,480
so

211
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,280
that fear is perhaps just like what is

212
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:25,280
in the dream when you wake up from a dream oh it's perfectly safe you're not

213
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:33,079
dreaming anymore no reason

214
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,560
fear has no foothold as it is

215
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,760
safe

216
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:44,280
this impersonal both personal and impersonal self

217
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,560
is held in complete safety

218
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:39,079
and for the last moments of this practice period

219
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,560
however it was sleepy distracted

220
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,599
confused it's all okay offering safety to yourself

221
00:36:53,599 --> 00:37:01,280
for however it was no judgment just appreciation

222
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:06,839
you showed up you've planted seeds trusting

223
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:13,599
trusting that they will flower in ways you cannot fathom don't limit

224
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:22,920
yourself thank you me for showing up

225
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:34,880
just showing up and offering even a second of safety

226
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:42,560
may all beings may all beings in ways i can't imagine

227
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,320
may all beings including myself benefit from the goodness

228
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,520
of my heart goodness of my being trusting trusting

229
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,720
in the goodness may all beings be safe

230
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,838
may all beings be free including myself

231
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:30,440
thank you all thank you for your practice

232
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:43,839
so in this practice the invitation was

233
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:50,000
to explore safety this

234
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,920
basic basic tilling of the soil for love for metta

235
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,839
for care for happiness for ourselves and for others

236
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:10,240
and then inspired by the comment at the beginning of the hour by neil about not-self i also

237
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:18,559
brought the aspect of not-self and the invitation

238
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:26,400
of dimensions of safety which are not

239
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:31,599
typically what we think of and again it was an invitation for you

240
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,640
to try and perspective maybe for just a second

241
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:44,800
maybe something would open up and if it didn't no problem let it go all good

242
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,760
planting seeds so i'd like to open the floor for

243
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,680
reflections for questions for comments and the spirit of

244
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,359
sharing or the benefit of the sangha what you observed maybe something opened

245
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:11,839
up for you or something was challenging violet i say your hand is up

246
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,119
hi um i had a whole journey i don't know if i'll be able to

247
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:23,440
articulate what i'm trying to say um i have this view i've been working with

248
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,720
that pain is unsafe that there's something unsafe about pain

249
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,920
and today as i was trying to offer myself safety there was pain in my body

250
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,119
there was pain in my mind but there was safety

251
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:45,760
in my awareness so that's where the safety was found so then i was like

252
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,520
okay what's the nature of my awareness can i see what that is like so i can hold on

253
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,800
to it when there's painful stuff going on but it felt very far away from me like

254
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,920
it felt like this like bubble that was like 10 miles away from me and it

255
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:09,760
almost it didn't feel very close so that i tried to bring the awareness inside like okay what if the awareness is like

256
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:15,599
inside my body next to the pain and then almost immediately after i started working with that you said something

257
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:22,160
about like the blanket is in your cells or something i was like oh yeah that

258
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:28,720
um yeah that's i tried to like keep it in my body and then when you said

259
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,839
this idea that the universe is inherently safe then that

260
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:41,359
again that's like challenging this view that pain is unsafe because the universe is painful but then you're saying that

261
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:47,520
in some ways pain is safe so i'm still working with that but

262
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,040
that's some of what i experienced beautiful thank you violet thank you so much for

263
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,400
sharing i am so touched i love the way that

264
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,720
um for you one way you worked with it skillfully is what it came up for you with with

265
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,760
awareness the safety awareness imbued with safety how

266
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:15,839
profound and beautiful because whatever awareness is aware of is okay this is

267
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:21,839
safe oh pain awareness is aware of it oh yes it's just a beautiful way and i have

268
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:27,760
full trust that what you just described in this way of working it will

269
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:33,280
continue to open up for you i have trust for you this is this is

270
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,720
beautiful this is profound what you described thank you yo

271
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:44,440
lovely yeah

272
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:53,280
ah jerry says i found the issue of finding

273
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,280
safety in death profound yeah thank you jerry in that quote i'd

274
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,599
like to give credit to um stephen levine

275
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,720
um this is something that he has said and i

276
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,560
was quite impacted by it but that death is

277
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:23,200
completely safe i forget i might be paraphrasing but something about death is completely safe and i just love the

278
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:28,400
way that he says it so yeah thank you for that

279
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:37,119
you asked could you spell the name of the universal sound you spoke about on october 25th is nada sound n-a-d-a nada

280
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:44,400
as in nothing zero any other reflections we have a few more minutes you can raise your hand or you

281
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,880
can type in chat if you wish and if you type to me personally i will

282
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:58,480
only read the reflection not your name so it's private and if you type to the whole group then i will read your name

283
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:05,920
don i see your hand please well thank you so much the uh

284
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:13,039
it was a very interesting meditation i confess that

285
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,560
and i don't want to i feel like i'm going to be a wet blanket and but the

286
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:27,119
saying everything is safe it took away the meaning of safe

287
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:32,640
and it for me anyway it became sort of a meaningless concept to say everything is

288
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,680
safe i think like well maybe matter is never destroyed and

289
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:45,280
and sort of in that sense i'm never i'm always going to be around in some form and so i'm sort of safe but

290
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,280
anyway i uh maybe i i sort of got lost why i

291
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:59,838
don't know confess i hear that and confessing is completely safe don you are completely safe to confess

292
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:07,520
that it was it wasn't intangible it kind of it became heady i'm hearing and it's perfectly

293
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:12,560
fine you know that invocation that invitation may not be the appropriate

294
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:17,920
one and the right one for you and right now in in this way and it's perfectly

295
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:24,880
okay it's not needed and that's the invitation that i was really trying to say hey if it's not working

296
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,000
don't spin out just let it go there's plenty here already to

297
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,680
to to feast on and yet some seed has been planted instead of arguing

298
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:41,520
with yourself and saying this doesn't work let it go just don't get into the argument

299
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:48,400
please and trust that something might open up at some point into a different way of seeing an

300
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,480
insight and if not that's okay too it's all good there's so many paths to

301
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:01,440
the temple so many different paths this is not the only one so many paths

302
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,920
thank you don for that beautiful confession thank you it's safe for everything like this work this didn't

303
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:15,119
work what the heck do you mean by everything it's like what does that even mean that's okay too

00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:31,119
in small groups offering each other safety offering ourselves safety

307
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:37,359

308
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:44,079
and the invitation is to start with um 15 seconds of meta

00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:56,880
and then you can share as much or as little as you wish about your practice

more about this invocation that towards the end of everything being safe is actually

323
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:15,680
from the perspective of the enlightened from the enlightened perspective awakened perspective

324
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:22,720
there's ultimate safety and that is the invitation that i was trying to bring in

325
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:27,920
to put see for a split second that perspective

326
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:33,760
could could make sense and and maybe it can't at this point and sometimes it can drop

327
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:40,160
in something can open up when the mind is ready with these invitations with these invocations

328
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:45,520
something can open up profoundly so that was my hope um

329
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:52,160
even if it jiggled something and if it didn't don't worry about it it didn't work so

330
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,680
barbara please

331
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:08,160
i have my breakout mate if i may say um

332
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:13,839
um it talked about visiting uh

333
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:20,240
people in a family in um arizona i think it was

334
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:25,839
where he was so surprised to see people i'm just going to pause actually before

335
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:32,559
you talk about that but i just want to make sure it's okay with your partner for you to be talking about what they shared oh okay

336
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:41,480
maybe he should share it yeah if they want to maybe that's more i think yeah that's more appropriate thank you

337
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,920
pausing for a moment

338
00:49:54,319 --> 00:50:00,559
yeah if that person wants to raise their hand they're welcome to if not somebody else yeah thank you barbara i think it's a

339
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:06,319
way of offering safety to each other to speak from you know what

340
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:15,760
i trust that whatever they shared it really touched you and yet since it was in the small group oh okay we'll respect that

341
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,000
and wayne

342
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:32,559
i um

343
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,960
just want to share uh for people that maybe you read about it

344
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:45,599
or something but how in schools

345
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:53,280
are having especially public schools or having kind of been a crisis with

346
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:58,720
the lack of uh support people and then teachers and

347
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:06,480
everything and substitutes and uh i can see why

348
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:12,800
it just it saddens me that uh you know i work in in the

349
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:21,280
probably the wealthiest middle school in the district that i that i'm in and that i work in and

350
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:29,040
and i can see why safety is first because there's just so many

351
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:34,800
it's like a boiling pot where it just at any minute it could explode

352
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,900
yeah thank you wayne knowing that you're a teacher and you deal with a lot of kids um

353
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:46,400
[Music] yeah safety being very important and now also david on on youtube said it is john

354
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,760
bolby and the attachment theory so yeah safety definitely very important last

355
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:57,280
reflection i'm going to read it and then we'll close carmen says this meditation definitely

356
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:03,520
gave me a a thought to think of what makes me feel safe and what doesn't

357
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:09,119
and breathing is definitely an anchor to help me find out beautiful

358
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:14,240
breathing as an anchor to find out what makes you feel safe and what doesn't yay

359
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:19,520
what an important note to end on and and similar to what

360
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:25,280
