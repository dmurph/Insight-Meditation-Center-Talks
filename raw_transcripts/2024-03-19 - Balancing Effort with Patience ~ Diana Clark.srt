1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:10,040
good evening welcome welcome it's nice to see you all I st

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:15,840
practice together

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:24,240
so today I want to talk a little bit about balancing the amount of effort we

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,640
put into this practice of course it takes effort to go

5
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:37,200
against our usual patterns to go against entropy you know just kind of this less

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,160
and less energy and more and more chaos right of course it does anything we want

7
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:49,079
to do in our life takes a certain amount of energy and effort for the purpose of

8
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,600
this talk I'll just kind of use energy and effort

9
00:00:54,520 --> 00:01:00,199
together so if we want to kind of like bridge this idea between the theoretical

10
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:07,200
between this ideas that we have about practice and Buddhism and meditation and

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,720
what's possible bridge the gap between the ideas to the actually having that in our

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:22,640
life what's possible of course of course requires a certain amount of effort and

13
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:30,360
energy and part of the question is or well how do we do that is it it just

14
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:39,079
like do you just push non-stop because it feels like such a big thing that's being asked of us such a big

15
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:44,159
uh shift to have more and more freedom in one's life it often can feel like wow

16
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,719
I'm so far from that it the amount of energy must be an amazing amount of

17
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:55,799
energy certainly more than I have I might have that kind of a

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,399
feeling maybe I'll start by saying the only energy that's

19
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:10,319
needed is just the energy to do one small tiny next step that's it that's

20
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:17,760
all sometimes we can feel overwhelmed we have to think like wow I have this seemingly large distance to

21
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,040
travel but right always starts just with the first

22
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,200
step so I'd like to talk a little bit uh i' like to share this simile that's uh

23
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:37,239
in the suit does that talks about this a little bit and like to come at this idea

24
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:45,319
of energy and effort from a different angle so here's this simile it goes like

25
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:50,800
this suppose a gold smith would prepare a hot

26
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,680
furnace heat up a receptacle take some gold using tongs

27
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:05,239
and put it into the receptacle then from time to time the Goldsmith would blow on

28
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:12,879
it they'd sprinkle water on it and from time to time just look on as

29
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:19,560
the gold was heating as you can imagine right this is somebody who has gold and they want to

30
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:26,120
make some bracelets or jewelry out of it and so get it from a nugget they have to

31
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:33,040
purify it and make it so that they can work with it so the assimil continues if the

32
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,159
Goldsmith were to only blow on it then it is possible that the gold would just

33
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,319
burn up it would get too hot if the Goldsmith were to only

34
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:48,680
sprinkle water on it it is possible the gold would cool down and couldn't work

35
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:55,599
with it and if the Goldsmith were to just look on it is possible that the gold

36
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,879
would not reach the right consistency they wouldn't be paying attention whether it's too hot or to cold or what

37
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:08,120
was needed but if the Goldsmith would from time to time blow on it sprinkle water

38
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:15,639
on it or just look on then the good would be the gold would become purified

39
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:24,000
bright unblemished rid of imperfection so purified malleable and wieldy can work

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,039
with it and steady attained to imperturbability wasn't gonna I don't

41
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:38,479
actually know how to interpret that honestly I was going to say something steady and attain to imper Ability but the reason why that kind of

42
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:44,360
expression is in there because this is the exact same language that The Bu

43
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,599
Buddha uses to describe his mind before

44
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:56,000
Awakening purified bright unblemished rid of

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:04,199
imperfection malleable wieldy steady attained to

46
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:11,240
imperturbability this whole idea of being malleable and wieldy sometimes we think like oh okay

47
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,039
meditation or practice is about you just got to stick your mind on something and

48
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:24,800
staple it there and you'll be apply more energy and keep it there and you'll be good to go but it's not like that it's

49
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,919
you having to be malleable and wieldy that is to be able to work with whatever

50
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:37,600
life is bringing you whatever that moment is bringing you whatever is being

51
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:44,240
experienced and then I'll continue this last part of the um simile says but if

52
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:51,440
the Goldsmith were to blow on it sprinkle on it or just look on it becomes malleable and wieldy and

53
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,080
purified and then it continues and says then whatever ornament the Goldsmith

54
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:03,919
wishes to make from it whether a bracelet earrings a necklace or a garland that

55
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,080
can be achieved so this idea of what if it's

56
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:14,439
malleable then we can do what we want to

57
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:22,319
do we can make something beautiful that maybe we share with

58
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:29,759
others maybe it's jewelry for ornamentation for ourselves maybe it's for others but something that's uh has

59
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:38,360
some beauty to it and some value to it so I'd like to unpack this simile a

60
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,599
little bit because there's this the in this description there's three ways to work

61
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:50,759
with the gold you can blow on it make it hotter sprinkle water on it make it

62
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:58,400
cooler or three just look on and the first two with a making it

63
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,919
hotter or colder I feel like we can do this there's a way like okay just give me the instructions

64
00:07:04,919 --> 00:07:10,639
I can do it you know water okay should it be distilled water sparkling water should I get it purified mineralized you

65
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:17,039
know I get what temperature should it be this like something we can do our blow on it okay should I get a Bellow can I

66
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,840
just use my breath it's like you know this activity we feel like oh okay I I can do that I can do

67
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,919
that the hard part is just looking

68
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:35,599
on this is really the hard part often right so much of like our lives

69
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:42,039
I'll speak for myself my life I feel like I can fill it up with all these to-do list thing after thing after thing

70
00:07:42,039 --> 00:07:50,560
that needs to be done this NeverEnding to-do list you like a life could just be one long to-do list right if we let

71
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,639
it and then this whole idea of but from time to time just to look on it's not

72
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:04,680
saying to just exclusively do that it's not saying to just exclusively make it heater hotter put heat on it I made a

73
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:11,479
new word make it heater but this idea that to have some

74
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:17,520
of the wisdom or to learn really it's not like we know

75
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,759
automatically for the example with gold like when to put water on it or put uh

76
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,039
heat on it or when to look on chances are that I know in Ancient India that

77
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,880
somebody was would be an apprentice before they were going to be a Goldsmith they would learn from somebody and

78
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:43,560
through trial and eror so this idea of just looking

79
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:50,680
on I'd like to say another word we could use and this word is part of the parames

80
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,040
these are a collection of practices and characteristics that we often do not

81
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:03,240
when we're meditating or I should say in addition to meditating in our daily life

82
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,519
and that is this word kti and poly in

83
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:16,279
English patience patience we all know we should have

84
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:22,360
patience right this is not a news for anybody but this is kind of like a

85
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:28,000
reminder that practice isn't only about like just putting more and more energy

86
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,680
into it and it's you know in certainly in times

87
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,120
that we need to just be patient be simply looking on because if we only

88
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:47,120
apply energy then we will exhaust ourselves and get burnt out or there's a

89
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:54,680
way that we can be this really striving that can make our practice feel brittle

90
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:02,360
and very enjoyful very dry and burden some and you know humans can only do

91
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:09,920
that for so long and we will only get so far and I remember I think I've told

92
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,279
this story a few times but uh being on a Meditation Retreat I don't this had such

93
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,880
a big impact on me that uh this was a long Meditation Retreat and a having a

94
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,360
practice discussion with one of the teachers and uh she was saying to me

95
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,440
something like well you know people like you Diana that like to strive I was like

96
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,600
I don't strive what are you talking about I was like so offended and then I

97
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,200
left I thought okay I'm going to strive to make sure that she knows that I'm not a striver you know I just had this whole

98
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:49,360
idea of like I have to work harder in order to show that I'm not a striver I just couldn't see how hard I was just

99
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,639
working working working I couldn't even I just felt like I had to do more just

100
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:03,639
that was the only message I had gotten I had to do more and didn't appreciate that no it's not about just more more

101
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:11,320
more it's about being sensitive to what's needed and sometimes it's stepping back

102
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:16,639
and looking on and allowing things to unfold the way they're going to

103
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:24,040
unfold because there's this way if we feel like we always have to be putting heat on or cooling down there's a way

104
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:32,079
that maybe we like to do that because makes us feel like we can control

105
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:38,800
things but have you noticed we don't get to control as much as we think we

106
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:45,639
can and so there's this way in which sometimes maybe we want to do this because it helps us to feel anything but

107
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:53,959
helpless we're just trying to do anything we're not even sure what we're supposed to do sometimes or maybe we

108
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:59,320
have this inner critic that raises up and is telling us

109
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:06,440
us yeah whatever you're doing it's not good enough or whatever you're doing it's inadequate in fact you're

110
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:14,079
inadequate right this inner critic can show up in our thoughts and then kind of

111
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:20,920
as a in response we can just apply more and more effort and to be

112
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:28,320
patient is a way that's kind of admitting like okay I'm not really needed right here

113
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,279
right now I don't have to jump in and try to fix everything instead to be

114
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:41,079
patient is to recognize okay this maybe isn't what I want maybe

115
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:46,480
it's uncomfortable maybe it's uh not what I'm looking

116
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,600
for but maybe uh it doesn't have to be fixed

117
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,120
right this moment maybe I can look

118
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:05,079
on maybe it's too hot and it can cool by itself without my sprinkling water on

119
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,720
it so there's this way in which if we just overexert

120
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:19,279
ourselves we maybe it makes us feel better that we feel like we're doing something covering up a sense of any

121
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,079
sense of inadequacy or

122
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:33,160
helplessness but there's this maybe the opposite side too she was like oh okay well sometimes we can collapse and feel

123
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:38,839
like okay well there's nothing I can do and uh maybe there's this way in

124
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:45,480
which we just kind of like disengage and you know maybe with it like well the

125
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:50,839
hell with that I'm not going to do it and just go somewhere else instead of looking just simply

126
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:56,199
looking on there a way of disconnecting or being disparaging or

127
00:13:56,199 --> 00:14:02,160
dismissive of whatever it is and then going off and doing something

128
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:09,920
else or maybe there's this way that also if we are don't take the time to maybe

129
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:17,279
simply look on we may be ex uh not using energy or

130
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,399
effort in a wise way maybe we're making mistakes or doing things that aren't

131
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:30,600
helpful just because we're just busily doing and the Buddha has a simile for

132
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:36,639
this also which um I really appreciate here's

133
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:43,040
a he spokes about this and as the Wagoner so the person who's you know has

134
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,120
a cart with horses and cart and is directing them as the Wagoner who left

135
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:56,320
the highway a road with an even surface and entered upon the rugged

136
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:04,600
path Broods mournfully with a broken axle so the wagoners is upset that they

137
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,000
have a broken axle because they thought oh let me take a shortcut I'm going to

138
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:16,800
go off of the highway here and I'm going to go you know Overland and and then their exle breaks and then you're like

139
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,959
filled with regret or feel like oh why did I do that part of the reason why I

140
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:27,440
like this uh simly I think it's very illustrative but I mean this like

141
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,440
literally happens well I don't go off the highway but there's sometimes like you see like the traffic oh I better

142
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,160
take this exit first and then right it ends up being much slower

143
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:44,440
right because the roads are just as busy or even busier or something like this

144
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:50,079
this way like oh no I I'm I'm I'm don't want to be patient and get through this traffic

145
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:55,600
so how many of you have done that right many of us

146
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:03,279
right but for us usually we don't end up with a broken axle or something like that it just takes longer but in the

147
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,360
simile here the Buddha is pointing to you know maybe there are things that's

148
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,639
taking the shortcut leaving the this what what is the expression

149
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:20,079
here the even surface of course concrete or pavement

150
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:26,160
that just didn't exist back in Ancient India just like didn't exist so in order

151
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,680
for it to be an even surface meant that there was lots of of people that had been down that path

152
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,959
before and so that can be helpful to note in the same way that The Apprentice

153
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,079
is learns from the Goldsmith often we learn from what other people have done

154
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:49,839
before I'm not saying that we have to do Lemmings and just without thinking follow other people but neither should

155
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:56,519
we all also think that there has to be a shortcut or sometimes these days we use

156
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:01,880
this word hack there has to be a hack you know like oh okay I don't need to put that much effort or take that much

157
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:09,760
time and there's got to be a shortcut sometimes these shortcuts don't work but because we have this

158
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,839
impatience we want to take

159
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,640
them so if we don't maybe I'll just say this

160
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:27,280
so what is needed is this balance between effort energy plain energy and

161
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,320
some patience and this is part of practice it's like

162
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,760
learning when to do what when is it best

163
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:44,240
to apply more heat when is it best to cool down how do you know when things

164
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:51,400
are too hot and when is it time to just look

165
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,039
on I want to talk a little bit about patience here we can think about it as

166
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:06,360
as uh nonreactivity as this uh not raging or blaming blaming

167
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:12,039
ourselves blaming others or not despairing or making wild stories when

168
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:17,400
we encounter something that's uncomfortable or

169
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:24,280
difficult so often the Mind wants to just start blaming oursel or others or

170
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:30,000
wants to it shouldn't be this way as soon as I get home I'm going to write a letter to

171
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:35,039
the highway calr and this road should be

172
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:41,400
shorter wherever I want to go or there should be less traffic or whatever it is right these things that we want to do we

173
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,919
start blaming or you know something thinking that it's something has to be

174
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:54,120
done but patience is this way in which we like hold these difficulties in a

175
00:18:54,120 --> 00:19:02,000
spacious way yep this is what's happening right

176
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,840
now and it's difficult but it doesn't have to be fixed

177
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,280
precisely this moment doesn't mean it needs to be there

178
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:21,880
forever it doesn't mean this is the best thing but all it means is kind of acknowledging it's what's here it's

179
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,720
actually what's happening and can we be okay for that

180
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:34,400
moment there's this way if we can like hold it with this little bit more spaciousness

181
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:41,039
then the mind can feel a little bit more peaceful some of the agitation or the restlessness has the time to maybe

182
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:46,799
settle down a little bit and with that settling down can become more and more

183
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:54,400
wisdom like the wisdom can bubble up and we can see things in a clearer way or

184
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,440
maybe even see like a bigger picture which can help point the way of maybe

185
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:06,480
what's to be done next as opposed to just reacting immediately when the thing is difficulty

186
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,440
so patience when we encounter things that are

187
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:20,760
uncomfortable patience uh in our relationships with others can we be in a difficult

188
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:27,559
situation with someone instead of lashing out with anger saying things that we might regret is there a way that

189
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:34,320
we can maintain our composure doesn't mean that we're happy

190
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:42,799
it doesn't mean that we approve of what's been happening what's happening it just means that we're not lashing out

191
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:48,679
we're not collapsing we're not bolting but to maintain some composure

192
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:54,400
composure and and be there for what's going to

193
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:01,080
unfold next take a deep breath and be present as best you

194
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,600
can just think how your life would unfold if those times when which you had

195
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:13,400
conversations and they were difficult but you were able to kind of like stay grounded and

196
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:21,039
spacious even though it was not what you wanted to hear how many times have we said things

197
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:27,720
that we have regret I know I do say things like oh yeah I've regret about

198
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:33,480
that and ouch regret is one of those painful painful

199
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,919
things patience and meditation right so much where we were sitting and then you

200
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:45,360
just bring the Mind back you get lost in thought planning the grocery list as soon as I get home I got to remember to

201
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,200
do this or that or you know whatever it is and then oh yeah that's right I'm supposed to be meditating just again and

202
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,520
again and again maybe there's this feeling like when is that Bell going to

203
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,960
ring here's a here's a little hint that I learned never look at your watch it

204
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:10,120
doesn't matter what it says it will never be good news because if it's 30 seconds before

205
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,200
you're like oh I shouldn't have looked I could have waited and if it's uh 45

206
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:20,520
minutes before the bell's going to ring you're like oh my gosh when is it gonna ring I can't believe it so this is

207
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:27,520
Diana's little hint I I stopped ever looking at the watch or the clock and that made me feel

208
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,880
better so patience as maybe this non-reactivity whatever it finds us we

209
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,200
what kind of this difficulties find our way and maybe

210
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:47,039
maybe a different way to say non-reactivity is just holding things in a spacious way that is not getting tight and

211
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:53,360
insisting things being different but instead like okay this is how it is and

212
00:22:53,360 --> 00:23:01,159
being able to maintain composure or you know not lose it not lose composure but

213
00:23:01,159 --> 00:23:07,039
also patience is also perseverance it's kind of like maybe this little bit of

214
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:13,200
maybe forbearance or something like this like sticking with things even when they

215
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,240
take time to show results not

216
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:25,799
uh leaving right away or maybe I heard this expression like patience is like

217
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:32,440
giving up a deadline that something has to happen but it's not giving up it's

218
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:38,919
just giving up the deadline that has to happen right then so still hanging in there and the

219
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:47,120
same way that we plant seeds and it takes time to Blossom or flower or seed or grow

220
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,840
whatever they're going to do so many things are like that and while they're underground of course we

221
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:58,880
don't see what the seeds are doing so often we don't really know how

222
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:05,039
things are I I keep on using this expression unfolding unfolding within ourselves

223
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:12,159
unfolding within others and folding just in our environment so this idea of patience is

224
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:19,240
more like focusing on maybe consistency or perseverance or hanging in

225
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:26,159
there so what I think it's also important when we're talking about patience to talk about well what

226
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:33,600
patience isn't because it's not this numbing

227
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,600
resignation like H okay you know kind of like

228
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:46,880
disconnecting and being um annoyed like you know tapping the foot

229
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:54,480
type of you know thing whether you're literally or figuratively doing that so it's not like disconnecting from

230
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:03,120
what's Happening and patience is not like gritting your teeth or clenching your hands holding on for dear life or

231
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:10,200
when is this going to be over that's more like waiting with

232
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:17,760
aversion that's not patience either or maybe patience also isn't like

233
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,399
being impervious to the pressure to change or do something

234
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:32,000
different it's not like being completely uh um not imp I use this word impervious

235
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:37,240
it's being impenetrable or uh just not paying attention to what's happening and

236
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,799
said nope I'm going to just do this no we could say that's more like

237
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:49,760
stubbornness that's not really patience or maybe that's uh just resistance to

238
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:56,840
change this kind of nope I'm just going to sit here and

239
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:03,880
wait and PTI patience is also it's not a paralysis or it's not a weakness wow

240
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:10,480
right patience is a strength of course it

241
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,360
is and so often we have this kind of our society or kind of like promotes this

242
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,720
sense of go go go do do do and the busier you are the more important you must

243
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:28,600
be so it's easier to be busier in doing but it's not so easy to be patient I

244
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:34,440
think we all know this so also patience doesn't mean that

245
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,760
we become a dant that others can just tread upon however they

246
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:47,840
wish but instead by this holding things spaciously and still being connected to

247
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:56,039
them not losing our composure but staying there we can start to see

248
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:03,559
oh this is what's really happening here this is taking longer because of

249
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:10,720
that and maybe it's helpful for me to just push a little bit over here or

250
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,159
maybe it's just helpful for me to get out of the way but whatever it

251
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:24,880
is patience kind of helps creates the conditions in which the best wisdom that we have can arise and then we can do

252
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:32,960
what's best to be done that's so different than just passively being a doormat or that's so different

253
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:39,360
than just uh being stuck and staying there or something like this instead of

254
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:49,679
being a doormat maybe the part of the wisdom would say like nope actually I need to Clearly say no to this person to

255
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,880
this whatever it is that might be so maybe the next step is after a little

256
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:02,240
bit of patience is to see okay it's time to do something here andless something is to say

257
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:12,760
no maybe I'll say something a few words about okay well how can we cultivate

258
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:19,640
patience because we can't always make things go faster we can't necessarily

259
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,799
make things be pleasant all the time right if we could have done it we would

260
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:30,120
have done that already certainly

261
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:38,120
but there's this way that we can we can adjust how we respond or

262
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:46,039
react to whatever life is bringing us and Sylvia borain she calls patience

263
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:53,000
this unglamorous courage I kind of like this unglamorous

264
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:59,159
courage courage sounds I don't know LOF

265
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:05,399
we all want to be courageous but unglamorous courage maybe

266
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:10,720
patience is this way to stay connected not

267
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,279
disengage and not feel like we have to fix it at that

268
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:22,440
moment and this way we can think about um patience

269
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:30,159
requires maybe two things some un Pleasant circumstance

270
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:37,880
right you don't need patience if everything is perfect and lovely and a little bit of effort this is the effort

271
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:45,000
to hang in there not run away not disconnect not just jump into busyness

272
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,919
if unless we have a sense of what some wisdom about what needs to be

273
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:58,559
done so we don't need to cultivate uh opportunities to

274
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:06,320
cultivate patience life will bring those to us that they just naturally will but in the

275
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:11,760
way that Sylvia Borstein is saying that patience is unglamorous courage

276
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:18,240
something that patience and courage share is that you become more courageous

277
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,440
by being courageous you become more

278
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:30,880
patient by being patient when there 's this uh one

279
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:36,519
line from uh this poet Katie

280
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:42,320
Lang she's also a singer some of you know might know her and this uh one line

281
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:50,919
that I just love it says I've worried is it so that lessons of patience are

282
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:56,240
learned slow is it so that lessons of patience

283
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:02,840
are learned slow yes it is

284
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:09,440
so so I'll just say a few words here so this won't be a surprise to

285
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:16,159
anybody well what can we support this uh how can we hurry up this patience

286
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,279
learning for patience one is just bringing some mindfulness to our

287
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:29,320
experience one is to notice when we're impatient sometimes we don't even notice

288
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:35,559
notice when we're standing there with our hands on our foot or you know our foot is doing this or we're kind of like

289
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:41,880
I don't know doing something fidgeting often like oh okay this could be an

290
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:48,720
opportunity to practice patience let take a deep breath and like

291
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,159
it's like this right now that could be an opportunity to

292
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,760
practice patience but takes some mindfulness to recognize so often where there's these little bursts of

293
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:06,880
impatience that we don't even notice and often we'll notice by how it feels in the body like this restlessness

294
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,360
like we want to get up and run or we want to honk the horn if we're in the

295
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,840
car or something like this the second thing

296
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,000
is love and kindness practice this way in

297
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:29,320
which having some warm-heartedness some spaciousness

298
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:37,120
in our hearts and Minds supports a sense of well-being of course it does and we all

299
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,679
know if we have more of a sense of well-being then we can be more patient if we are feeling really

300
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:50,480
agitated of course we're more impatient so part of this practice is to

301
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,440
cultivate it does cultivate a sense of happiness and well-being and ease

302
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,880
mindfulness can do this loveing kindness practice can do this and also if you

303
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:07,559
have a concentration practice that also can kind of like be a way in which that

304
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:13,559
uh enriches one's life or nourishes one's inner life in a way which it feels

305
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:20,679
like a little more space a little more steady a little bit more warmth so that impatience

306
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:26,200
doesn't arise as readily in so many

307
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:32,559
situations it's a mindful practice and love and kindness practi is a way to support

308
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:39,080
patience and then we need patience as a balance to the effort that we're

309
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:44,440
doing patients both in times of um just being willing to

310
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:50,200
wait takes time for changes to be made for us to undo patterns of a

311
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:56,159
lifetime patterns of whatever patterns it might be patterns of impatience or

312
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:03,360
patterns of trying to fix everything immediately or flying off the handle or whatever it might

313
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,960
be and also patience as a way of just kind of like holding difficulties

314
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:17,320
spaciously not insisting that that moment they be different but instead to be recognized

315
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:24,158
it's like this and then babies in aside I'll say we might say well how is patience

316
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:32,200
related to equinity which also kind of like holds things spaciously I would say patience is more

317
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:39,280
when you are really really wishing that it were different but you're not you're kind of like holding yourself in

318
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:44,638
check kindly whereas equinity is you're not necessarily wishing things were

319
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:52,079
different you recognize that oh yeah this is uncomfortable but it's uh not as much of

320
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:57,480
a problem whereas patience maybe the uncomfortableness is more of a problem

321
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:05,640
but but um you're holding the problem this more spaciously but it's maybe

322
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:10,760
patient there's more discomfort than with equinity I would say if you wanted

323
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:16,920
to think about those so patience is the counterbalance

324
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:24,160
to energy and effort so thank you for your attention

325
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:30,440
and if you like I'll I'll open it up for some questions and comments if you have

326
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,400
something you'd like to add so thank

327
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,240
you yes the question was did Katie Lang sing

328
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:59,599
that song constant craving yes and she was actually a Buddhist practitioner so yeah yeah yeah so it's not a not a

329
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:07,880
uh what's the word I'm looking there's a reason why she uses these lines right in her some of her songs thank you yes I

330
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:14,240
was struck by your comment about not wanting to fix things

331
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,839
immediately or can it wait do you have any comments about how you find that

332
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:28,200
balance between being patient and that point at which you do take action

333
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:35,560
or jump into the phay so to speak yeah this is such a um great question part of

334
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:42,280
the way that we can find it is maybe the uh I'm going I'm pointing to my body because the way it feels in the body

335
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:49,960
there's a difference between agitation and that fuels uh activity and like some

336
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:55,760
like oh this is what needs to be done in an activity so it's to maybe like feel

337
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,359
in is it is it being fueled by agitation or restlessness like oh something has to

338
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:10,160
be different here or is it like some clarity nope this is what needs to be done is that helpful yes thank

339
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:25,520
you so there are times when I need to be patient and I realize that the problem

340
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:31,520
isn't the situation I have to be patient about the problem is an abundance of

341
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:38,079
energy because I got triggered and so how do I deal with this

342
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,359
abundance of energy can you say a little bit more when when you mean triggered you mean

343
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:52,760
like that your that's your emotions are up or what does that mean yeah emotions are up um I don't like what's going on

344
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:58,839
and I'm going to do something about it and the energy do something about it is

345
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:08,520
right there for me and I can't put it to one side and so your question is what how do

346
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:14,839
how do I put that energy aside I see do you need to maybe there's maybe

347
00:38:14,839 --> 00:38:21,640
there's a time like you have a sense of okay I know I none of this could be done now but maybe um take some notes or here

348
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:29,040
was like here's some ideas or maybe to look into this or maybe talk to that person or do that or maybe there's the

349
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:36,720
energy could be used in a way that can create the conditions in which something could be done at a time when it is

350
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,800
appropriate no I'm impatient with that because I want to put it aside because I

351
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:48,079
want to put the energy aside but I get what you're saying so you there's this agitation and

352
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,480
it's uncomfortable yeah yeah oh

353
00:38:54,119 --> 00:39:00,119
busted yeah so maybe here's something else that I'll say this is not some it's

354
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:05,240
like so uh I don't know it's simple right and some people feel like no

355
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:11,000
that's too simple but I'll just offer this feel your feet on the ground and just keep on coming back to your feeling

356
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:18,079
your feet on the ground that does two things one it kind of brings the Mind back to the body which even if you're

357
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,240
walking is moving slower than the what the mind is doing and two being

358
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:28,520
connected like being kind of grounded and connected is just something that's

359
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:34,480
really helpful so that we don't fly off the handle so to speak so this is some

360
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,880
and sometimes like when we're really agitated we don't have access to our greatest wisdom we don't have access

361
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:47,680
to much really so feeling one's feet on the ground just that pressure on the

362
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:55,200
bottom of the foot can be enormously helpful it's surprisingly helpful thank

363
00:39:56,319 --> 00:40:04,640
you thank you for your talk um brought up many things for me um

364
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:10,839
the one I'm thinking of um was prominently is the story about the uh can you can you hold this just a little

365
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:17,079
bit closer thank you the student that was asking the master if I work really hard how long will it take me to be

366
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:23,280
enlightened and he said 10 years and he the student said well what if I work do

367
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:30,119
double time and work really extra hard Master said 20 years yes exactly it's a

368
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:36,240
great story that's that's what uh eroses me with that and also the Serenity

369
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:43,680
Prayer um about you know having that wisdom to know recognize the things you can change

370
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:50,880
and the things you can't and finding that that space yeah yeah thank you

371
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:58,040
thank you that's great if you work extra extra hard it

372
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:03,359
takes longer I think that's such a great story

373
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:07,680
because uh right kind of sums up so many

374
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:24,280
things just calls to mind as saying that you're trying to dance faster than the music oh I haven't heard this very nice

375
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,240
yeah

376
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:37,838
okay okay well thank you all and I wish you all a lovely rest of the

377
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:46,119
