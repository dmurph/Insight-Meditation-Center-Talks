1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:08,440
so warm greetings everyone and today we're going to do the second

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:14,400
day on a series this week that picks up on the introduction of to mindfulness

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,039
Gil has been doing and it's different elements of

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,760
mindfulness as we talked about in my talk yesterday in the Q&A actually afterwards

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,040
we're going to be speaking about another layer of response or

6
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,079
reaction on top of Vena and that is the wanting or the not

7
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:45,719
wanting so with that very brief introduction and

8
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:53,160
a warm good morning greetings back to everyone invite you to settle into a

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,199
meditation posture something

10
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:04,960
that exemplifies alertness and

11
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,520
relaxation maybe starting with a couple of longer solar

12
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,280
breaths intentional

13
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,119
breaths and allowing yourself so

14
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:36,079
soften relax on the

15
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,119
exhale and then allowing the breathing to return to normal whatever that is for

16
00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:01,840
you this day this time

17
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:12,319
and again scanning through your body just a gentle good morning or good

18
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,480
day or good evening

19
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,159
scan noticing any places of tension or

20
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,760
relaxation Pleasant or unpleasant

21
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,439
just acknowledging them letting them be there just as they

22
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:51,599
are and then setting the intention to have mindful awareness

23
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,760
mindfulness at the Forefront of attention for these moments of

24
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,760
meditation

25
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:34,120
allowing the attention to set on breathing more Body

26
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:43,159
Sensations hearing whatever feels like the most natural anchor for your attention

27
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:54,680
today resting dedicating the

28
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,680
attention to the embodied experience of the moment

29
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,520
noticing the alignment of your posture whether you're

30
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:31,600
sitting standing or lying down

31
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,319
and encouraging your body to be

32
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,479
balanced and then noticing

33
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:12,080
too the internal posture of the heart and

34
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:20,880
mind is it balanced or is there a leaning towards

35
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:28,479
or away movement wanting or not

36
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
wanting

37
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,000
from time to time throughout this

38
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:54,680
meditation the invitation is to check in if there's a leaning towards or a

39
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,479
away the movement for or against

40
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,290
and for now [Music]

41
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:17,720
settling softening into the breath the body the

42
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
moment

43
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:14,240
in any Pleasant feelings associated with breathing or just

44
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,410
[Music]

45
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:26,039
being noticing any unpleasant

46
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:38,399
Sensations and allowing other one allowing the vast territory in

47
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,880
between noticing any leaning

48
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,320
towards or

49
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
away

50
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,960
from time to time refreshing the

51
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:43,240
awareness and perhaps checking in what the overall

52
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:52,200
mood or attitude infusing this moment might

53
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:02,960
be allow knowing what is in

54
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
mindfulness

55
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:01,760
and in these last few minutes of our meditation

56
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,360
together opening the heart and the

57
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:18,720
mind to the fullness of whatever is here everything that wants to flow

58
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:33,080
through noticing bowing

59
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
resting

60
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:16,080
and casting your mind back on these moments of meditation

61
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:24,960
together Gathering up any goodness mindful awareness patience

62
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,440
ease and savoring that any good

63
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:41,120
qualities and being with as kindly as possible anything

64
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,210
difficult that may have [Music]

65
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:56,519
Arisen and with that kindness turning your internal gaze

66
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:00,760
outward to the others in your

67
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,120
life everyone your life

68
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:16,880
touches may they may others be

peaceful and free and may our practice here

71

together be a cause and condition for that greater happiness peace and freedom

72
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,159
to

73
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
arise

74
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,960
thank you for your

75
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
practice

76
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:23,080
so good morning everyone good morning delighted to be back with you

77
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:28,640
today and delighted to see the bows and the greetings in the chat

78
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,159
it's really

79
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:41,000
lovely special welcome to those of you who slipped in a little bit late

80
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:48,480
and happy you could join us so today is the second day of a

81
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,760
five-part series building on the introduction to mindfulness that Gil has been unfolding over the last number of

82
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:01,159
weeks and these are other skills capacities

83
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:06,399
elements of mindfulness that are really helpful to bring to the

84
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,440
practice so today is building on yesterday yesterday was a mindfulness of

85
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:19,320
the very basic attribution of feeling tone or Vena Pleasant unpleasant neutral

86
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:27,559
that happens in practice and in life it's really basic today is kind of the next layer

87
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:33,880
our minds tend to add onto that experience which is a wanting or a not

88
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,919
wanting a leaning towards or

89
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:48,519
away a grasping or a pushing away this is um known as attitude of

90
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:54,320
mind or mind State generally and this wanting or not

91
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:02,840
wanting can otherwise be known as greed or aversion greed or aversion and it can

92
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:10,399
range from the mildest wish to extraordinary

93
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:16,720
desire or the mildest tiniest pulse of irritation all the way up through

94
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:25,360
hostility and hatred so there's quite a range here the most way I'm going to talk about it as wanting or not

95
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:32,480
wanting the um these attitudes of mind can really distort

96
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,559
experience like for example desire can be like those Rose tinted glasses

97
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:43,159
everything looks beautiful everything looks

98
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:49,600
nice desirable or a dyed bowl of water is the

99
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,919
ancient kind of similar in the Buddhist discourses whatever that water reflects

100
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:02,279
takes on the cast of the Dy so it influences it tints

101
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:07,639
everything for aversion hatred anger hatred tinted

102
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:15,600
anger hostility the ancient discourses talk about oiling water a roiling boil

103
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,639
and you can kind of get a sense in your body of what that feels like another dramatic simil that's used is that

104
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:27,760
hatred or hostility is like picking up a hot coal to throw at someone else

105
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:34,000
well who gets hurt first so this kind of reactivity can be

106
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:43,320
very um obvious and like a pulse like I'm describing with the hot coal or it can be pervasive and kind of

107
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:50,120
hidden or unconscious it can be very strong or

108
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:58,960
extraordinarily subtle in any case it tends to be instinctive thoughts can build on it all

109
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:05,559
by itself these attitudes emotion emotional reactivity that I'm talking

110
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:11,720
about aren't the sort of movement of emotion that Gil was talking about last week but

111
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:19,000
more default moods atmospheres ways of being

112
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:26,358
that can shape the very way we take in experience when pervasive unconscious

113
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:31,878
attitudes are there it's more like the waves under a boat the soundtrack to a

114
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:40,118
movie a filter a tint over the image the general atmosphere of the

115
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,480
sky and in general these kinds of attitudes mind States can be broadly

116
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:53,599
helpful or unhelpful today I'm talking about the unhelpful ones I will cover helpful ones

117
00:34:53,599 --> 00:35:01,320
more tomorrow but unhel ones within the context of mindfulness

118
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:09,079
meditation can be kind of like an old rippled pane of glass or a Hall of

119
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:15,320
Mirrors distorts whatever is seen and it can feed this recursive process of

120
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:22,839
building more and more thinking or delusion on top of it it it can even distort the process of

121
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:28,320
mindfulness itself which is not so helpful

122
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:37,400
so a simple example here I used to work at pain clinics for many years teaching meditation and um many practitioners

123
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:44,240
have discovered that being mindful with unseen aversion to for example knee pain

124
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:49,720
actually cultivates more aversion and it cultivates more pain more perception of

125
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,800
pain this is a well documented

126
00:35:55,480 --> 00:36:01,920
phenomenon being being mindful with the attitude of greed can also increase

127
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,520
greed greed for more experience Greed for more of that pleasure another

128
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,800
state in either case sooner or later often

129
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:20,359
sooner this kind of wanting this leaning in or pushing against increases

130
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:26,079
suffering and it I mean part of it is that it's

131
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:31,560
inherent the greed itself has the function of

132
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:37,920
wanting it also has the function of narrowing The Gaze of

133
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,119
tension of kind of a leaning outwards that isn't so pleasant in of itself

134
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:49,000
regardless of how pleasant the object of attention seems

135
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,960
aversion has the function of wanting to separate right or even destroy strong

136
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:03,160
aversion and it also it also has the function of creating more

137
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:12,480
tension creating more stress so what to do a mindfulness of

138
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,119
wanting or not wanting greed or aversion inputs something different into the

139
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:25,680
system so these are subtle here it's mindfulness with the aversion or greed or mindfulness of it and it flips it

140
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,839
from being a distortion filter to something that's

141
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:39,000
seen and this just like noticing feeling tone offers space it offers a

142
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:46,079
choice a choice it's possible When approaching

143
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:54,440
this these kinds of States greed aversion wanting not wanting as objects of meditation we can notice them as

144
00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:01,040
events as processes in the mind mind and heart which rather than allowing them to

145
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:07,920
have Authority or masquerade is truth or reality then they're seen they're no

146
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:16,640
longer in control and that's good news it's the difference between

147
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:24,119
meditating with a default state or an attitude versus noticing and the noticing can come with

148
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:31,160
a bit of clarity mindfulness and perhaps even a bit of kindness or

149
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:37,280
equinity and this is kind of the magic of mindful awareness it transforms

150
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:43,160
what's seen instead of believing in it feeding

151
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:50,560
it pumping it noticing without spinning out allows greed and aversion to become

152
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:57,760
a basis for wisdom for self-awareness they become food for

153
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,040
discernment rather than fuel for

154
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:09,560
delusion so it can be super helpful to cultivate

155
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:16,800
curiosity interest with these attitudes and one way of getting interested is to notice

156
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,160
cause and effect notice the effect on your body

157
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:27,319
the effect on your mind

158
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:34,200
with mindfulness our systems begin to recalibrate towards ease Simplicity and

159
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:42,000
a way away from stress or tension and it's possible to take respit

160
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:48,079
in the presence of mindful awareness itself to begin to notice whatever

161
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,800
attitudes arise with interest patience even

162
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:00,440
Joy over time this can transform unhelpful attitudes of wanting and not

163
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:07,760
wanting or worse and cultivate helpful ones especially a stronger

164
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:16,039
mindfulness especially a stronger Equanimity compassion even stronger

165
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:24,160
wisdom so to recap these attitudes attitudes of

166
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:30,839
wanting or not wanting greed or aversion are just a microc away a nanc away from

167
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:39,760
Pleasant and unpleasant there is a space in between and there's also space to

168
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,319
incorporate them into mindfulness afterwards and this

169
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:52,680
itself can help us utilize them as food for wisdom

170
00:40:52,680 --> 00:41:00,960
and Awakening rather than continuing to be hooked by these

171
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,240
states that's my little wrap today and as we did yesterday rather than talk at

172
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:15,160
you talk at you talk at you I want to offer a moment or two for questions in the chat we have a lag so I'm going to

173
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:21,960
mute and have a sip of tea and wait for the questions to come in but thank you very much for your practice it's a real

174
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:28,240
gift it's a gift to the world

175
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:20,280
oh a question about the guidance where the guidance for this kind of um

176
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:26,960
practice comes from Sherry I can't think of a single one discourse off the top of

177
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:33,559
my head it comes from many many discourses but it's included in the

178
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:39,720
um in the Sati panas to the four foundations of

179
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:47,160
[Music] mindfulness so as a Buddhist and chronic

180
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:54,319
pain practitioner how much do you of your Buddhism do you bring to treating patients I don't do that work anymore so

181
00:42:54,319 --> 00:43:03,079
much but it is is very much about the compassion the kindness the

182
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:12,280
acceptance okay and then Andrea I'm not sure I understand your question I did

183
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:18,040
give an example of knee pain getting worse if we're aversive to it it gets

184
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:24,000
much worse the alternative is to back away and notice

185
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,720
the attitude towards the pain rather than the pain itself and this principle

186
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:37,280
works with all kinds of things in meditation if there's an attitude toward

187
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:43,000
something that's making wor making it worse you can always take a step back

188
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:51,880
and notice your relationship to that emotion that attitude that allows for um a little bit

189
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:57,480
of space so it's taking a step back taking a step back

190
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:04,480
okay I'm having trouble keeping up with all the chats here we got one minute left we'll see what I can

191
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:07,839
do

192
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:16,200
so there two excellent questions Julie yours is going to take longer but just

193
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:22,599
to Simply say that mindfulness absolutely is a mirror reflecting back

194
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:29,319
what is however greed or aversion distort the mirror the ripples in the

195
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:34,559
mirror or like a funhouse mirror and

196
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:40,000
equinity wisdom causes the mirror to be completely clear whereas delusion might

197
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,330
have you might have a Mist over the mirror or fog or another Distortion and then

198
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:52,510
[Music] um re-explaining mindfulness if

199
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:58,559
[Music] beneficial there's a difference between leaning into a

200
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:07,119
verion and being mindful of a verion so noticing the noticing of the

201
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:14,040
aversion actually starts to transform the aversion into information into

202
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:19,280
information so that's the best I can do with a few seconds left I hope that's

203
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:26,040
helpful and then finally um a couple of people were

204
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:33,440
asking about Vena neutral Vena so um neutral Vena is a shorthand

205
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:39,960
for neither Pleasant nor unpleasant feeling tone and that really is the vast

206
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:46,000
majority of our experience the vast majority of it is neither Pleasant nor unpleasant it's just kind of filtered

207
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:53,839
out or ignored there is an association sometimes not always with

208
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:58,880
neither Pleasant nor unpleasant and with

209
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,680
delusion so I hope that's helpful the topic today

210
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:10,440
isn't really vad anymore so I'll try to address this in a blog post later in a couple

211
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:15,839
weeks thank you all very much for your practice thank you for your questions

212
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:22,838
