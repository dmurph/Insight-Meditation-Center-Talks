00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:10,200
good hello everyone welcome and welcome

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:19,119
to this the end of this week on the pleasure aspect of

3
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:25,359
samadi and one of the things to consider when you're interested in

4
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,759
somebody is that as you meditate uh

5
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:38,000
to there's some there's value in taking in

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,760
absorbing whatever healthy sense of pleasure is

7
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:53,239
present and to become wise over time what forms of pleasure support uh the settling the

8
00:00:53,239 --> 00:01:01,640
calming support uh our mind and body feeling a sense of stability

9
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,720
we become in the we're in the present moment awareness is in the present

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:17,360
moment in a stable way often our attention

11
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:25,400
is agitated or flighty quick to disappear wander off

12
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,119
with our thoughts our preoccupations

13
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:37,119
sometimes even if we are in the present moment it's flighty or agitated because of

14
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,159
anxiety and we might be very much in the present moment hyped up in the present

15
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:50,200
moment where every sound is a of concern and and um and the stability of the mind

16
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,560
is lost in the constant searching out am I

17
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:03,399
okay or it might be that we're not so stable because we have expectations or Ambitions around

18
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:08,840
meditation and we're riding every moment kind of breathlessly to see you

19
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,519
know you know how to get further so to find the joys the

20
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:21,000
pleasures which support a calming a

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,480
stabilizing a quieting of the mind and

22
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,360
body and um so often in beginning of a meditation I

23
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,720
emphasize relaxing the Buddha's way of doing the

24
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,560
same maybe with somewhat the same effect is to emphasize a

25
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,080
calming a calming of the body calming of the mind and the calming the difference is

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,200
that calming maybe goes a little deeper than

27
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:05,040
relaxing it's also calming might be more more of a

28
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,799
pervasive of influence on our system than relaxing

29
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:22,599
which might be just relaxing the shoulders or the belly particular muscles but to calm the system to calm

30
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:29,120
the nervous system and then to see if there's any

31
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,319
pleasure in that calmness any pleasure in the

32
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:42,760
relaxing any pleasure in being here and now any pleasure in being connected to

33
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:49,280
the body any pleasure in how we're

34
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,959
aware in a sense the deepening Som

35
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,439
is a wonderful joining together of the body and

36
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:10,480
mind so the mind

37
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:18,959
is in Harmony and in connection and in cooperation with the body and vice

38
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,520
versa and so how we're aware is very important for

39
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:31,720
that sometimes I think of my body as being shy or

40
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:44,039
and it appreciates when the Mind approaches it with a relaxed gentle

41
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:48,840
awareness un forceful undemanding

42
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:56,680
unjudged and sometimes I think of my mind as um an

43
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,160
overactive engine that really appreciates when the

44
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,880
body receives it so the Mind attention can rest with the

45
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:14,600
body so in this way mind and body come into Harmony and that feels Pleasant

46
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:21,440
that feels good might even be a sense of Joy so

47
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:30,160
to gently close your eyes with the eyes closed

48
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:39,360
feel your posture from the inside out and feel it the way that you feel

49
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:47,600
it feeling is kind of the mind and the the feeling that the

50
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:55,199
sensations we have is kind of like the body so to feel the body with

51
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,840
a soft mind

52
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,520
gentle mind and to adjust the

53
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:17,360
body to be a body and posture conducive to

54
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,680
attention and

55
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:34,599
calm and in this coming into harmony of the Mind and

56
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:42,240
Body the Mind directs the body to take a few long slow deep

57
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:50,120
breaths the body provides great more Sensations more

58
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,919
connection for the mind to be aware

59
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:06,599
of and the place where Sensations [Music] occur is the same place as we're

60
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:11,879
sensing and that's the meeting place of the mind and

61
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:24,160
body and let that meeting be calm maybe

62
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,479
gentle light

63
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:37,520
and as you exhale to let there be a calming of the

64
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,560
body maybe a pervasive sense of like a

65
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:50,879
wave of calm traveling through the

66
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:57,520
body softening the muscles the tense the tensing the

67
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,520
bracing

68
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,720
letting the breathing return to

69
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:26,520
normal and taking some time to feel your body almost like you're checking in with

70
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,080
your body with a wide right angle

71
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:40,959
lens and just very relaxedly take in absorb

72
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,560
in the sensations of the body throughout the

73
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,800
body without searching or trying to do it

74
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:59,440
right whatever way the body reveals itself a wide angle lens for your body

75
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,440
for

76
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,000
as you exhale an ordinary

77
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:46,160
exhale let there be a calming wave being carried by the

78
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,320
exhale a calming wave through the mind

79
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:05,160
a settling of the

80
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:31,760
Mind perhaps are calming on the edges of the

81
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,880
body

82
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:57,320
softening maybe a calming on the edges of your heart the edges of the feelings

83
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,040
emotions you're feeling

84
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,720
a softening on the

85
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,639
edges and then feeling

86
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:31,399
sensing whatever is Pleasant that feels like it's part of this

87
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,120
meditation

88
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:45,839
practice The Simple Pleasures of settling sensing being

89
00:11:47,079 --> 00:11:52,760
present the pleasure of being more embodied

90
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:14,399
maybe there's a very subtle hum or glow or vibrations through your

91
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,279
body somewhere in your body that

92
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:31,160
feels like a settling like a like a pleasant abiding Here and Now

93
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,519
and then within

94
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:51,120
that becoming aware of the breathing as if breathing is a gentle or

95
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,040
maybe not so gentle movement within a wider

96
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,120
field atmosphere of

97
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
calm pleasantness

98
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:47,079
and being aware of the body breathing in a light way gentle

99
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:56,519
way but also in a committed way devoted

100
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:01,040
way without any strain

101
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:13,040
the Mind meets breathing softly

102
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:21,440
gently and the body receives the mind so it can rest in the body be at

103
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:29,160
ease know it's okay to soften and relax

104
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:34,920
into the present moment

105
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:04,639
breathing and for whatever pleasure there is however

106
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,480

smile supported by this yes to being with the breathing

being aware of the diffuse

131
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,960
broad feeling of being here in your

132
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:04,158
body Maybe the way that Cal or

133
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,880
pleasure might not be localized to particular

134
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:19,640
place but more spread quietly throughout the

135
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,360
body easy to

136
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,360
overlook but which is support

137
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,000
for steadying the Mind Here and

138
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,360
Now with a breathing at the

139
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
middle

140
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320

for for

142
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,840
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

143
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:08,200
to take a few moments to feel whatever way you

144
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,240
can a pervasive pervasive sense of the

145
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,679
body that the body has three dimensions

146
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,679
it's has width and

147
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:44,919
depth into which there can be a glowing feeling

148
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,200
of calm or subtleness

149
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:58,000
or quiet even in the middle of noise and at

150
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,120
your

151
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:10,440
ation to feel the body

152
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,600
widely almost as if there is

153
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:23,320
a a glow of attention that goes beyond the body

154
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:39,360
and may it be that your glow of care glow of Love or kindness

155
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,559
Goodwill travels like a

156
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:50,158
Radiance like a gentle light or a soft

157
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:57,240
warmth with no specific Focus but except to gently

158
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:02,559
touch all things as it glows and flows outward

159
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:08,200
into the world touching the

160
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:14,919
world with kindness with kind

161
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:23,000
attention the warmth of kindness and imagine that light of

162
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:29,080
kindness the glow the warmth spreads far and wide

163
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:35,919
carrying with it good will for all

164
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:42,240
beings may all beings be

165
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:47,919
happy may all beings be

166
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,480
safe may all beings be

167
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:59,440
peaceful may all beings be free

168
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:11,640
and may this these wishes spread outwards in all the ways

169
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:18,399
possible so that other people know they're not alone to know

170
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,720
that there are people who care and are kind

171
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:33,840
let us be forces of kindness in this

172
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,440

[Music]

174
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,440
thank you

175
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:41,760
so hello and welcome to this

176
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:48,760
fifth Friday the Friday the fifth day of looking at the pleasure of

177
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:53,919
somebody that to enter into

178
00:31:53,919 --> 00:32:00,559
somebody and really is deeply supported by being attuned to

179
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:06,080
pleasure the pleasure that comes with meditation not the pleasure that we can

180
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,120
get by having really wonderfully soft

181
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:18,320
clothes to meditate in or the most perfect sensuous cushion to sit

182
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,320
on but rather the kind of pleasure that begins to radiate or flow from the

183
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:30,000
inside out and as we start being sensitive and

184
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,760
attuned to the pleasure of the simple very simple pleasure of maybe being

185
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:42,000
calmer and it might be a relative or relative in that relative in that we're

186
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:49,519
little bit calmer than we relief pleasure and the hope that it

187
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:55,320
provides it might be that we feel a little bit more at ease in ourselves at

188
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:02,039
ease with what is difficult and that sense of little bit more ease or ease is

189
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:07,919
Pleasant it might be that um that uh there's a calm that begins spreading

190
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,880
through the body or a feeling of being stable uh after being agitated feeling

191
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:19,360
like we're not going anywhere we're settling down more and more into

192
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,760
ourselves there could be that um there begins to be some Joy or

193
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:33,159
Delight there could be some um feeling of ease in the breathing I

194
00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:38,760
think one of the great experiences that really was uh very meaningful for me

195
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,960
when I was quite young and beginning to meditate was discovered um a breath that

196
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,320
breathing that was free that was had its own ease it breathing was breathing

197
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:56,120
itself and sitting quietly in meditation or having tea or something and just

198
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:03,000
feeling this complete freedom in the breath to breathe itself before that I would never have

199
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,839
imagined I thought my breathing was relatively free that I wasn't involved in it but there were so many ways in

200
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:14,599
which my mental and emotional life was somehow uh involved with the breathing

201
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:23,079
and have all that settled down enough so that the physical breathing was just breathing itself felt like such a great

202
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:29,000
pleasure so there's many kinds of Pleasures that can come with meditation

203
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:36,398
and uh and some of them really feel like they're healthy like they're beneficial that they're supportive because they

204
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:42,520
feel wholesome they feel like they're good for us to feel and so we

205
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:48,599
don't uh tighten up or we don't bore down on it we don't try to Pump It Up we

206
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:56,280
don't try to uh be selective about it to be like okay this is the one this is the pleasure to really focus on and build up

207
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:02,760
but rather we kind of trust it we absorb it we let it register in our system and

208
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,800
uh in particular I find very useful is the kind of very subtle pleasure or

209
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:15,320
maybe joy that can feel like it's pervasive through the body and um becoming more and more

210
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:22,520
embodied more and more present in our whole body is phenomenally useful for

211
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:28,119
subat uh when people try to get concentrated only as a mental exercise

212
00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:34,680
they they often they can get certain kind of concentration and certain kind of satisfaction from

213
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:40,440
it but in the bigger picture it's not so useful because it's not part of a

214
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:46,160
movement towards becoming more peaceful more settled more free and there's

215
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,359
something about opening up and settling into the full body and feeling the

216
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:57,839
goodness of that and the pleasure of that there's pleasure in breathing so

217
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:05,000
there's all kinds of pleasures and so each person is going to find their own but there's something about the mind

218
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,200
that it's more mind is more interested in being present if it's enjoying it if

219
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,359
there's pleasure and uh and certainly we can

220
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:22,520
develop a lot of mindfulness strong mindfulness being in the present moment with things that are unpleasant and

221
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:28,400
that's valuable when we have to but um the um

222
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,880
and the um um but it just makes it easier for and

223
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:41,079
nicer for the mind to want to be there to become partners with the body partners with the meditation so that the

224
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:46,800
Mind begins to gather the Mind begins being really interested yes this is good

225
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:56,200
this is where I want to be some people might complain that this is hedonistic and um it's uh it can be if

226
00:36:56,200 --> 00:37:03,240
that that's the purpose is to only really just um uh Savor or indulge in

227
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:10,280
the pleasures of meditation but it it's not meant to be that it's meant to be able to dip into

228
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:18,000
drop into uh a state of health state of well-being state of Harmony that uh the

229
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:23,440
kind of pleasure that comes when uh we're at ease in a deep peaceful way

230
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:31,960
when we're not in conflict and not agitated not chasing things are running away from things and not judging and and

231
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:39,119
uh making commentary about everything happening but the whole psychophysical system begins kind of come into kind of

232
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,200
very healthy place I think of somadi as

233
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:52,520
health and uh and it feels good it feels Pleasant to pleasure to it and uh and it

234
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:59,480
leading Us in the direction of becoming good people leading Us in the direction to become kind more compassionate more

235
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:07,000
caring more intelligent more attuned people attuned to the world attuned to ourselves attuned to others somat

236
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:15,240
provides a tremendous amount of benefit for how we're going to walk into the world if we um uh if we kind of shift

237
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:20,640
the whole way in our stance or attitude in Buddhism Samar is the means

238
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,760
for Liberation to become free and uh to become free of suffering

239
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:32,040
is one of the great purposes goals of a human life and

240
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:37,960
it's a great goal for supporting other people great goal of compassion and so

241
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:45,680
to know and discover for oneself how thoroughly and fully we can become free of suffering uh makes it possible for us

242
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:52,240
to be attuned or attentive to how that's a possibility for other people and so

243
00:38:52,240 --> 00:39:00,040
we're not uh overly influenced by their behavior or their quirkiness of people

244
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:05,560
but we see them their different eye we see them with this deep love and care

245
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:12,160
knowing what's possible in them and knowing that there is goodness and beauty within them that can be grown and

246
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:18,880
and become full we feel kind of uh in kind of uh

247
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:27,160
kinship with people a deep kinship with Samar because the strong lines of Separation that we

248
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:34,960
have uh become softer so it's not hedonistic but it is

249
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,560
going along supporting and with with pleasure so this is a piece of the

250
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:47,319
puzzle that's needed to be understood to really begin finding a way to settle in

251
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:54,480
and getting concentrated in the samade type way and um so we'll keep building as we

252
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,560
go along here and hopefully this uh week on Pleasure will support us as we go

253
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,400
further at some point that pleasure becomes uh a pervasive feeling of joy

254
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,359
and pervasive feeling a very deep peaceful happiness so the pleasure

255
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:18,520
shifts and changes as we go along and for now the next step in this

256
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:25,160
which we'll talk about next week is uh is H kind of the prep Preparatory final

257
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:31,880
prepar preparation for dipping into uh uh what most clearly is called Samar in

258
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,440
in U in the teachings of the Buddha to really get absorbed into this and for

259
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:44,680
that there's something that's sometimes called access concentration and uh and so this

260
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:50,480
pleasure supports a kind of attention kind of awareness that uh now begins to

261
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:56,720
become uh in the groove of the present moment so that'll be the the topic for

262
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:03,839
next week so thank you very much and as uh week

263
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:11,839
comes to the end um one more time here for the our YouTube Community I want to

264
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:17,040
uh evoke or remind that we have this fundraising drive that uh I'm so

265
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:24,800
grateful for all of you who've made donations it's quite inspiring that so many people come together and uh we've

266
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:31,680
raised you know maybe close to I don't know 2third or something of uh

267
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:39,119
what we're hoping to raise we're trying to match what we raised three years ago when we did a fundraising drive for for

268
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:48,040
um save the children then and maybe even surpass it and um and so uh

269
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:55,359
um I think for given the challenges of our world uh these days it's uh particularly

270
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:01,440
significant to support these kinds of nonprofits that are trying to do good in the world and I think everyone benefits

271
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,960
that the benefit spreads widely through the world uh for this kind of uh

272
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:13,599
offering this support for to save the children so um thank you and you can
