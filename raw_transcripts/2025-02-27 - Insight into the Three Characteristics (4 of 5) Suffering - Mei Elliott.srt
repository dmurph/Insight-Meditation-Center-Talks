1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:06,960
welcome to all of you it's great to be here again my name is May Elliot and

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,040
today we'll continue our study of the three characteristics with a focus on

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:18,039
the second Char characteristic uh Dua or uh

4
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:23,519
unsatisfactoriness suffering so yesterday we looked through the lens of

5
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,599
anicha impermanence and when observing

6
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:34,440
impermanence um it's pretty clear that we're observing change right the arising

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:42,120
and passing of phenomena but when we consider insight into Dua um we might think that the

8
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,120
practice is just to sit around and uh think about the ways that our life

9
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:55,480
sucks which is obviously not the case that's not what we're doing with this practice so I just want to be overt

10
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:02,000
about the fact that contemplating Dua is not about uh dwelling in or uh

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,280
ruminating on our difficulties um and it's also not to cement a view or a

12
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,960
belief that life is suffering rather um we're learning to

13
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,759
clearly see the source of suffering which is craving we know this from the

14
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:25,920
second Noble Truth so the source of suffering is craving that's what we're interested in seeing when We crave and

15
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,240
claim we suffer um and of course the other side of the coin of craving is

16
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:38,200
aversion so when craving or aversion are present when wanting or not wanting are present we

17
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:45,079
suffer so during the meditation today uh we'll be noticing if and when uh craving

18
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:51,439
or aversion are present or we'll be noticing the absence of craving or

19
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:58,479
aversion so if and when we identify desire wanting not wanting uh during the

20
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:05,119
practice today we'll meet it by using a practice called raft raft is an acronym

21
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:10,520
developed by T Weiser frequently taught by Gil um R A

22
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:20,160
ft so the r stands for recognize a for allow or accept f for feel and T for

23
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,599
te's um so the r recognize we're just really clearly recognizing when desire

24
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:32,640
or aversion are present we allow um a for allow we don't try to get rid

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:40,000
of them this would just be more aversion sneaking in through the back door so we're we're um letting them be present

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,480
and then F we feel it in the body uh desire and aversion they often include

27
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,040
uh like tension or contraction so we're learning what it what it feels like and

28
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:59,080
where um really getting to know it when we can get to know um these manifestations really really well we're

29
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:05,360
much less to uh less likely to be um consumed by them to be hijacked by

30
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,080
them and then lastly tease though this is the last letter in the acronym

31
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:16,159
actually kind of doing this one first um so we're teasing apart the object of

32
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,200
Desire say the desire for a cup of coffee so the coffee would be the object

33
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,319
from the desire itself so rather than just uh fixating on getting the cup of

34
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:34,080
coffee as the typical human does um we look a little closer and

35
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,360
notice if there's some desire in relationship to the coffee uh so we're

36
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,319
we're teasing apart the object from the desire just so we can see that there's two things that are present um we're

37
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:51,720
usually so absorbed in getting what we want that all we see is the object all we see is what we're trying to get not

38
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:59,360
the wanting in relationship to it so um so in This Acronym um we'll put that

39
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,720
that is really going to need to be this teasing apart is going to need to be upfront um so that we can really clearly

40
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:12,120
see oh there's desire here and te that teasing apart will allow us to R

41
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:18,040
recognize once we've re recognized it we can a allow and F

42
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:24,320
feel uh so this is this is one way that we can deliberately explore Dua in our

43
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,840
own experience um but as I've I said yesterday uh there are many many ways to

44
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:38,360
explore the Insight themes you don't need to go directly looking for them even um uh but it can help to be

45
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:46,320
intentional about it from time to time to learn how to develop the capacity to see desire and aversion clearly um

46
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,840
really helpful so um so for our meditation today uh as with yesterday uh

47
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:59,960
we'll start by by cultivating the supportive conditions for insight

48
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:06,600
um so uh we'll um you know we'll connect with any contentment that might be

49
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:15,080
available um we'll let allow the mind to settle a little bit and then we'll shift to exploring uh wanting and not wanting

50
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:21,800
U more directly so that's what you can expect today and so let's let's start our

51
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,479
meditation go ahead and connect with a posture that supports you to

52
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:35,400
be um both uh awake alert and

53
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:46,720
relaxed maybe taking a deep breath to support you in landing

54
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:07,319
maybe starting by sensing what's here for you physically has the

55
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:15,800
body how's the heart how is the

56
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,800
mind just a brief check-in at a

57
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,360
glance whatever you find um can you me it with

58
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:38,080
contentment even if there's a 99% discontent

59
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:44,159
dissatisfaction maybe there can be uh 1%

60
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:56,039
okayness maybe just being content uh that it's possible to know things as

61
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:03,479
they are the beauty of knowing things as they are what a gift

62
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:40,759
and when you're ready connecting with the breath or with your primary

63
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,759
anchor and inviting the mind to settle and relax

64
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,479
if it's supportive for you to connect with vaka and

65
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:15,199
vichara as we talked about on the second morning of this series you might try

66
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:24,080
that making contact with the moment a breath starts and then sustaining that

67
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:31,080
contact like a bird flapping its wings and gliding

68
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,360
that little bit of effort to touch in to connect with the felt sense of breathing

69
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,200
you're using an object besides the breath ITA and vichara can be practiced

70
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:33,120
there as well whatever the object this connecting and

71
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:41,120
sustaining contact aim and

72
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
sustain

73
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

74
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

75
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

76
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

77
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

78
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

79
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

80
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
e e

81
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:51,600
V taka connecting connecting with the

82
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,240
breath and vcha is sustaining contact with the

83
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:05,399
breath making contact and sustaining contact

84
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:51,600
as you practice with the breath at

85
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,680
times it's likely that thoughts and emotions will

86
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:05,600
arise and when you notice thinking rather than jerking the Mind

87
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,199
back to the breath take a moment to recognize where

88
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,759
you were what landscape were you in when you

89
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:22,360
were thinking were you planning maybe

90
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:29,880
planning dinner or your next vacation were you regretting

91
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:33,800
or replaying a

92
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:44,240
memory are you fantasizing or rehearsing an upcoming

93
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,839
conversation or maybe

94
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:57,839
fixing so if you notice that thinking is occurring rather than get lost in the

95
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,360
story line uh notice thinking almost as if you were

96
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:10,319
an onlooker not in the thought but observing the

97
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
thought

98
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,840
e e

99
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:59,000
as you practice you might notice recurring themes recurring thoughts that seem to

100
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,799
keep coming

101
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:16,320
back often these thoughts are fueled by unseen desire and

102
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:31,480
aversion so if you notice thinking is Aur ing during your

103
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:38,440
meditation see if you can recognize if there's any wanting or not wanting in

104
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:43,080
relationship to the content of the

105
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:56,200
thought if you're regretting there may be aversion [Music]

106
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:02,919
present if you're fantasizing there may be desire

107
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:15,840
present if you're trying to fix or change something maybe

108
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:27,120
both we're just opening to the field of the mind to notice our attitude to

109
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:34,799
notice any want wanting or not wanting in relationship to our experience

110
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:12,120
as you do this as you check the mind for desire or

111
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:19,400
aversion uh you might notice an absence of desire and aversion which is

112
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,840
also valuable to notice

113
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,039
so continuing with the breath and just checking the Mind here

114
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:51,919
and there see if there's desire or aversion maybe in relationship to the

115
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:57,799
thinking mind or maybe in relationship to some

116
00:21:57,799 --> 00:22:01,559
other aspect effect of

117
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
experience e

118
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:29,640
if you notice desire or aversion wanting or not wanting

119
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,080
can you recognize

120
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,200
it nearly seeing

121
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:47,559
it can you allow it not pushing it

122
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,960
away not getting rid of

123
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,840
it you feel it in the

124
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:12,679
body what's it feel like to Crave to cling to

125
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:20,480
want or to push away experience to reject experience

126
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:39,360
maybe there's contraction or tightness some aspect of discomfort

127
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,399
if there's an absence of wanting or not

128
00:25:07,399 --> 00:25:16,080
wanting you might feel what that's like what's that like in the body

129
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:41,400
maybe the body is relaxed or soft

130
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,479
[Music]

131
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:03,880
open p in your own time now practicing with the breath and when

132
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,840
it feels right turning to check the

133
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,360
attitude checking for wanting or not

134
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
wanting

135
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

136
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

137
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

138
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,120
e e

139
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,559
welcome welcome back again my name is May

140
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:55,760
Elliot and today we'll be continuing our study of the three

141
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,880
characteristics uh with our Focus today on Dua or

142
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,919
suffering sometimes translated as unsatisfactoriness uh

143
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:13,039
stress dissatisfaction so Dua covers the full

144
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:18,519
range of difficulty uh it can be the slight

145
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:24,399
discontent of uh wearing a sweater that's too tight uh the pain of a

146
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:32,720
sprained ankle you know to the Heartbreak of losing loved one so this full spectrum of of

147
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,240
difficulty uh so yesterday we talked about how all conditioned things are

148
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:47,640
impermanent the characteristic of Dua is sometimes phrased all conditioned things are

149
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:54,240
unsatisfactory so this isn't saying that all condition things that all things are

150
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:02,279
unpleasant now we know that many things are Pleasant um rather it's saying uh

151
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:08,760
that they can't lead to Lasting H happiness um to say all condition things

152
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:14,360
are unsatisfactory is pointing to the fact that they can't lead to the forever

153
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:19,440
fulfillment that we're seeking that we're investing into

154
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,200
them uh so having just talked about insight into impermanence

155
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,760
yesterday uh we can see the relationship ship between that insight and this one

156
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:40,360
uh impermanence and unsatisfactoriness um and here's how um because all things are of the

157
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:47,480
nature to change of the nature to pass away uh that means that all objects and

158
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:55,519
experiences are unstable refuges as in any object or experience

159
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:01,559
that we might try to get or have it can't provide deep lasting

160
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:07,159
satisfaction um so this is really important information um because it it

161
00:32:07,159 --> 00:32:14,760
guides us on our path to happiness which is really what the Buddhist teaching is all about you know it helps us discern

162
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:21,799
where happiness is and where it isn't if all objects and experiences pass away um

163
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:27,559
why would we try so hard to get them why crave and cling to them you know if we

164
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:34,799
know um uh that it's not going to work that in the long run it's not going to

165
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:42,279
work and that's not to say that um you know we don't uh you know we don't turn

166
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:48,840
on the heat in our house when it's below freezing or um that we don't share love

167
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:54,159
with those that we care about or you know there's uh uh ways to skillfully

168
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:59,440
engage with objects and experiences um but what we find is that the clinging to

169
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:05,679
them is not so useful um so uh one of the key insights

170
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,760
into suffering um as we we talked about before the meditation uh is seeing that

171
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:19,159
the source of suffering is craving um so typically um as the Buddha

172
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:27,399
would say an untrained worldling um thinks that they're suffering because of their circumstances so um I'm suffering

173
00:33:27,399 --> 00:33:33,360
because my socks are too itchy or because I I

174
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,559
feel insecure after that conversation with my partner or I'm suffering because

175
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:44,440
the food is too salty or uh because my coworker is incompetent or I'm

176
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:51,120
incompetent um or you know I'd be happy if I only had a better uh relationship

177
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:59,159
or job or house or family so if we could just arrange our circumstances is then

178
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:05,320
we wouldn't experience Dua then we wouldn't experience suffering but what we don't tend to

179
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:10,599
realize is that the Dua isn't from the objects or

180
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:15,800
experiences it's from the craving and aversion itself it's not because of the

181
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:23,279
socks or the crummy job uh our suffering comes from the wanting and not

182
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:30,398
wanting so it was um it was striking from me to see this uh for the first

183
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:36,599
time in relationship to physical pain and I have a a disability so I live

184
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:42,878
with um some Associated chronic pain conditions and uh this was particularly

185
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:48,280
pronounced during my time training as a monk at uh tasahara Zen Center in the

186
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:53,599
Venta Wilderness so it's very rustic conditions there uh it especially cold

187
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,680
in the winter and get up in the morning maybe 3:45 a.m.

188
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:04,680
um sit meditation till noon work a few hours and then go back to the Zeno um so

189
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:10,599
it was one of the during one of these long days of practice um in the first

190
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:16,200
thing in the morning I had a few sips of tea and uh and it set off a multi-hour

191
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:24,520
spell of uh this chronic pain a digestive pain and so for much of the morning uh

192
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:32,320
this the physical Sensations I had were uh quite unpleasant um so uh there's maybe

193
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:38,000
contraction tightness pressure um but the Mind wasn't agitated

194
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,560
it was it was relaxed around the object like it was it was fine it was just unpleasant unpleasant

195
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:50,079
Sensations um but a few hours into the sitting a

196
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,560
thought arose and the thought was something like wow I can't believe this

197
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:04,359
pain is still happening and with that thought there was this kind this sense like it

198
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:10,760
shouldn't be this way I felt kind of incredulous that uh that much pain would

199
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:16,640
come from such a minor stimulus and that seeing you know it shouldn't be this way

200
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:24,119
you can probably hear in it it was just like dripping with aversion there was so much not wanting with that and that

201
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:31,880
feeling it just cut me like a knife and sudden I was consumed in Dua was filled

202
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:37,240
uh with suffering so here's what's

203
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:43,160
interesting nothing changed with the level of pain but I went from very

204
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:50,560
peaceful and at ease uh into the throws of suffering uh in an instant so what

205
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:57,000
happened there what happened um so this was such a

206
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,200
noteworthy the Insight um because it showed me where the suffering

207
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:09,640
was it wasn't the sense object that caused the Dua as in it wasn't the stomach pain it wasn't the

208
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:14,680
unpleasantness of the pain I was able to be with that without suffering right

209
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:21,200
with you know an easeful mind but rather it was the craving for it to be otherwise it was the aversion of it

210
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:28,280
shouldn't be this way so I was just fine until that feeling came along

211
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:33,839
aan suito says uh first we think we need to get out of the

212
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:40,160
predicament of this predicament then we realize we are the

213
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,480
predicament so the predicament it wasn't the pain uh it wasn't the chronic

214
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:53,920
illness it was my own mind the predicament was my own

215
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:01,440
aversion so how are you relating to your own

216
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,839
Dua in any given moment uh most of us aren't even aware that we're suffering

217
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:15,119
when we're suffering so our first step is just knowing recognizing like oh this is suffering and can you be aware um

218
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:22,079
that suffering or stress is happening when it is and if so that's actually great it's great to be able to know

219
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:28,640
that's happening um most of us don't feel excited when we recognize suffering is present but that's actually a really

220
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,880
um important thing to see because if duka is present that means craving or

221
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:40,520
aversion are present um so you can see that if youve teased apart that object or circumstance

222
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:47,720
from your own reactivity you're seeing the difference between the circumstance say uh fixating on how your roommate

223
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:54,560
doesn't take out the trash and you're teasing that apart from your own aversion that's the t is the T the te in

224
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:01,040
raft that I talked about before the meditation um so we're able to see the difference

225
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:07,440
between the object the thing that we don't want and the the aversion itself

226
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:15,359
so our once we see oh yeah aversion is here um then we can practice um R A

227
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:22,000
those first letters of raft that I talked about earlier we can you know clearly recognize

228
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,119
it we can allow it to be present not judging oursel for it uh not going to

229
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:34,359
war with our aversion or our wanting and then we can f feel it in the

230
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:40,000
body feel it in the heart and mind so for me the often there's a lot of

231
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:47,400
tightness in the chest or the belly you know point of contraction somewhere in the body maybe in the throat uh in the

232
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:53,480
forehead the temples the jaw um so see what you recognize or see

233
00:39:53,480 --> 00:40:00,560
what you feel um what we often find is is that desire and aversion are actually

234
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,720
uncomfortable um they're kind of painful in a sense and when we can see this

235
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:10,920
really clearly and we can see this with mindfulness it starts to train the mind

236
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:16,520
heart that like ouch desire and aversion are painful like I don't want to keep

237
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:23,000
creating this this um aspect of the mind this quality of mind and it begins that

238
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,040
wisdom that clear seeing begins to let go of the pattern the pattern of

239
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:37,000
constantly craving constantly rejecting experience so when we um when we look at

240
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:44,880
our craving and we see we see that it's painful um and this is uh in part

241
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:54,240
because at its core um craving is an expression of um of discontent um of a a

242
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,720
lack of contentment so we could say you know desire it wears a thousand different

243
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:07,040
costumes you know it masquerades in all of these different ways in our life so that we barely recognize it um but

244
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:13,800
within all of the different facades um it always carries the secret message

245
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:20,000
this moment isn't quite right this moment is not

246
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,880
enough and this is a message of dis dissatisfaction this is you know that

247
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:34,640
the the core of duka you know like this isn't right this just isn't right um but what happens is when

248
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:41,880
we see the source of suffering in the mind that it's in the mind and not in all of the external objects There's an

249
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:50,000
opportunity for transformation um because we can train the mind so as some people say uh the

250
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,880
Dharma may not solve our problems um but it has the capacity to dissolve our

251
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:02,640
problems s right it can dissolve our problems when we can let go of our

252
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,559
craving and our

253
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:15,400
resistance so over time uh as we encounter Dua again and again and again

254
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:23,400
um we begin to see um that it's not bad news uh that it's actually the seed of

255
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:29,839
our Awakening it's it's the foundation of the pth so one of the Buddha's teachings is

256
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:35,480
called liberative dependent arising and it consists of 12 mental

257
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:41,319
states that uh that condition the mind for enlightenment um for complete freedom

258
00:42:41,319 --> 00:42:47,680
from suffering and the reason I mention it is because of the first step and this

259
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:52,880
is what I find that so extraordinary about this particular teaching the very

260
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,440
first link the very first necessary condition in this list of 12 that ends

261
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:04,880
in Liberation is suffering suffering suffering is step

262
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:10,119
one on the path to Liberation so if we don't

263
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:15,599
suffer we don't see a reason to practice and we need to practice in

264
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:22,920
order to wake up Tibetan Monks actually have a a

265
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:28,240
prayer that they chant where they're they're actually praying for suffering

266
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:36,200
so they can have something to practice with so often we think that something's going wrong when we suffer uh but what

267
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:45,599
would it be like to meet suffering um saying oh wonderful like I'm right on

268
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:53,359
track can we meet our suffering with that sort of like oh great I have something to practice with so this is

269
00:43:53,359 --> 00:44:00,359
this is our task in life in our practice in transforming uh obstacles into the way

270
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:06,160
you allowing our suffering to inspire our practice so let your suffering fuel

271
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:14,440
your practice uh as the Insight teacher Joseph Goldstein says don't waste your

272
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:21,319
suffering don't waste your suffering so remember uh as we explore

273
00:44:21,319 --> 00:44:29,040
insight into Dua uh remember that the role of the three characteristics fundamentally is to teach us to let go

274
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:34,640
to let go of craving and aversion wanting and not

275
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:41,160
wanting the Thai Forest Master aan cha he used to say

276
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:48,040
um if you let go a little you will find a little peace if you let go a lot you

277
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:55,880
will find a lot of Peace if you let go absolutely you will find absolute peace

278
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:03,280
and tranquility now elsewhere in aach Cha's teaching he

279
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,720
also said 70 to 80% of spiritual Life Is

280
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,920
Knowing we're cing and not being able to let

281
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:20,480
go so that's why Insight is really helpful because it cultivates the wisdom

282
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:30,000
needed to let go of what we can't release on our own so often and we see um we see we're

283
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,920
clinging and we can't let go you know the heart just won't let go um we know that's what needs to happen and it's not

284
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:42,000
happening so it's it's insight into the three characteristics that provides the

285
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:49,200
wisdom to let go of what we can't let go on our own that's 70 to 80% aan cha

286
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:55,319
talks about and when uh wisdom lets go of cleaning we let go of suffering so

287
00:45:55,319 --> 00:46:01,319
this is where the path takes us uh to complete peace complete

288
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:07,640
Liberation so today as you practice don't waste your suffering

289
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:14,000
allow it to inspire you to be mindful uh you know recognize your suffering see if

290
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:19,160
craving and aversion are present and if so allow it to be there uh feel it in

291
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:24,880
the body there's uh there's a sacred visitor that comes to teach all of us

292
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,240
this visitor is Dua and and our job is to get to know our

293
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:37,559
guest so may you notice your Dua with Clarity and kindness thank you very much

294
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:41,280
have a lovely day
