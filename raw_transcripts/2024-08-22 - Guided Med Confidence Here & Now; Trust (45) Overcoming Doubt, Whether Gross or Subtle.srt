134
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:37,519
time so the theme we've been exploring

135
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:43,039
together the teachings uh this week have been on sadada

136
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:51,279
sadada the word in poly translated as trust or

137
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:58,799
confidence and a quick recap of the past few days today is day four so day one we

138
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:06,639
started with how sense of trust and confidence is needed in practice before

139
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:11,960
you begin uh there has to be some perhaps borrowed trust oh yeah this

140
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:18,240
seems to be working for others borrowed trust that later becomes verified trust

141
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,720
verified confidence after you see how it actually impacts your your life and and

142
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:30,760
um your the way that you are yourself so the importance of trust for beginning

143
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:35,960
and for continuing practice and then day two we talked about the importance of

144
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:43,440
confidence trust in the triple Jewel uh Buddha Dharma that um yeah it is

145
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,000
possible someone woke up it's possible for me I can do this too trust in

146
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,399
yourself and Trust in the teachings that the teachings are available uh there are

147
00:33:54,399 --> 00:34:03,080
recipes there have been people have tried them from for for centuries and uh trust in the support of

148
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:12,480
the S God that I'm not doing this alone I have support so trust in those three and um

149
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,599
yesterday uh day three we talked about

150
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:26,919
cultivating um um uh sadada uh through um uh through practice

151
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:34,240
and reflection how the more we practice um actually our confidence in

152
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:42,280
the practice grows and how by reflecting and uh both during practice uh and also

153
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:50,158
after practice uh short time frames long time frames we can uh water the seeds of

154
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,398
Sada of confidence in our practice it's through practice itself as well as we

155
00:34:55,399 --> 00:35:03,480
also talked about ethical conduct with which was very important is important otherwise our confidence gets eroded in

156
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:12,040
ourselves uh in our capacity to to wake up um if we keep intoxicating ourselves

157
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:19,440
and and or stealing lying just the sense of trust gets eroded um so not

158
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:25,320
helpful so today building on all of that

159
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:33,599
uh we um I'd like to uh offer for your consideration the role of sadada uh

160
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:43,000
trust confidence in overcoming doubt overcoming

161
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:51,079
doubt so doubt is one of the five hindrances or the five naras the

162
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:59,200
five um veils and doubt um

163
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:06,520
uh in ply Vicki kit Vicki kit doubt can show up in different ways

164
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:12,880
doubt can show up as oh I can't do this everybody's got this I can't do this I

165
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,760
have a monkey mind nobody else does I can't do this or it can show up in the

166
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:24,440
teachings like yeah I'm not quite sure about these teachings or or

167
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:31,560
um um or um they're not for me or or um

168
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:37,760
can show up in the sa in the community I don't know about this community I don't know and also can show up in so many

169
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,880
different ways the teachers they don't know what they're talking about anyway doubt can show up in so many different

170
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:50,319
ways and S that trust is a way to support ourselves through periods of doubt

171
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:55,680
now I like to offer a more subtle way to

172
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,880
see doubt which we usually don't so this is we're going to go a little bit off

173
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,680
but you can see how it can relate

174
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:13,720
so consider that subtle subtle doubt can

175
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:18,800
also show up um in the ways that our

176
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,599
mind moves in um minute by minute moment by

177
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:29,520
moment so if we're sitting and practicing for example

178
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:37,319
and practicing say mindfulness as we did just before and then the subtle doubt

179
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:42,440
can show up as oh it's more juicy it's more fun it's more rewarding it's more

180
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:48,440
onward leading for me to to think about my plans for this afternoon so the Mind

181
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:55,760
goes there instead of instead of trusting that this is the place this is the most onward leading

182
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,280
rewarding uh supportive place for my mind to be right here right now with

183
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:08,680
mindfulness of the body mindfulness of the breath mindfulness of impermanence so there is this subtle pulling away not

184
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:14,359
quite trusting that this is it this is the most nourishing place to

185
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:20,200
be and practitioners report that sometimes

186
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:25,400
this Insight arises for them when they are really steeped in their practice

187
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:31,480
this Insight this uh thought arises oh this is the most nourishing place for me

188
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,720
to be right here right now not the thoughts not the distractions not the

189
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:43,400
this not the that not the desires and thinking wow this is the and it comes up

190
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,680
as a sense of trust this is the this is the most nourishing this is the most

191
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:55,240
onward leading uh wisdom producing place for me to

192
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:04,599
be so that is a sense of trust so so trust not just in a larger scale of

193
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:12,160
supporting our practice but also in the minor scale of supporting our practice to stay to stay this subtle trust and

194
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:19,480
again remember self- judgment is not the answer to trust it's not like oh you're

195
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:24,880
a bad meditator you don't have enough trust it doesn't work that way so please

196
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:32,200
let go of self-judgment um and just come back to trust I trust I trust that this

197
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:38,079
is this is supportive this is onward leading doubt can

198
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:46,160
also um show up with in a slightly different way um it can show up in the

199
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:54,040
subtle way of us not connecting to the practice um for example not being a

200
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:59,599
regular practitioner like practicing one day and then taking a week off or month

201
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:06,720
off and then realizing and then remembering our trust oh yeah when I was practicing uh when I was connecting with

202
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:14,640
the Dharma when I was reading when I was listening to Dharma talks oh I was Kinder I was um less reactive so

203
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:20,359
remembering tapping into that trust can ofer often brings us back but in those

204
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:25,920
periods that are we're not connecting we're not connecting then trust is not

205
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:33,240
as strong right because we're not we don't have unshakable trust that this is what helps my Humanity grow this is what

206
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:40,760
helps me wake up in this very life for the benefit of myself and the benefit of others to be transformed into another

207
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:47,880
version of myself um a better Angel a better angel of my

208
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:54,800
myself so so doubt can show up in these subtle ways of our behaviors uh which

209
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,319
not so subtle actually is is is doubt in in in the practice that can show up in

210
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:06,160
or doubt in ourselves or um doubt that it's working Etc in a subtle way it's

211
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,640
not a clear expression of that but it's got more more subtle kind of takes us

212
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:19,720
away it's a lack of confidence that shows up as as lack of

213
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:28,319
commitment so a couple of other things I wanted to say today

214
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:34,319
so sadada confidence as an antidote to trust and again we build trust by

215
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:41,960
noticing by really bringing reflection to how um this is working for us how how

216
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:48,839
how the shifts and changes are happening and to say that again from the

217
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:55,040
first day I want to repeat that it's very important for sadada to be um

218
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:01,400
balanced with PA with wisdom wiom so trust needs to be balanced by

219
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:07,359
wisdom if not it can fall into Blind Faith or or

220
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:13,400
blind yeah Blind Faith which is not helpful either not

221
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:18,599
helpful and in fact it is said that I mean the same way that you've heard the

222
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:24,079
metaphor that wisdom and compassion are the two birds of the wing of Awakening

223
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,319
also the two birds of the wing it is said uh the two wings of the bird let's

224
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:37,720
try that again the two wings of the bird that's funny um are uh wisdom and and

225
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:45,839
Trust so so wisdom needs to support trust so that it doesn't get out of

226
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:51,160
balance um so there are many stories in the

227
00:42:51,160 --> 00:43:00,440
sutas and maybe I'll just share one with you briefly so there stories of

228
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:09,040
um various Disciples of the Buddha uh venerable saruta and mallana who were

229
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:14,920
initially skeptical and had doubt but through confidence and hearing the

230
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:20,160
Dharma hearing the Dharma they had confidence and and they fully awakened

231
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:27,160
and became Disciples of the Buddha um there's also another story uh

232
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:33,960
typical a a story of kemma Terry who became uh a leading disciple of the

233
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:42,800
Buddha um similar to venerable SAR she was likened to the uh in in in the nuns

234
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:50,480
orders as the um uh uh as the Sarai in the in the monk orders and the story is

235
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:57,920
that she was um she was very beautiful and uh part of the um uh and and she was

236
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:05,480
a con concert of uh of a king king bin basari and uh she was very attached to

237
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:12,680
her beauty and her Youth and uh King Bim basari wanted her

238
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:17,720
to practice with the Buddha and know the Buddha so uh they arranged for her to

239
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:25,000
pass by The jeta's Grove where the Buddha is teaching and the Buddha through her through his um uh Powers

240
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:34,599
through his um uh um Powers he creates an a vision of a very beautiful woman uh

241
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:41,440
and and while k um uh while um uh K the

242
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:47,880
k k the is passing by she sees the vision of this very

243
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,160
beautiful woman and she admires the very beautiful woman and then the Buddha

244
00:44:53,160 --> 00:45:01,520
again through her through his powers creates that having cre created this Mirage makes this beautiful woman

245
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:07,280
um Decay and get old in front of uh

246
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:14,359
Ker's eyes and ker in that moment realizes really has insight into

247
00:45:14,359 --> 00:45:20,880
impermanence that beauty and and youth are impermanent they're not they're

248
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:28,440
they're not for her to hang on to and to to cling to so through why reflection of

249
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:36,079
impermanence she overcomes doubt that oh these practices are not for me I don't know and then she practices with the

250
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:41,440
Buddha um and becomes fully enlightened and and becomes one of the uh Prime

251
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:49,079
disciples so so wise reflection listening to the teachings practicings

252
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:55,200
etc etc are ways to overcome doubt whether in strong ways or in subtle ways

253
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:01,000
of of lack of commitment do during practice distractions Etc or or falling

by the wayside or or practice Falling by the wayside okay so thank you so much for your
