1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,160
so good day

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:21,279
i'm happy to greet you to this meditation session together and and to be here with all of you

3
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,960
and i love seeing the names and locations people are from that are in the chat and

4
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,240
those who don't see it it's quite impressive from all over

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:40,399
so um one of the ways that buddha characterized his own

6
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,440
teachings or his own yeah his own teachings is that he

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:53,440
realize his teachings rely on direct experience they rely on his own direct experience

8
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,640
and that's in contrast to the people that the religious leaders on

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:04,799
his time who teachings were articles of faith they took it on faith that they received you know they

10
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,840
received it from someplace else they received it from the tradition

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:18,320
whatever tradition they came from or from sacred texts or they the teachings they had were

12
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:26,720
based on what they liked with their preferences or the teachings they had were based on

13
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:34,799
what they have reasoned out for themselves that would seem logical to them themselves or those that were sure based

14
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,680
on intuition some kind of intuitive knowing

15
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:50,159
or those that were based on one's own teacher my teacher said this

16
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,799
and instead of those other sources of knowledge the buddha relied on what he

17
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,000
could know directly and that's the what the this buddhism

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,280
the buddha pointed to for each of us and so this idea of of sitting in

19
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,080
meditation in the present moment is to place us with the in the place and the location

20
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:21,520
in time and place and with a kind of attention

21
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:29,680
that is connected or sees or is present for our direct experience

22
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:37,280
direct experience of the body direct experience of the eyes the ears

23
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,720
the nose the tongue and also the direct experience of what we can know that's

24
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,920
unfolding happening in the present in the mind

25
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,560
and there's something about something we can see in the present moment directly

26
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,640
that cannot be seen anywhere else and that is what this practice is

27
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,440
helping us to discover we can know something for ourselves see it for ourselves

28
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:15,920
and so this practice becomes a very fortunate practice in that it turns

29
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,120
out that it's possible to really feel at home in the present

30
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,560
moment direct experience it's possible for that to be a place where

31
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,599
our preoccupations with the past and the future our ideas and fantasies and preferences

32
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,879
and and the stories we tell ourselves that are

33
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:46,480
some some of them are quite painful that all those recede into a kind of

34
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:54,159
deep sense simplicity of being a contentment of being here and now

35
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:02,159
not for its own sake but but rather it turns out this is the way of being

36
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,879
that coincides with really being able to see things as they really are to really

37
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:18,000
connect have direct experience so perhaps those few words will

38
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,639
maybe inspire you to be curious about what your connection to direct

39
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,199
experience might be what is your experience and can that be a place where there's a simplicity of

40
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,360
being not something you have to work out logically not something you have to

41
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,840
believe by faith not something you have to have preferences for

42
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,199
liking or not liking just something to be settled and breathing

43
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:57,840
breathing in the middle of it so to assume a meditation posture

44
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,600
that is supportive for you of being attentive in the

45
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,840
present moment generally it means to

46
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:20,080
have a posture that expresses some alertness even if you're not lying down there

47
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,000
might be some way of adjusting your head your chest your spine

48
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,800
your arms where there's some intentionality involved to be here

49
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,720
and present

50
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,759
and to then also relap relax in this posture

51
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,800
not to slump

52
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,759
but to relax the muscles which don't need to be tight

53
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:04,840
i kind of settling in and so to take a few long and slow deep

54
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
breaths

55
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,479
relaxing as you exhale

56
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:52,800
and letting your breathing return to normal but to feel that breathing from the

57
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:00,879
inside out to be aware of your the body's own experience of breathing

58
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,400
and here's where direct experience comes into play

59
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,880
you don't have to be concerned with your preferences for how breathing is like

60
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,680
or the tradition of how it's supposed to be or

61
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,758
some logic of reason that you've worked out about how you're supposed to breathe

62
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:35,280
it's enough just to be familiar with the breathing as it is

63
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,560
perhaps as you exhale

64
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:56,080
to relax into the body breathing

65
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:13,840
especially on the exhale relaxing into the breathing body

66
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,880
and whatever occurs as you're meditating now

67
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,959
how do you know it as a direct experience

68
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,839
as the immediate experience of now

69
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:58,079
direct experience doesn't need any thinking about the experience it's just a knowing

70
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,800
mindfulness

71
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:13,200
almost a silent awareness of what is happening now

72
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,839
in the body as you're breathing

73
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:52,240
in the ears as you hear

74
00:12:52,240 --> 00:13:07,600
in the eyes as you see

75
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,079
in the mind as there's mental activity

76
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,519
as you think the content of your thoughts are not important but the

77
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:35,839
direct experience of thinking can be known

78
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,158
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

79
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,960
the ability to

80
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:57,440
prioritize the direct experience we have can give us a very different

81
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:04,840
relationship to other people than if we experienced other people

82
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:12,559
through our judgments our bias our projections

83
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:21,840
the colored glasses we wear the cobwebs through which we see

84
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:30,320
and to clear away much of the distortions or

85
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:37,919
assumptions or bias in which we see people and to be

86
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,200
present simply fully with the direct experience

87
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,320
of another person

88
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:55,278
is a way of sharing in the humanity of our lives

89
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:04,720
it's a way in which hopefully what's deep inside of us

90
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:12,640
can sense what's deep inside of another their humanity their

91
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,840
suffering their joys

92
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:25,600
their fundamental value as a living and breathing human being

93
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,840
and may it be that this practice of meditation

94
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:41,520
helps us to see others in new ways in ways where we feel and sense and

95
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,840
share common humanity

96
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,000
that form of direct experience where

97
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,720
it's easier and cleaner

98
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:06,880
for there to be good will and generosity kindness towards others

99
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:13,200
care and may this direct experience of this

100
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:20,080
life inspire us to live for the welfare and

101
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:26,240
happiness of others in whatever way is appropriate for each

102
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,799
individual

103
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,240
may this practice we do together

104
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:45,120
support the happiness of others provide people with greater senses of

105
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,679
safety

106
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:58,240
of peace and open the doors to freedom

107
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:09,840
may all beings be well and happy

108
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,719
[Music]

109
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:19,840
so so for uh this week so

110
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:28,000
little dharmets and i would like to continue with the idea of stories but this time to

111
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,679
tell the stories of the buddha from the suttas from the ancient

112
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,880
literature that we have in our tradition they purport to be the

113
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,960
direct records of the buddha and not some of the common stories that

114
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:52,480
are often told about the buddha but rather some of the ones that contain some wonderful teachings

115
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:59,679
and some of the stories are not great stories but they're stories that contextualize

116
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:08,159
the teachings and it can help them to stand out a little bit and highlight and so the first one is is a

117
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:15,039
discourse discourse this ancient word is sutta s-u-t-t-a and it's called the

118
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:21,600
chunky sutum and uh it's spelled usually in english c-a-n-k-i

119
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,039
and it's number 95 in the middle length discourses

120
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:33,360
and um i'm particularly fond of this suta and when i teach some of the courses i teach on the suttas themselves

121
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,880
on this ancient discourse especially when i teach courses on middle length discourses i

122
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,159
like to start with this one and the reason for it is that i the kind

123
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,279
of the pivot of the text that kind of the story kind of pivots on

124
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:55,519
and therefore maybe the most important part of the text is a teaching the buddha gives on the

125
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:01,279
preservation of truth and how do we preserve the truth and to

126
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:06,720
offer that the beginning of teachings on this ancient ancient studies of the studies of the

127
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:14,240
ancient teachings is how do we study these texts and preserve the truth as we do it stay

128
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:20,559
truthful in a certain way and not to accept them naively the

129
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:25,679
teachings not to accept them as true because that's what's in the text

130
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,679
how do we relate to these teachings if we don't have our own direct experience of them

131
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:40,320
and how do we talk about it so the preservation of truth and um so the story has to do

132
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:47,279
with um brahmanas visiting the buddha and the brahmins were and we have in

133
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:56,080
this text that kind of represents a little bit the tension in ancient india between the brahman caste and the

134
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:03,919
sometimes called the warrior or the noble caste the katya chatrias that the buddha came from

135
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,158
and india was very hierarchical culture everything was stratified according to

136
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:17,679
hierarchies and uh there was a vying for top position among the brahman class which was uh

137
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,599
often the scene is that whether the this the brahmana priests the priests the

138
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:31,440
brahmanical religions some of them who were phenomenally wealthy and controlled lots of territory

139
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:38,079
and and then the uh the warrior noble class that were often the rulers

140
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:44,960
and um so in this text i um a uh the buddha is camped out

141
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,320
near a town where there's a brahmana named chunky who's phenomenally

142
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:56,240
wealthy he's been given land it's like like a maybe a lord of you know a

143
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:03,760
medieval lord you know given by the king whole big territory to be his own and to

144
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,040
the wealth of it was his the people in it were working kind of for him and things like that

145
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:14,720
and he's also very learned in the vermontical lore

146
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,400
and um one day he hears about um the people in his the other brahmanas in

147
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,520
his town here that the buddha is nearby and there's a good report about the buddha he's

148
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:32,240
supposed to be you know a wonderful teacher and so

149
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:38,640
they all decide to go visit the buddha and hear his teachings however there's a

150
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:46,240
group of other brahmanas 500 it says visiting the town from other places and they get upset

151
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:53,359
that chunky this kind of ruler of the territory this great brahmana is going to go visit the

152
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:59,040
buddha and they say it's inappropriate for you to visit the buddha because you are so wonderful and they

153
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:06,240
go through all the ways in which he's wonderful and and the buddha should come see you

154
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:13,520
because you're so elevated and you shouldn't go to the buddha and the brahman chunky says oh no no

155
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:20,000
the buddha is actually more wonderful he lists all the special qualities of the buddha to argue

156
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,280
yes it's appropriate for me to go see the buddha not the buddha to come to me so they all go to see the buddha and

157
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,640
they're sitting there having a conversation about the dharma or something

158
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,680
and there's a 16 year old brahman priest a student of the brahmanical lore

159
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:44,800
teachings sacred texts who is sitting amongst them and he keeps

160
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,320
interrupting the buddha and at some point the buddha says to him

161
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:57,440
and exactly the tone of voice and how he said it we don't know and how to translate the word uh into english we don't know the body

162
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:03,599
translated as the buddha rebuked the boy for interrupting the conversation between the elder

163
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,960
brahmins and himself one meaning for the for the word is that

164
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:15,839
the buddha stopped and just simply stopped the brahman the young boy that night 16

165
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:22,000
year old and said you know you shouldn't interrupt when the elders are speaking

166
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,119
and then one of the elder brahmans maybe chunky says oh it's okay venerable buddha that this this young

167
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,800
man is one of the most learned of the brahmana students we have he's

168
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:42,079
memorized all the ancient texts and the histories of the past and philosophy and he knows it all

169
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:48,720
please now you know it's okay that he is part of the conversation and in the very formal polite culture of

170
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:54,160
the time of the buddha probably what the buddha needed to do in order to have converse with the 16 year

171
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,920
old he needed to have clear permission from the elder brahmanas to do so otherwise it would be rude to

172
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:06,320
them that he directed his focus to this 16 year old so he has that permission so

173
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:12,640
the buddha looks at the at the at the 16 year old and 16 year old says oh good the buddha is now ready

174
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:19,200
to hear my question and the 16 year old says

175
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:26,000
it's been said among the brahmanas that our texts our sacred texts

176
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,400
are the only ones that are true and all everyone else is wrong

177
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:40,079
it said he actually says it's uh the brahmins say that definitively our texts are the only ones

178
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,280
that are true and everything else is wrong so they're kind of definitive this is clear

179
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,800
and what does the buddha think about this and the buddha in this kind of circumstance does what he often does

180
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,240
which she asks counter questions and he asks

181
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:03,760
the 16 year old the student what is there any brahman

182
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:10,640
in the current generation who has directly known and seen the truths of these ancient

183
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:18,720
texts they really know it for themselves through their direct experience and the student says no

184
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:25,839
and what about their teachers the generation before them and the generation before them

185
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:31,680
did they any of them say they directly knew and see saw the truth of these teachings no they

186
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:38,160
never said they directly stew it themselves and if you go back seven generations

187
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,599
nope no one said no and seven generations have said they directly know and see for themselves

188
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:50,160
and if you go back to those people who composed the sacred literature did they ever make

189
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,000
a claim maybe in the literature that they directly knew and saw the truth for themselves

190
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,119
and the students said no there's no proof that they claim that they themselves saw it directly for

191
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,400
themselves so then the buddha makes a kind of a big claim big big

192
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:12,000
statement he says sound seems to me that the brahmanas

193
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,119
are a little bit like um well before i say this earlier in the text

194
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:25,200
chunky when he's describing the great qualities of the buddha he says the buddha never harmed any and

195
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,280
and so this what's about to be said because it could be seen maybe a little bit offensive but maybe there's a way of understanding it that

196
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,400
it's not offensive but it's just um you know just

197
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:43,599
doing kind of an aikido move with uh what the the maybe the conceit or the arrogance

198
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:50,640
of this student who believed that this is the truth that he had and so the buddha said um well it's what

199
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,839
you're saying then it's kind of like a row of blind people one

200
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:01,520
holding the shoulder of the next the one in the front can't see the one in the middle can't see and the

201
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:07,680
one the back can't see and the brahmins are a little bit like like a row of blind blind people

202
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,839
going along so the the um

203
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:19,680
the the student then says well you know but we have it on faith we don't know and directly know and see for ourselves

204
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:25,280
we have it on faith and the buddha says well what's known on

205
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,880
faith may be true but it might not also be true there's no no certainty about just because it's

206
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,240
sake on faith that it's true ah but it's in our or it's in our oral

207
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,760
traditions in our texts and that buddha says well just because it's part of the tradition

208
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:48,960
it might be true but it might not be true there's no way of really knowing just because it's traditional and then

209
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:55,599
the buddha says there are five things that may or may not be true

210
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,680
things taken on faith things taken as being true because we like them we

211
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:09,200
prefer them things taken as true because they are the tradition things true because we've

212
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:15,599
reasoned them out for ourselves they're logical and the last one is because there's some kind of intuitive

213
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:23,040
understanding of uh that we intuitively feel or sense that these are true and he said in each

214
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:29,200
of these circumstances sometimes it might be that it's true and sometimes it's not and there's no way really of

215
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:37,760
understanding which it is based on those sources and and so the the youth says well how

216
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,839
do we preserve the truth then and this is the pinnacle of the text and why i like it so much

217
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:52,480
the buddha says that we preserve the text but we preserve the truth by

218
00:42:52,480 --> 00:43:00,160
stating the basis upon which we make a claim so if we take something on faith

219
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:06,800
we say it is my faith that this is true if we take it upon our preferences it's

220
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:13,040
my preference that this is true if it's based on the tradition the text

221
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:19,280
or something our teachers or something then we say it's based on the tradition this is what

222
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:26,000
the tradition says is true and then i reason it out for myself that's why i think it's true

223
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:33,200
or i just have an intuitive sense that this is true and so we're like then we're not making

224
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:39,119
a claim about what is true we're making a claim about

225
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:44,319
how we've come to understand what we think is the truth we're not claiming it's true we're

226
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:50,000
claiming that we have faith or reasons to believe it so

227
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,520
and then it's possible to be in dialogue with people people understand what we're basing our claims upon we can

228
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:02,560
go back and look at the texts or we can examine their reasoning or we can appreciate the faith that someone has

229
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:07,599
and this idea of really being clear about the basis upon which we take

230
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:15,040
something to be true it's my interpretation it's my this or that i suppose i'm claiming it's true

231
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:23,119
this is a pivot the pivot of the text then the student says well if

232
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:28,480
how do we discover the truth for ourselves and the buddha then goes on and says

233
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:35,040
well in that case if you want to discover it for yourself go find

234
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:42,160
he actually says a monk a biku who's come to your village or something and spend a long time checking that

235
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:49,280
person out that teacher out make sure that that person doesn't exhibit any traces of having greed

236
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,560
hatred and delusion that might skew how they talk about the truth where they

237
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:59,760
might be motivated to twist or bend the truth a little bit for the purposes of their desires or

238
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,800
their aversions or their illusions so really check someone out first when

239
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:12,160
you're confident that they don't seem to have exhibit any kind of greed hate and delusion that uh would maybe skew how they give the

240
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:17,760
teachings then listen to their teachings and reflect on them and really take them in and think about them for

241
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,880
yourself and find what's going on and then once you really have reflected

242
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,800
them deeply then engage in the practice and do it wholeheartedly

243
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,720
enter the practice into the world of the direct experience until the direct experience opens up

244
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:42,240
that you discover the truth for yourself and then this brahmana student says well

245
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:50,400
is that all there is just a discovery and the buddha says no there's one more step and that is the arrival at truth

246
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:56,240
so not just discovering what the truth is but arriving at it now what the buddha is doing is talking

247
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,520
about the discovery of the truth he's kind of doing another move by aikido at least this is my

248
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:11,039
interpretation i'll say that so i preserve the truth and that is he's saying that um um

249
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:19,040
he's doing is rather than talking about abstract truth he's pointing the the student to how you

250
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:26,240
could practice to experience the direct experience that buddha values the most

251
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:33,760
and and uh and it's through practice that that's uh uh accomplished mindfulness practice

252
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:42,400
concentration practice and all this and then once you have the discovery of truth then to arrive at truth the buddha

253
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,000
says then you do the same thing over and over again you do this repeat the same practice repeatedly

254
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,920
again and again until it gets you're fully integrated into it then there's no separation between

255
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,960
yourself and the truth and you in a sense become the truth it doesn't say that in the text but

256
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:05,200
become the truth so um and so then everyone's happy

257
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:10,960
that's the end of the story so it's not a necessarily a great story but it's a

258
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:16,880
it's i think a fascinating story of setting up the context for why it's so important uh to

259
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:22,480
emphasize the preservation of truth among people who hold on to the truth

260
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:28,640
out of faith or out of traditional reason or something and there is another way of going about it which is

261
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,839
not just to take teachings even buddhist teachings on faith or because in the texts and therefore it's

262
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:39,119
true that's always provisional that what's not

263
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:46,000
provisional is when we've actualized it for ourselves and really thought this is what i know i've experienced myself

264
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,359
the direct experience we have ourselves of it now i know

265
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:56,720
and then we could arrive at truth but keep practicing what we've discovered

266
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:03,280
so that's the story and i hope that you appreciated that

267
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:21,838
and i'll say tell some other stories for the rest of the week so thank you

268
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,599
you
