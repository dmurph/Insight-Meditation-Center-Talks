1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,520
greetings everyone I'm happy to be here with you this

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:14,759
week my name is Meg Galler and I'm speaking to you from a rem remote part

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:21,960
of the south of France and uh the zoom coming out from

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,840
my end is being uh transformed at IMC by our

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:35,719
wonderful audiovisual team uh and live streamed out to you on

6
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:41,200
YouTube so please know that I very much value your feedback in the

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:48,359
chat uh although I can't see it while I'm teaching but I'll do so

8
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:56,600
afterwards last year around this time I gave a series on training in

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:04,320
emptiness but unfortunately had to cancel on the last day because of Internet

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:13,640
issues so today I'll share with you the fifth guided meditation and talk

11
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,880
for that week on training and

12
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,600
emptiness you all came here for a

13
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:35,079
reason and the invitation is to begin our meditation by formulating Our

14
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:41,840
intention which can be as simple as may my practice

15
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:49,320
serve as a condition for awakening for myself and all

16
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:58,240
beings in the Buddhist context Awakening means freedom from

17
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,399
suffering and as you know the suffering in this

18
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:10,160
world is immense so our job here is to free

19
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:16,280
ourselves from suffering so that everything we

20
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:23,000
do we can then help free others which is a tall

21
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:32,800
order in every moment we create the conditions for who we become in the next

22
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:42,280
moment so keep in mind that this is a gradual path and it requires being patient with

23
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,840
ourselves the Buddha says the wise person gradually bit by

24
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,280
bit Moment by moment removes their

25
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:05,239
impurities so our meditation practice is to purify our unskillful

26
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:11,959
Tendencies so we have to begin by holding ourselves in

27
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:17,680
compassion dropping any temptation to feel

28
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:26,440
inadequate or to judge ourselves so begin by closing your eyes

29
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,760
or lowering your gaze if that's more comfortable

30
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:36,840
and whether you're sitting or lying down settle

31
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,560
yourself by aligning the spine into a posture that

32
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,480
expresses the aspiration you formulated just

33
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:02,720
now inviting the grounding energy of the earth to hold you safely in its

34
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:11,239
embrace you can fine-tune the alignment of the spine by imagining that the head

35
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:17,000
is suspended from the sky by a thread an invisible

36
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,160
one and then letting all the vertebrae relax

37
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:31,880
downward inviting the clear open energy of the sky to come down through

38
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:41,280
you from the opening in the crown of the head down through the Torso and legs and

39
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,960
out through the

40
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:56,960
feet offering your body your heartfelt

41
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,638
compassion this is how it is right now

42
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:10,880
so light a little flame of benevolence and compassion in your

43
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,919
heart and let it protect

44
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:25,160
you see if you can open the edges of your body and let your little flame of

45
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:30,319
compassion radiate out to all beings in

46
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:36,680
all directions may we and all

47
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:40,520
beings be free from

48
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:56,000
suffering connecting to the breathing by taking one long beautiful

49
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:03,039
breath deep breath and then slowly let the breath return to

50
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:09,240
its natural Rhythm as You Follow the whole cycle of

51
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,800
the breath perhaps visualizing an oval if that

52
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,680
works for you in this oval waves of breathing

53
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:29,120
moving up the back on the inhale at the end of the inhale over the

54
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:36,680
crown of the head noticing the little empty

55
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:43,120
Paws and on the exhale letting the breath Cascade down

56
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,599
the face and the front of the

57
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:55,319
Torso the end of the exhale comes with another slight pause at the bottom of

58
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,720
the oval as the breath moves past the

59
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,520
panum towards the back again for another

60
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:21,520
inhale feel the flow the constantly changing nature of

61
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,560
the breath as you breathe

62
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,879
normally following the whole cycle of the

63
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:48,240
breath Welling in the flow of breathing and appreciating its

64
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,440
inconstancy seeing how it's constantly changing

65
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,759
staying peacefully with a breath is a way of dwelling

66
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:17,000
in abiding in and knowing the Ever Changing nature of your

67
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
experience

68
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,760
the one meditation practice that Scholars are confident the Buddha practiced

69
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:55,440
himself is anapanasati awareness breathing

70
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,880
in Awareness breathing out

71
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,839
and in his instructions on anapanasati the budha tells us first of

72
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,399
all to go to a Wilderness with the foot of a

73
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:18,839
tree or to some place empty to establish

74
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:26,279
our awareness I take this to include

75
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:31,519
establishing our awareness first of all in a

76
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,240
mind that's empty of self-

77
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:46,680
preoccupation the Buddha then instructs

78
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,720
us very succinctly always

79
00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:02,000
attentive one breathes in with awareness and breathes out with

80
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:10,440
awareness that's all we have to do with this

81
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,680
practice and resting in awareness of the

82
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,279
breathing is to be protected from

83
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:34,079
delusion as we follow the breath we can choose the wisdom of

84
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:41,800
spaciousness non-grasping rather than self-referential

85
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:51,240
thinking coming back as often as

86
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:58,639
needed to awareness of this body breathing

87
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:30,519
we close your eyes and stay with the breath

88
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:33,079
the whole

89
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,200
cycle e

90
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:48,720
if you see thoughts arise take a moment to recognize how

91
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,880
unsubstantial they are thoughts have no real

92
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:03,519
substance and rather than choosing to follow your thoughts you can choose a peaceful

93
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:09,880
mind right here empty of the

94
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,079
preoccupation With Me Myself and

95
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,560
mind and by dropping down into the breathing perhaps you can

96
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:30,800
taste if only for a moment the freedom of just

97
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:38,440
breathing being present open

98
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:47,800
receptive this is the freedom of emptiness which allows you to be

99
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:57,199
available for the experience of breathing available for just being

100
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
alive

101
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,079
e e

102
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,240
feel and appreciate the wholesomeness of those

103
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:29,839
moments however brief when the mind is empty of thoughts

104
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,199
revolving around self-

105
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,959
preoccupation e

106
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,800
feeling the Ever Changing in constant nature of

107
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:56,720
breathing and letting the breath teach us the truth of

108
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:05,600
inconstancy the truth that everything we think of as solid is in fact a

109
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,400
process of constant

110
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
change

compassion for ourselves for everyone in this sa meditating together

131
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:35,960

139

[Music]

142
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
for e

143
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:18,399
greetings everyone um I'm Meg

144
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:24,600
Galler and I'm speaking to you from a remote part of the south of

145
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:34,840
France and I'm very grateful to the IMC uh audiovisual Tech Team who are uh

146
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:42,000
taking the zoom for me and sending it out to you on

147
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:48,360
YouTube for the last year I've taken a sabatical due to health

148
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:55,518
challenges and I'm really happy to be back here with you

149
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,120
please know that I very much value your feedback in the chat and although I'm

150
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:11,320
not able uh to read the chat during the teaching I do look at it

151
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:20,760
afterwards so as I said at the beginning of the meditation uh last year around this time

152
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:26,480
I gave a 7 a.m. series on training and

153
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:32,519
emptiness but un fortunately had to cancel on the last day because of

154
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:38,279
Internet issues so today I wanted to share with

155
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:43,720
you the last part of that series on

156
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:52,000
emptiness focusing today on how we might put emptiness into

157
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,760
practice so my aspiration today is to give you some

158
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:08,159
ideas for fostering an open spacious mind rather than a mind caught in the

159
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,720
clinging of self-

160
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:21,480
preoccupation Emptiness is essentially being empty of

161
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:28,559
selfing this preoccupation With Me Myself and mind

162
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:35,919
is the motor behind our discursive thinking and our

163
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:45,600
reactivity so I'd like to begin with the first two verses of the

164
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:52,559
dhap the beautiful collection of poems expounded by the

165
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:59,799
Buddha he says all experience is preceded by

166
00:32:59,799 --> 00:33:08,519
mind made by mind led by mind speak or act with a corrupted mind

167
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:13,799
and suffering follows as the Wagon Wheel follows the

168
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:21,799
hoof of the ox all experience is preceded by mind

169
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:28,880
led by mind made by mind speak or act

170
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,919
with a peaceful mind and happiness follows like a never

171
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:42,960
departing Shadow so a corrupted mind is defined as

172
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:50,880
having any kind of clinging and a peaceful mind is what we

173
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:59,720
need for unwavering happiness that stays with us like a never departing shadow

174
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:04,840
so our job as practitioners is to learn how the mind

175
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,079
works to see our own reactivity to our

176
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:17,399
experience and all the proliferation that comes from self-centered

177
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:26,200
thinking without a mind that's empty of proliferating self-centered

178
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,839
thinking and and is caught in reactivity rather than being at peace with what is

179
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:38,440
we can't even see the choices we have in each

180
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:46,000
moment much less make wise choices in order to be at peace with

181
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,480
ourselves and with the world so in meditation we're training

182
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:59,520
the Mind little by little to become more and more

183
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:07,480
peaceful so that rather than being caught in instant reactivity to our

184
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:14,280
experience the Mind learns how to slow down enough so that we can see the forks in

185
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:19,320
the road in each moment of our

186
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:29,079
lives so that we can then make the wise choices that Foster happiness confidence

187
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:41,400
Serenity rather than choosing clinging to the illusion of self which leads us down the path to

188
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:48,320
anxiety fear and suffering the Buddhist stresses that

189
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,720
this is a gradual path and you may have seen for

190
00:35:53,720 --> 00:36:00,200
yourselves in the early stages of practice That We Begin by seeing how

191
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:06,000
Wild the mind is and this is totally

192
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:15,839
normal we need to befriend the wild mind and keep walking the path with

193
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,680
perseverance and patience understanding that it's part of

194
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:29,560
our DNA to want to protect ourselves to exist

195
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:37,040
and in meditation this desire to exist is often expressed as discursive

196
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,319
thinking with the self as the primary

197
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:51,760
protagonist many of you are familiar with the hindrances to

198
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,880
Awakening the unskillful Mind states that we need to abandon

199
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:03,359
as we progress on the path of

200
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:09,440
practice in ply the word for these hindrances

201
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,838
narana literally means

202
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:21,680
coverings with the hindrances these obstacles to

203
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:29,640
Enlightenment we literally cover over the purity of our mind's potential for

204
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:36,359
awakening and the Buddha's great discovery was that the obstacles to

205
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:42,599
freedom from suffering had originated in his own

206
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:48,720
mind and he awakened to the full potential of his own

207
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:56,000
nature fundamental radiant awareness that is infinite and

208
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:04,480
indestructible as you know our usual mind is populated

209
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,480
by proliferating thoughts that arise from ignorance and

210
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:17,520
craving and it's no accident that the vipasana

211
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,880
tradition stresses cultivating mindful

212
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:32,319
awareness aan Mahaba from the ti for tradition describes our true mind as

213
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:37,280
simple awareness utterly

214
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:46,240
pure our Pure mind is unconstructed and has no reference point

215
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:53,920
in the self and the nature of this pure

216
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:03,559
awareness is the ease of emptiness the absence of all defilements and

217
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:12,440
self-centeredness in our tradition it's compassion that is the spontaneous

218
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:17,720
expression of the Fertile space of

219
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:26,079
emptiness so our path of practice involves recognizing this Union of

220
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:32,359
emptiness and awareness endowed with

221
00:39:32,359 --> 00:39:37,920
compassion and then stabilizing our

222
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:47,560
recognition we know that everything is in flux which is why the self doesn't last

223
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:54,480
long enough to be able to be reified into something lasting and

224
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:02,200
substantial emptiness is really the fertile

225
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:09,359
possibility of endless transformation and this means that we're

226
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:16,359
not stuck with our wild mind or any of the difficulties in our

227
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:23,599
lives this path of practice is

228
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:31,000
transformative and I'm speaking from experience when I tell you

229
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:38,800
that we can make peace with our difficulties when we learn to settle the

230
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:47,200
mind and to make more and more wise choices in our lives Moment by

231
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:56,200
moment what we perceive as our inadequacies are just the starting point

232
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:01,040
or this transform for ative path of

233
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:11,400
practice and when we really see that every

234
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:16,640
moment offers us the possibility of

235
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:25,680
Freedom we can let go and transform our self-centered barriers and limitations

236
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:35,319
my root teacher shunu Suzuki said that there is always a possibility

237
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:41,680
of understanding as long as we live in

238
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:48,640
emptiness we should always live in the dark empty

239
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:57,640
Sky even though clouds and lightning come the sky is not Disturbed

240
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:09,599
Suzuki roshi also advised us when you study Buddhism you should have a general

241
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:17,160
house cleaning of your mind so the first way of putting

242
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:22,920
emptiness into practice is essentially

243
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:30,040
decluttering which is a long process of Letting

244
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:35,359
Go letting go of unskillful mental

245
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:40,920
habits and replacing them with wholesome mental

246
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:50,319
habits and the good news is that we have agency and we have a path of practice

247
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:57,599
we're learning how to let go of our un UNH wholesome mental habits arising from

248
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,800
greed hate and

249
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:12,720
delusion to do this we need to constantly cultivate

250
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:19,000
awareness and calm the mind sufficiently so that moment after moment

251
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:26,319
we can slow down enough to be able to see the forks in the road and make wise

252
00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:29,119
choices

253
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:41,000
so if it's of interest to you for the next 24 hours you can try

254
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:48,160
cleaning and decluttering your meditation space another thing that's very

255
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:57,319
important for decluttering the mind is to not be in a rush so it's a good plan to um when

256
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:05,119
you're going to meditate arrive a couple minutes before your meditation to be able to settle down in

257
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,838
your posture mindfully and

258
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:18,559
calmly I also like to remind myself before I start that for these minutes of

259
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:25,359
meditation I can leave all my worries concerns obligations and

260
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:32,810
responsibilities together with my shoes outside the door of the meditation

261
00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:35,960
[Music]

262
00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:43,680
room so this ends the series from last

263
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:51,599
year on training and emptiness I hope it made some sense and if not and if you're

264
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:58,720
interested uh you can find the earlier meditations and talks on the audiio

265
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:05,440
Dharma and tomorrow we'll begin the four-part series for this week which

266
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:11,280
will be on the theme of trusting our

267
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:19,280
practice thank you for your attention thank you for your practice
