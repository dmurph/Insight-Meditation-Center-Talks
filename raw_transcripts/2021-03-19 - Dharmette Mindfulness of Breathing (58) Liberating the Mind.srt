1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,480
so

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,000
then we come to the 12th step

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
of the 16 steps of anapanasati

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,640
the practice of mindfulness breathing in

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,520
and mindfully

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,160
breathing out

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,960
and the 12 step is breathing in

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,400
one liberates the mind

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,960
breathing out one liberates the mind

10
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,800
and um so it's the 12th step of the 16th

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,680
so it's usually said not to be the full

12
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,840
complete possibility of liberation that

13
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,840
buddhism

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,440
champions but it is a significant

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,760
experience of freedom of liberation

16
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,719
of letting go that

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,039
that

18
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,600
that makes an impression on the mind

19
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,120
makes an impression on us it's

20
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,079
educational

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,960
it's opening it's inspiring it kind of

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,440
begins

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,518
pointing the way oh now we know

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,960
something we didn't know before

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,840
and um the

26
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,159
so the um

27
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,439
uh now remember it's a 12 step

28
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,560
so what that means is that um

29
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,680
the first 11 steps are in a sense

30
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,119
a preparation for this step if we simply

31
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:40,000
heard

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,479
the only instruction for buddhism is to

33
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,040
let go

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,280
let go let go i don't know if that would

35
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,680
be so useful for people to hear

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,520
and also it might not give the right

37
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,640
idea of what letting go is about it

38
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,840
might feel like oh

39
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,600
just let go of everything i have and

40
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,119
have nothing as a result and

41
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,479
be impoverished impoverished in some way

42
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,240
and if i let go there's nothing left and

43
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:05,759
i'll just be kind of depressed and

44
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,280
miserable or

45
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,840
something

46
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,040
the letting go happens after the first

47
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,239
11 steps

48
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,239
which are preparing the ground and

49
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,360
opening the field

50
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,120
and setting up a sense of well-being

51
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,239
where letting go has a very wonderful

52
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,160
context and we understand the tremendous

53
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,760
value of letting go

54
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,560
because of the wholesomeness the

55
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,840
beneficial states that we're

56
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,080
experiencing

57
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,840
so so to kind of review this little bit

58
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,480
how to contact how context is set up for

59
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,959
letting go

60
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,959
so the practice begins with just simply

61
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,800
mindfully breathing in and out

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,640
helping the mind calm down helping the

63
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,840
mind get focused

64
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,680
helping us to show up and be present for

65
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,519
our experience

66
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,239
and i think for most people that's where

67
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,840
the bulk of the practice is

68
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,680
even people who practice for a long time

69
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,440
they sit down to meditate

70
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,959
and they're they're at step one and two

71
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,000
and uh and uh this idea that there's a

72
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,840
progress you're supposed to always be at

73
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,159
the

74
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,760
growing edge of this 12 16 steps

75
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,879
is a kind of uh just a

76
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,480
unnecessary source of stress and

77
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,440
misunderstanding and it's easy easy than

78
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,000
to

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,400
miss ourselves in the process and not

80
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,319
really connect to ourselves

81
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,000
the idea in mindfulness practice is to

82
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,920
really become ourselves be ourselves

83
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,400
really

84
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,799
be honest about what's here and learn

85
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,440
how to rest and be present for it

86
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,280
and this idea of just breathing in and

87
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,879
out through it all

88
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,519
is a way of supporting us to not resist

89
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,319
not

90
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,440
try to escape not try to avoid what is

91
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,879
here but to really

92
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,040
be present and face what's here and work

93
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,319
through it

94
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,560
and just breathe with it and relax and

95
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,080
heal and open up

96
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,480
and and release the things that have to

97
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,959
be released

98
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,040
and but as we do this practice then at

99
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,560
some point we begin feeling

100
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,360
recognizing that we can relax the body

101
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,280
sometimes the body just relaxes itself

102
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,159
in meditation

103
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,720
often you don't have to do the relaxing

104
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,720
but the mind body becomes more tranquil

105
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,479
more calm

106
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:20,880
and and that's a feels like a good thing

107
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,040
and the more we practice the more calm

108
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,680
and relaxed the body becomes

109
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,520
as the body becomes calmer and more

110
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,840
relaxed let go some of the tension we

111
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,199
have

112
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,680
some of the feelings of well-being can

113
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,560
well up the

114
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,960
sense of contentment ease relaxation

115
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,840
itself is

116
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,720
can bring a kind of joy and happiness

117
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,400
and so the practice begins kind of

118
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,639
inching its way into feeling some joy

119
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,240
happiness contentment well-being

120
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,440
that sets the stage to better

121
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,160
appreciate the tensions of the mind the

122
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,320
mental activity how there's the stresses

123
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,759
that are there

124
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,199
and so then the practice when we start

125
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,000
seeing that we start relaxing the mental

126
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,639
activities

127
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,680
calming the agitation of the mind

128
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,360
relaxing the mind relaxing the mental

129
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,479
uh muscle the thinking muscle and

130
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,639
um and so the mental activities which

131
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,199
can be swirling around and be fragmented

132
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,160
and

133
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,080
be going off in different directions

134
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,080
begin to settle down

135
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,840
and the mental activity starts coming

136
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,840
into harmony with itself

137
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,639
and in in harmony and unity with the

138
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,680
settling process of meditation

139
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,120
and then we come into the third tetrad

140
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,840
all having to do with the mind the

141
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,160
chitta

142
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,639
and the cheetah can be understood as the

143
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,240
heart mind

144
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,759
it's kind of like our inner life

145
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,000
you know it's uh not would not be

146
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,080
appropriate buddhist term

147
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,360
but it maybe for a way some people some

148
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,680
modern people use the word soul

149
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,160
um kind of the deepest kind of places

150
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,520
inside our

151
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,319
insider psyche inside of ourselves it

152
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,680
might also be the soul

153
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,639
kind of them but the the mind the heart

154
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,680
the mind heart

155
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,319
it is you know what buddhists talk about

156
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,400
and uh so we start recognizing that we

157
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,160
have this inner life

158
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,120
this inner mind this inner quality of

159
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,319
life the mood

160
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,800
state that's inside and we start

161
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,360
becoming the caretaker of that

162
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,000
and because of the earlier steps of

163
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,120
panasati

164
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,280
this begins to feel good to be connected

165
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,960
to this deep

166
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,440
you know if i use the western word soul

167
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,000
to really

168
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,520
for some people i think it really kind

169
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,919
of feels like a homecoming more than if

170
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,240
you

171
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,440
say mind or heart but uh

172
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,440
does heart mind really feel like this is

173
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,240
good this inner state the state of being

174
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,599
and there can be a gladness of

175
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,840
satisfaction deep satisfaction deep

176
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,199
contentment

177
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,880
of being home being connected to

178
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,520
something deep that's not kind of

179
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,280
spinning around on the surface of our

180
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,800
thoughts and ideas and

181
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,720
scattered in her mind but we're really

182
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,919
starting to feel whole

183
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,880
and unified and that process of becoming

184
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,000
unified and

185
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,199
unscattered undispersed continues into

186
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:11,680
the

187
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,319
11th step with with samadhi with

188
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,000
unification we're studying

189
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,400
this whole mind state comes and gets

190
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,000
gathered together and

191
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,160
and there's a lot of well-being that can

192
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,000
come some of the greatest forms of joy

193
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,280
and happiness

194
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,120
come from samadhi from a mind that's

195
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,720
unified and settled and connected

196
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,319
so by the time we get to the step 12

197
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,759
letting go liberating the mind

198
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,800
the um there's just a tremendous amount

199
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,440
of

200
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,120
of well-being there's a feeling of being

201
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,240
really at home

202
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,319
connected and so rather than letting go

203
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,240
being an impoverishment the diminishment

204
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,520
of ourselves

205
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,639
it's we start really seeing that what

206
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,240
we're letting go of

207
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,280
is in fact what diminishes us

208
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,919
is in fact what impoverishes us that

209
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,759
there's something about the mind

210
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,199
getting caught and preoccupied

211
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,919
obsessing about things spinning around

212
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,000
in thoughts and ideas

213
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,960
holding on to fear oddly enough we can

214
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,479
cling to fear

215
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,840
uh clinging to uh to resistance clinging

216
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,039
to

217
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,759
all kinds of things that we resist and

218
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,919
hold on to and cling for dear life

219
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,280
clinging to self and self image

220
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,839
clinging to hurt all kinds of things

221
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:34,320
that

222
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,360
people will cling to

223
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,719
but it's seen on this reservoir on this

224
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,000
foundation

225
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,519
of well-being of goodness of freedom or

226
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,080
clarity and so it's really clear that

227
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,240
that clinging

228
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,839
is is a separation from that well-being

229
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,600
letting go just feels like of course

230
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,440
i'll let go

231
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,399
the letting go so obviously a

232
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,480
diminishment so obviously a source of

233
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,560
suffering so obviously a source of

234
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,320
stress of course i'll let go and so

235
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,600
sometimes the letting go

236
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,320
the liberation that happens here is uh

237
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:12,640
so

238
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,959
innate that it's not something we have

239
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,080
to do

240
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,160
we just keep staying present breathing

241
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,760
with the experience

242
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,240
and and just letting things be letting

243
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,200
things be

244
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,480
and something will just let go by itself

245
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,519
because it takes a certain kind of

246
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,720
mental involvement

247
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,440
to remain clinging and if we just let

248
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,399
things be

249
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,720
let things be even our clinging it will

250
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,880
self-liberate

251
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,040
at some point the self-liberating

252
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,399
capacity of all things and so

253
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,240
um so we come to the

254
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,760
the 12th step and we come to

255
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,480
the time of liberation of letting go and

256
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,399
it's at this point where some people

257
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,279
find it just

258
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:04,640
really a wonderful thing to just

259
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,120
sometimes when you sit down to meditate

260
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,320
just let go

261
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,399
let go let go just whatever arises let

262
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,600
it go

263
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,560
let it be let it be don't be involved

264
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:17,839
don't pick it up

265
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:20,880
don't get reactive to it don't pull away

266
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,519
just let go let it be let it be let it

267
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,600
go

268
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,800
and um and

269
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,320
you know and so we let go of everything

270
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,800
let go of even we let go of even

271
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,640
mindfulness being aware we let go of

272
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,920
self we get

273
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,680
let go of knowing we let go of

274
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,560
even letting go at some point just let

275
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,920
go

276
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,720
and don't and let go of being the agent

277
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,600
of it

278
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,200
let go of having an agenda let go of

279
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,640
trying to be complete

280
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,560
or getting enlightened even just let go

281
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,480
let go there's some that's as if that's

282
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,079
all there is

283
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,200
let go of um

284
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,560
of uh needing to let go even uh just

285
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,800
wherever it is possible the next moment

286
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,040
let go of this let go of this

287
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,680
and so

288
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,920
so this twelfth step of anapanasati

289
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,880
breathing in liberating the mind

290
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:29,680
breathing out

291
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,640
liberating the mind so that's um

292
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,279
and that is the is the entry way

293
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,560
to the last four steps of anupanasati

294
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,880
and so letting go and liberation here is

295
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:47,680
not in

296
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,079
you know the end of the story but in

297
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,600
some ways it's the beginning of the

298
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,560
story

299
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,959
and they say that some sometimes it said

300
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:55,680
in kind of

301
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,639
folklore buddhism that the buddhist path

302
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,320
really begins

303
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,560
when we have a qualitatively experience

304
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,639
of letting go of liberation

305
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,360
that we know oh this is what it's about

306
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:07,760
this

307
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,639
is what freedom is possible this is what

308
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,800
really feels good and feels inspiring

309
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,920
and feels

310
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,000
this is worth and this is such a

311
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,839
qual qualitatively good

312
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,399
experience such a rich experience such

313
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,920
an experience that's filled with

314
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,200
potential for

315
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,600
compassion and love and freedom and

316
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,880
goodness and

317
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,079
lack of causing harm wanting to cause

318
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,360
harm in the world

319
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,480
this is a good thing

320
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,360
so so

321
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,480
that's where we are on this process and

322
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,760
we'll continue it

323
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,279
um on monday and

324
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,480
and and over this weekend uh

325
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,519
why don't you uh talk to some friends

326
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:58,639
about

327
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,040
what they've learned about how letting

328
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,480
go is useful

329
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,560
and when letting go is useful have

330
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,320
conversations about

331
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,639
the benefits of letting go and how

332
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,839
letting go can be done

333
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,720
in wise ways and and look for

334
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
opportunities to let go

335
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,959
look to look and really start to explore

336
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,399
all the different dimensions that you

337
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,519
can find

338
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,399
of when and how and where letting go

339
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,959
operates for you or can operate for you

340
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,320
and if we do that then

341
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,519
we'll have a better foundation for our

342
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,200
continuing our adventure

343
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:41,199
on next week monday thank you
