1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,399
so good morning everyone and good day hello

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:17,279
and we're coming here to the last week of the series on sati patana

3
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,039
and my preferred translation of the word

4
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,800
sati is awareness and awareness

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,480
maybe is a little bit ambiguous term for some people it's a

6
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,480
multivalent term meaning it can have different meanings for different people

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,760
and one of the meanings that it has for me that

8
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,960
pertains to my practice and understanding of this text we're doing

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,000
it is a form of awareness form of

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,520
attentiveness that when established

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,600
has an effortless quality to it

12
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:12,640
there might be effort to stay in the flow of the river

13
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:19,119
if you kind of go off to the side and get caught on the bank on the left side you

14
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,479
maybe push off or you kind of paddle a little bit to stay in the middle of the the current

15
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:29,920
or if there's um some boulder in the way as you go down

16
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,159
on the left you kind of you know make sure you stay in the middle and so there's a little bit of

17
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:43,280
effort involved but it's clear that the effort involved is not to be aware

18
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,320
the effort involved is letting go of what interferes

19
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:56,000
with awareness and some of the things that interfere with kind of a crisp or clear awareness

20
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,040
really feeling we're present is there's a lot of thinking and thinking is not the problem

21
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:09,759
in a sense thinking is the distraction from that awareness

22
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:16,560
we don't have to then condemn thinking or stop thinking the art of it is to kind of turn it

23
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,680
around and let that discover that awareness

24
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,280
return to that awareness being aware of the thinking

25
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:33,120
and so it's a little slight of hand you're preoccupied and thinking then you know you're caught in your thoughts

26
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,120
and then rather than doing anything against the thoughts judging them or

27
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,200
or or trying to get away from them or do something it's the

28
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,200
discovering the kind of knowing of thinking

29
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,400
the awareness the recognition that has a kind of ease to it a

30
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,959
quietness to it a naturalness to it maybe an effortlessness to it

31
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,239
effortless in the sense that it's not something that we do

32
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:15,120
but rather it's something that is done by our psychophysical system

33
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,319
something that's done by maybe we say the mind it's as if it's the awareness that you

34
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:30,319
can't turn off you can only be distracted from in waking hours

35
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,680
it's always operating and

36
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,599
and luckily it operates when we're distracted sometimes because

37
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,360
um you know you might being lost in thought but you have just

38
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,000
something something has just enough awareness to see that as you walk down the sidewalk you're about to run into a

39
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,879
person pushing a stroller with a baby in it and somehow that comes into awareness enough that the system takes it into

40
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:07,280
account um but you weren't really seeing anything but you know consciously

41
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,280
but somehow that awareness was there so

42
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:20,400
i don't know how accessible this will be for you today but perhaps for the sitting today

43
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:28,479
maybe there can be little moments where you can appreciate this little moments of maybe being in awe of

44
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,520
it inspired by it that we have this capacity

45
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,639
or maybe there'll be moments where you can't understand why this is a big deal

46
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,160
why is it so important because we have important things to think and to

47
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,280
do and and we have to get on with it and just to do something that's so

48
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:55,120
uh we're not applying ourselves can seem like you know

49
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,320
what's the point but we do apply ourselves mostly to get

50
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:06,000
out of the ways to stay in the current to place ourselves back in the current

51
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,360
and then allow this awareness to be there and to carry us and maybe it's the

52
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,120
current the river of of our present moment experience

53
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,360
or maybe it feels like there's a river of awareness itself that flows through experience of the

54
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,280
present moment something like that

55
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,520
so assuming a meditation posture

56
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:45,360
and just as you're here even before you close your eyes if they're not closed

57
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,800
what comes into awareness effortlessly

58
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,199
what you become aware of that you're not directing your attention to focus on or

59
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,680
it kind of comes into peripheral vision

60
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:27,440
maybe what comes into awareness that there was no plan to have that be there

61
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,120
just there without planning or directing attention and

62
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,400
a sound

63
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:48,439
a particular body sensation if your eyes are open in particular

64
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,599
sight object

65
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:03,520
it's possible that almost seemingly immediately after something comes to awareness

66
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:09,680
unexpectedly and effortlessly the mind kicks in with effort and

67
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,520
directedness and reflection

68
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:26,720
that's okay but see if you can even for moments

69
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:34,160
recognize and appreciate when awareness seems effortless or

70
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,560
undirected as it knows something

71
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,680
now you might gently close your eyes

72
00:07:52,560 --> 00:08:00,400
and with this kind of under on kind of receptive open

73
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,120
maybe seemingly effortless awareness the closest you can to doing it

74
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,319
without doing anything more or fixing anything or changing anything

75
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:19,120
become aware of the tensions in your body the places where you're tight places

76
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,400
that we usually relax during this meditations but don't relax them

77
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,879
just let them be in this field of awareness

78
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:38,000
and let them appear in whatever way they want to appear in the different parts of the body

79
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:46,560
maybe without attention centered on any one of them

80
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:54,360
but just gently in its own way floating between them

81
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,839
notice any tendency to want to relax the body

82
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:30,800
and that that desire to relax the body let that just be one more thing that

83
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:37,600
awareness knows without needing to do anything

84
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,920
awareness does not need to do anything at all except be aware

85
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:54,480
if you need to do something experiment with just being aware of the

86
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:01,440
feeling of that need letting it just exist in a

87
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,839
field of this effortless awareness

88
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:42,160
and maybe as if you're pulling the curtains on a window and now see the landscape outside

89
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:50,000
kind of like you're pulling the curtains for your breathing

90
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,760
the landscape is the body breathing

91
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,200
and what a part of breathing experience of breathing comes into

92
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:12,920
awareness effortlessly unplanned

93
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:48,959
the particular sensations of the in-breath and out-breath don't last

94
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,240
when one ends

95
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:03,880
what's the next sensation that comes into awareness

96
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:26,399
you're watching the river of experience in the river in the breathing

97
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,320
it's like watching the little waves on the top of the river

98
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:41,200
that go by watching all the different sensations

99
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:55,839
putting aside needing to do anything accomplish anything

100
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,200
in favor of

101
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,760
appreciating whatever way there's a naturalness and

102
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:16,160
awareness in whatever way once in a while

103
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:24,320
it seems that awareness operates without direction and without

104
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:33,880
you doing the awareness just aware

105
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:44,000
yeah you don't have to give any concern

106
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,880
to how you're not doing today's practice not managing to do it

107
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:02,480
only kind of begin again noticing how it is working

108
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:10,399
maybe it's a most clearest time is when a sound or a sensation or a thought

109
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,000
arises uninvitingly unplanned

110
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,880
is just there in awareness in that first moment

111
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,600
it's there effortlessly

112
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,039
and what happens to the naturalness or the effortlessness of awareness

113
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:39,399
if you make a very small half smile with the corner of your lips

114
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:44,480
resting in awareness as you would rest in an

115
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:50,159
easy chair rest in a

116
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:57,640
back into a soft mattress is resting in awareness

117
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:17,919
and then whatever way you can appreciate

118
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:24,240
the naturalness of awareness the effortless quality that can be there

119
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:32,240
the way that awareness could operate without directing the mind or doing awareness

120
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,960
and in that natural awareness

121
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:46,080
is there any in and of itself within itself not within you

122
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,120
is there any attachment

123
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:59,640
any fear any aversion or

124
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:11,360
clinging is there a place of awareness

125
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:19,039
a way of being aware that is absent of clinging absent of

126
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,679
attachment

127
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,000
absent of being for or against

128
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:49,520
and what we're focusing on here is the awareness itself not what awareness knows

129
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:56,720
the awareness might know attachment it might know clinging or

130
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,320
but the simplicity of that awareness which

131
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,559
is there even when you're not trying to be aware

132
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,840
in and of itself is it free

133
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:18,600
of attachment and fear

134
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:47,440
and those of you who can sense something like this

135
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:53,840
take one last moment here in the meditation to appreciate

136
00:29:53,840 --> 00:30:01,440
knowing a place within free of attachment free of clinging free

137
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,600
of fear

138
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:51,000
and to the degree to which you can be aware without attachment without fear

139
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,679
without

140
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:04,559
asserting yourself let that attention move now towards

141
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:09,760
the people in your life in your neighborhood

142
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,240
places of work family friends strangers your

143
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,840
people in stores you go to

144
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,200
and perhaps this simple natural awareness

145
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:40,720
can be a clearing a clarity through which

146
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:45,840
your kindness your

147
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:49,760
love your friendliness

148
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,880
can flow outwards to them

149
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:10,080
may the clarity of awareness allow us to love more

150
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,120
freely and in that love

151
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,880
as an expression of that love may we wish well for others

152
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,720
may all beings be happy

153
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:34,240
may all beings be safe

154
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,600
may all beings be peaceful

155
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,840
may all beings be free

156
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:52,360
and may we contribute to that possibility

157
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:12,920
[Music]

158
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,000
thank you all

159
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:31,840
and while i drink my water if some of you would like to write what the meditation was like for

160
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,120
you or how well or not well you could tap into this idea of

161
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:43,200
natural or effortless awareness and i'm sure that some of you it didn't

162
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,960
work and that's those comments are just as valuable as those that it

163
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,880
was useful for and then those comments maybe will help me kind of know how to direct my

164
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,519
little dharma talk

165
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,960
so thank you all for the comments i'm seeing and the ones that are still coming

166
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,480
i'll read them all um at the end when we stop here and so i

167
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:23,440
appreciate looking at them then but for now i'd like to say a few words

168
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:29,440
so we're coming to the end of this many weeks

169
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:37,200
teachings on sati patana the sati patana which the title of which i like to

170
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:42,480
translate it as um the

171
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,920
ways of establishing the four ways of establishing

172
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,920
awareness the establishments for awareness

173
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:02,240
and the emphasis what we're trying to do here is not understand

174
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,280
so much these areas of our life that's certainly part of it

175
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,359
but we're also establishing awareness when and then we're abiding in that

176
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:18,720
awareness and and that awareness isn't uh

177
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,240
involves a clarity involves being able to remain in the present moment

178
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,000
that ability to remain centered in the present moment is often associated with

179
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,880
concentration to be concentrated and focused here and now but often with

180
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,039
concentration there's a for many people they assume that um

181
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,960
that concentration is kind of a laser focus or a tightening of focus onto something

182
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:56,880
and the way that i understand somalia here is that it's an undistractedness

183
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,800
in the present moment where all our our whole being starts getting gathered together

184
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,920
to be aware here and now without the distractions

185
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:15,440
this is to do this well uh comes at the end of a long period of doing sati patana

186
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,599
practice and um and it might for some people it they might get the hang of it quickly

187
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:27,040
some people it might take years and years you'll see in a moment it might take

188
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:33,440
them seven years to develop it to some degree but one of the nice qualities that

189
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,599
happens is as we get some sense of the naturalness of awareness or the effortless of awareness

190
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,839
or the the the way that we can um

191
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:51,599
practice letting go of the distractions from awareness but then abide in awareness awareness not something we do

192
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,119
it's something that we allow for something that we stay in

193
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:02,240
and uh and and avoid it's like staying in a current in a river

194
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:08,320
and you're floating down the river and um and i i said this earlier but

195
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,359
this recording is will might live differently from what i said

196
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:19,040
so floating down the river and you can stay in the current but if it looks like you're going to veer off the

197
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:27,040
current into an eddy or into the side of the river then you make a small adjustment to come back into and then the river carries you

198
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:34,720
so the effort at some point becomes not an effort to be aware but the effort to avoid being distracted

199
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,079
being caught in something and then come back be here come here

200
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:45,599
at some point uh there starts to be a recognition

201
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,640
that in this awareness this awareness itself in an in and of itself

202
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:57,359
there is a kind of freedom there is a a absence

203
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:02,560
of attachment of clinging maybe fear anger

204
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:08,640
hostility even desires are absent in this awareness

205
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:16,160
even healthy desires we can still have them all these things still exist but we start

206
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,440
taking up residency in the awareness we don't have residency in our anger

207
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:28,720
residency our fear those things can still exist to some degree but we're not prioritizing them we're

208
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,240
not giving them undue attention and importance

209
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:40,720
they can be there and we can take care of them wisely but we realize we're we're not those we're not identified

210
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:47,599
with them and if we want to identify with anything we identify with this awareness that we

211
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,119
can't do that just is there but more importantly though is that we

212
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:59,040
start seeing how this awareness is free of clinging and knowing that this exists that this

213
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:05,280
possibility is there is a fantastic knowing oh it is possible

214
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,400
to be free of attachment amazing

215
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,920
i get a glimmer of it i have a hint of it but wow it's possible to be free

216
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,599
of jealousy of judgmentalism of cynicism of

217
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:27,119
of craving of avariciousness of

218
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,160
um all kinds of things that are absent in that place

219
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:40,400
and it's possible to live in the world effectively established and abiding in this place

220
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,160
to know that is to know something really important so now i'd like to read

221
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,599
the last part of this text that we were doing all these weeks and

222
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:57,839
it's kind of the conclusion to it all and

223
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:03,440
it says so that the buddha says practitioners

224
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:10,000
if anyone should develop these four foundations

225
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,520
for awareness in such a way for seven years

226
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:22,480
one of two fruits results could be expected of that for that person

227
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:30,480
either final knowledge here and now or if there's a trace of clinging left

228
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,720
non-return so if a person does this practice seven years

229
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:43,520
they can expect one of two results final knowledge here and now to in this

230
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:50,640
lifetime here to attain final awakening here's called final knowledge

231
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:57,440
and and what it's a knowledge of it's not knowledge about the cosmos and the inner

232
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,640
workings of the mind or you know the details of you know

233
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:09,119
physics or something final knowledge is a knowledge

234
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:16,480
that the mind is without clinging wow and really know this wow this bind

235
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,680
here has no clinging in it amazing

236
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:29,040
and what i was pointing trying trying to point to today is we can get a

237
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:37,839
early hints of that possibility so we know it's possible some as we develop awareness as we

238
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,960
find ourselves more and more aware and

239
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:49,280
and don't confuse it with having clinging it's a part of you

240
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:58,079
that is free of clinging it's a part of you that's for your fear and it's found in the awareness itself

241
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:05,760
and then it says either after seven years you'll have full awakening final knowledge here and now

242
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:13,040
or if there's a trace of clinging left non-return non-return means that when you die

243
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:19,200
you in this old idea of rebirth i mean the common buddhist idea of rebirth that you

244
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:25,920
will not return as a human being but you'll do the final work the final liberation finally letting go in this

245
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,920
liminal space somewhere beyond your death

246
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,839
and um and um

247
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:44,160
and in seven years so i the usual interpretation of this is

248
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,200
that this means seven years that this is the primary occupation a person is

249
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:55,839
involved in doing this practice so classically it's someone who can do this would be monastics and

250
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:02,800
really give their life over to it and that seems pretty phenomenal but the buddha goes on and says

251
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:09,839
let alone seven years if anyone should develop these four foundations for awareness in such a way

252
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:14,880
for six years they'll have have one of these two

253
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,640
fruits or for five years or for four years three years two years

254
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,839
for one year one of two fruits should be expected

255
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:31,200
either final knowledge here and now or if there's a trace of clinging left

256
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:37,119
non-return let alone one year

257
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,400
if anyone should develop these four foundations for awareness in such a way

258
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,760
for seven months for six months for five months for four months

259
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:55,119
for three months for two months for one month for half a month one of two fruits could be expected

260
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:02,720
either final knowledge here and now or if there's a trace of clinging left non-return

261
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:09,839
let alone half a month if anyone should develop these four foundations for awareness in such a way

262
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:14,880
for seven days one of two fruits can be expected

263
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:22,240
either final knowledge here and now or if there's a trace of clinging left non-return

264
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:28,400
so it seems pretty you know phenomenal to do this inner work in seven days

265
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:34,560
they're probably you know in the billions of people that exist in the planet there are people who can uh

266
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:40,960
probably are prepared and have a certain kind of capacity potential that maybe they can

267
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:46,400
drop into a deep state and find their way all the way to to the end

268
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:52,160
for most of us it's uh this is not if you don't attain final knowledge in

269
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:58,480
that this kind of speed but uh it's possible to have

270
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:04,720
knowledge of this recognize that it becomes part of us

271
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:11,359
it's not complete it's not the final but it's we're well on the way we've had an

272
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:18,240
experience we know this possibility of non-clinging and to have confidence in it to feel

273
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:25,359
that it's value no it's valuable it's one of the most valuable things a human being can can do with this lifetime

274
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:30,400
is to discover this place within this this place or this

275
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:37,040
possibility or this i don't know if it's within it's just once you're in the in awareness there's

276
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:43,440
no insight and outside where there's a freedom from suffering

277
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,640
then our compassion for the world knows how it's

278
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,920
how fully it's possible to help support people to become free of

279
00:47:53,920 --> 00:48:01,119
suffering to have compassion for people who suffer and provide them with

280
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:06,559
band-aids is great if there's a wound i mean i never want to

281
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:13,920
not offer band-aids that are needed and i celebrate the people who do

282
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:20,240
and to really know how thoroughly people can be

283
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:26,480
freed of their suffering is to have this knowledge in experiential knowledge inside of

284
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:32,839
ourselves of this possibility then we can be a beacon then we can point people and then we can support

285
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:39,040
people to to the full potential to become free of suffering the very

286
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:46,000
goal of compassion the text goes on a little bit more

287
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:52,000
and then we'll stop for today so it was with reference to this

288
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:59,040
that it was said this is the direct plat this is the direct path for the purification of

289
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:05,760
beings for this amounting of sorrow and lamentation for the disappearance of pain and grief

290
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:13,920
for the attainment of the of the of the way for realization of nibana namely

291
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:21,119
the four foundations for awareness this is what the buddha said

292
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:27,760
the practitioners were satisfied and delighted in the buddha's words

293
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:33,680
so that's the end of the text and um we'll have the rest next four days of

294
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:39,599
the week to kind of also finish up this whole text and suta and

295
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:45,280
and so thank you for today and

296
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:51,520
during this day of your life maybe you can

297
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:58,720
try to have a heightened attentiveness to when awareness operates

298
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:04,640
without you directing it you making it happen the awareness where

299
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:13,000
your ordinary self is not the agent for the awareness you're just aware in a natural way

300
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:19,078
so thank you and i'll see you tomorrow
