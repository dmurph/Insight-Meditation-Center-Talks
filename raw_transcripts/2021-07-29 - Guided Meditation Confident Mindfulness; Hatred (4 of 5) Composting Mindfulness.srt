1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:12,000
welcome everyone and uh thank you for the greetings that are in

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
the chat youtube chat and thank you all for being here

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,599
and thank you those of you who have come been coming regularly for some of you well over a year now and

4
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:32,800
i think all this has added inspiration momentum to me and i think many of us

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,039
for the practice and engagement with the teachings

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,120
so uh today's guided meditation is based on a little bit of what's going

7
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:54,960
to be said during the darmette following here and i want to do a little

8
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,320
uh caveat first and that is that what i'm gonna teach might not be

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,439
suitable for everyone and uh for for wonderful important

10
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:15,439
reasons so what i'm offering is not supposed to be like this is a better way or the right way for anyone and that

11
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:22,320
there might be good reasons for you to not to have other other approaches other ways are practicing mindfulness which

12
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,520
is more appropriate for many circumstances including what you're working on these days in

13
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:34,400
terms of developing your practice so please you know use some discernment

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,439
of whether to go along with what i'm saying or you're

15
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:47,600
welcome to if it seems like it's going in the wrong direction to tune me out turn off the sound maybe and

16
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,799
and then just kind of sit quietly in your way and uh

17
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,520
so that the the topic is um strength

18
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:09,360
to bring a sense of strength be a power

19
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:17,120
to engaging in mindfulness practice and i would uh like to

20
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,800
suggest that it's not so much a matter of

21
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:31,120
overriding how we are to be powerful or strong in the practice but rather to um realize a certain kind

22
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:40,319
of inner strength and power that is being channeled or which is uh engaging

23
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,480
our capacity to be mindful and this uh you know personal power kind

24
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:51,680
of inner power strength maybe a vitality

25
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,000
i associate with things like confidence nothing to sit with

26
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,640
really strong confidence gives a kind of strength to people

27
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,159
to uh sit with courage sometimes sometimes it's what we are working with is quite

28
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:17,840
difficult and what we have to be present for is challenging and to sit with um

29
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:25,280
a certain kind of courage and again not the courage that uh is bypassing how we are but that it

30
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,000
rises from deep inside and moves through and supports and engages all of who we are so that we're

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,599
not limited by anything or held back or held in check and so there's a fullness that can come

32
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:46,319
a certain kind of fullness and so the art of this

33
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:54,319
is to discover just that how uh we can use our

34
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:00,239
um a kind of a native strength you know something that's in

35
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,680
here almost inherent within us in our whole psycho physical system a capacity for

36
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,920
letting the energetic engagement feel like it's not even us doing it but

37
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:19,359
rather allowing the systems to express a kind of wonderful

38
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:26,840
yes hey yes i'm here yes i'm going to be present in a full

39
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,960
way and when there's that kind of energy of strength or power

40
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:41,040
that it's very easy for that to be channeled into thinking into agitation in the mind

41
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,000
and so the art of it is to learn how to in a certain way be have a kind of a

42
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,120
cognitive quiet or calm that is

43
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:00,400
almost like because we're not thinking a lot or caught up in thought that

44
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,560
it's like there's more room for a physical almost a physical embodied

45
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,720
strength to support us here to be really here and that would be the the kind of goal

46
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,280
of tapping into our personal strength is a strength for being present

47
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:27,120
a strength for just be being really here like embodied yes to yes here i'm going to

48
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:34,639
this whole system is going to be here in a clear engaged open

49
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:41,440
energetic way that is a balance creates kind of a partnership

50
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:48,800
with a certain kind of vitality and a stillness so

51
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,720
if this doesn't make sense for you um you know plea please don't uh hold it

52
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,880
up as being you know a better way or the right way to practice mindfulness and

53
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,160
but uh if it makes sense you might experiment with it this time

54
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:14,240
so to assume a posture and if it's possible to

55
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,160
have a posture that expresses some degree of confidence

56
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:27,759
and you might adjust your posture maybe very slightly to have a feeling of confidence

57
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:34,479
in the posture you might not tap into some innate confidence

58
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:43,680
but to assume a posture which is an expression of posture of confidence like if you were an actor

59
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,960
what would you you know if you were going to show a confidence dance

60
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:56,400
not not not too dramatically like an actor but just very subtly

61
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:05,039
and gently close your eyes

62
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:15,440
and without do breathing deeply different than you ever you do other times begin by breathing

63
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:23,680
deeply and recognize in the deeper inhales and longer exhales there is a

64
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,479
some degree of confidence strength

65
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,880
that's being manifested

66
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:50,879
and as you may maybe a longer exhale appreciating that energy of confidence or strength

67
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,240
allow yours allow yourself to also relax

68
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:03,120
all the physical must the muscles which are being held and tense

69
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,639
almost as if those muscle tense muscles are interfering with

70
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:27,120
a inner confidence

71
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:34,000
and then to let your breathing return to normal

72
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:43,360
and again with a little bit of confidence as you exhale

73
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,880
relax the parts of your body maybe with the word yes

74
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,640
that expresses that confidence and relaxing to be present

75
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,000
exhaling and relaxing the face

76
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:22,800
softening exhaling and relaxing the shoulders

77
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:37,839
and then with a yes as you exhale softening the belly

78
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,519
and then scan through your body and see if there's any location in your

79
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,920
body where it seems to be the

80
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:02,079
clearest location for you to have confidence

81
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:09,440
or courage or a sense of strength

82
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:19,839
either because you know from previous experience that that's the place or you feel it now

83
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:27,839
and it could be anywhere it could be this kind of strength in your belly

84
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,160
a fire kind of it could be in the chest where the word

85
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,959
courage comes from the word heart in french

86
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:47,839
it could be in a sense of strength in the spine

87
00:10:52,000 --> 00:11:01,839
or maybe it lives in the hands legs and the feet

88
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,200
and if you can as you exhale

89
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,000
relax into that location in your body

90
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:28,320
almost like you're letting go of your thoughts and letting go into whatever feeling of strength or

91
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:43,839
confidence that you have in your body

92
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:02,720
and any feeling of vitality or strength in your body is present

93
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,879
moment experience it's not a memory or a

94
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,839
plan for the future the experience the feelings the sensations of

95
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,240
vitality energy confidence

96
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,519
strength his present moment

97
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,120
here in the present allowing that to support

98
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:45,040
or enable mindfulness maybe an

99
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:53,839
embodied sense of awareness body fullness

100
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,560
keeping you grounded or rooted

101
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:21,200
in the present moment body experience

102
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,959
and perhaps whatever sense of confidence or strength you can feel

103
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,160
maybe you can let it spread and be global enough

104
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,360
to include the body breathing

105
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,120
as if it animates or supports or

106
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,839
is channeled with through the breathing

107
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:04,880
so a confidence of being here with each breath

108
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:20,560
and if the energy seems to be building too strongly remember to relax as you exhale

109
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:27,199
soften so the energy doesn't get

110
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:34,240
concentrated in any one place in the body but a global soft

111
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:45,839
open feeling of confidence and courage

112
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:59,839
letting the thinking mind become quiet

113
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:06,560
and letting this strength or confidence

114
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,920
cooperate with whatever feeling of peacefulness

115
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,399
calm that might be here as you practice

116
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:41,839
a calm confidence a peaceful strength

117
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:55,839
not letting the strength or energy override the peacefulness and calm

118
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,240
if it does then maybe let go of the strength and the confidence

119
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:09,839
to settle in deeper

120
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,919
you

121
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,919
you

122
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,919
you

123
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,360
and now shift your attention

124
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:58,080
just a little bit from the sense of inner strength or confidence to whatever sense of

125
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:06,400
inner peace or calm there might be no matter how small or

126
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,080
background it might be feel

127
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,039
relax the thinking mind and settle into that

128
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:26,080
feeling of calm and peace so that

129
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,840
present moment peacefulness or calmness

130
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:44,480
is a little bit more what carries your mindfulness your awareness

131
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:52,158
so the sense of gentle yes gentle tender

132
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:58,559
mindfulness can be infused

133
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:13,840
with a peacefulness and calmness

134
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,919
you

135
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,919
you

136
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,919
you

137
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,919
you

138
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,360
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

139
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:07,840
to appreciate the capacity of human beings of others

140
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:16,640
and yourself to live a life

141
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,679
which when where our life energy does not feel held in check by

142
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:31,840
fear or attachments within or by the social conditions around us

143
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:44,559
where confidence and courage is not channeled through

144
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:52,880
an aggressiveness that then limits or intimidates others

145
00:28:52,880 --> 00:29:00,960
but is a kind of freedom of a wonderful yes

146
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:09,039
and a feeling that we're not we're able we're confident that we're able to make a difference in the world

147
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,039
we have the ability and the capacity

148
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,600
to make this world a better place

149
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:31,679
even if it's quite small even if it's very local in our own lives

150
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:40,720
people immediately around us

151
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,919
and to turn that your heart inside out

152
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:58,320
to gaze upon the world kindly compassionately tenderly

153
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:09,360
and to wish both for happiness and well-being and freedom for

154
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:17,039
others and to wish that you have within you

155
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,840
the appropriate yes

156
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,240
that you would like to support this possibility

157
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:36,720
yes may all beings be happy

158
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,760
yes may others feel safe

159
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:51,840
yes may i contribute to a peaceful world

160
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,600
yes may we all together

161
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,840
find ways to work for freedom

162
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,158
for liberation of all beings

163
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:19,840
yes may we live for the welfare and happiness of the whole world

164
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:50,320
so today i'm offering the fourth talk on on the

165
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:58,399
topic of ill will hatred hostility and the talk is not meant to

166
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:05,279
be standing as a stand-alone talk certainly it's meant to kind of be a continuation of the first three talks

167
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:11,519
that set the ground for today but also it's kind of meant to be a

168
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:17,919
continuation of a long period of time focusing on

169
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:24,399
mindfulness practice buddhist practice and it's meant for people who have

170
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:29,600
a strong grounding in mindfulness

171
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:36,080
and most specifically it's uh this talk is kind of meant for

172
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,840
um it's kind of little bit if i may i don't usually use this kind of language a little bit we think of it as an

173
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:47,120
advanced practice in the sense that it's really i'm really

174
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,320
offering it either as a possibility in the future

175
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,519
for some of you or those of you who have already cultivated a good sense of how to

176
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,840
practice mindfulness because

177
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:10,399
it builds on the capacity to be non-reactive with our experience

178
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:18,880
to be in a certain way to get out to get out of the way and to um

179
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:26,240
um allow what's within us to be there without being involved

180
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:32,559
without picking it up without getting caught in it without fueling it

181
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:41,200
and without trying to get rid of it or resisting it or trying to fix it and

182
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,600
and this is to learn this capacity and how to do it wisely so that we don't cause harm in the world

183
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:54,640
or harm to ourselves i think of meditation practice as a wonderful laboratory for it a wonderful

184
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:03,120
place because the topic is ill will hostility hatred

185
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:13,040
that's overlaps but it's not synonymous always with anger sometimes with fury

186
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:19,358
and and when we sit in meditation we're kind of committed for the duration

187
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:24,638
of the meditation practice to not act on any of these impulses to

188
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:31,040
sit with a body that's quiet and still and we're also kind of committed to not

189
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,158
intentionally and actively to be involved in the stories the ideas

190
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:41,440
the planning that are connected to these intense feelings of

191
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,760
ill will that might exist in us and what the practice is today in which

192
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:55,118
every thursday for these three weeks is composting these difficult states

193
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:01,040
or these intensities these things which in buddhism are considered poisons so rather than

194
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:07,520
condemning them learning how to be present for them so that they can be transformed

195
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,960
but not transformed because we're in there tinkering with them but the composting of them the way the

196
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:19,440
whole psychophysical system can has them has the capacity to move

197
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:26,160
them to greater health hostility hatred

198
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:34,320
is a form of illness inside it because it illness in the sense that it's self-harming and uh and can become kind

199
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,079
of a buddhist tradition of poison but rather than condemning it

200
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:47,839
there's a we allow the inner system to heal it to transform it to compost it

201
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:56,480
in a certain kind of way by allowing it so and this is sometimes it's

202
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:01,920
most useful when um when there's no you know kind of no other choice because it's so strong

203
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,680
the anger the hostility and so um if we have the ability to kind of be

204
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,920
present for it without getting entangled or caught by it and just allow it something different

205
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,599
can happen than if we're trying to fix it or if the self

206
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,240
identifies with it or pushes it away or somehow the self is in relationship

207
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:33,440
to it um so one of the advantages of this and one of

208
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:40,960
the is that our sense of personal strength even power a real vitality that

209
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,800
moves through us in a wonderful way

210
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,680
is overlaps or is connected to hostility and anger these are very

211
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:58,240
powerful states there's a lot of energy in them and rather than feeling that rather if

212
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:05,280
we kind of squash or push away or deny these powerful feelings of

213
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,640
we might also in some ways inadvertently kind of suppress the vitality the energy the strength the

214
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,839
confidence that can exist in us as well the suppression of anger the suppression

215
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:25,040
of hostility uh creates kind of a bottleneck or kind of a pressure cooker or unhealthy ways in

216
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:31,040
which this life vitality can then explode later on or

217
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,760
can fester within and and so one of the advantages of

218
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:43,920
connecting with uh mindfully practicing really careful careful mindfulness

219
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:51,839
with these strong kind of negative energies harmful energies is to um

220
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:59,680
one of the advantages is it also connects us to this inner strength and it's possible as we compost it and

221
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:06,480
transform this negative energy in a sense negative expression of this energy

222
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,160
it can be the energy can be retained or be made available for

223
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:18,640
positive things for healthy things for wholesome phenomena and

224
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:25,440
because i think in buddhist practice in a way over time the idea is to become

225
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:32,720
strong human beings to not have our inner strength or confidence or even courage

226
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:39,119
be somehow stifled but to actually be able to show up in the world

227
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:46,720
not aggressively assertively but you know with with a clear sense of stable upright

228
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:55,200
energy presence so composting hostility in meditation

229
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:01,359
and so we have to first learn the capacity to be present non-reactively to be present without

230
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:09,280
being for or against the sense of mindfulness becomes strong enough that it feels like it can open even

231
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:16,800
to be present here for this and when anger hostility is strong it's i think

232
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:23,680
it's best to look upon this as not you know just be able to do this continuously um used

233
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,680
to open and just kind of uh but rather that um it's uh

234
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:37,040
uh uh uh sequential it's a moment by moment that um

235
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:44,320
so it's like um like for we we might recognize oh there's anger here hostility here

236
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:50,480
and and then for a moment open up and feel in your body the what it feels like in the body like

237
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,760
let the body feel it um and uh and as soon as you're in your

238
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:02,480
body the body is in the present moment and the body is kind of a processing center

239
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:08,480
it's a way in which things can move and and and transform make space like we're

240
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:16,079
giving things breathing room for it to kind of relax open up sometimes it needs to get stronger

241
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:21,520
and and then the thoughts are there and you know we don't we're not to fighting

242
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,720
the thinking and and think we have to make that the

243
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,079
bl and end all to let go of the story and all that when we're practicing this composting

244
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:38,400
it's um it's moment by moment um opening to what's here oh this is what's happening

245
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:44,720
and in those few moments that we can open that's where the non-reactivity is that's where the freedom is

246
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:51,839
and then we have to do it again and again and sometimes we um and we just kind of

247
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:57,520
trust got opening again and again and what we're doing there and that constantly okay here

248
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,920
feel this feel be present for this is we are stepping away

249
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:11,040
from being entangled fueling identifying with feeding

250
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:17,520
the anger the hostility the hatred but to really give it room to as

251
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,640
if it could take care of itself it could transform itself

252
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:30,880
and so there's no need for shame there's no need for hostility towards our hostility and and

253
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,960
you know i don't know if i want to say no need for fear there's healthy fear

254
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,640
definitely around hostility and anger fear of causing harm but there's also

255
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,160
kind of no need to kind of um i don't know how to say this

256
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,920
um be somehow caught in the fear of it there's just

257
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,040
here here and um and sometimes it takes a while

258
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:05,760
for things to settle down open up transform and on the way we might realize that the

259
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,920
hostility the anger as i said yesterday is a symptom it's a messenger almost for

260
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,960
something deeper inside of us and by making room for it something in

261
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,319
the cracks of the of the of the ill will can show that

262
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:29,119
there's things like fear or hurt underneath it or and then if we open to that then

263
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:36,160
that itself begins to show that there's something deeper still and underneath it there's a sense of

264
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:43,200
maybe of care or compassion a sense of good will

265
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:50,480
or tenderness there's a whole other world deep inside waiting for us here that uh

266
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,720
sometimes is the uh is the uh is the very thing that's been

267
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:04,319
um challenged or overlooked or uh we're closed down around which

268
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:09,440
the very closeness to our tenderness our peacefulness our love our compassion

269
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:17,119
is part of what gives the some of the negative power to hostility and to be able to discover

270
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:26,400
this reservoir of peace of compassion and care of tenderness within and then that's where the energy

271
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:36,079
that's where the strength can us flow through and be here for and uh and then the energy of our life

272
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:44,400
um is not squashed or diminished but it can flow now through

273
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,960
good will instead of through ill will and a good will and a compassion that

274
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,240
maybe in circumstances needs to address the situations in the world

275
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:05,279
that are the conditions for anger or hostility there is injustice in the world there is

276
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:11,599
you know is that there is a injustice and harm that's being caused

277
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:18,560
in the world and to ourselves and so how to respond to that or how to

278
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:24,560
protect ourselves from that how to address that um with

279
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:31,520
with this sense of confidence and courage and uprightness of this deeper vitality

280
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:37,440
that you know that somehow gets skewed or becomes more dangerous

281
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,599
if that energy is channeled through hostility and anger but it this is not to do this practice

282
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,960
of composting and transforming is not meant to be an avoidance of

283
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:55,359
addressing the issues of our life and around us but rather to do so from a

284
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:01,440
a different place where we're rooted in the wholesome

285
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:09,280
treasures a wholesome you know roots of roots inside of us we're

286
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:15,920
rooted in generosity and love and compassion and wisdom but

287
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:23,280
in a way that people feel oh that's that there's strength there there's a real kind of chance to meet someone and

288
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,720
be with someone who is has um you know is uh is confident here

289
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:37,119
and is not is not diminishing themselves or

290
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:44,640
so um so i think that i feel a little bit uh you know cautious

291
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:49,680
in what i've offered here you know that it needs this what i'm

292
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,880
saying today needs to be done with great care and and certainly compassion and

293
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:02,720
gentleness and very careful monitoring of it so that this allowing and being present for

294
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:07,760
things like hatred and hostility and ill will uh very careful so that doesn't get

295
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:15,920
stronger than we then we can somehow manage and the the standard for knowing when is

296
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:21,440
stronger than we can manage is that um the it takes over so that

297
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:27,040
when we take open our eyes and take a deep breath we can't just feel grounded again or

298
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:32,480
can't feel kind of stable and and one of the ways of practicing this composting

299
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:38,880
is periodically in the meditation to pull ourselves out of it look around

300
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:44,960
take a deep breath somehow shake it off and then dip down again if it seems

301
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,640
appropriate but we don't want to let that pressure build and build and build because we're supposed to just kind of stick

302
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:57,040
through through it to the end of the meditation that's usually not so useful it's useful

303
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:04,480
this standard is just do it just well enough just good enough and trust

304
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,760
that over time the composting will happen not insist that it has to happen in one

305
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:16,480
sitting but rather it could do it just good enough and when you feel like it's getting the upper hand a little bit

306
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:23,280
then take a deep breath open your eyes maybe even get up and go for a walk and then come back

307
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:31,040
it is very important to kind of feel that you have some strength in not being pulled into it

308
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:39,359
just too much so composting transforming

309
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:46,079
and so we have one more talk tomorrow that's related to the liberation the liberation

310
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:54,480
from and of um ill will hatred so thank you all very much and

311
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:01,838
and i look forward to our time tomorrow
