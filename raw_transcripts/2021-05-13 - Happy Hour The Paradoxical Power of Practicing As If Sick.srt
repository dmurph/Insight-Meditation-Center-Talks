1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,600
so hello and welcome everyone to this rendition

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:16,800
of happy hour [Music] so so for today's practice

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,080
i wanted to invite us to explore an invitation that i have often given

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:30,240
on retreats to people as a way of practicing and i've heard other teachers in the

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,960
past have done this too so the invitation

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,079
is practice as if you are sick practice as if you are sick

7
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,120
as if you are ill as if you don't have a lot of energy

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,480
and you wonder okay why why would that be a wisdom

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,079
invitation why would that be wise at all so the idea

10
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,960
here the idea of course we'll be doing meta but we'll be practicing meta we'll be practicing

11
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:12,399
meta as if we are sick as if we don't have a lot of energy

12
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:21,040
and the wisdom here is that we often the way we approach practice the way we approach

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:27,680
practice is often can be often for many of us we bring the

14
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:33,439
same mind of wanting and doing and getting

15
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,880
and it needs to be the right way and they need to it needs to look pretty and it needs to

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,840
be this it needs to be that there is a lot of clinginess a lot of wanting a lot of energy

17
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,439
that we bring to to the both the self judgment judging

18
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:59,360
practice and the wanting like if it gets very tight and we can get um can

19
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,079
topple over our own shoestrings that we tie so tight so the idea of

20
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,280
practicing as if you're sick as if you're ill is you know consider when you're sick you

21
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,879
don't have a lot of energy you don't have a lot of energy the mind doesn't have

22
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:26,480
a lot of space for what is extra no space for fighting no space for

23
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,480
being you know cajoling for self-judgment for just all the tightness there's just no energy

24
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,760
for it there's only energy for what is essential

25
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,239
only energy for what is essential

26
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,800
so consider you know when when you were sick last

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,160
time or maybe you're not feeling well right now did you want to like call up far you

28
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,280
know flunk friends you hadn't talked to for um years or especially if you had an

29
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,200
argument with them to really work it out oh no just what what is essential what is essential is

30
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,280
care what is essential is care for this person for this being and maybe the people who

31
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,959
are around you just a simple care it gets life gets very simple

32
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:26,400
very simple when we're not feeling well the ambitions ambitions for more more more they go

33
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,760
away it becomes very simple in fact what is essential becomes

34
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:42,000
visible and i also wanted to bring this quote from uh from antoine saint-exuberee

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,120
in in the book the little prince which we can spend the whole

36
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,760
dharma talk and a whole other happy hour on it but the quote is it is

37
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,200
only with the heart that one can see rightly what is essential

38
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:09,280
is invisible to the eye what is essential is invisible to the eye so sometimes

39
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,599
when we don't have a lot of energy when we're actually sick ah

40
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:22,960
the simplicity of what is essential can become more visible to the eye to

41
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,240
the heart so that is the invitation for exploration today

42
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,440
and they'll walk us through it so for this practice you're welcome to be sitting or

43
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:40,960
you could be down to actually take a position of of not feeling well that sense of oh

44
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:46,080
i don't have a lot of energy and if you're worried you might fall

45
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:51,360
asleep lying down one thing you can do is you can have

46
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,840
your arm at a 90 degree angle either all the way up or at 90 degree angle at your elbow like

47
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,479
this if you can see it and if you fall asleep your arm will fall and hit you and will wake you up so

48
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,479
this is one trick you can use if you want to do this practice lying down which i do invite you actually

49
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:16,880
to try it out especially if you're judging mind things oh it's

50
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:25,360
practice you know sitting practice is where it's at no the buddha taught four different

51
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,360
postures sitting lying down standing and walking and they're all

52
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:39,520
just as good you can have ins and concentration and beauty and and a

53
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,680
lot of um dedicated practice deep practice can happen in any of those

54
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,360
four poses so don't let your mind privilege one over the other and if you

55
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:58,479
think okay it's only sitting no challenge yourself gently like a sick person kindly

56
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:05,120
challenge yourself to lie down and try see what what lights actually

57
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,160
might come up for you what insights but since you won't see me if i lie down

58
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,400
i'm going to sit up but rest assured i do most of my practice actually lying down

59
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,520
most of my deepest practice and insights have come lying down practice so

60
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,479
so without further ado let's get started let's get started so making yourself

61
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,840
comfortable whatever posture you like to take

62
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:49,840
ah landing landing in this body landing in this body

63
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:58,080
and what if this body in this moment uh taking a posture as if you are not feeling well

64
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:05,199
as if your energy was limited

65
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:31,360
letting go letting go of ambitions of more more and more in this moment

66
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,080
and as if you were not feeling well as if you were sick

67
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:46,240
let your body sink ah let your body sink into the cushion

68
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:59,840
all the tension tightness fighting with the circumstances

69
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,479
letting them sink letting them drain

70
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
away

71
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,200
and letting the breath be received by the

72
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:43,760
nourishing keeping this body alive

73
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:50,640
as if you were sick each breath

74
00:08:52,839 --> 00:09:00,240
precious each breath not to be taken for granted

75
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,160
the entirety of this breath just this

76
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,399
breath embraced

77
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:20,880
gently gently received can remember you're practicing as if you

78
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:29,600
were sick you don't have too much energy for wanting or fighting the circumstances

79
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:37,839
wanting things to be different just receiving letting go

80
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:51,839
it's like this right now

81
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,519
explore for yourself the next few minutes

82
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,519
just receiving the breath in the body what does it feel for you what does it feel like for

83
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:19,839
you to practice as if you were sick as if you were ill

84
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
so

85
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:26,000
there can be a sense of contentedness when we are sick sense of contentment to just

86
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:43,839
be and breathe be breathed

87
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:25,839
no fighting no resisting letting go

88
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:39,839
just receiving the breath

89
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
do

90
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
do

91
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,839
practicing as if you're sick

92
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,600
not enough energy in the mind and the body to get entangled

93
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,920
in thoughts you can watch them come and go but not so much energy to get entangled

94
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:36,399
in them it's watching them come and go

95
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:55,839
this breath is received the breath comes and goes

96
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,519
and light touch and lightness

97
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:14,639
that awareness can have receiving phenomena

98
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:23,839
not getting entangled in phenomena just receiving phenomena

99
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:42,880
our functioning is reduced to what is essential what is essential

100
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:52,320
like a sieve only what is essential

101
00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:00,000
is it tended to has participated in

102
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,839
a light touch

103
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,600
when the mind comes up with self-judgements ah not enough energy to get entangled and

104
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:30,840
follow that thread to beat ourselves up not enough energy for self

105
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,360
flagellation just let that thread go

106
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:47,840
come back with the sense of contentment the breath the body

107
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,880
with this light touch of awareness

108
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:11,840
just enough energy to be aware and receive phenomena

109
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,320
let there be a light touch of care

110
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:30,880
not forceful not tight

111
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:39,200
just a gentle care for this body for this being

112
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:47,200
as if you were sick wishing yourself well

113
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,840
not being hard on yourself this is not the time

114
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,679
to be hard on yourself

115
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,360
you wouldn't be hard on a child who was sick you would take care of the child

116
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,440
because having a fever is ill

117
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:24,000
that attitude that perspective is available to you [Music]

118
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,559
see what it feels like to put it on as if putting on glasses

119
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:35,840
that you look through

120
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:46,640
sense of gentle care as if you were sick person as if you were sick right now

121
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:53,508
this being for this body just [Music]

122
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
breathing

123
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:20,000
if there's enough energy in the supposedly sick body for the metaphases

124
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,039
bring them in and if they feel like a lot of work

125
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:35,360
don't or you can simplify them just may i be well may i be well

126
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,520
a sick version is an ill person's version

127
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:59,840
simplified low energy may i be well

128
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,840
to

129
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
to

130
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:07,440
practicing as if sick so many things can be let go

131
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:16,960
whatever is extra not needed over efforting can be let go of

132
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:24,600
simple simply receiving breath

133
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:31,360
sensations the sense of care and kindness

134
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:38,559
for this being this body

135
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,039
that is

136
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,840
myself

137
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:21,840
only what is essential

138
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,399
everything gets simplified when we're

139
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,840
sick

140
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,960
with not enough energy in our minds to go after

141
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:59,520
what's not essential see if you can feel the simplicity in

142
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:08,720
your body in your heart and mind

143
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:17,840
the mind goes after a thought or a story self-judgment ah

144
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:24,398
i'm sick i don't have energy for this coming back

145
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:37,840
to the simplicity of this moment

146
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,840
the

147
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:49,839
to

148
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,838
for the last two moments of this practice period

149
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:54,720
if there are any judgments arising for what this practice period was whether the mind was restless

150
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:00,240
or sleepy or filled with thoughts

151
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:07,839
again as if you're a sick person without the end to fight with yourself ah

152
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:14,640
letting go letting go of what's not essential

153
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:21,040
these self-criticisms not important not essential

154
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:31,760
don't need to be followed or believed letting them go practicing

155
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:41,838
like a sick person the mind staying with what is essential

156
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:50,240
may all beings everywhere

157
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:09,839
be well may all beings everywhere be free in their hearts and minds

158
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:23,839
thank you for your practice

159
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:30,160
so so this invitation

160
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:38,640
practices if you are sick it can quite radical for some

161
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:46,000
and for some you may not have connected with it and that's perfectly fine not every practice works for

162
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,119
everyone or at a given time maybe we'll work at another time when you try it

163
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:59,520
and for some people you might find this completely revolutionary the sense of ease a sense of letting go

164
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:07,680
practicing as if you were sick a couple of other things also to say before i invite and open

165
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:12,880
the floor for insides

166
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:23,040
is that at some point in your life you will be sick and this can also serve as a practice

167
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:28,640
period as a practice for that how do we relate when our mind doesn't have the energy

168
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:35,760
what is the attitude we will take is it one of wanting things to be different or do one to one that embraces

169
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,800
things as they are and really relishes this low energy state

170
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:49,200
of how it serves for us to just um engage with what is essential

171
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:56,960
on retreat sometimes when folks get a cold or they get sick and and they're upset

172
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,320
saying oh i came to practice this whole week and now i'm going to be in bed with a fever and

173
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,920
they're upset um i actually celebrate

174
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:14,240
that it is an opportunity we learn so much and they usually well they actually when after they turn

175
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:20,800
towards it and practice with it it becomes such an opportunity for insight becomes such an opportunity i've

176
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:27,359
had many people um including myself if i remember the very first retreat i was sick on the

177
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:34,400
first i was bummed years and years ago like oh i came here to practice and then i got this this invitation to actually

178
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,640
use it as an investigation as an opportunity to to see how the mind that doesn't have

179
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:48,240
a lot of energy how it relates it was so insightful so now using this as a

180
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,720
practice guidance so like to open it now for your insights you can type them in

181
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:01,359
chat either privately to be i won't say your name or publicly for everyone in which case

182
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:10,160
i'll read your name or you can raise your zoom hand and i would love to hear your

183
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:16,160
your insights what you discovered what was this like for you

184
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:24,400
compared to the usual way so please

185
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:31,200
what did you notice was it easier to let go of thoughts

186
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:39,838
habitual tendencies

187
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:53,839
was there more ease more spaciousness or maybe less what did you notice

188
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:13,280
arya says definitely more ease nice thanks for sharing that and lisa

189
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,560
please hi hi um i noticed

190
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,838
i was able to offer compassion to my young self

191
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,119
um who was sick during a time

192
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,838
and it was a challenging time

193
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:42,400
so that was helpful and also made me reflect on my attitude toward

194
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:49,599
being sick which i actually experienced with the meta retreat with you and i really struggled um

195
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:56,400
and until getting the instruction it's like a perfect time to practice meta and so that

196
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:03,760
combined with this i think it's just helpful to see my my own attitude towards myself when i'm

197
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:09,200
sick and um be able to be a bit warmer

198
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:16,720
and understanding thank you thank you lisa

199
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,440
lovely beautiful

200
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,599
thank you for sharing your insight

201
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:37,119
now i saw your hand for a split second did it get resolved i liked it

202
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,920
there you are yeah

203
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:49,359
hey nikki hey everyone uh what came up for me in this practice

204
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:55,599
was a question of when am i really well

205
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:02,880
i think in some ways there's always a reason that there's always reason that somehow

206
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:10,720
arises on why i can't practice sometimes and and in a way kind of connecting with

207
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,720
this idea of when we are sick kind of reinforces

208
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:24,000
i think something you've always said nikki which is that uh practice extends beyond sitting it's it extends beyond our

209
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:31,680
formal ideas of what sitting is so i just wanted to uh to share that with everyone

210
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:41,040
thank you now yeah i appreciate your reflection it i'd to if you would say a little more

211
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,800
so i can understand better when you said brought up the inquiry or the question

212
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:53,119
when am i ever well what do you mean by that say you say more so as

213
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:59,280
as you were guiding us through thinking about sickness for some reason i thought what does it mean to be well

214
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:05,920
yeah and again you know uh sometimes when i when

215
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,680
i haven't wanted to practice it's been because of one reason or the other and there was a retreat actually that i

216
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,960
was not well uh at and i remember thinking okay i'm not going to practice now because i'm not

217
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,319
well but you know you know if if the practice

218
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:30,240
is simply observing uh ourselves and meeting ourselves where we are yeah that in a way the idea of being

219
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:36,640
well and being sick is all just different kinds of practice yeah yeah yeah

220
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,680
yeah i see absolutely i see what you're saying yeah exactly and and with this um

221
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:48,240
[Music] given that they're all different ways different filters

222
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:54,319
and with this assuming but putting on what we assume being sick is like this

223
00:44:54,319 --> 00:45:01,200
this low energy state it actually uh i found it to be so freeing so freeing

224
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,599
the times that i've crashed and i have been sick oh the mind just doesn't want to go after what's not essential there's a

225
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:15,119
sense of just cutting just letting go natural letting go that wow my mind knows how to do this you

226
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:20,240
don't already know how to do this it knows he knows how to do this

227
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:25,359
perfectly well i don't need to go into a monastery and become a monk and all that

228
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:32,880
it knows how to do this so taking on this perspective of sickness can really light up like oh this mind knows

229
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:39,440
how to let go how to not go after um what's not essential yeah and then

230
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:48,079
yes and just different ways of meeting yeah thank you now yeah beautiful tanner says

231
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:53,119
the invitation to come to practice from a place of meekness

232
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:58,240
almost was a relief oh beautiful thank you for putting it that way

233
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:06,000
and another reflection sent just to me so i won't read the name i notice myself hold my breath in more a tendency

234
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:13,760
i am aware of in general and perhaps has resurfaced as a result of not having meditated as much as i have in

235
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:21,280
the past i have a chronic condition which has caused some pain and while practicing i realized even more my

236
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:28,960
body has been asking me to take care of myself oh beautiful thank you for sharing that beautiful

237
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:35,520
insight that realization and frederica says i really recognized

238
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:44,319
how gentle i am with myself when i am sick beautiful and how i accept support from myself and others

239
00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:50,800
and i really felt how the past year when the world was sick i was gentle with myself and supportive

240
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:57,119
of myself and it was healthy and i want to hold on to that gentleness as i'm emerging back

241
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:05,680
into society beautiful thank you frederica that's beautiful insight yeah just gentleness

242
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:12,400
with ourselves with the whole world yeah lovely thank you all for your reflections and

243
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,760
your insights so rich this community is so rich so

244
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:24,400
like to invite us to turn to practicing in

245
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:31,599
small groups in community together now and let's start with um just 15 seconds

246
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:37,440
of silent meta for these beings who might appear healthy but

247
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:43,200
are either have aches and pains or some sickness or have been or will be so

248
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:49,200
starting with this sense of meta compassion for each other

249
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,040
for ourselves and then sharing however much or little you like to share

250
00:47:55,040 --> 00:48:03,280
with each other so i'm about to open the rooms and here we go

251
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:12,319
welcome back everyone and we have about a minute or two for

252
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:21,839
maybe a final reflection we'd love to hear from any of you who haven't spoken yet

253
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:34,880
person who's okay i can see you person who's says iphone i see your hand there you go

254
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:42,240
hi how are you hi so i think i am new to practice

255
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:47,280
this is probably the fourth day of the i never practice in this matter

256
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:53,359
to be honest but it was it was at the end of my work and it just

257
00:48:53,359 --> 00:49:02,000
so vaccinated so much because i was already feeling very tired

258
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:10,319
what i said and i just feel like i just let it go myself and i feel like

259
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:15,680
so relaxed i never felt like such a relaxation like that

260
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:23,760
and i felt more grounded so much and i was able to completely concentrate

261
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:30,800
it's so funny isn't it i didn't even try anything at all but i was so

262
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:37,680
concentrated about how i feel so um just wanted to acknowledge that

263
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:44,000
thank you so much for giving us this opportunity experiencing such a different stage of

264
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:50,800
meditations appreciate you yeah thank you so much thanks for sharing your reflections and as you were speaking

265
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:55,920
i'm seeing other people nodding their heads saying yep yeah agreeing with you

266
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:04,000
it was useful more more concentrated and yes yes this is it you said it so

267
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:11,520
beautifully that we often think of meditation as okay now i'm gonna meditate no i'm gonna meditate where is really

268
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:17,119
it's more about letting go it's more about ah just relaxing the

269
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:22,960
body as if you were in a different mind a different way of being reveals itself

270
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:28,240
that that is the way to meditate not what we think it is it's another economy it is

271
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:33,440
not another accomplishment it's not another badge to add another thing to attain it's more

272
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:38,960
of letting go relaxing and just as you said the mind concentrates

273
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:44,000
lands the body lands there's nowhere to get

274
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,040
so beautiful thank you so much for sharing your wisdom of course

275
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:55,280
thank you thank you so dear all thank you so much for your

276
00:50:55,280 --> 00:51:00,960
practice together um we don't do this practice just for ourselves

277
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:08,160
but for all the beings whose lives we touch may all beings be happy may all beings

278
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,640
be free including ourselves

279
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,039
thank you
