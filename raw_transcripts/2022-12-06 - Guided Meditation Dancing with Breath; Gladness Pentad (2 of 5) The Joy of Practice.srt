00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:27,859
hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,340
I've spent time among the Redwoods trees lately

3
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:42,899
large Majestic trees it's kind of inspiring to see how straight they are how tall they are

4
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:51,079
how solid and strong looking up at a giant Redwood is quite an impressive sight

5
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,579
and the redwood tree has a very small seed I don't know if it's the smallest seed

6
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:04,680
among trees but it's a very very small and the small seed grows into a big

7
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,280
dream imagine that you have a seed you want to

8
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,560
plant a redwood tree and you go find a place in the forest

9
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:25,020
that you think might be a good place for it near your house perhaps and you take survey the territory and

10
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:30,500
understand the challenges the dangers the the

11
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:36,420
conditions that are there and in the middle of that you find a spot that you think given all the

12
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,060
conditions that are here uh here's a spot that I will plant the seed

13
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,180
and in this environment I will care for it I will water it and feed it and

14
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:54,560
until it becomes well established and then it can grow on its own

15
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,320
so in the same same way we are planting a seed for joy

16
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:06,540
and it can be a very tiny little seed

17
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:13,400
and uh and that seed can grow strong and big and tall

18
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:20,819
and we plant it by first taking into account

19
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:28,920
the feel the territory the forest where we'll plant it so all of ourselves

20
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:35,099
that kind of uh survey and understanding Clarity wisdom

21
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:40,800
about all of ourselves is included in this practice of mindfulness

22
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:47,540
The Good the Bad the Ugly the wonderful and the difficult

23
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,099
and it all has a place and in the middle of this large field of

24
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:59,819
our life we have this little seed of joy that we plant

25
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:08,220
and then we support it we nourish it with the nourishment the water of awareness

26
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:14,900
of the sunlight of awareness that shines on it so it can grow

27
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,500
and the particular um joy that we're interested here today

28
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:30,599
is not that being joyful about anything but the joy that comes from engaging in

29
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:36,060
something the activity so for example some people would find a

30
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:45,080
lot of joy and dancing or joy and singing or joy and

31
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:54,120
going for a walk or the joy of meditating

32
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,900
just the opportunity the possibility of that engagement there's some joy that can come from it

33
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:05,940
if we give ourselves to the experience

34
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:12,060
we turn our attention away from our concerns preoccupations

35
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:18,739
away from the weeds and the bushes and the vines that are growing around

36
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:27,060
to hear now maybe the breathing

37
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:33,180
and engage in it like you would something that brings you Joy just in

38
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:39,780
the activity of doing it the feelings of movement and freedom in

39
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,820
the body that feeling may be of like a dance all

40
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,020
of us who are included

41
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,639
and there that Joy this little seed that we want to plant so maybe there's we can

42
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:04,280
find that seed during this meditation so to

43
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:10,759
assume a comfortable alert meditation posture

44
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,280
where in assuming the posture there's some care given to the posture

45
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,320
as the beginning of this stance beginning of this entering into

46
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:32,538
her experience fully all of ourselves included including the body

47
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,620
it was sitting in a way that kind of you feel like you're really here in your body perhaps both feet planted

48
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:44,300
on the ground if you're sitting in a chair

49
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:53,120
you're feeling a solid connection to what supports the weight of your body

50
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:05,479
gently closing your eyes and here

51
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:18,180
here in this body at this mind at this time this is the field of practice the forest

52
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,440
where we plant a tree

53
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,160
to relax this body

54
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,139
to begin a wholeheartedness

55
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:44,060
by entering into this embodied experience of Here and Now

56
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:58,199
taking some deep breaths as part of the stance of with yourself

57
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,460
of being present

58
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:13,880
maybe the inhales like the lead dancer and the exhale is going to Follows

59
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:21,080
breathing in deeply and relaxing fully

60
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:33,979
and letting the body return to normal

61
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,080
the body the breathing returned to normal

62
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:05,039
and then finding your way to a place in your body

63
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:12,000
where you can feel connected participating

64
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:16,340
with the body breathing

65
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,639
maybe almost as if breathing is your partner and a dance

66
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:45,860
and being aware of the fullness of the inhaled fullness of the exhale

67
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,700
aware with the body

68
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:04,519
and what would it take for you to be present mindful of breathing

69
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:10,200
so the engagement with it the immersion with it

70
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:18,779
Devotion to it has some joy in it

71
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:24,800
some Delight some enjoyment pleasure

72
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:42,899
and if there is a little hint Joy Delight in the engagement with the

73
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:48,980
breathing gently water that

74
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,380
by being aware of it including that Joy

75
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:04,399
in the experience of breathing out in and breathing out

76
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:33,900
if your mind wanders off in thought don't despair

77
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:40,700
instead be glad that you're able to

78
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:46,160
gently bring your attention back to the breathing

79
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:55,440
it's an amazing good fortune to be able to begin again with breathing

80
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:03,000
it's amazing good fortune to practice mindfulness of breathing

81
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,640
the same practice the Buddha practiced

82
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:13,519
feel the joy of that engagement

83
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:21,539
The Good Fortune participating in the dance of breathing

84
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:24,860
in and breathing out

85
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,380
foreign

86
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:56,580
sometimes in Dancing with a partner there's a joy that comes with

87
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:02,880
surrendering to the dance maybe surrendering to the partner who

88
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,960
leads maybe there's a joy in surrendering

89
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:16,380
to the breathing following along participating being

90
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:24,140
carried along breathing in and breathing out

91
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:44,600
and then coming to the end of this sitting

92
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,900
breathing in and breathing out

93
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,900
breathing in and feeling whatever Joy however small

94
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:05,279
you might find Within maybe with a small half smile on your

95
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:11,039
lips breathe in and feel the joy

96
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:18,440
and breathe out imagine sending it forth out across the lands

97
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,720
that you share your joy your well-being

98
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,980
your inspiration

99
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:39,020
The Winds of your joy carrying your good will for the world

100
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:49,760
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

101
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:56,000
may all beings be peaceful

102
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:00,740
and may all beings be free

103
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:16,269
[Music]

104
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:37,760
so hello everyone

105
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:47,940
and this is the second thought uh talk on the gladness pentad

106
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:53,279
and as I said yesterday the remarkable thing about the gladness pent head

107
00:28:53,279 --> 00:29:00,960
is that it's a natural phenomenon that just like a seed with all the

108
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:08,520
conditions are in place will grow so when the seed is planted in US

109
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:14,039
and nourished and supported that this amazing natural process

110
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:20,880
unfolds it requires the momentum of practice

111
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:26,159
so it's really supported a lot by having cultivate developed some modicum of

112
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:32,640
concentration some ability to really dive deep or be really present in one's

113
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,220
experience mindfully but that momentum and the practice then

114
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:44,700
um um picks up this good energy this good feeling and a

115
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:51,919
lot and it's real if it's a practice grows we allow this to grow it transforms

116
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:57,500
and um the um

117
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:05,039
And So It Begins this pentad with something that inspires us

118
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:12,299
and the classic thing in Buddhism is our faith confidence trust in the practice

119
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:17,760
sometimes it's our own Integrity our own virtue

120
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:24,240
something about our virtue that we feel happy about and inspired by it can be someone else's virtue that

121
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:33,419
really hits Us in some deep way and moves us it can be inspired by another person who

122
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:39,059
maybe has a lot of maturity a lot of wisdom a lot of Joy themselves Dharma

123
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:45,059
Joy and so that inspires us whatever the inspiration is

124
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:50,820
as we practice that inspiration can first lead us to gladness

125
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:57,240
which is in which is a reflection that of how good it is to do this to be

126
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:03,360
involved in the stands to be involved in this practice feeling the Good Fortune of it not many people have the chance

127
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:10,260
and even though it's hard it's a phenomic and Buddhism is considered phenomenally Good Fortune to be able to

128
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:16,679
do any degree of practice so feel the contentment or that kind of happiness with that

129
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:22,140
as we allow for that contentment that happiness that Delight

130
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:31,080
as the practice develops the momentum of practice kind of begins to carry that along and into and transforms it into a

131
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:38,820
joy in the engagement and um and uh so the Joy or practice the

132
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:46,260
joy of waking up the joy of being aware of being mindful this is phenomenally Good Fortune it's a

133
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:51,980
great thing but it's not so much reflecting on The Good Fortune now it's more like

134
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:57,899
almost like we can surrender ourselves to the practice give ourselves over to

135
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:03,059
it fully and the fullness fullness which we give ourselves over to it

136
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:08,360
is where some kind of Joy begins to rise up

137
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:14,299
sometimes it's me quite strong when all of who we are

138
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:19,740
is absorbed or connected to the practice that we're doing

139
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:25,679
and uh this the immersion in the activity of practice

140
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:33,899
so there's we're not daydreaming we're not thinking about something else we're not preoccupied with an itch we have or

141
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:39,360
on it something or other we just really fully present

142
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:45,140
and even though that kind of language fully present is kind of you know Grand language

143
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:52,620
as we approach that as we kind of give ourselves for the into that purpose there can be this Joy Wells up in the

144
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:59,460
engagement that is like the joy of giving ourselves over to a dance maybe surrendering to

145
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:06,179
our partner surrendering to our breathing it could be the joy of singing The Joy

146
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:11,399
of playing um playing with children or being a

147
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:17,600
child and just being delighted and squealing and playing so much fun just to be active and moving

148
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:23,220
the joy of exercise some people feel so whatever it's some something that

149
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:30,539
kind of we give ourselves over to and fully there and that so it's kind of pleasure and joy and wholeheartedness

150
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:35,820
and kind of surrendering to that activity and partly because we're not caught up

151
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:43,799
in our usual ruminations and preoccupations and so the importance of this in Dharma

152
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:48,960
practice is that it it supports the Dharma practice

153
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:55,740
um to have joy in the practice itself uh sometimes what we're mindful of what

154
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:01,320
we include in our practice is quite difficult um there can be a lot of difficult

155
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,480
emotions like difficult physical Sensations pain all kinds of difficult

156
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:14,300
circumstances that we're practicing with but even with all those difficulties

157
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:21,540
um if we have recognized that the joy of giving ourselves to the practice trusting the practice

158
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:28,858
as if the practice is more important practicing with the difficulties is more important than the difficulties

159
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:35,580
um it isn't like we're practicing to overcome the difficulties we're practicing to be present with the

160
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:40,858
difficulty like there are dance Partners our difficult dance partner but it's we

161
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:47,158
can give ourselves fully to that too that dance um it's a kind of very different

162
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:53,460
perspective than how people most people live with their lives where we live kind of preoccupied with problems and wanting

163
00:34:53,460 --> 00:35:01,800
things and not wanting things and the path of this meditation practice is different than that uh it's the

164
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:08,820
engagement in the practice and the mindfulness and being really showing up that is where the dance is where the

165
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:15,359
where the play is where the immersion is to experience so it's a shift of where

166
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,880
we're looking for our well-being and the advantage now of making that

167
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:28,980
shift is then we can learn to get out of the way of the natural growth of This Joy

168
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:35,520
and a big part of a Dharma practitioner's job when we start kind of getting in the flow of the present

169
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:43,380
moment is to get out of the way and allow this present moment to do its thing allow the joy to grow for example

170
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:49,800
but we have it helps if we recognize that it's there and when once we recognize this there

171
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,200
then it's we have a little bit more incentive to not get distracted

172
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,800
a distraction is kind of like putting as like night time coming and so the sun

173
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:08,520
can't shine down at uh on the on the plant that's growing

174
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:14,579
when the directions go then it's like the clouds are parted the sun is out and

175
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:23,000
then the plant can grow on the sunshine the sunshine of awareness and so uh

176
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:29,520
uh important part of practice is is to make sure that there's a space and

177
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,520
clearing for awareness to shine on our experience to shine on the joy and the

178
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:43,500
Delight of engaging mindfully with the whatever is here This Joy Dharma Joy should not be the

179
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:50,280
primary thing we're focusing on it's kind of an adjunct it's kind of like the music or something of the dance or it's

180
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:56,400
part of the the kind of what comes along and the Art of this is not to get

181
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:03,060
attached to it or try to Pump It Up but to allow the natural process of it to

182
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:10,500
grow and develop by staying present making room for it allowing for it and

183
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:17,060
staying with the practice we're doing like mindfulness of breathing keep with the breathing

184
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:25,260
and um so why do we do this why do we give ourselves over to uh the practice so

185
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:31,619
that we enjoy it so that one reason is it's a lot easier to be with the difficulties the

186
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:38,720
difficulties aren't the whole show and everything the difficulties are just part and parcel and of what's happening

187
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:45,240
and uh and the other part maybe a bigger part is uh our mindfulness our awareness

188
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,460
that just feels great to be active with and be present with and

189
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:57,960
so it grows and um so this this uh gladness pentad

190
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:05,099
is something to do that we allow to grow with a growing concentration

191
00:38:05,099 --> 00:38:12,480
until the fifth uh the pentad we'll talk about on Friday is concentration itself

192
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:19,320
and that sets us up to see things as they are so gladness Joy

193
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:25,440
Tranquility happiness samadhi is the sequence

194
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:32,040
and then the instructions are or the the unfolding is to become aware of

195
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:37,820
suffering if we're suffering

196
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:45,720
the that can Inspire us to practice that can motivate us

197
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:52,980
but we're not really ready to address and work with suffering directly when we first come to the

198
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:59,820
practice and so part of it is being motivated by suffering but not

199
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:06,720
being too concerned about it it in beginning let it be motivating

200
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,940
let it support the faith the inspiration to practice engage in the practice for a

201
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:18,780
while as if you're tilling the soil you're repairing the ground for something different to grow and

202
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:24,660
develop and at some point when this gladness Pentagon moves

203
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:30,660
through and so there's enough well-being enough stability enough

204
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:36,720
concentration then we're in a whole different uh place

205
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:41,880
to see or suffering in a new way A New Perspective

206
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:47,119
and um so in that sense the joy

207
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:55,500
is pragmatic is practical it's very useful so it's not joy for its own sake

208
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:01,380
though it almost is and because if we get involved with trying to make it happen and make it

209
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:07,140
grow for other purposes it kind of gets interferes with the dance with the play

210
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:14,880
with the kind of giving ourselves over fully to the activity at hand with our mindfulness and our awareness

211
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,640
so I just realized this morning that we're

212
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:27,359
doing this gladness pentad which ends with concentration

213
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:34,140
and that that is uh then the the practice continues next step is seeing

214
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:39,900
things as they are and um and which is seeing suffering

215
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:47,339
seeing having insight and uh I think it's kind of coincidental on

216
00:40:47,339 --> 00:40:53,099
Saturday I'm going to do a day-long retreat on the four noble truths on

217
00:40:53,099 --> 00:41:01,020
suffering and I think that you'll be in a much better place to understand and follow

218
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:06,540
this day along on the four noble truths if we're building on this gladness pent

219
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:15,079
head if that's the background support for then seeing suffering in a new way

220
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:22,859
so um gladness Joy

221
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:28,279
tranquility happiness

222
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:37,200
samadhi these are the five topics for this week

223
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:43,500
and for today is if you want to do some practice in daily life

224
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:52,079
look for opportunities to do something maybe physical to do it wholeheartedly

225
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:57,900
as if it's a dance or a game or a play or like you're like you're playing a

226
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:03,599
game or a child in the playground is just so delighted to be in the sand making sand

227
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:10,380
castles so just give yourself over to see if you can find the enjoyment of

228
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:17,160
the activity when there's no resistance no distractions and ruminations about

229
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:23,520
the challenges of life just there for the activity it can be in cleaning

230
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,619
washing dishes cleaning the house doing laundry

231
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:34,260
it can be driving it could be going for a walk it can be

232
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:40,619
you know anything that's physical see if you can discover the joy

233
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:47,099
of giving yourself fully to just the activity and doing that doing it in your way

234
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:55,140
the way that works for you and your body and your circumstance but whatever way it works see if you can find the joy of

235
00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:00,660
giving yourself to it foreign so thank you

236
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:09,800
very much and and I hope you enjoy your day
