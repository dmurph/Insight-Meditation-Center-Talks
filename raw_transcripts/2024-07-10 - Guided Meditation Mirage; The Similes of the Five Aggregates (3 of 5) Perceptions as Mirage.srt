1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:11,000
good to be with you all again on this Wednesday morning for me here in

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,320
California and so yeah so good to be with you all this

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,680
week we are going to

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:30,679
continue um continue this journey of exploring the symboles of the five

5
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:39,360
Aggregates or five bundles and today uh we uh include the

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:49,440
exploration of uh the third simile which um the Buddha used the

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,680
Mirage that arises um

8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:05,000
the uh heat of the noon in the summer this shimmering Mirage can emerge and

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,280
it's used to um Al liken the

10
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:18,119
perceptions Sona which is the PO term um that we often use to describe

11
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:27,079
this and so our perceptions Sonia is like this High Noon

12
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:34,000
shimmering uh Mirage I found this really really

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:42,320
evocative and so we are going to practice with this and uh we discover what it feels

14
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,360
like for us this perception and there are many uh words

15
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,920
uh that may be uh capturing uh this um meaning of

16
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,560
Saia and so perception is one and there's also

17
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,599
perceiving conception recognition name

18
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:13,400
Concepts uh Impressions symbols and all of this can

19
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:23,319
be a way to kind of capture this aspect of ourselves that's able to perceive

20
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:30,480
things and it's like a shimmering Mirage uh in the high noon

21
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,280
in the hot season so let's practice and then we'll

22
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,200
explore this a little bit uh in in the daret I'm going to start with the sound

23
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,480
of a

24
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:58,360
bell so come into a meditative posture

25
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:16,959
there is often for me a sense of coming home to this body mind and

26
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,680
heart what is a sense for

27
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,159
you at this moment

28
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,799
coming into your meditative

29
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:50,400
space maybe you're feeling a kind of energetic

30
00:03:50,400 --> 00:04:00,200
settling [Music] downwards or settling back

31
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,799
allow yourself to ease into this

32
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:20,479
moment now and ease

33
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:27,479
into this space here

34
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:51,680
Mindful and a heartful there is often a kind of a

35
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,680
tenderness arise in my heart

36
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:10,520
even the sense of a sacredness of coming

37
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:15,840
home to this present

38
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:34,880
moment the Mind may still wanted to think about the future the

39
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,960
past it's got plans to

40
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:57,440
do let them be the floating clouds

41
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,919
we are dropping in into the felt

42
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,440
sense right here and now

43
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:45,400
and sensing the body sitting lying down whatever the posture you may be

44
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,080
taking as you connect deeper with the present

45
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:16,120
moment there may be a sense of mindful awareness becomes

46
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:21,479
stable steady

47
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:47,479
you may feel more available to the

48
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:56,080
moments or the moments are more available to you

49
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,039
the movements of the breath May register more

50
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,199
fully you may feel

51
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:33,800
aliveness and kind of a Vitality as you

52
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:53,560
breathe or you may feel as you

53
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:00,040
breathe the whole body is animated

54
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,519
en

55
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,279
liened different kinds of a

56
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:34,399
Sensations may become visible felt out obvious

57
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:17,240
Sensations have a kind of buzz in the

58
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:25,279
body maybe an kind of underlying humming

59
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,120
you may notice we are already

60
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,600
perceiving our experiences

61
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,200
allow the mindful awareness to

62
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:34,040
expand receiving the whole energetic Chi

63
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:45,240
body or maybe even beyond the boundaries of the body

64
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:18,920
you may notice the perceptions arise as the experience

65
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:28,199
happen noticing the sensations feel like a soap bubbles

66
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,800
or the water bubbles of the

67
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,800
rain we yet the perceptions are ephemeral

68
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:08,680
like the Mirage shimmering [Music]

69
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:14,839
Mirage of the high noon in the hot

70
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:34,959
season may have images

71
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:45,880
words that emerges as your experience

72
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,480
happen and then they fade

73
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
away

74
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,079
e e

75
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,480
sometimes the mind can get

76
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:26,480
excited about yet the images the

77
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,959
perceptions that are

78
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:42,600
rise and you gently inviting yourself to stay

79
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,560
connected with a felt

80
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:06,720
sense without pushing over away anything or being pulled into

81
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
anything

82
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

83
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

84
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

85
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

86
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

87
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

88
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

89
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

90
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,559
e e

91
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,120
noce how the mind can get involved

92
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:06,120
based on the perceiving Mirage in the

93
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,320
mind start telling

94
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:22,799
stories start analyzing criticizing blaming

95
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:36,559
it's just a perception

96
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:43,200
comes goes as we experience

97
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,080
something in the felt

98
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
sense

99
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

100
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

101
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

102
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

103
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,278
e e

104
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,520
it's quiet

105
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:15,080
here and when it's

106
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:24,799
quiet maybe you can drop in below the surface

107
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,240
level of the activity of the Mind

108
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:43,559
maybe even below the [Music]

109
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:47,559
perceiving impressions

110
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:10,520
trusting the immediacy of your felt sense

111
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:24,360
experience they don't need [Music] words

112
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:31,240
images to justify their presence

113
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:10,080
peaceful nourishing silence

114
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
Within

115
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
for

116
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,039
e

117
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,039
e

118
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
e for

119
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:27,880
in a moment our ringbell to end of the sit

120
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:36,440
again the invitation is to stay in your meditative bubble if you

121
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:41,720
like and I'll begin the darat by

122
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:46,720
reading the simile from the

123
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,760
sutta and allow the words drop into the

124
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:02,279
depth of your being like the stones

125
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:11,559
settle in the quiet peaceful Lake and let whatever touches you to

126
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:18,840
have its own effect and otherwise they can just

127
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:24,679
settle settle down to the bottom of the lake

128
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,880
for

129
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:53,829
[Music]

130
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:07,639
suppose practitioners that in the last month of

131
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:15,399
the hot Seasons at High Noon a shimmering Mirage

132
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:24,320
appears a person with a good sight would inspect it ponder it and carefully

133
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:30,320
investigate it and it would appear to them to be

134
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:37,519
void Hollow and insubstantial for what substance would

135
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:44,360
there be in a mirage so to

136
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:54,360
practitioners whatever kind of a perception there is whether past future or

137
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:00,240
present internal or external gross or

138
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:09,040
subtle inferior or Superior far or near a practitioner

139
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:16,679
inspects it P it and carefully investigates it

140
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:23,760
and it would appear to them to be void Hollow

141
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:30,919
insubstantial for what substance would there be in

142
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:39,240
perception and so this word siia as I uh was reflecting at the

143
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:44,878
beginning of the meditation that there are many

144
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:51,079
translations perceiving conception name

145
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:59,640
concept Impressions symbols signs Etc

146
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:10,800
Etc it's the function miraculous a function of a human mind that is able to

147
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,320
perceive something and give it a

148
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:23,079
label you hear something outside oh that's a bird bird

149
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:30,000
singing or you smell something oh that's a Jas and

150
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:39,839
flowers so we can perceive and this is a wonderful capacity we all have maybe

151
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:45,079
based on you know leld memories and past

152
00:35:45,079 --> 00:35:49,400
the imprints that we know in our

153
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:57,680
system yet when we're not careful and present with what's happening in the

154
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,000
this process our usual

155
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,040
relationship with perception uh can become rather

156
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:15,400
tricky we're often very quick to Short

157
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,599
change the momentary perceptions as a something much more

158
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:28,119
solid and conclusive as if they are the truth

159
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:33,560
you know sometimes around me um maybe a

160
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,839
little further out there may be a kind of a buzzing

161
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:44,680
sound around well you know it could be leaf

162
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:51,640
blower that could also be some sort of construction that's going

163
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:58,079
on that immediate the perception is kind of low

164
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:08,040
buzzing sound in my environment but the mind can leap into a

165
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:14,839
mirage or that must be the leaf blower that happens at the 7 a.m. in the

166
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:19,760
morning why would they have to do

167
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:28,520
that right in the middle of my meditation you can see how this Mirage

168
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:35,400
and the movies start to get created in our mind where the

169
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:40,839
reality of what is happening in the

170
00:37:40,839 --> 00:37:50,640
experience is just that we're perceiving a kind of loud sound that's in the

171
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,640
environment and I don't actually know what exactly it is but the mind can leap

172
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:05,960
into a kind of conclusion or truth or a kind of a

173
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:12,760
reality now I could be right you know I could be right and this is the

174
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:20,800
um even more complicated part of the perception apparatus and so if I did

175
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:27,119
find out that I was right well you know we can reinforce our

176
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:33,119
belief believe and are hardening our perceptions that we already there and

177
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,839
look at me I got right yes it's absolutely a leaf FL that shouldn't have

178
00:38:38,839 --> 00:38:48,240
happened in this morning at this time and so this is how the perception

179
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:56,440
becomes a cleaning perception the cleaning and

180
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:01,920
existing is infused into the immediacy of our

181
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:09,960
experience when we're not attuned or to stay with our direct

182
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:19,160
experience and so often uh when our perceptions about

183
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:27,040
something don't agree amongst a group of people you know that can be a big fight

184
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:34,440
about what the reality is and this is often how the conflict happens it's that

185
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:41,359
the people perceive things differently but we they get hardened

186
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:46,640
into reality uh conclusions and

187
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:55,000
beliefs and uh that leads to a kind of a bumpiness against each other and because

188
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:02,359
our perceptions are not necessarily the same it's just the perceptions yet we take a

189
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:11,400
big leap so that's the danger of this cleaning Aggregates of a

190
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:19,960
perception and the reality of our perceptions is

191
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:26,839
that uh they are rather ephemeral as what the simile is pointing

192
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:34,560
to that that there're kind of a shimmering Mirage in the hot season at High

193
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,880
Noon they feel real but the reality is

194
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:45,599
it emerges in some form shape and and uh

195
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:52,480
some texture and it fades away when the conditions change when the weather cools

196
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:58,560
it goes away I remember once um uh

197
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,920
Retreat I went I had a sequence of experiences and I was perceiving it in a

198
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:12,119
certain way then I went to report to my teacher about my experience and I

199
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:19,440
described to him with a great confidence said this must be what I thought it

200
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:29,160
was and my teacher looked at me and said oh that's just one way to see it

201
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:34,640
just at that moment the Mirage

202
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:42,680
bursted so I realized I was making it much more solid and much more

203
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:50,760
conclusive about the ephemeral perceptions that was created based on my

204
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:56,240
experience and while the reality is that there may be many ways that the

205
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,960
experience it could be perceived

206
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:07,480
and they're already gone and then they're no longer

207
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:14,240
there I can't really be very certain what what what it was

208
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:22,280
exactly and so that was a really very useful teaching and learning moment for

209
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:29,359
me now I want to uh speak a little uh about an another aspect of a

210
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:35,920
perception sometimes this teaching about a perception being Mirage can be

211
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,079
interpretated as if somehow our perceptions are never

212
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:46,960
valid and I want to just point out that itself is also a

213
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,079
perception so perceiving is a very

214
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:58,480
important function of a human mind and human beings and we can on this part of

215
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,520
a function to work well enough for us to go about living our

216
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:10,960
lives without making a total chaos right we're counting on us being a able to

217
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,520
perceive I don't know white rice has white rice and brown

218
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:22,559
rice has a brown rice and we're counting on our perceptions and so we can pick up

219
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:29,839
the right kid from school not someone else's kid that's very important

220
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:38,079
um what the teaching is pointing to is how we and our

221
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:46,960
relationships uh with this aspect of a function can get um stuck the stuckness

222
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:55,599
the clinging the existence the belief and the conclusiveness that we have about our

223
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:01,359
perceptions is what leads to Dua or

224
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:08,160
stress you may have a perception that someone is angry right now and that's

225
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:16,599
momentary and that may be very much true very much so but we can build upon that perception

226
00:44:16,599 --> 00:44:24,359
to make a bigger conclusion that wow this person is really an angry

227
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:29,839
person now that's more than a big

228
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:35,559
Mirage that's a big conclusion now the person got boxed up

229
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:43,480
boxed in as a angry person what happens is now it's very

230
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:50,640
difficult to see this person in other ways but being an angry

231
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:58,480
person and so that's what um this teaching is pointing to that there is a

232
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:05,680
Dua in the cleaning of the perception the cleaning Aggregates the per

233
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:12,520
perception so we're learning to discern this cleaning forces that are

234
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:20,680
operating to allow us little by little let go of the cleaning to allow the

235
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:28,839
ephemeral perceptions to just be what they are so that's the teach teachings on the

236
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:34,200
simile of the Mirage and as a

237
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:41,760
perception and so I invite you to have fun and enjoy and maybe be humorous

238
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,880
about your perceptions uh in this in the rest of the day practicing with this or

239
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:55,000
exploring this and uh we'll continue tomorrow so thank you everyone for being

240
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,400
here have a wonderful rest of the day
