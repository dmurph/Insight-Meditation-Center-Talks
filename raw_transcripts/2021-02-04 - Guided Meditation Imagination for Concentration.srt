1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:11,519
so good day and good evening

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,119
good morning to everyone and it's

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,760
a funny thing to be sharing here and now with

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:32,320
different time zones and different places it's a wonderful way that here can be

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,440
at different time zones or now can be at different time zones at the

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,839
same time something like that so um

7
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,559
i think it's uh maybe useful to i think that

8
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:09,119
human beings are using their imagination all the time and imagination is more subtle than

9
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:16,000
flights of fantasy and this but rather it's the little uh images

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,560
that we have of what's going to happen what did happen imaginings when we we imagine people

11
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:28,320
when we meet them we imagine things about them we imagine what's going to happen tomorrow

12
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,320
and and sometimes these imaginings are detrimental they undermine us

13
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,360
especially if they're they are kind of

14
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,920
frightening or disturbing imaginations that we do over and over and over again

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:52,960
they kind of slowly kind of begin to create a mood a

16
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:02,000
disposition and almost maybe sometimes even a personality by this the constancy of what we imagine

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,399
and so meditation practice is certainly a wonderful time to learn how to put

18
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:16,080
down some of the imaginings that we do so when we let go of thoughts we're also letting go of imaginations

19
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,720
when we come back into the present moment we're letting go of or what we imagine or assume will be

20
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:29,280
tomorrow or other times in other places but we can also use imagination to give

21
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:38,000
us a kind of a little edge a little clear clarity about uh um stay here be present

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,599
write this out and uh you know so i've used the lots of

23
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:50,720
analogies over time and these analogies are all acts of imagination it gives us a sense a feeling for

24
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,720
kinesthetic and association that can we give a better sense of what it means like to stay with something

25
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,879
continuously than if the instructions are okay sit down and stay with your breath and don't leave it

26
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,800
but this idea of uh riding a scooter and um and every time that your mind

27
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,120
wanders off we come we push back into the present moment and then we coast along on the present

28
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,159
moment until we need to kind of come back again and push again

29
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,920
or if we're staying with the breathing the imagination that we are

30
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:32,080
it's like waves and as i've done frequently and or like we're surfing on the waves the

31
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,440
in-breath is the lifting of the lifting us up and on the wave and then the out breath we're

32
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,280
surfing the front of it going down or maybe not surfing just simply kind of

33
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,360
gently being lifted and falling when my son was quite small had trouble

34
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:56,480
sleeping i sometimes had him imagine that he was an otter floating on its back to sleep at night

35
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:03,040
and top of a wonderful peaceful sea and the kelp forest all around

36
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:10,400
underneath and that the in the gentle kind of swells would come up and down and that with his breathing

37
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,840
he was the otter that was being lifted and settled lifted and settled with

38
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,919
each wave and generally then after a while he'd fall asleep

39
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,800
and so all these little acts of imagination that not to put us asleep here but to

40
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,080
encourage us to stay here this is what it's like so as i said yesterday the buddha gave

41
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,240
one for uh for breath meditation

42
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,840
which is that of a lathe worker holding the lathe knife i guess or the

43
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,160
chisel so that against the wood that's going around in the lathe

44
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:01,520
and in order to cut the wood properly the chisel has to be in continuous contact with the wood

45
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,440
that's how it it chisels away and so

46
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:15,039
i guess this idea of a lathe turning around and around was the buddha's analogy for the cycles of in-breath and out-breath

47
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:23,440
and the awareness somehow is like the chisel where the kind of the point of awareness is really

48
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,280
centered someplace with the breathing and then it doesn't leave it just stays there

49
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,320
stays there and stays connected so this goes around and around

50
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:42,800
and um and if that kind of image doesn't mean much for you uh an image that uh

51
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,039
when i was when i was in college i took a massage course and the instruction was that if we had

52
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,400
to get more oil to put on more to you know for massage to continue with the massage

53
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,880
to never lose physical contact with the person getting the massage so you have to always keep one hand on

54
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,440
this touching the person's arm or something as you reach for that oil and put it on your hand and so this idea of

55
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:15,280
always staying in touch and contact and contact and touch i interpret to be

56
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,199
the physicality of breathing the physical experience just stay there with

57
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:27,600
your chisel or stay there with your hand stay there on the waves riding up and down

58
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,120
so don't be busy with all those images but these are images that can be used

59
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,520
one of them maybe speaks to you and if using the image is better than the

60
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:45,280
alternative meaning that you it's you're less likely to wander off into thoughts and

61
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:52,960
imaginations which are not supportive for you then stay with the image until the image

62
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,880
no longer is needed and you're able to stay there with the with the breathing

63
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:07,759
so taking a meditation posture and gently closing your eyes

64
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,039
and even saying the word gently closing your eyes and hadn't thought about it but also

65
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:21,520
evokes the imagination the idea of gentle gentling

66
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,199
and maybe has value that travels beyond just the eyes

67
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,039
and then sitting quietly and gently the body

68
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:59,840
shifting gears so that you are settling down into your body your embodied experience

69
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:15,599
and taking a few long slow deep breaths big swells big waves that lift you up

70
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:21,840
expand you and then down the other side of the wave

71
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,840
as you exhale relaxing your body

72
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,760
and letting your breathing return to normal

73
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:59,760
and then softening relaxing parts of your body and as each parts of your body relax

74
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,959
imagine it's becoming soft like a cotton ball

75
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,240
relaxing the muscles of the face

76
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,839
softening the shoulders

77
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:37,839
and softening the belly

78
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,560
and also as you exhale softening the mind

79
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,760
quieting the mind

80
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,399
distilling the mind into a soft

81
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:11,760
place and if any part of your body mind feels hard brittle

82
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,959
maybe it's your awareness which is like a soft cotton ball

83
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:33,839
it gently supports or holds whatever is hard challenging

84
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:56,640
and then to settle into the body's experience of

85
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,839
breathing

86
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:15,839
and feeling the sensations physical sensations that come into play as you breathe

87
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:29,839
the sensations of inhale are different than the sensations of exhaling

88
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:58,880
and then settling in to stay with the sensations of breathing

89
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:10,880
and so some continuity like you would a chisel against the bowl being lathed

90
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:17,920
or like the continuous contact of the waves is once flowed someone's

91
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:26,160
back on the gentle swells of the ocean lifting up and lifting down

92
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:38,800
for the continuous stroke of a masseuse yes as we receive a massage from the

93
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,160
inside as the lungs expand and contract as a

94
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:53,839
diaphragm pushes and releases

95
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,560
and settling in gently steadily

96
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,279
see if you can have continuity

97
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:14,399
with the breathing letting the thinking mind become quieter

98
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:21,839
softer stiller

99
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:29,200
so the center of gravity of attention shifts from thinking

100
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,839
to breathing

101
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,920
as if breathing is the center of the

102
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,120
universe if breathing is

103
00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:03,839
home for these minutes that we're meditating

104
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,720
riding the waves of breathing

105
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:54,559
letting go of imaginary futures imaginary

106
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:02,000
other places the imagination

107
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,760
of things which are not here and now and to use the imagination

108
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:18,960
instead to be intimate with our lived experience of

109
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,840
here

110
00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:00,640
allowing yourself to feel whatever satisfaction or gladness

111
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:09,039
that comes from not being lost in thought so much

112
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:14,640
not perpetuating thoughts which are undermine you

113
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:22,480
trouble you glad to be intimate here now

114
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,279
perhaps even allowing yourself to feel the joy

115
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:41,120
of just being alive breathing just content sitting here breathing

116
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:47,840
feeling embodying yourself

117
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:54,960
the more that we are preoccupied in thought distracted by thinking

118
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,399
the more that we're lost in imagination

119
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,400
the less in touch we are with others

120
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:14,960
the less we are distracted the less we're preoccupied

121
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,480
the better what's best in us can come forth

122
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:30,799
to meet other people love gratitude

123
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:40,799
compassion friendliness all shine all flow most easily

124
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:48,960
most manifest when we are not distracted

125
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:57,039
not preoccupied when we are present for others

126
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:05,840
that's the vehicle that's the channels by which our positive attitudes

127
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:16,000
manifest and may it be that to whatever degree

128
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,799
that you're more settled more intimate with yourself

129
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:30,880
calmer clear from this meditation

130
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:38,000
may that register for you may you take that in feel that

131
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:44,240
and imagine how you can stay this way

132
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:51,760
or stay close to it so that your warmth for others

133
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,840
can be palpable expressed your love your compassion

134
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,840
your kindness can better flow

135
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:19,120
and may it be that what you learn about being non-distracted

136
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:26,399
supports you

137
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:31,520
in greater goodwill for the people around you

138
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,880
known and unknown strangers and intimates

139
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,520
may it be that what you learn through this

140
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:50,960
practice is a means by which you live a life that

141
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,440
betters the life of others in small ways in big ways in intentional

142
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,360
ways and unintentional ways

143
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:11,200
may the benefit of the merit of our practice together be for the welfare and

144
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,039
in support of all beings everywhere may all beings

145
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:26,720
be happy may all beings be safe

146
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,679
may all beings be peaceful

147
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:51,840
may all beings be free

148
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,080
you
