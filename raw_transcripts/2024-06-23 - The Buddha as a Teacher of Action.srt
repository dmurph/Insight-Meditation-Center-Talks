1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:07,200
to hopefully say something succinct and memorable that you can carry through the

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
talk maybe through your life um in the time of the Buddha he was

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,039
characterized as a teacher of action a teacher of

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,240
action and why would he be called that and what did he mean by action that he

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,120
would was known as a teacher of action so that's kind of the part of the topic

6
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:40,000
for today and um and in introducing this

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,079
topic uh I would say that um the Buddha was much more interested in what we do

8
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:53,120
than who we are and uh and in fact uh if we he was

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,280
going to Define who we are the Buddha would Define it by what we do a farmer

10
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,000
someone who Farms is a farmer someone who's a cook Cooks is a

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,720
cook and so someone who meditates is a meditator so it's what we do that the

12
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,799
Buddha was interested in how we got recognized and known and that goes a

13
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,079
little bit uh against some of the popular orientations we have maybe in

14
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:31,520
the west the modern West where I get a sense there's a lot of people who are looking for a message that somehow who

15
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,880
they are is perfect somehow who they are is

16
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,759
guilt-free someone who they are is okay something like that and somehow

17
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:52,200
inherently in who we are we're just fine to way we are somehow and um and I think that comes

18
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:58,000
from a culture that has really condition people to think the opposite for

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,159
themselves there's a lot of self criticism a lot of anxiety about me myself and mine in this culture there's

20
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:12,080
a touching story that wasn't there but I've been told of it many times by people who were

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,720
there that um the Dal Lama was uh doing some kind of teaching and someone was

22
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:24,400
asked him a question and he had a translator and the translator would translate the question and into Tibetan

23
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,519
and the the uh the person asked some question about how to work

24
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,319
with how to deal with self-hatred and

25
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,440
um and um so the the translator translated this with

26
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,480
diil and then he looked perplexed and so there was a long

27
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,040
conversation between the dalama and the translator no people didn't know Tibetan

28
00:02:53,040 --> 00:03:00,080
didn't know what it was about but long at some point in that conversation maybe the Dilma understood the question and he

29
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,200
started to cry it was inconceivable to the somehow

30
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,840
maybe because of Tibetan culture maybe because I don't know who he who he is dama that there was a culture of people

31
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:18,440
who have self-hatred it was unbelievable to him and when he realized that he

32
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,519
started to cry maybe we all can cry what we have here in this

33
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,840
culture and so because of this there's often it's a it's a relief to get a

34
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,319
message that you're okay that you're loved the way you are you're you're fine the way you are and

35
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,519
so but that's kind of how you are and as a relief as a corre

36
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:50,120
correction maybe that's a a wonderful teaching but that's the Buddha had a lot more Buddha actually emphasized much

37
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,560
more than how we are what he emphasized in fact how we are was not that

38
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,120
important for him and certainly he didn't want to the Buddha was not oriented Ed towards a philosophy or

39
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,799
religious worldview or idea of ultimacy that there's some kind of core aspect of

40
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,239
who we are that's perfect the Buddha didn't have the notion of a soul for

41
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:18,440
example there is no essential kind of heart and that goes against the grain

42
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,759
for a lot of cultures where they have that kind of view so we have to kind of hold all this kind of lightly and maybe

43
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:30,919
do a kind of cultural translation to really see how it all fits

44
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:39,400
but for the Buddha in his own terms he emphasized action what we do and uh and that this is where we

45
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:44,520
could um um you know where we take

46
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,919
responsibility and in teaching about action he taught about action in body in

47
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:58,320
speech and in mind so there's a touching story I think is touching um of the

48
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,600
Buddha teaching his son so what most people don't know is that Buddha Buddha

49
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,840
was a father he had one child and uh

50
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,039
after uh the child was about six or seven years old the Buddha was the

51
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:19,680
primary parent and uh we don't have a lot of stories about what he was like as a

52
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,880
parent um but he was already a monk himself and so he would living the religious life and his son joined him in

53
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:32,199
that kind of religious life following along and uh as maybe it's not too

54
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:38,240
uncommon for children to stumble into this issue

55
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:45,400
that um one day uh his son was apparently caught telling a lie you know

56
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:54,160
maybe a seven-year-old you know and um and so um I remember when I was maybe

57
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,919
six or maybe seven or so my father saw that we were playing checkers and he saw

58
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:07,240
that I cheated I I guess I was losing so I kind of put cup cup my tecker pieces under my

59
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,120
hand and kind of slipped it on the on the

60
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,800
board and my father did a a a wonderful thing for me it was I thought it

61
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:27,960
was and you know it affected me for the rest of my life in certain way he didn't criticize me he didn't wasn't angry with

62
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,880
me or to me or something he just got up and

63
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:42,639
left and that's all I needed to know I didn't need someone yelling at me

64
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,599
or berating me or criticizing me just like okay if that's what you do this is

65
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:54,880
what I do action and so he didn't tell me you're a

66
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:03,720
terrible person and um so um so he his son was caught with a

67
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:10,680
lie and his son already was living a life of a novice monk Nas kind of

68
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,199
noviciate and uh which is which is not defined by what you are but how you live

69
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:22,000
your life it's in Action a way of living and the Buddha said if you if if uh you

70
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,720
tell a deliberate knowing lie then uh your life as a noviciate

71
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:36,160
uh is has as much kind of spirituality religiosity in

72
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,800
it as uh a bowl full of water that's been turned upside down so all the

73
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,360
water's gone out so you know I don't know if it's not criticizing the sun exactly but this is the action and this

74
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,479
is the consequence of the action in terms of what you're how you're supposed to be

75
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:59,639
living and then he went on to say he said that anybody who is willing could

76
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:07,120
tell a deliberate LIE there's there's no nothing Wicked they wouldn't do somehow

77
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,720
there's something about telling lies that sets a stage for a lot of other things that are cause

78
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:19,479
problems and then he went on and said to his his son what's the purpose of a

79
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:24,919
mirror and the son said well the purpose of a mirror is

80
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:30,319
reflection in the same way you need to reflect

81
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:36,518
your mirror is your actions if you want to see yourself

82
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:41,599
study yourself through your actions see yourself through what you're doing so

83
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:49,399
don't see yourself in some kind of essentialist way like but this is who I am but learn Who You Are by what you

84
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:54,760
do and this is how he's said to do it um

85
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,160
if you're going to do anything with your body any physical activity

86
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:09,680
before you do it reflect because you're looking at the mirror reflect um is uh is what I'm

87
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:16,760
going to do is it going to harm me is it going to harm others or is it

88
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:23,560
going to harm both so that was the first criteria does it cause harm not just to myself he

89
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:32,519
equally important was others and equally important was both which I like to think of is the community we in all

90
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:40,040
people and then he went out to said say you should also reflect is this

91
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:49,440
wholesome actually he said it this way you should reflect first does it cause harm to S others or both you should

92
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,680
reflect is it UNH wholesome leading to

93
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:02,600
pain is it UNH wholesome leading to pain if it's if it is causes harm if

94
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,720
it's UNH wholesome leading to pain then stop doing

95
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,560
it then he went on to say while you're doing something with your body you

96
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:22,720
should be reflecting that's the M look at the mirror look yourself through the in the mirror of your actions and see for

97
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,399
yourself is it causing harm is it UNH wholesome leading to pain

98
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:34,959
because some things don't cause harm in the moment but they cause harm in the

99
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:42,200
future so this thing you know it has ongoing effects and um and if you're doing it

100
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:49,480
and it's in the middle of doing it you should stop doing it and

101
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,800
um and then he said if you're after you've done something with your body you

102
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,480
should reflect have I caused harm was it unh ome leading to

103
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:08,600
pain and um and if you see that it was then you should could find a wise

104
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:15,839
person and just talk about it with someone so it doesn't say

105
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:24,160
confess but there's something about when you've done something that's been harmful UNH wholesome there's something

106
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:30,160
about the honesty speaking about it honestly getting it off not necessarily off your chest but getting it

107
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,040
acknowledged there's something about speaking that is a fuller acknowledgement and recognition of what

108
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:42,880
we done that helps the mind and the heart to dis disengage itself from it

109
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,600
from itself not be so identified with it and then it's a wise person who's kind

110
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,920
of now know what you're up to so it's a little bit more difficult in the future

111
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,200
to want to do the same thing because you know that wise person now is like really

112
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:06,079
you're doing that again and you don't want to your wise your wise friend to kind of have to say really you're doing

113
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:12,600
that again so it's a it's a way of supporting us to be more careful in the

114
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,279
future if as before you do something and you

115
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:24,760
reflect if it uh is beneficial to oneself beneficial to others beneficial

116
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:31,480
to uh both if it's wholesome leading

117
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,680
to pleasure leading to happiness just keep doing it or do it if

118
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:46,160
it's during then keep doing it if you reflect after then just rest content and

119
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,800
happy uh growing and cultivating wholesome States so if it's wholesome

120
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:59,560
what you're doing and you'd finish doing it and you recognize that this was a wholesome thing to do

121
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:05,079
then continue to develop wholesome States so wholesome states are developed

122
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:12,760
by what we do so then he went through the same thing uh with speech same

123
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:19,839
analysis then he did the same analysis and and it's wonderful I think this it's a speech because many of us find one of

124
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:25,560
the most difficult places in our life to be mindful let alone be wise and

125
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:32,399
wholesome in how we speak how we live is through speech and so here we're offered wonderful

126
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,959
criteria and how to reflect on ourselves and be careful how we speak and if we

127
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:45,440
kind of spend time just being pausing and looking and thinking about what we're going to say before we say it you

128
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:53,440
with these criteria we would live in a different world so what uh what I'm about to say

129
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:00,320
is this harmful for myself harmful for others or harmful to both

130
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,920
is what I'm about to say is it UNH wholesome leading to

131
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,399
pain if it is don't say it I mean what a great world would we live in if just

132
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,519
that was if that was followed I mean we would be like the world would

133
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,560
shine and uh and but if if what you're about to

134
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,199
say uh is beneficial for yourself and for someone else and and all all people

135
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,639
then please say it if what you're going to if uh uh if

136
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:40,160
it's uh is wholesome and going to bring benefits and happiness then please do it

137
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:46,560
so he goes through the same analysis so you know the So speaking so I recommend

138
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,800
that and and for me I don't know how it is for you this kind of this guideline that he

139
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,959
gives a son I'm actually more inspired by the speech part than I am by the

140
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:04,279
action part maybe because I'm less likely to harm people with my actions than I am with my

141
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:11,320
speech Just subtle things we do so subtle and and um and uh so having this little

142
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:17,279
criteria I find very helpful and then the um the third one

143
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:24,440
has to do with for some of us uh the speech we do in our head to

144
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:31,519
ourselves we track what we're thinking we track what's going on in the mind and and if what I'm about with the mental

145
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:39,880
activity the mental thinking I'm doing if that is harmful to oneself to others or to both

146
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:44,959
then don't do it and I think there it's particularly true that it affects us

147
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:52,560
ourselves I think we can harm ourselves tremendously the selft talk we do and uh how we harm other people if

148
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,959
it's all in the privacy of our own thoughts is not so obvious but I think

149
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:04,079
it oozes out by osmosis it oozes out by all kinds of kind of subtle ways of

150
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:11,279
communication to others and they pick it up and um and so we look at our own

151
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:19,279
thoughts and can we see is this wholesome what I'm doing wholesome what I'm thinking it does it lead to

152
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:26,279
happiness or unhappiness does it lead to pain or pleasure and uh so here again we look at

153
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:31,319
our own mind so this is our the three areas of

154
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:38,240
action the where the Buddha emphasizes to his son when the son was

155
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,880
young and we have three discourses where the Buddha was teaching his examples where the Buddha taught his

156
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:52,319
son and it's marvelous three discour teachings because one was when he was very young one when when he was a

157
00:16:52,319 --> 00:16:58,600
teenager and one when he was just becoming an adult and for the little for when he was

158
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,160
the kid was small he was teaching him this kind of an ethical teaching we could say in

159
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:11,480
English uh when he was a teenager he he taught him um not to be caught up in

160
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,678
conceit some teenagers have little bit like that and uh but but his teaching

161
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:24,880
for how to deal with conceit was meditation to develop a sense of wellbeing and happiness through

162
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,679
meditation that the whole need for conceit begins to dissolve

163
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:36,720
and then when he was a young adult the Buddha taught him uh the insights the

164
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,880
pointed to the kind of way of seeing that is liberating so you have these three

165
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,400
phases of the young this but the first one which could be called ethical teachings is really foundational

166
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,440
teachings for all the Buddhism it's not just a teaching to a young kid this is

167
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:02,400
like all of Buddhism can fit underneath this criteria uh is it harmful or not harmful

168
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,840
is it harmful or beneficial is it wholesome or UNH wholesome does it lead to pain or does it lead to benefit to

169
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:15,919
happiness and uh uh and the deepest meditators people who are most skilled

170
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,240
in meditation going deep in states of meditation the same criteria are the

171
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:26,400
guide for how to go further and further in meditation all the way to Liberation

172
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,880
because we're getting more and more refined and to see subtly the subtlest

173
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,559
ways in which our mental activity causes

174
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:43,280
stress and causes freedom from stress causes tension and freedom from tension

175
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:50,240
and just that very little criteria seeing that is what is onward leading leads us we become our own teachers and

176
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:58,039
we find our way that way so this is not just the teachings to a young kid this is a teaching for all of us and uh

177
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:05,320
there's no no no metaphysical teachings there's no Supernatural teachings there's no um nothing you have to kind

178
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:11,799
of believe in in some kind of religious kind of belief kind of thing except you

179
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:17,280
have to believe that it makes a difference how you act and what you

180
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,400
do that can't be that hard that can't hurt that much to believe

181
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,440
that so then um but so especially so it's one of the most difficult places

182
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:34,440
for this is our inner life our mental life and for some people that's where we

183
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,960
tend to identify strongly with our thoughts identify strongly with our

184
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:46,200
feelings we Define ourselves by those and it's not and our society

185
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:52,799
sometimes helps us to do that and the analogy I'd like to offer for this sometime was sometimes like with being

186
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:58,360
caught in our thoughts and we we're so caught in the thoughts we think we are we thought our thoughts we think we have

187
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,720
no choice but to think thinking is kind of like obvious like this is true you

188
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:10,240
know whatever I'm thinking it's how it is because I'm living in my thoughts uh the analogy

189
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,919
is uh if you're if you're uh moving along a wheel burrow full of heavy

190
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:23,000
bricks it's heavy to push it along but then you're lucky you come to a little

191
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,799
place where that becomes it uh incline so you can you can roll it downhill a little bit just in the beginning it

192
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,360
feels good oh good it's not to push so much but the hill gets steeper and

193
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:41,080
steeper and steeper and at some point the wibur is in

194
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:47,520
charge you're just desperately holding on and running after trying not to run into all the people on the hill right

195
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:54,400
like you know and you're completely invested in CAU and you become the wheel bur almost because the wheels has the

196
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,960
momentum and you're just trying to hold on for their life so or thinking can be that way with

197
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:08,840
a wheelbarrow um it's best just to put it down gently so it stops

198
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:14,279
rolling if it uh or if you can't do that it might be better off just to let go of

199
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:20,279
it because a wheelbarrow is not going to keep rolling down the hill it's going to tip over as soon as you're not holding

200
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:27,840
it up and all the bricks are going to fall out so with our thinking we can be so

201
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:33,120
identified with them and sometimes that they can it's very a lot of negative

202
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:39,799
selft talk lot of thoughts there about the uh danger and anxiety and concern

203
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:45,799
for this and that and trying to figure things out and it's very hard to stop

204
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:52,120
that identification to believe Stop Believing in them because we're living in

205
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:59,039
them and so the Buddha his emphasis was action he was a teacher of action so how

206
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:05,200
does Action come to play well right now the action is one that's harming

207
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:12,960
yourself and so you know stopping it might not be so easy but what can you do and that's the

208
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:19,400
qu magic question what can you do as soon as you ask yourself that question

209
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:25,320
what can I do that's different you're already doing something

210
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:32,559
different just a question creates a little space just a question creates a little pause just a question means that

211
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:39,400
part of you is not so invested or caught or lost in the whole swirl of thoughts

212
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:46,919
so to have enough mindfulness to recognize oh boy am I caught what can I do here is that is the

213
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:52,320
is the beginning of what the Buddha wants us to be doing what can I do is that

214
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,799
question uh cause harm or benefit it's not so clear yet but it's

215
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:06,159
certainly not causing harm to ask that question but maybe it opens a door to figure out what to do is

216
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:13,158
beneficial and then so what can you do one of the things we can do is

217
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:20,400
relax because if we're whatever that whenever we're caught in thoughts there's going to be tension in the body

218
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:29,080
and in the mind in the thinking muscle and beginning to relax and soften

219
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:35,159
the thought the thinking the nature of

220
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:40,960
thinking is that if you're caught up in some big chain of swirl of

221
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:48,440
thoughts those thoughts are never going to on their own think that it's time to

222
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:55,840
relax it'll they'll never come up with kind of like maybe I shouldn't be doing this they're very convincing the

223
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,880
authority of our thoughts are powerful partly because we give them a lot of

224
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:07,679
authority but as soon as you ask what can I do that's different here you're breaking the authority of those thoughts

225
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:14,000
you may be not breaking how strong they are the wheel you're still holding on to the wheelbarrow but then begin to think

226
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:22,919
can I do something else with the wibur can I put it down so we can relax and so to become skilled and it it

227
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:29,919
takes skill it takes familiarity really learn how to do this learn how to relax

228
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:36,039
and it means becoming highly attuned to micr muscles around the temples the

229
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:42,159
forehead the jaw the shoulders where can you soften where can

230
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:48,720
you relax something that is the very thing that's feeding or keeping the the

231
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:57,000
thinking going obsessive thinking is reinforced by

232
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:04,080
tension if you you want to stop that reinforcement you have to look for where can I relax and

233
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,840
soften some of you probably wake up in the middle of the night

234
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:16,600
anxious caught up in thoughts there's something else you can do rather than just trying to go back to

235
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:24,360
sleep trying to go back to sleep relax start doing body scans just relax

236
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,399
look look at the microm muscles around the thinking relax

237
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:36,720
or I prefer the word release release the tension release because release to me is an opening it's

238
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:44,080
a kind of expanding so this idea you expand around something you you let go you open you

239
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,760
relax and expand okay and uh and so then

240
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:56,320
how are you doing that how are you relaxing are you relaxed that's a question always questioning reflecting

241
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:05,080
how am I doing this well is it am I heart am I relaxing in a way that harms me or benefits me boy

242
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:11,000
there I am again harming myself I'm there with a I'm there with a you know

243
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,440
yelling at myself and and U prodding myself with

244
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:22,120
sharp kind of me mental knives

245
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:28,520
relax come on you can do it oh you can't you're not managing it you're being you're doing it the wrong way and you

246
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:36,000
know everyone else knows how to relax but you don't know how to relax so there you are harming

247
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:41,200
again or are you doing it in a way that's beneficial what's the beneficial

248
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,279
way to relax so asking those questions those are actions those are mental

249
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,760
actions that can lead to benefit how do I relax can I relax in a soft way in a

250
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:59,640
easy way and can I relax without so being so focused on being successful

251
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:06,279
I just do the best I can and then um and so once we get the

252
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:12,799
same thing with emotions we're caught in emotions what can relax what can we soften how can we

253
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,880
open to this how can we be with it rather than the wheelbarrow of emotions

254
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:23,000
that we have they're caught in and

255
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:29,520
um so um so rather

256
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:35,360
than having the world do rather than being

257
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,360
concerned about the what the world does to

258
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:46,679
you be concerned of what you do in

259
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,760
return if you're concerned about the the world does to you too much you might be

260
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:59,640
forfeiting forfeiting taking a deep look at yourself and for the Buddha it's always

261
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:06,519
with your actions that he emphasizes how you become free how you don't become

262
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:14,399
caught by the world how you don't believe in the forces that come down upon you that tell you

263
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:21,000
otherwise you don't believe in the forces of Oppression so that you oppress yourself

264
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,799
or or limit yourself for the Buddha it's always what do you contribute how what

265
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,559
do you do how do you meet the

266
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:38,840
situation it's not what your emotions are doing to you that's important what's

267
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:44,840
important is what you do to the emotions it's not important what your

268
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:51,000
thinking does to you and exactly it's more important what you do

269
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,200
in return in response in Buddha being a teacher of

270
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:03,840
action is he's pointing to our role as actors

271
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:10,039
in our own life he's pointing to our own responsibility or our own ability to

272
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:17,279
respond our own capacity to find our own Freedom if we're looking for freedom to

273
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:24,679
be handed to us from the world it's never going to be handed to you we have to find our freedom from

274
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:29,799
within the deepest kind of Freedom what might be called spiritual fre

275
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:36,000
freedom and um the um and so there's a program that

276
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,200
I'm involed it at St Quinton State Prison and um and one of the things they

277
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:47,159
teach there what I think it's one of the one of the men who was incarcerated who

278
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:53,799
came up with this phrase um uh uh to be

279
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:59,880
become free while still in prison and the context of that is quite

280
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:07,240
for me it was quite powerful to think to be even in that kind of situation to find this freedom and not let the prison

281
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:13,320
guards Define who you are and what your inner life is like to take

282
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:20,600
responsibility this is kind of the most radical message of the Buddha and uh no one else is going to be

283
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,960
the caretaker for your inner life but

284
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:33,039
you don't what is it called in the in the business

285
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:40,480
world now Farm out what's the other another better expression what Outsource yeah don't

286
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:47,559
Outsource the quality of your inner life don't expect that there's some

287
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:53,519
person who's going to do it for you or thing or

288
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:59,840
event that least for the Buddha you have to insource it

289
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:06,799
and it's your actions your activity what you do and these criteria is the is that

290
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:12,799
that we offered here is it is it um cause harm or not harm the fact that

291
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:18,799
that sits at the heart of Buddhism it just makes me so happy given how much

292
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:25,480
harm exists in this world that really this is what's important and that is a

293
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:31,399
wholesome and beneficial wholesome and brings happiness what a fantastic thing if that

294
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:37,679
could be the primary message for a religious

295
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,840
life so um that's

296
00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:53,519
uh started off that's what I was thinking

297
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:02,840
today and so I walked down here from home that was what I was my physical action was to come there and tell you

298
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:10,519
this and then I spoke and hopefully that's for my

299
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:16,600
benefit and for all of yours so thank you so we have a few

300
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,760
minutes if any of you would like to comment on this or would like to ask any

301
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,080
questions um can maybe take two or three

302
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:38,639
sure thank you hi Gil um first of all I've been

303
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:44,399
sitting with a slight smile on my face and immense gratitude for your presence

304
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:52,639
and talks I discovered your talks on a podcast maybe 12 13 years ago um on the

305
00:32:52,639 --> 00:33:01,200
east coast and now it's funny I'm here with one of my best friends um in California living here a mom and so much

306
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:09,120
has changed in my life so um just very grateful for the presence

307
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,440
um the perspective and the peace that you have given to My Life um and I just

308
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:24,039
want to thank you first of all and um my heart is racing from excitement but um I

309
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:30,480
just want to ask you um today in the context of

310
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,480
relationships and raising um kids

311
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,760
um thinking about the emotion which is the feeling that comes

312
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,880
outward how do we communicate that in a um how do you

313
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:56,799
say um Wholesome Way during the times when it may not be necessarily a

314
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:02,039
wholesome message while we also

315
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:11,480
um keep ourselves free of expressing ourselves and do not let it ooze through

316
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:17,320
osmosis um so I guess that's Yeah question whooing out so when U my son

317
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:22,878
was small I thought I was doing a wise parenting thing so not not I wasn't

318
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:29,158
going to express anger to my son I was just going to name how how it was for

319
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:36,040
me and so I said to him if you continue doing what you're doing um I think I'll

320
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:41,320
become angry and uh he looked at me and said

321
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,520
dad you're already

322
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:53,800
angry so he knew before I knew so it oozes

323
00:34:53,800 --> 00:35:00,480
out and um so I uh I I think one of the things to do is to practice mindfulness

324
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,680
out loud which mean you have to figure out exactly how to do it appropriately with children but to have the children

325
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:13,560
see that you can talk about how you're feeling without it being directed at anyone attacking anyone just say you

326
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:19,800
know that was a hard day today I I was really angry and and uh so I went for a

327
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:26,560
walk to calm down I went to meditate to come down and the kids see that there's a ways that parents get angry just like

328
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,480
they do but the parents not caught in it and they have a way of practicing with it or some way of dealing with it and

329
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,720
you might shared examples like today I was really angry or really afraid and so I talked to my

330
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:46,079
friend and that helped me a lot and so then the day might come when you're angry with them and then you might say

331
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:53,160
oh here I am you know I'm angry you know you know I've asked you many times not to walk across the kitchen floor with

332
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:58,960
Muddy shoes and I just cleaned the floor and you know could you know and so now

333
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:06,760
I'm getting angry um but I don't want to be angry I want to be able to talk to a friend about it can I talk to

334
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:13,839
you that's going to get their attention and anyway so you want to find ways of talking and one of the simplest ways I

335
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:22,160
think of being very careful is to try to make ey statements I mean there so much I could say but rather than you

336
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:27,800
statements and um the um

337
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:35,680
and then the other thing I learned being a young when I was had a parent of young kids was

338
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:42,760
um uh that kids

339
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:49,160
um at the young age will learn from the parents how to

340
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:54,920
be and so uh there was a period of time where a few time very rare but it was

341
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:00,680
sometimes where one of my kids was kind of difficult for

342
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:06,920
us and sometimes I would use my strong voice I thought to get his attention and

343
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:14,000
have him stop what he was doing but uh it was like no you have to stop with a strong voice and then one day I heard

344
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,599
him use the same voice to his younger brother and I said oh no what have I

345
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,720
done so I learned not to be really careful that what you pass on to next so

346
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:33,280
this I don't think I'm as answering your question adequately but maybe I offered little pieces that might is that okay

347
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,480
for

348
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,560
now uh so G we have a question from YouTube from an um she asked what about

349
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:59,119
when one takes too much responsibility for others feelings

350
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:06,119
well I think that uh one of the things to do always is to turn that the mirror

351
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:11,720
on yourself to to learn how to look more deeply and um and first rather than

352
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:17,720
analyzing or thinking about that you're taking too much responsibility but if you recognize you

353
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:23,079
are really look and feel what that's like to do that what it what's the

354
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:30,040
tension what's the pressure what's the heaviness what's the compulsion where does it feel like in the body physically

355
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:36,079
and to to start with the body begins breaking up the hegemony of the thoughts

356
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,880
the ideas the push of the responsibility and so um so and when you

357
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:47,000
start feeling it physically it's also a way beginning to create some distance

358
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,880
from these really strong compulsive attitudes we might have like including being responsible to other

359
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,960
people a as we kind of begin to relax around it and soften it gives the

360
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,880
opportunity to look at it more deeply what's going on and the next layer might

361
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:09,000
be to notice what emotions come along uh when you're taking responsibility for

362
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,040
others is it anxiety is it anger because you're trying to get everyone to shape up and be just like the way you think

363
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:22,079
they should be uh what what's what's emotionally is going on here and then learn to uh

364
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:28,440
understand them and once you understand kind see the emotions you're in a better place to take a deeper a look at what

365
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:36,880
are you believing what what's the what's the belief behind it what's the message you've learned about how to live a life

366
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,200
uh did you grow up with parents who took responsibility for everybody and then you've learned that's what you're

367
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:51,160
supposed to do and that's where the message came from or that's the belief or maybe the belief is that um you're

368
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:56,720
the all knowing one and uh everyone should just kind of you know behave

369
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,880
properly because you know and that's why you're responsible so I'm just making things up

370
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:07,119
but but uh but uh so to do a deep

371
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:13,880
inquiry in oneself and to to do it in a way with that mirror of mindfulness that

372
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:19,640
the way that we do the inquiry the way we study ourselves are present for ourselves with mindfulness and asking

373
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:26,440
ourselves good questions about what's happening we do it in a way that is um kind we do it in a way that's beneficial

374
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:33,280
that's wholesome uh we don't do it punitively we don't do it critically but say oh this is how it

375
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:41,480
is now let me take a deeper look so that's um what I think I'm looking at you

376
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:49,359
because you answer so thank you for the question on online so thank you all very much so uh
