1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:10,679
okay so uh so welcome folks yeah appreciate seeing the

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,960
uh the uh chats uh over there I did ask

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:23,160
for suggestions on how to meditate and uh saw gentleness and equinity sounds

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:31,480
reasonable to me so um yeah let's uh let's settle into a a

5
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,480
posture

6
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:32,640
just being held by the

7
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:48,000
silence even if there's noise we can be held by the

8
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,880
silence e

9
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:42,599
we're encouraged to bring a spirit of radical honesty to experience the

10
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:47,959
Dharma never asks us to pretend

11
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,879
ever it's r iCal honesty and then it's paired with a kind of

12
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,080
radical nonviolence directed towards the entirety of

13
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,840
our sensory

14
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,760
life e

15
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:20,919
this is our path deeply

16
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:33,198
honest and deep trust that we do not have to to fight to

17
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:44,080
heal we do not have to fight to wake

18
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,680
up e

19
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,280
we just kind of cook in our own

20
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,478
juices Moment by

21
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:01,639
moment experience uh softening us

22
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,720
kneading the dough of our being

23
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,759
just filling your body with

24
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
awareness

25
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
e

26
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,479
e e

27
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:48,720
we don't associate force with gentleness but we can make it

28
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,440
such our strength

29
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,760
and courage and our willingness

30
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,240
can be very gentle

31
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:38,760
the awareness just blend

32
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,200
blessing its

33
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,880
objects with uh Fidelity but uh

34
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
gentleness

35
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,320
e e

36
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,200
we're connecting rather than

37
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:33,200
controlling then controlling the push the pull that's uh not

38
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:47,360
gentle and gentleness is not self-indulgence

39
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,839
we being invited to stay

40
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,760
to give radical permission to the

41
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,800
ambivalence that runs straight through the center of the

42
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,800
world

43
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,199
we practice staying and being softened by what's

44
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
here

45
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

46
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

47
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

48
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,040
e e

49
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:03,440
how uh gently might you want wash a baby's

50
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,560
head kind of make your hands

51
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,279
soft but clear

52
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,040
maybe that's the spirit with which we hold our

53
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,920
experience we just cultivate this

54
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:59,560
deep Trust

55
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:07,480
and kind of surrendering to the

56
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:12,839
flow of pleasant and

57
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
unpleasant

58
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

59
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

60
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

61
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,720
e e

62
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:15,880
you can only know your mind when you stop trying to do anything with your

63
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:30,640
mind perhaps that's the ultimate gentle

64
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
this

65
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

66
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,559
e e

67
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:56,640
clinging is busy

68
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,200
love is

69
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
still

70
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

71
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

72
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

73
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

74
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

75
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

76
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,240
e e

77
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,159
for

78
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:33,840
it's good to um good to sit with you

79
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:11,519
okay so every every now and

80
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:18,360
then I uh like to ask the question like

81
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:26,000
Matthew do you know what you're doing like the whole teaching thing whole

82
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,760
Dharma thing do you know what you're do and that sounds like it comes out of

83
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:40,559
like self-doubt or something uh but I not

84
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:48,840
really it's just that uh as a teacher the way you talk about dma gets shaped

85
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:57,399
by forces you cannot clearly see you know just as our lives are

86
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:05,440
shaped by a million unseen forces one's Dharma is also how one

87
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:12,159
talks about it is also and so I just asked the

88
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:19,720
question you know what's happening here and to answer that I have to

89
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:24,799
consider another question which is something like what's the function of a

90
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:33,360
Dharma talk what's the function of a Dharma talk and um classically from one kind of

91
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:41,200
prominent uh suit the the numerical discourses um the the Dharma should only

92
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:48,039
be taught with the thought of I will speak step by

93
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:55,279
step not doing great on that front I'll speak explaining cause and

94
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:02,799
effect the sequence of cause and effect also a little shaky speak out of compassion okay fair

95
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:11,320
enough speak without um being motivated by material reward okay and speak

96
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:18,760
without disparaging others pry good nor disparaging

97
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:27,480
oneself little shaky but the truth is I only mercilessly make fun of myself because

98
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:34,200
of uh love so so what's the function of a Dharma

99
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:42,559
talk what's the counsil on how to offer things um is a talk meant to be an

100
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:48,600
exchange of information or something

101
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:54,679
else uh in some ways yeah some

102
00:31:54,679 --> 00:32:00,919
ways you know this this path is is about learning the way we learn anything some

103
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:06,919
of Dharma can be learned in the same way as that we learn anything

104
00:32:06,919 --> 00:32:12,240
else and you know experience just The Human

105
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,639
Condition is so bewildering it's amazing you know that the the Buddha and that

106
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:24,200
the tradition sort of arrived at like

107
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:33,240
distinctions that are so valuable you know just just you know carving

108
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:39,039
nature at at its joints you know and um

109
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,960
it's really powerful just to know okay you know I have maps that there are

110
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,320
three Wellsprings of suffering or seven factors or different aspects of

111
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:58,799
mindfulness species of love all the all this it's like yeah we got to learn that we got to learn that

112
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:04,679
and in that respect um Clarity is important you know it's not good to be

113
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:10,960
massively confused it's not good for me to be massively confusing on that

114
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:19,399
front but information transfer is it's not the only currency of

115
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:29,000
exchange and sometimes the Dharma is meant to be bewildering

116
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:36,440
we we don't we don't really like that usually but it's If you're sort of like

117
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,320
it's weird to say but if you're not being bewildered you might not be

118
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:50,679
learning a a dear uh Dharma friend said to me um that uh you know she's been

119
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:57,159
practicing a really long time and she said when she first heard Dharma talk

120
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:03,960
she really really did not understand much you know she didn't know

121
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,599
she there was not a lot of information transfer but what she could hear and

122
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:16,839
what made her keep going was that she could hear that the teacher loved

123
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:21,878
something and knew something that she

124
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:28,560
didn't and so out of that that what the the she wasn't understanding what was

125
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,679
being said exactly but she could sort of sense the faith that was animating those

126
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:41,398
words and she just followed that thread and

127
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:47,799
now she knows everything that they

128
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,720
knew we uh learn more we learn more when

129
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:02,599
we're not highly intolerant of uncertainty when we can roll with

130
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:10,280
ambiguity and consciously experience conflicts with our current mental

131
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:16,000
models you know part of what Spurs our long kind of learning I almost made the

132
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:25,400
slip of longing you know part of what Spurs that is that um we get hungry to resolve some

133
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:32,880
of those tensions how is this you know like it's a it's an awkward place to not

134
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,920
have a coherent model and so it mobilizes something in

135
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:46,760
us that um to try to resolve those tensions in other words it motivates us

136
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:54,520
to grow to learn sometimes uh a Dharma talk

137
00:35:54,520 --> 00:36:00,400
um is uh is just meant to

138
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:06,480
inspire Faith or love for the practice just to to Really Gladden the mind to

139
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,838
Gladden the mind and

140
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,680
um yeah sometimes I can be a little I don't know I'm just uh part of me is

141
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,880
like real renunciation and you know just this

142
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:33,040
kind of eagerness to experience the UNP pleasantness with equinity and yeah it's a good thing for

143
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:39,440
sure sometimes to be willing to feel bad but uh other times it's

144
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:45,640
really supremely good to feel

145
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:49,279
good and

146
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:56,640
uh sometimes uh Dharma talk functions um

147
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:04,200
like a kind of soothing bedtime story you know

148
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:11,040
uh like when I when I used to teach teen Retreats kind of groups of you know 40

149
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:19,280
kids 15 to 19 part Retreat silent retreat part Camp part group therapy

150
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:26,680
roughly you know group come together uh and um and those teen

151
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:34,160
Retreats they would end on January 1st and so the last night was New Year's Eve

152
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:41,280
and we would stay up late and have a dance party and the kids would get kind of a little wild and we would do a

153
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,680
community share like a no talent show kind of vibe except they were all super

154
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,920
talented and uh and dance the New Year in right and then okay what are you

155
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:02,040
going to do with 40 rabid children on New Year's Eve you know who are uh hyped

156
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:09,079
up and uh having vasana romances all over the place you

157
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:15,240
know and so we just get the kids to uh to lay down in the meditation hall and

158
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:21,240
then tell you know lights down eyes closed okay it's story time it's Dharma

159
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:29,599
Story Time and uh that's one function of Dharma

160
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,880
talks uh Dharma talk is a kind of co- meditation where we're offering each

161
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:43,720
other attention you know it's just that simple I offer my attention you offer yours and

162
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:50,599
in that kind of currency there's a lot of of care right I know I've quoted my

163
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:58,599
uh friend and colleague Mar Belzer who said like the willingness to pay attention to another without

164
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:08,680
agenda very closely related to love to love well is to learn to pay attention

165
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:15,400
well and in this way we're um we're really both listening to each other you

166
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:24,560
know listening to each other I'm trying to listen to How the words arise and uh

167
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,880
the ways in which they facilitate kind of sense of connection with

168
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,920
you and that means that I have to stay really close to

169
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:42,400
experience so it's kind of a tension flowing out flowing

170
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,440
down and just abiding in that is is um

171
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:53,400
can be nourishing I'm also very conscious that

172
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:59,599
I don't own my words I don't control the meaning meanings that they make and I

173
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,960
feel often like my words might say too much might say not

174
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:12,280
enough the literary critics say something like the author's dead you know meaning that you are left to

175
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:18,640
construct the meanings to find the resonances to discover something about

176
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,920
yourself in these words it's not my job nor my

177
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:30,119
inclination to tell you what to do or how to to live there are a lot of right

178
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:38,880
ways to live and so in this sense uh a Dharma talk

179
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:46,520
really merely clears a space whereby you can find

180
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:54,079
yourself maybe the the um the most important function of a Dharma talk is

181
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:02,680
something like just to inhabit a d field together the kind of space between

182
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:08,079
us becomes Sanctified even here without seeing you

183
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,960
that's enough it's enough and that space becomes filled

184
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:20,160
with Dharma that space runs through us we become much more

185
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:26,400
porous you know and when there's a sense of we're

186
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,359
doing something together when the Dharma field to use language from Ain Saito

187
00:41:32,359 --> 00:41:40,560
when that opens up I I really have no idea who I am you

188
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:47,720
know and uh but this is how we dwell together the

189
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:53,480
Dharma is a transmission in a sense it's a just a merely

190
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:59,200
modeling particular mind States Moment by

191
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:07,200
moment and the teacher is is just inviting the practitioners into their

192
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:13,440
mind and expressing whatever it may be in that moment love or grief or

193
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,520
emptiness compassion

194
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:24,119
and I have you know I I take care and how I structure a

195
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:29,520
talk and um notes that I follow a kind of outline

196
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:34,960
that I follow um but uh the words are

197
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,720
really only vehicles for expressing a mind

198
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,000
moment and when I'm putting together notes the kind of skeletal outline of a

199
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:51,800
talk uh that's what I'm attuning to what what

200
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:59,119
words can we dwell in together and so this is a function of

201
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:05,200
resonance um I'm only pointing to that which we already

202
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:12,599
share and so the teacher depends on the sincerity of the practitioner a Dharma

203
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:20,440
talk there's no Dharma talk without sincerity and uh kind of when I'm on my

204
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,800
own just in that day I I don't I don't feel like I know anything you know like

205
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:31,160
like wisdom it's like it's like comical you

206
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:38,240
know uh I don't know anything but then we get together you

207
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:45,040
show up then there's Dharma and

208
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:52,160
so uh this is not a kind

209
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,599
of performance but um something like

210
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:03,040
uh just uh co- meditation some some

211
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,520
vulnerability in the exposure I think I I don't know what it means

212
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:13,880
exactly but I saw a dayong on taiichi or maybe it was a book I was titled there

213
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:22,079
are no secrets there are no secrets I love that title you

214
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:29,839
know uh here too no secrets meaning some of you might

215
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:34,359
know me better than I know

216
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:42,720
myself this is a this is

217
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:49,240
s yeah abiding um together in

218
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:55,319
Dharma so I offer this for your consideration
