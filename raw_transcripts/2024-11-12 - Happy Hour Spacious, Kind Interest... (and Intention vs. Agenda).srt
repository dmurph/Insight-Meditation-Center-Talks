00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:05,759
hello hello and welcome everyone to this

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:15,119
edition of happy hour so I would like to uh invite us to

3
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:23,720
explore the practice of presence um this session and

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:31,239
presence with curiosity not assuming or not

5
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:38,480
forcing anything in particular but a stance of Interest

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,600
curiosity um of of being with and and let me give you a couple of pointers as

7
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:51,760
to what I mean um so so I'd like to invite us to

8
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:59,519
explore the way we pay attention in a nuanced way so for example are we paying

9
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:05,560
attention to our breath in order to make it a particular way and it can be very

10
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:14,080
very subtle very subtle what I'm inviting us to explore um are we paying attention to

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,479
our emotions to our heart space in order

12
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:26,799
to dampen it make it okay um to get rid of it rather to get rid of it is it is

13
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:36,040
there an agenda a very subtle agenda and and just to back up um perhaps a

14
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:42,960
question to sit with is there are two modes of meditation one is noticing

15
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:50,000
being with really allowing with any agenda simply

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,079
noticing and seeing what is and only through this way of being

17
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,399
only when we have really seen the ways we make and we we force we

18
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:14,640
don't accept reality only after we have um seeing this then then we are able to

19
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,680
master the second type the second type of skillful means of meditation which is

20
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,200
um cultivating which is for example practice of thought replacement there

21
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:35,120
are teachings in Buddhism on that but the question always comes up do should I just observe or should I change well

22
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,879
changing or or cultivating or shifting becomes so both of these practices are

23
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:47,319
available in the Buddhist Canon

24
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:55,000
however not until we have mastered being with we have mastered seeing clearly

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,480
With No Agenda or or seeing our agenda that oh yeah I'm paying attention to my

26
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,560
backache in order to make it stop like yeah I have an agenda or or My heartache so that just goes away after you've seen

27
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,200
the agend and softened and really released into being okay with not being

28
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,959
okay then it's it's wholesome it that then the mind is

29
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,879
trained to to shift and turn but if you try to shift and turn before you've

30
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:33,319
mastered being with it might become an aversion practice oh yeah I want to get rid of this so so

31
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:38,879
um and not to say that the cultivation

32
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:46,159
practice the cultivation of the heart in meta is um is an aversion practice I'm

33
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:53,000
not equating that at all but I'm what I'm saying is there are some

34
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,480
times that that um if we're not careful the practice of meta or any other

35
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:06,319
practice practice can become a big hammer can become a hammer that we're trying to get rid of uncomfortable

36
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,439
feelings without holding them and being okay with them first so just a very

37
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:18,519
subtle shift that that um or or subtle curiosity interest that comes up for

38
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:25,000
many practitioners and I've had this question before and I've seen it in my own practice

39
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,560
before so hope this makes sense

40
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,800
and if it doesn't don't worry drop drop all the thoughts and what is she talking

41
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:45,800
but I'll lead us into a session of of stability and presence with a sense of

42
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,280
openness and curiosity of of being with what is and

43
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:58,639
um and yeah we'll we'll start there and we'll see where it goes okay great all

44
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,720
right thank you all oh so let's begin let's formally

45
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:13,360
begin arriving arriving and landing in our

46
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,240
posture it's helpful to have an upright

47
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:30,520
posture it's helpful to have our feet flat on the earth firmly planted

48
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,680
to have our chest

49
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:46,639
open sense of openness to possibility to

50
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,440
life yes this too this

51
00:05:52,520 --> 00:06:00,960
too and allowing inviting the body to feel itself to be felt to be

52
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,430
sensed from the [Music]

53
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,400
inside and inviting the shoulders the neck to be

54
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,319
soft the heart to be soft

55
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:43,160
so the posture is holding both stability Integrity with the way we sit and hold

56
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,160
ourselves

57
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:53,080
allall and yet there's

58
00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:01,520
softness gentleness in the heart

59
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:13,560
strong back soft heart strong back strong

60
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,960
torso soft

61
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,720
belly and allowing the breath to be known the whole body the sensations of

62
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:34,879
the breath let it be

63
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,599
known in breath and the out breath

64
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,960
and notice the quality of attention the quality of

65
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,200
knowing is the knowing imbued with

66
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,200
curiosity

67
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:42,159
patience or does it have an agenda to make something go

68
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,600
away or make it a particular

69
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:55,000
way be curious and spacious spaciously know the quality of

70
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
knowing

71
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,760
be more practical how is the breath being known

72
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,160
can it be just as it

73
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
is e

74
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:14,880
and if thoughts are arising so many thoughts past future and

75
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:28,959
present be spaciously interested in the quality of being entangled in thoughts

76
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:37,279
are we addictively entangled are we absent mindly entangled

77
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,720
it's the

78
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,480
quality and after we know we see and

79
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:58,079
recognize inviting awareness to know the breath

80
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,880
simply calming soothing

81
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,279
breath however it chose up deeper

82
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
shallow

83
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

84
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

85
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

86
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,120
e e

87
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:09,360
notice that as we spaciously become curious about the quality of

88
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:15,959
knowing the heart and mind feel more spacious knowing itself

89
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:21,680
becomes more spacious more stable more

90
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:30,880
grounded this aspect of gentle curiosity kind gentle

91
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:38,560

interest what is this Human Experience in this moment in this body

97

this mind and heart spacious gentle

98
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:46,000
interest without an

99
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
agenda

100
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920

e e

126
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:14,720
and as we turn to bring this meditation to a

127
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:22,240
close meeting meeting ourselves our

128
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:30,158
attitude with spacious friendly relaxed interest

129
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:53,320
noticing what's arising and bowing appreciating whatever

130
00:27:53,320 --> 00:28:00,559
is arising knowing it and trusting there

131
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:08,480
is seeds of wholesome knowing a different kind of relationship

132
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:16,159
to ourselves and therefore to others in the world these seeds being

133
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:21,320
planted with kindness and generosity offering the goodness of our

134

happy and free including

136
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:52,200
ourselves thanks everyone thank you for your

137
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:59,760
practice [Music] so this way of attending this way of

138
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,799
knowing this practice is very gentle seems like a

139
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:14,640
very subtle practice but it's very powerful because as we really open up to

140
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:23,240
this gentle spacious friendly presence interest curiosity is

141
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:30,279
very spacious very open we start to see we start to see

142
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:36,880
with friendliness with kindness without judgment some of the assumptions that we

143
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:44,640
have some of the attitudes we have some of the pains and aches that we have and

144
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:51,519
it shifts our relationship to them it wakes us up from being in the middle of them caught in them to a different

145
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:59,120
relationship to them this is very powerful and it it helps to hang in here

146
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,559
with that attitude of knowing and spacious friendly

147
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:11,320
gentle presence it's not a big bang Hammer approach it's a very

148
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:17,640
gentle um opening to and seeing things perhaps

149
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:24,480
that we usually don't see because they're so subtle in our assumptions Etc

150
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:31,360
um I wonder if some showed up for you anyway before we head to groups I want to ask

151
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,760
you a question I'm going to open chat and ask you was there particular

152
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:42,559
phrasing of the invitations that worked for you you were invited to shift them

153
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:51,080
and change them any of the words and if you like to put them in chat that would be nice seaing for the

154
00:30:51,080 --> 00:31:00,159

167
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:31,039
work for us in any way that that supported us yeah that's great and I

168
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,799
trust there's more that perhaps became available seeing

169
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:42,159
um yeah things that were perhaps in the midst of or something else that was

170
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:49,760
holding that just kind of got soft with this with this open spacious gentle

171
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,799
interest to bring more kindness stability to help ourselves support

172
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:04,000
ourselves and others so now I like to invite us to um enter into the practice

173
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:12,480
of meta M TTA in uh in small groups so the happy

174
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,080
hour breakout room guidance I will put it in

175
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:26,279
chat here we go and the invitation is to practice um meta for ourselves and

176
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:33,639
others mind Yul speaking and listening really treating the breakout groups as an

177
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:39,840
extension of um yeah of of the sitting

178
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:46,600
practice um embracing compassion if if any internal resistance or reaction or

179
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:52,679
discomfort comes up internal external to hold it with kindness compassion stay on

180
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:58,960
topic and the topic is this first round I'd like to invite

181
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,399
you to share if you would what word or phrase was helpful for you and just

182
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:10,079
offer that as support for you to be held witness nobody has to be right or wrong

183
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:17,520
there's no word or phrase that's better than any other it's all whatever works but just a way of being held witness and

184
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,960
the second round in the group The Invitation is if you feel like it you

185
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,520
can reflect out loud if there was something that became clear with this

186
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:33,800
way of seeing um so I'll share with you that a

187
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:41,839
few days ago I was practicing and and I noticed the way I was being with my breath was but it was just a little

188
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:49,560
force was a little even though I was just being with it supposedly the way it was when I shifted to The Stance of open

189
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:57,118
gentle curiosity then I notice oh there was just a tiny bit of agenda tiny little little bit to make this the

190
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:03,800
breath you know Fuller more more whatever like Ah that's not needed was

191
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:10,839
so subtle or for example seeing an attitude in the mind that um maybe the

192
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:17,440
mind and the Heart were a little cranky or a little midst of you know conversation that or something that had happened earlier like oh wow that's

193
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:24,520
still resonating not needed not needed so these very subtle things that can see

194
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:30,960
um when we open um with this ey attitude of spacious so stay on this topic so

195
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:38,880
first round sharing the words if you like the second round if there's any opening or something that showed up for

196
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:47,280
you you're welcome to share or if not you're H you're welcome to say pass or hold silent space it's okay

197
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,079
you don't have to talk and please take turns briefly so

198
00:35:53,079 --> 00:35:59,160
everyone can speak and avoiding cross talk and giving each other advice just

199
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:05,680
oh I see the rest of it didn't get copied but that's good enough avoiding cross talk and commenting interrupting

200
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:11,480
just staying with your own practice uh Le sharing for her own sake

201
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:16,960
so be kind to yourself be kind to one another and really the breakout groups

202
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:23,920
is where the rubber meets the road in these days especially with what has been happening in this country Community is

203
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:31,520
so important uh finding um yeah finding support and even if we

204
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:37,480
don't directly offer support about the events of the world just our Our Kind

205
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:44,000
kind spacious presence is support enough so please stay to the topic all right

206
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,160
I'm going to create the breakout rooms

207
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:56,680
and open them take care of yourselves take care of one another here we go okay

208
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:02,480
welcome back everyone the rooms are closed

209
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:09,280
and um yeah we have time and space for Reflections questions how was the

210
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:15,760
practice today for you what what uh did you discover either in the silent

211
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,160
practice or in the interactive practice and also apologies I was trying to move

212
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:27,280
uh combin some of the smaller groups and got a little clunky so if I moved you a little late after you had been starting

213
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,359
to to speak my apologies so I hope it was more nourishing to have more people

214
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:39,440
to speak with than just one person so Audrey

215
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:46,240
please thank you Nikki um I was struck

216
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:52,359
by something that you said about I think you put it as putting aside the

217
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:58,119
agenda and I was wondering um

218
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:06,160
how that might be different from an intention yeah yeah I appreciate the

219
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,160
question [Music] so yeah

220
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:18,640
what um what I mean by the agenda and how it's different from an intention is

221
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:26,480
the following agenda is kind of a secret agenda somehow that we don't quite see

222
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,838
but it's operating and it's not necessarily very

223
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:41,119
wholesome yeah is that is that enough does that clarify what I mean

224
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,920
there and how it lands for you oh you're you're muted sorry let's try that

225
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:54,560
again a yet another subtlety to be uh try to notice yeah yeah yeah does it

226
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:03,839
land do you feel the difference in your heart I love it oh darn another one I have but

227
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:12,760
but they're lovely right when you expl when you see them like wow another layer of the onion this is so cool and so

228
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:20,280
interesting this being human thing right wow the Mind thing yeah yeah and I'll

229
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,480
tell you what one common one that happens a very common one for example

230
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:32,200
and and again we discover these different versions but one common one is know the intention the wholesome

231
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:40,119
intention might be um say there is pain in the body and my wholesome intention

232
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:46,760
is to to learn from it to be with it to cultivate kindness compassion for myself

233
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:52,240
and for others who are hurting and that's a beautiful intention right and

234
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,839
yet the agenda which kind of Might creep in is like you notice oh I'm

235
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,880
really paying attention in order to make it stop make it go away now because I

236
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:10,560
hate it and I don't want to be here and I'm afraid of being sick and being in bed for the rest of the week like oh wow

237
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,599
oh I see you so example thank you thank

238
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,720
you thanks Audrey great question

239
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:29,318
Neil oh at the very beginning you talked about

240
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:35,640
keeping track of right that when you pay attention to your breath you're not trying to change

241
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:41,280
it and I find when I pay attention to my breath it almost always

242
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,560
changes right and depending on where I pay attention to depends on how it

243
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,640
changes yeah but I'm not trying to change it

244
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:58,160
[Music] so yeah so so

245
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:03,400
yes yes and yes so this is um it is

246
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:08,720
absolutely true that we when we attend

247
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:14,520
to when we when we know the breath um and the mind and the Heart settle the

248
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:22,920
breath shifts it changes of course it does of course of course it does that is that is

249
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:28,040
different from what I'm saying I'm saying that sometimes we do pay

250
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:34,160
attention to the breath with sometimes with an agenda sometimes you know if we've had

251
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:39,240
say training and in parama to make the breath longer and subtle to really

252
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:45,599
notice the breath in a particular place but sometimes the agenda again could be

253
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:52,400
very subtle so we can have a subtle agenda so

254
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:58,079
to notice that but but that's not withstanding even if you pay attention

255
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,160
to the breath without any agenda of course it settles and and it get it

256
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:11,119
shifts so these these two are a bit orthogonal so so no problem here Neil So

257
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,680
quite I find when I pay attention to my abdomen my breath tends to be

258
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:22,680
more abdomen that's a word and when I pay attention to my chest it's the

259
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:29,960
breath tends to be higher up yeah yeah so you're saying and that just happens

260
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:35,760
of course that just happens not a problem I think what there's there's no

261
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,839
problems here there's no issue here they the this invitation to

262
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:48,280
pay um to pay attention to the quality of paying

263
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:58,240
attention is to uncover any subtle unhelpful agendas that they

264
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:04,720
that might be there there may be nothing right as you're reporting there may be nothing but there might be something

265
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:12,839
that's sadly shifted it's um does that make sense yes great thank you thank you

266
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:21,559
thank you and one direct message that came to

267
00:43:21,559 --> 00:43:27,920
me I Nikki sometimes negative story making can be very powerful and knowing

268
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,720
that it's negative I can have trouble receiving it with openness

269
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:39,359
ah so so negative story making so and feel

270
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:44,960
free to to write more because I'm going to try to assume what the question is

271
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:51,480
and comment on it and if I get it wrong please correct me and and if you feel comfortable you can raise your hand but

272
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:57,559
not to put you on the spot you can um send me a message so so say I'm sitting

273
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:05,079
and and having this spacious quality of attention I'm realizing oh yeah there is a story

274
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:15,599
making it's like da da da da da da there's kind of like a negative story making and oh oh ouch can can in that

275
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:22,960
moment be either kindness you know this gentle kindness that I'm offering when

276
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,760
it comes to the pain of the story making it naturally becomes compassion

277
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:36,960
naturally becomes is this oh holding the gentle spacious interest becomes a

278
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:43,760
caring gentle interest can it hold the negative story in ourselves in that way

279
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:51,880
that would be the invitation another another way to work with it is this gentle spacious interest

280
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:59,240
when it notices that yeah this is this is kind of a um negative story can it

281
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:06,079
really hold it with spaciousness like it's okay yeah causes and

282
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:12,800
conditions lots of spaciousness and then this negativity in the story can soften

283
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,839
on its own and settle so these are a couple of ways to work with it and I

284
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:24,680
hope that this addressed the question you asking if not please thank you the

285
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:30,000
person says you are welcome so we' just got a couple more minutes

286
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:38,680
for any questions Reflections maybe anything that came up in the small groups as you practice

287
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:46,000
together going on going

288
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,880
toward

289
00:45:55,359 --> 00:46:01,680
friend I know you thank you um so I guess I'm asking

290
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:09,280
here am I forcing am I forcing something or am I taking the opportunity so last night I

291
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:15,319
woke up uh 3 o00 and I realized I'm not going to go back to sleep I'm just

292
00:46:15,319 --> 00:46:21,960
really awake um and I thought well I don't want to I

293
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:29,440
don't want to perseverate about that I I I sort of felt my body as it was and

294
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,119
um I thought well I'm I'm just going to use this time and I'm going to direct Goodwill

295
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:41,640
to batches of people and I really spent a long time doing that and maybe I fell

296
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:48,960
asleep at some point I don't I you know I'm not sure but it wasn't really a goal

297
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:54,640
um and that seems a reasonable thing to me to do you know with with uh an

298
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:02,200
imperfect situation at that yeah absolutely Fred this is lovely

299
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:09,920
thank you for sharing this and and the Nuance that you shared which I loved was

300
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:15,559
you know I did this practice to to you know to take advantage of this

301
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:22,559
opportunity I'm awake the middle of the night cultivating and it wasn't so much of an agenda I might fall asleep I know

302
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:29,079
I know having a light heart can be helpful but it wasn't so much like I'm doing this in order to fall asleep so

303
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:34,359
that agenda wasn't there I'm hearing this and yet what what a wholesome way

304
00:47:34,359 --> 00:47:43,640
to to um to really cultivate do the cultivation practice with with this with

305
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:49,000
this Hammer of an agenda again intention you I'm going to bring back what Audrey

306
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:55,280
brought which is lovely you had the intention of of um using this time in

307
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:02,119
the mold of the night yeah I'm awake yeah what a great time to practice I do this often too I just put away sleep for

308
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:11,440
a moment like yeah I'm going to celebrate that I'm awake and and and practice and and um yeah it's not

309
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:18,400
because if there was the agenda of falling asleep then it would be like am I sleep yet I'm doing this meta thing but I'm still awake right that's the

310
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:25,119
difference that's the difference between wholesome intention and agenda and you beautifully uh brought it up with this

311
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:31,400
example they may be subtle but they're not not not subtle at all actually to me sounds very

312
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:37,359
