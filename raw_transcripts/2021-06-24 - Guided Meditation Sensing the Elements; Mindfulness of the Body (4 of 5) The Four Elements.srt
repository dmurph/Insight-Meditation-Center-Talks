1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:08,240
greetings to all of you and happy to be here

2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,400
and one of the things that i love about sitting down to meditate

3
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:26,000
is i kind of return to a simplicity of being

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:34,160
a kind of um returning to the

5
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:40,719
elemental qualities of just being alive and the immediacy of the of it the

6
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:46,800
directness of it and

7
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,640
maybe it's uh the difference between spending a whole life eating processed

8
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,239
food versus uh going out into the garden and

9
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:07,280
picking vegetables and produce and coming in and

10
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,080
maybe if it's a salad just all raw ingredients that are gathered together and made into a nice

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,000
salad or zucchinis and onions that are chopped up and

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,840
and cooked directly and so in the same way we can live our lives

13
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:36,000
lost in thought preoccupied in abstractions involved in the complexity of political

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,240
philosophy family dramas

15
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,759
sensual fantasies and the world of regrets and

16
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,759
resentments all this kind of abstract world that we keep processing and processing and

17
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,000
processing and and it's not just a simple processed food it's over processed and

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,360
reprocessed and deprocessed and all kinds of things

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:15,200
but then we come to sit and meditate and we return to the garden

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,560
we return to where the elemental aspects of just being alive and

21
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,800
breathing and sensing and feeling exist and it's such a it can be such a

22
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:34,080
delight it can be a challenge too because the momentum of the

23
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,000
processing machine can be strong there's not a simple switch to turn off

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,080
the processor and but to appreciate

25
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,760
that underneath all the thoughts ideas experiencings we're

26
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,959
processing there is something very fundamental

27
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:05,360
and elemental and basic about just breathing and

28
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,120
blood coursing through our veins and the nerve ends in our skins and

29
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,840
throughout our bodies picking up whatever sensations that are

30
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,599
being whatever things are triggering the sensations

31
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,760
the elemental qualities of our temperature and warmth and coolness

32
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,480
hardness and softness movements of the body

33
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,519
so we'll sit here

34
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:53,439
and feeling the solidity of your body maybe against the

35
00:03:53,439 --> 00:04:01,840
whatever object is supporting the weight of your pro of your body

36
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,080
so you're the bottom of your chair your cushion the floor the bed

37
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:21,919
whatever supporting the weight of your body to feel the elemental solidity of that

38
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:29,840
or hardness firmness of that the support of it

39
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:42,160
much of our life maybe all of our lives unless we're

40
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:51,759
flying fundamental is the foundational support

41
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,720
that holds our weight so we don't fall through space

42
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,840
and then there the solidity of our bones that

43
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:21,280
maintains the muscles in the flesh from just completely collapsing like a empty pillowcase

44
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:30,080
and to feel the sense the uprightness if you're sitting upright of the bones

45
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:38,639
the spine and the solidity perhaps all the way up the spine to the neck

46
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:52,960
to the skull

47
00:05:52,960 --> 00:06:01,759
and then accompanying us through this life is basic movements of breathing

48
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,840
that can operate

49
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:17,520
without any concern or thought from ourselves or we can be actively involved in

50
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,600
breathing and to appreciate this play

51
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,479
by taking a few long slow deep breaths

52
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:42,240
this fundamental rhythm of breathing that's like the rhythm of the tides the rhythm of the days and nights

53
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,240
the natural rhythm that we have inherited

54
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,479
from the whole process of evolution

55
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,680
and relaxing softening

56
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:17,199
releasing the ways that muscles are sticky

57
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,919
close contracted

58
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,440
releasing softening

59
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:35,599
moving in the direction of the muscles of the shoulders the belly

60
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:43,440
arms and legs maybe becoming a little bit water-like

61
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:59,840
flowing and soft and not resisting anything not holding back

62
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:13,840
letting your breathing be normal

63
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:26,319
and settling down into the body's experience of itself

64
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:33,039
sensations there are in the body you might think of them as the

65
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:40,640
raw ingredients that takes in the data the information

66
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,800
that gathers together experiences which the mind can

67
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,839
process and abstract on and get involved in its thoughts and

68
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,720
concerns and for these minutes here

69
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,279
you do not need to think about anything or process anything

70
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:10,560
maybe you can give yourself a break a pause

71
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:19,360
to trust that there is something else to do here besides think and consider and remember

72
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:27,120
and plan to be in the garden of the body

73
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:37,839
the elemental qualities of sensations

74
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:51,760
where the mind's involvement is to receive

75
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:59,519
receive the elemental basic experience physical experience

76
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:08,240
of body shifting buzzing kaleidoscope

77
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,560
of changing sensations in the body

78
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:24,720
when you need to let the thinking mind become quieter

79
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,120
no need to do keep thinking

80
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,160
quieting the mind so the mind can spend more time

81
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,600
sensing feeling receiving

82
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,839
savoring the experience of body

83
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:56,480
and how those sensations of body are shifting and changing and moving and pulsing

84
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:15,839
in a flow just body for these minutes

85
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,280
you might relate to the sensations of your body

86
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:15,840
as you would to the weather

87
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:23,120
both impersonal and intimate if we're in the weather

88
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,840
if you have uncomfortable sensations in your body

89
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:34,080
it's a particular kind of weather

90
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:48,480
allow yourself to rest settle trust ex elemental experience

91
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:57,840
of the sensations of the body

92
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:17,200
one of the values of attention to the elemental qualities of

93
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:24,399
sensations is in fact a notice how much we will drift away from that in our

94
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:31,039
mental processing into a world that can be much more

95
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:38,080
complex convoluted stressful

96
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:45,840
than the raw simplicity of the body just breathing and heartbeating

97
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,360
and perhaps you have a small taste today or other times

98
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:03,440
of the thinking processing mind coming more and more to rest

99
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,519
and just sitting breathing peacefully quietly

100
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,840
just being

101
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,559
and maybe it helps us to realize appreciate how many people's minds are

102
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:27,600
spinning in this convoluted processing of

103
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,760
thoughts and ideas memories plans fantasies

104
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:40,880
spitting webs that they get caught in spinning webs of thoughts and ideas that

105
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,760
with which they suffer and may we have compassion

106
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,480
care good will

107
00:29:53,600 --> 00:30:02,559
to all the people suffering because of their thoughts and way of thinking

108
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:14,720
and may we wish others that they can have a peaceful mind

109
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,600
an an anxious mind

110
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:29,760
a settled mind that's able to be here breathing and appreciating the simplicity of life

111
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:37,840
in this beautiful garden of the body the present moment

112
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:46,398
may all beings have peace of mind

113
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,360
may all beings can it break from their stresses of

114
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,120
their thinking mind

115
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:05,840
may all beings hold with care and compassion their struggles

116
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,480
may all beings experience a freedom from struggles and

117
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:22,320
stresses in their mind and in doing so

118
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,320
may they feel the richness and the peacefulness

119
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,880
of just being as they are

120
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:47,840
may all beings be happy and free

121
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:13,679
so before i offer my words this morning

122
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:20,399
when i say that announce that for tomorrow a nicki minaj will give the 7a and lead

123
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:25,760
to 7 am sitting in that talk i'm gonna go i'm going to go and see my

124
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:32,399
90 year old father and we'll start then we need to start this driving down to southern california

125
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:39,679
i'd like to start early before it's too hot or it's too late and

126
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:47,120
uh it's very fortuitous that the nikki will come because the schedule was to talk about

127
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:55,600
the final exercise and mindfulness of the body is an exercise that might sound gruesome

128
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,640
but i'm sure that nikki will present it in other ways

129
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,159
which is um a imaginary practice a visualizing practice or a

130
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:15,679
cons or an or reviewing practice of of uh of of how this body of ours

131
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:22,240
sooner or later will become a corpse and rather than being a

132
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,000
gruesome and and frightening depressing uh exercise i think it's really part and

133
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,399
parcel of this movement towards freedom and and so um nikki has done a lot of

134
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:41,039
contemplation of that a lot of consideration of this i think maybe last year she even talked about it a bit during when she was

135
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:47,279
leading this 7 a.m so it was very fortuitous that the topic should be one that's so close to the

136
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:56,640
to nikki's heart and i think you'll be in much better hands with her than me on this topic so i'm very happy for this

137
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:06,320
so so but the topic for today is i'll

138
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:14,480
introduce this way and that is that many years ago i saw a poem and

139
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,760
i remember all the pieces of the poem but it was a very simple poem that said something that if you're running

140
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:29,919
walk if you're walking stand if you're standing sit down

141
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:36,480
if you're sitting lay down and i think it went on and it was but there was a progressive movement

142
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:43,200
to be getting quieter and quieter stiller and stiller to less activity less energy involved in doing

143
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:50,720
and doing and doing and um and this is could be described a little bit the movement of meditation

144
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:57,920
that we're we're moving from a mind which is very much more active busy abstract

145
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:05,680
thinking a lot and letting the thinking mind the abstraction mind become quieter but not just become quiet and

146
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:11,680
calm but become clearer and clearer so there's a clarity of attention

147
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:19,280
that goes completely together with no longer being so involved in caught up

148
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:27,280
in the thinking world and so much of the stress that human beings experience

149
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:33,440
you might attribute it to the world around you which has some truth to it but it's all processed through the world

150
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:38,960
much of it process through the world of our thoughts and our thoughts themselves get

151
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,079
transformed into emotions and emotions come back and feed the thoughts and there can be

152
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:50,560
this complicated loop that mobius loop that we can never get out of

153
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,760
thoughts and feelings and spinning and and but

154
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:03,359
as we sit down to meditate some of this stuff quiets down and thinking about the future quiets

155
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:09,520
down and we're just thinking about the present thinking about the present in terms of me myself and mine

156
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:16,880
and how i feel all my resentments or dreams quiets down and we just get

157
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:25,040
quieter and quieter in there in that mind as we realize we give our mind a vacation a rest from the

158
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,319
incessant ways in which we can be think and think and think and think

159
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:36,720
and i can remember being laying on grass someplace looking at the

160
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:45,520
clouds drifting by and feeling so content and happy and peaceful and just watching the

161
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,440
patterns of the moving clouds as they move through the blue sky above me and

162
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,599
after a while not only you know so much of my my daily life and concerns fell away it was just

163
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:04,480
i was just there with kind of absorbed or involved and just watching the changing

164
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,680
patterns of clouds and the movement of it until i i would say that i wasn't even

165
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:16,400
thinking there are clouds uh there was just awareness of movement and color and shapes that were shifting

166
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:22,880
into and it's much more elemental basic and and the relief the peace the

167
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:29,200
simplicity the quiet of the mind that can do that with the clarity of seeing to them not

168
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:35,359
numbed out but with clarity it just gets so peaceful and it was a wonderful break it's a

169
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:42,720
wonderful pause it was a little vacation from uh being so caught up in things

170
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,839
so and then if we have that experience then we have a can have a new

171
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:55,359
appreciation of how the mind gets caught how the mind gets preoccupied and spins out and

172
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:02,320
busy and all that if all we ever know is a busy mind it feels normal and the stresses of it

173
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:09,119
just are taken for granted or not even known they're just it's so so um normalized we don't even

174
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:14,960
know it's there but if we have this experience this very strong radical experience of really

175
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,400
things getting quiet in the mind then we can start taking more uh

176
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:26,320
consideration and care and uh and of this of what the mind is

177
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:31,599
doing and we begin getting us a feeling for what freedom is and peace is

178
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:38,560
that's not in chasing more thoughts not by thinking better but by quieting

179
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:44,000
the thoughts but not to numb out or to be disconnected to the world

180
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,240
but to have a kind of a different kind of intelligence operating that is the intel that it's not so much

181
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:54,800
uh centered in thinking

182
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:02,640
so it's in this context i'd like to talk about this next exercise of the

183
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,640
mindfulness of the four elements and this is the simple very simple maybe appropriately simple

184
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:14,800
instructions some of the simplest ones for mindfulness practice

185
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:29,760
um one considers one one um

186
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:37,040
contemplates the same body um however it is placed

187
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:43,838
however disposed to whatever way the body's sitting standing walking whatever way we are

188
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,160
as consisting of elements thus in this body there are the earth element

189
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:57,040
the water element the fire element and the air element and

190
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,240
and this is supposed to be an ancient indian idea that all physical matter is made up of four different

191
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:10,960
elements or qualities or characteristics or processes uh

192
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,359
earth i think that that

193
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,760
yeah earth water fire and air and um kind of like you know the

194
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:37,280
earth is the foundation for the oceans and the rivers and so then um fire is a little bit more

195
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,040
the fires of kitchen fires of the ancient world campfires of the ancient world that

196
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:49,680
um and then higher than that is there so it kind of goes from the most solid to the most ethereal or most

197
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:57,119
light and but how it applies to our body is uh that it's aware of the raw basic

198
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,960
sensations of the body the physical sensations that make up our experience of the body

199
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,160
not necessarily what the body is but how from the inside out we experience the

200
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:17,599
body and it simplifies all the possible experience we have into four categories those of solidity

201
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:25,440
those of liquidity those of motion and those of movement so solidity is the

202
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:33,200
earth element liquidity is water element and the

203
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:40,000
temperature is the fire element and movement the wind associated is the

204
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,040
the air element and so there it isn't so much you have to

205
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:51,599
remember and fit everything into these four elements ideas but to really under

206
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:57,760
the sensations that those uh point to so to feel the solidity the

207
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,839
hardness the softness of the body the weight of the body the lightness of the body perhaps

208
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:10,720
to feel the temperature of the body the cold and the heat to feel

209
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:17,119
the movements of the body the movements of the chest and the diaphragms as we breathe the

210
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,800
sometimes you can feel it that feels like the blood coursing through us or the movements of the heart and

211
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:30,000
whatever it might be and then the water element is all the things that are kind of fluid

212
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,920
and a little bit sticky it says that uh it's what creates stickiness and so i

213
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:42,400
associate it with uh with the muscles or tents and other people might have different associations to the elements

214
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:48,560
but as they they get kind of tight sometimes sticky and we can unstick them and sometimes you have to

215
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:54,160
massage your muscles a lot to get them kind of to unstick but

216
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:03,680
saliva when we swallow is definitely fluid and and and so here the idea is to drop in

217
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,960
to the raw fundamental simplicity of the body kind of like you're looking at the

218
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:16,319
clouds and just letting everything else go trusting sensing this very basic

219
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:23,839
aspect of human life the sensing of the body to get concentrated to be quiet to begin

220
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:29,280
letting go of the complicated world of thoughts and ideas and and to really kind of become more and

221
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,960
more attuned to um to get concentrated into the world of

222
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:42,000
our sensations and as we do that the mind gets quieter and quieter still learns stiller

223
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:50,400
and there's two great benefits of this many benefits but one is that the mind gets quieter

224
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,560
and we have a whole different vantage point to be wise about the thinking mind

225
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:04,480
and not be lost in it and the other advantage is that as we get

226
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,960
deeper and deeper kind of absorbed in a concentrated way into this world of just basic flow of

227
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:16,800
sensations the kaleidoscope the the river of sensations that move through us all the

228
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,640
different sensations that come and go to we less and less hold them together relax

229
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:29,359
relate to them as abstractions the idea that there's a hand is it's true enough but it is a little

230
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:35,119
bit of abstraction compared to just the sensations of the hand

231
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:42,160
close your eyes and just the sensations as they buzzing glowing pulsing tingling sensations of the hand

232
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,440
and the kind of handness the idea of the hand falls away because that's a little bit

233
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,520
of a concept we overlay on the hand and but just the sensations

234
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:59,440
of it we find that it lends lends itself to

235
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,920
more and more of the mind letting go letting go letting go and even holding even there's a subtle way in which

236
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:11,040
the idea of hand is a little attachment a little holding on to something

237
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:18,079
that's not needed to hold on to in deep meditation and so this idea of dropping into the

238
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:24,960
elemental sensations the raw foundation from which we build so much of our lives

239
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:31,599
and and get concentrated there just the simplicity of the elemental qualities of our physical

240
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:37,839
body is um as a very

241
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:45,440
key aspect of mipasana practice and because it allows us to see

242
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:51,680
the changing nature of phenomena the impermanent inconstant nature of this and that

243
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:58,960
itself leads to freedom so may you spend time in the garden of

244
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:04,720
your body with the basic foundational ingredients

245
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:13,839
of the from which we build so much of our complicated life and maybe uh stop maybe for a while from

246
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:20,640
eating processed food but rather start with the elemental ingredients and

247
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:27,599
just feel and sense and let them the rawness of them like eating raw

248
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:32,640
vegetables raw food that might be full of nutrients

249
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:38,960
may the raw elemental sensations of your body nourish you with some of the best

250
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:46,160
nutrients that we can have so thank you very much and

251
