1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:12,480
so warm greetings from redwood city

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,240
it's nice to be here i feel kind of quiet at the moment so

3
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,720
to warm up settle down get ready for meditation

4
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,280
the um there's a saying if you go walking in

5
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,960
the wilderness sometimes go backpacking that the

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,680
saying is leave only footsteps so sometimes they say leave no traces

7
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,719
or leave only footsteps and in the time of the buddha

8
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,559
buddha commented on that birds leave no traces no trail behind them when they

9
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:03,280
fly through the sky and this relates to the idea of

10
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,680
the metaphor of seeing for meditation to observe

11
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,640
that um if you are lay on the grass and look at the clouds

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,000
drifting by you look see them but you do not disturb them

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,520
if you sit to the edge of a river and watch the river go by you see it but you don't disturb it

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,200
this is a wonderful thing about eyesight that that

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,960
we can see clearly if we can see but we're not obviously

16
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,640
normally interfering with what we see we don't touch it we don't manipulate it

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,640
we just observe it so the same thing with the breathing

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,399
to observe the breathing is to not be bothered by it

19
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:04,399
and not have an agenda about it but rather to let the breathing take care of itself

20
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,319
and if you find that you can't help but to control your breath that you're breathing or

21
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,800
you find that the breath is constricted in some way no worry

22
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,640
the idea is to simply very simply be to observe that to be with it

23
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,440
and sometimes settling back and just to watch it even from a distance rather than feeling it sometimes is

24
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,480
really helpful of not being bothered getting out of the way of it and this to do so is

25
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,480
is not passive in the sense of we don't care about what happens

26
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,400
but rather it's strategic in that it allows for the natural system

27
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,000
to come to equilibrium it allows for the natural way of breathing to settle down

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,280
an observed observed breath observed breathing

29
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,640
returns to um to harmony in a sense

30
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,560
the buddha said that an observed mind becomes happy

31
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,599
the idea also just leaving the mind alone and letting it kind of settle out

32
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,440
and it points to the idea that we're often with our attachments we're often

33
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,720
engaged manipulating fixing reacting to all kinds of things

34
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,000
and that reactivity doesn't allow for some equilibrium and settling to happen

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,120
and so part of the art of meditation is learning how

36
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,360
not to be reactive caught in involved in with what's going on and i like to say

37
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,720
not be bothered by it one of the great teachings i received around

38
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,799
thinking and meditation was a teaching don't be bothered by your thinking

39
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,879
but for this week on breathing see if you can have leave no traces not

40
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,080
even a footstep with your breathing just observe it

41
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,599
as if you're looking at clouds drifting by or waves gently lapping up against the

42
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:18,959
shore or as if you're watching the the little wavelets of a river as the water flows

43
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:26,160
down now the idea is to get out of the way of your breathing but clearly stay present for it

44
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,880
and trust that your whole psychophysical system will take care of it as need be if we

45
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,639
really just observe some the miracle of observation gentle

46
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:47,199
caring loving receptive uh observation of of breathing

47
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,160
so to take a meditation posture

48
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:59,040
and um sometimes you can pull in the top the

49
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,880
spot the spine between the shoulder blades ever so slightly

50
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,840
in such a way that it it kind of pushes out the chest

51
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,520
maybe a little bit straighter so there's more room for the lungs and

52
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,199
the diaphragm to breathe

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,120
and lower your gaze relax your

54
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,440
gaze and kind of an unfocused gaze not looking on anything

55
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,560
and then gently closing your eyes

56
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,639
in the beginning of meditation we can actively engage the breathing

57
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,440
to establish the connection to help relax

58
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,600
and maybe also set up a contrast between being involved with breathing and later

59
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:11,199
letting it breathe itself so taking a few long slow deep breaths

60
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,759
really feeling your lungs fully the top of the lungs as

61
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:28,919
well and then a long leisurely exhale

62
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,280
and exhale relaxing the body

63
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,199
and then letting your breathing return to normal

64
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:03,319
on the exhale relaxing the muscles around the face

65
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,720
around the eyes

66
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,080
and around the mouth

67
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,199
on the exhale relaxing the shoulders

68
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,000
and softening the belly

69
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:55,599
and moving slowly a little bit to a breathing that's simply observed and allowed to breathe

70
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:02,879
itself ever so slightly at the end of the exhale

71
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,440
pause before you breathe in not so you get winded or something but

72
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,039
just a gentle pause so you can feel

73
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:21,160
the desire of the body to breathe in

74
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,080
and then allow the body to inhale

75
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,200
and perhaps also at the top of the inhale

76
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:02,720
a gentle pause so you can feel the pull of the body to

77
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,760
exhale and as soon as you feel that little pull

78
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,200
give into it allow it

79
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:36,399
the body will breathe itself if you allow it to so to do so

80
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,320
so now don't make any effort with the pause

81
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,640
just allow your breathing to breathe itself

82
00:09:52,959 --> 00:10:00,519
but being a witness to your body breathing

83
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:12,880
without being bothered whether you are still controlling it or if it feels constricted or difficult

84
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,880
if anything as you watch it be curious about it

85
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,360
or be tender and caring

86
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,000
trusting for now that all you need to do is to

87
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,680
accompany it as a witness just observe

88
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:47,160
the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

89
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,000
if your mind is actively thinking

90
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:24,320
see if you can allow yourself not to be bothered by that but also not continue with it

91
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,959
instead when the mind wanders away from the breathing

92
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:39,720
open the window of the eyes to allow the breathing to appear

93
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,680
the rhythm of the waves of breathing

94
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,240
coming and going

95
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:38,319
as you watch your exhale see if you can watch the whole exhale

96
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,360
like you would watch a bird fly through the sky

97
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,839
you would watch the whole thought you'd follow it

98
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,399
until it disappears

99
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,839
watch the whole inhale

100
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:19,799
allowing each inhale and exhale to be itself

101
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,279
another way of talking about watching the breath

102
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:17,360
is to allow the breathing to breathe itself and see what happens

103
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:24,559
when you stay close continuous with gently watching

104
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:32,679
the inhale and the exhale as if you would do it forever

105
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,158
as we come to the end of the sitting

106
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,760
to mention that there are times when one of the

107
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:11,600
gifts we can give others is to allow them to be themselves

108
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,840
to allow them to be themselves with respect

109
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,279
with appreciation

110
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,120
and this ability to sit quietly in meditation and leave and

111
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:38,480
allow ourselves to be ourselves in some deeper way than we can if we're

112
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,919
swept away in the floods of thinking

113
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:53,760
to really be present to see to know to feel ourselves

114
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,720
but let ourselves be ourselves in that process

115
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:07,279
to learn to do that in meditation we can also learn a higher quality way of doing that for

116
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:13,840
others to really be present for people

117
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,039
to care for them even

118
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:29,440
and that be in ourselves being free from needing to fix or judge or

119
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:35,919
change someone but rather to be with them with the

120
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:44,480
respect that they can be themselves maybe in such a way that they can relax

121
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,039
and be themselves more deeply than they've ever been

122
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:56,720
maybe some of the challenging ways they are is because they're not allowing themselves to be who they are

123
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,640
may it be that as we learn this meditation practice

124
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,880
that we can give others a gift of allowing them to be

125
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,080
who they are even if they don't know yet who they are

126
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:23,840
to accompany to witness to see others clearly

127
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,240
and they feel safe from us

128
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,120
may we become safe for all beings

129
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,720
may we contribute to the happiness and welfare of all beings

130
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:52,880
may what we're learning in meditation be applied

131
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,679
out into our lives the people we encounter

132
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,240
so that maybe we lighten the load or brighten the day or

133
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:11,120
reduce the suffering of those we meet may this meditation practice

134
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:18,960
serve for the welfare and happiness of all beings may all beings be happy

135
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,559
may all beings be free

136
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:39,109
[Music]

137
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:51,519
so this week i'm teaching the five r's relax recognize

138
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:58,640
today it's respect tomorrow it's be restore and then release

139
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,039
and to meditate with mindfulness of breathing to respect it

140
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:11,679
to offer our respect to our experience and i like this uh

141
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:16,960
word respect a lot because it's you know in latin that means to look again

142
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:22,640
to respect something is to give it a second look and uh so we really see what it is in

143
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:29,519
and of itself to observe it to see it and it also it's different it has a similar

144
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,200
effect as allowing something to be or accepting things to be there but it

145
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,760
has more body in it it has more accepting or allowing things to be

146
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,320
is uh sometimes is quite profound but it's also uh it's kind of like

147
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:55,679
where were we we're absent in the picture in some way which

148
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:02,159
has its advantages at times but to

149
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:09,599
have to see with respect to be present with respect there's something that we offer some kind of dignity or valuing

150
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:16,158
that we contribute and to come from a place of respect is to come from a place of a certain kind of

151
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,679
inner strength a certain kind of inner presence or something that is quite a

152
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,358
beautiful place to be to be able to give the gift of respect to something

153
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,040
and so this idea of looking again and so with the breathing to watch it to

154
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,878
see it and respect it enough to allow the breathing

155
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:44,398
to breathe itself and and it's quite something that if we can

156
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:51,919
get out of the way of the breathing but really be present for it give it breathing room in a sense

157
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:58,079
to do its own thing that generally we learn so much from the breathing

158
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,760
we learn about the big and the subtle ways in which we are contracted or anxious or

159
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:10,720
or agitated or afraid or depressed or sad all these kinds of ways

160
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:17,760
of being affect our breathing and because it affects our breathing

161
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,800
as the breathing begins to be it's allowed to be itself

162
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,480
it begins to kind of move through all these feelings and emotions and attitudes that affect breathing

163
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,800
and kind of like massages them and when we leave the br that when we watch the breathing and leave it alone

164
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,240
respecting it it's an indirect way of respecting and leaving alone

165
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:46,880
so much of our psychology and something uh and the massage of breathing is not just a

166
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,160
mechanical physical thing it uh it's intimately connected

167
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:58,079
to our deeper psychological life and if we can allow the breathing for

168
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,119
some freedom to move and relax and to settle and to open

169
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:09,359
just by watching it and giving it lots of time to do it as i've said then it massages the

170
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:15,040
psychology it helps those things also come to equilibrium or come to

171
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:19,920
to unfold in the way that's appropriate for them

172
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,880
um the gift of accompanying of watching or seeing respecting

173
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,960
is really a profound thing some years ago i met a woman who when

174
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,640
many many years ago she had been a

175
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,400
researchers she did research in psychology and in psychology and in particular the relationship between

176
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,839
mothers and their young children and for about two or three years

177
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,200
she went to the home of a mother who was raising a child i don't know if she was single but

178
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:01,280
she was always home alone and and the researcher would simply show up

179
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,880
and would not talk to the woman but simply be in the living room with her and watch as the woman interacted

180
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,000
with her child the child was you know maybe you know just a little baby initially

181
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,079
until two or three years old and she was there to take notes of what she saw the

182
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:24,480
the relationship between the two and that's what she was doing the researcher was just studying that and

183
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,640
um and um and after three years of doing that uh it was time to stop and the

184
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:38,240
researcher find you know spoke to the to the mother and explained she was leaving and the mother was deeply moved and said

185
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:44,640
that having this researcher come to her house and watch her be with her child was the

186
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:52,000
highlight of her week and even though they didn't speak simply to be watched be watched and be

187
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,720
attended to and be be treated as someone who's important enough and valuable enough to to pay

188
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,119
attention to is like a is a great gift like food for people

189
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:11,520
and and uh and so it can be for ourselves i had this similar experience with my

190
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,920
child when he was young when i don't think he really spoke yet but um

191
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,440
i was on the floor with him and he was playing with blocks and uh he was absorbed and playing with

192
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,760
his blocks and he was kind of humming along to himself clearly happy and delighted and i was just there watching

193
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,200
and after a while i got a little bored and i thought well he doesn't need me anymore he's absorbed in his blocks he

194
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:41,440
hardly knows he doesn't even know i'm here really so i started to get up and as soon as i got out i started to get up he stopped

195
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:48,480
singing or humming and i realized i saw what happened that he clearly knew i was there that my

196
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:55,920
accompanying and watching and seeing was a huge part of his happiness his safety his everything was okay in the world and

197
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:02,640
i had an important role even though i wasn't doing anything or involved in anything just being present and watching

198
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,240
so this idea of doing the same thing for ourselves and doing it through the medium of our

199
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:15,119
breathing breathing is not a mechanical thing only it's prof it's an intersection

200
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:21,040
the meeting place the crossroads of so many different parts of our uh emotional

201
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:28,640
psychological intentional social personal physiological life that we have

202
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:35,200
that um to be able to settle in and feel the breathing see it respect it

203
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:43,440
get out of its way and allow the breathing slowly to find its way uh is a is a is a profound thing to do

204
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:50,400
for our whole being what i do sometimes is uh if my breathing is constricted sometimes if i

205
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:55,920
live a you know active life doing a lot of things there's a little bit of tension builds

206
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,040
up in the upper part of my chest and then when i sit down to meditate i feel that

207
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:07,760
that constriction when i inhale i can't inhale all the way and what i've learned to do is

208
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,680
not be bothered by it in fact what's more important is

209
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:21,359
instead of being bothered what's important is to offer a gentle caring attention to it just observe it

210
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:28,160
and every time i inhale i make sure that i'm right there to feel and sense and observe

211
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:34,720
the place of constriction as if there's no problem it's allowed to be there i'm not trying to fix it or be upset by it i

212
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:40,319
just kind of like patiently as if it's forever offer my attention to that place

213
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:46,319
and at some point or other something begins to release let go

214
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:54,240
and and the kind of remarkable thing is oftentimes i don't see it letting go and relaxing it's either too slow or

215
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:00,079
maybe it happens on the exhale and i didn't notice and

216
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:06,880
but this for me is allowing the breathing to breathe itself

217
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,200
and uh and i'm calling this respect to watch it to be present for it

218
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:19,119
to observe it without interfering without judgment without

219
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:27,280
condemnation for sure but to do it with respect means that we do it as if it's important it's valuable

220
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:34,160
when we practice just allowing things to be or accepting things as they are they can come without any kind of inner

221
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:41,440
feeling that this is important this is valuable and i like to

222
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:47,440
consider that when we learn to meditate we're learning to value everything

223
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,480
nothing is not valuable even the smallest little detail

224
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:59,119
is not valuable it's one of the things i learned from my zen practice

225
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:05,599
the school of zen that i practiced in one of their slogans was that or one of the ways the characteristics of that

226
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,800
school of zen was called attention to detail and

227
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:17,599
that you respect every detail no matter how small and they'll end with a little story

228
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:23,839
of uh of um i was very inspired by this um

229
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:29,680
in the long time ago in the 1970s um i was there was a little bit informal

230
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:35,760
uh well there's a there was a gathering of the uh zen masters in the united states

231
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,920
uh and um it was kind of informal back then i think that maybe there were six of them about

232
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,119
uh that who are there at this little gathering of them there weren't that many back then and um

233
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,240
and um and they were just mostly meeting among themselves

234
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:58,319
and then it's uh but they had one evening they had a panel where ascend students could kind of see

235
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:05,839
them in the panel and and um and uh ask questions of them or something it was kind of a unique event

236
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:10,880
and there's a they were sitting behind a table and and uh someone

237
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:17,280
would brought them drinks tea or something we're bringing things you know to them

238
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:23,280
and what stood out to me was that all but one

239
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:29,520
kind of didn't react didn't respond to the fact that someone brought them some tea and put it in front of them they

240
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:36,560
just kind of like accepted it as normal there was there was no hostility no it was just kind of a

241
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:42,960
neutral thing but i remember one of them took the time to turn to the person who brought tea

242
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:48,960
and kind of bowed to them and expressed their thanks and uh i was struck by that one zen

243
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,880
master took the time to the person who was you know uh

244
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:01,280
incidental in a sense for the meeting and all that uh deserved their respect and met them and

245
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:09,760
and about to them and that inspired me so attention to detail everything is important and to respect

246
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:17,040
the breath to express express respect the in-breath the out-breath the pause

247
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:23,040
to respect the beginning of the in-breath the middle of it the end of it to be present to observe the beginning

248
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:29,680
of the exhale the middle of it and the end of it all these details are important

249
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:36,560
and as we kind of enter into this world of observing just the breathing it becomes less kind of like looking up

250
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,760
into the sky and watching the clouds go by and more like almost like a

251
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,599
the most relaxing microscope you can imagine where you're just kind of zeroing in

252
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:55,200
on just the details and just the subtlety of it and to and doing so with respect with

253
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:01,599
care with allowing things to be as they are the gift everything can be as it is

254
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:08,000
and with our respect is one of the profound things to learn through meditation practice

255
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,960
so thank you very much
