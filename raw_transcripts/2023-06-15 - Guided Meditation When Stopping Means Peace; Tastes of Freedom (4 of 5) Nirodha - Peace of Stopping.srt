1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:08,660
readings fellow practitioners good to be here with you

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:17,580
um I asked the tech team to put up in the chat that I do offer

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,800
um practice discussions and if you're interested you can contact

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,460
me about that and I also wanted to thank you for your

5
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:36,500
comments which have been very helpful so

6
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:45,800
today we will gently lean into

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:52,320
the factor of neroda which is usually

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,620
translated as cessation

9
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:10,080
when we're about to become an aura hunt near Rhoda means that we have completely

10
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,960
stopped read hate and delusion

11
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,860
but as I've been trying to uh demonstrate this week it's really

12
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,979
possible to even to take on these uh very

13
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:35,659
Advanced uh practices as beginners

14
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,520
because there's a whole um spectrum of

15
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,540
ways in which we can do it

16
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:57,600
um so yesterday we explored

17
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,119
gently letting unwholesome tendencies

18
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,420
fade away that was firaga

19
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:18,120
and then Tuesday we explored protecting our minds

20
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:26,420
by a cozy seclusion from distractions while meditating

21
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,079
so today we'll experiment with stopping

22
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:43,019
I think it's important to remember that we're not glued

23
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:50,000
to our unwholesome horses

24
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,040
and it's really good to know that

25
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,879
as long as I'm mindful I'm gonna be okay

26
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:13,920
because then we can you know present with full awareness in the moment and we

27
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,159
see when something unwholesome starts to arise

28
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,000
and we could say no it's done enough

29
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,920
so the um work for the meditation this morning

30
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:41,580
is not work it should be more like tasting

31
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:48,180
um we'll try to savor those moments whether they're just very

32
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,760
brief glimpses or they last for a few seconds

33
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:04,739
or maybe it should really Advanced a few minutes when the mind is quiet and undispracted

34
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:11,640
steady and we're just here with our lived experience

35
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:20,100
In This Moment so with that as a as an introduction

36
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:28,560
the invitation is to assume you're meditation posture

37
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:38,220
and since we're on the theme of stopping today uh

38
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:44,040
I'm going to make a suggestion but you don't at all have to follow it

39
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:50,280
but if you'd like to it can be difficult for some people but

40
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,919
see if you can get through this whole half hour of meditation

41
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:03,780
without moving once you've decided on the posture that you want to meditate in

42
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:11,540
so it's fine now to take a few moments to know see which way is up

43
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:18,720
and see which way is down and in the way that's down get in touch

44
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:25,879
with the center of the Earth which is holding on to us really nicely

45
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:45,560
and then as the meditation evolves will do our best

46
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,720
to let go of thinking

47
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,600
stopping thinking and when we managed to do that for just

48
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,820
an instant we can celebrate it's fine if you feel

49
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:08,960
joyful if you have a moment of peace

50
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,820
so closing the eyes and

51
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,979
visualizing your posture

52
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:31,500
so that the main centers of the body are in good

53
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:39,000
alignment lahara or otherwise known as The Dan Tien the

54
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,639
belly as the foundational Center

55
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:54,020
and then the heart chakra resting

56
00:06:54,419 --> 00:07:00,840
vertically above that and in balance

57
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:07,580
with the belly and the Heart Center the head Center

58
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:18,740
I take a long deep inhale followed by a long

59
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:26,479
peaceful exhale noticing the transition spaces

60
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:57,780
and again with it's always nice

61
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:07,460
for me anyway in my meditations I like to begin with at least a brief minute of meta meditation

62
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:17,220
to sort of create an atmosphere which has the flavor of kindness

63
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:24,360
because I know how important it is to be kind to myself to not be judgmental

64
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:30,060
like thinking I'm not a good meditator or even worse that I don't even have the

65
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:36,860
right to attempt anything like Awakening

66
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,440
so give yourself a moment to

67
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:52,160
see if you can be aware of the whole body altogether breathing

68
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:58,680
and at the same time shower

69
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:05,459
this precious body and mind which is all we've got right now

70
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:11,420
with love and kindness and acceptance

71
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:19,880
we don't have to be any different than Who We Are to be on this path

72
00:09:52,680 --> 00:10:01,380
May the heart be open and may we have the wisdom

73
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:07,940
we greet each moment with friendliness

74
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,680
not needing to turn away from anything

75
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:23,940
or judge anything [Music] knowing that it really is okay to be Who

76
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:31,760
We Are with all our foibles

77
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,360
because we're human

78
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,779
so with our best friend subtle

79
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:13,880
mindfulness awareness as our protector

80
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:22,820
we make sure the sheet is right in front of us

81
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,540
meaning that she is our highest priority

82
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,579
I kind of like that in Bali satya's feminine

83
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:45,300
she's a great Ally so do your very very best for the rest

84
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:51,779
of this meditation period to keep her

85
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:57,200
established within you

86
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,540
mindfulness of the body

87
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:16,100
this body

88
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:26,000
mindful of breathing

89
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:39,360
connecting with the whole cycle

90
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,380
of the breath

91
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:11,300
mindful of vedana

92
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:21,180
the feeling tone of our present moment experience

93
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:28,019
whether it's pleasant experience or an unpleasant

94
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:32,480
or we're not sure which it is

95
00:13:53,040 --> 00:14:01,339
and when we've connected the feeling tone of our lived experience

96
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:09,480
we invite Raza which is the Bali and Sanskrit word for

97
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:16,459
taste we taste those feeling tones

98
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,040
we taste our lived experience

99
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,779
and with our awareness of tasting

100
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:43,339
we have some insight into our state of mind

101
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:49,260
now we invite Sati

102
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,720
are awareness

103
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,740
to be aware of our mind state

104
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:08,399
both the mind In This Moment just knowing it

105
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:15,959
we don't have to change it or fix it but it is very helpful

106
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:19,279
to be aware of it

107
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,800
mindfulness of the Mind

108
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:49,640
and now that we have put in place the first three of the City by diamonds

109
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,780
awareness of the body

110
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,720
awareness of feelings

111
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,299
awareness of Mind state

112
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:14,160
we can now invite our awareness

113
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,120
to include gammas

114
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:25,980
and it's that was our like mental

115
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:33,679
objects for example the five hindrances

116
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:42,720
if that's meaningful for you you like do a little checklist

117
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:52,160
see if any of those are present or the seven factors of Awakening

118
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,280
Etc

119
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:13,860
one way of evoking 30 patana of

120
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:19,980
mind objects that we could do this week

121
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:25,320
is to consider

122
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:32,940
invector seclusion from distractions

123
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,899
what's that going

124
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:52,620
we could investigate the Mind object of viraga

125
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,140
dispassion fading away

126
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:07,020
how are we doing with iraga letting unwholesome qualities just

127
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,039
fade away

128
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:28,140
and then Mirada cessation

129
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:36,480
stopping our tendencies

130
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:43,820
who want to be anywhere else except In This Moment

131
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:57,440
keep practicing like this

132
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:22,580
and if these instructions sound like Greek to you

133
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:33,620
don't bother with them just do your practice the way you usually do it that's fine

134
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:38,659
and if the Mind should have jumped onto a train or a pleasure boat or a

135
00:23:38,659 --> 00:23:43,320
unpleasant Adventure

136
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:51,600
this is the time to say time out

137
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:59,779
just take a pause from those distracting thoughts

138
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:24,380
the Beauty and the fullness of the breath

139
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:32,120
the gratitude for being alive that's plenty

140
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:20,720
and in the last few minutes of this meditation

141
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:25,700
let's take our

142
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:36,840
State of Mind our loving heart any kind of Peace we may have

143
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:42,600
garnered from not indulging

144
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:48,419
thoughts and offering

145
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:53,720
that Peace by radiating it out

146
00:27:53,940 --> 00:28:00,720
so just imagine yourself as a candle

147
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,260
and you're able to radiate in all directions

148
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:13,140
in front the right to the back

149
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:19,399
to the left above and below

150
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:33,259
the sphere of peacefulness Rippling outwards from your heart

151
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,600
into the universe

152
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:35,000
now at the end of our practice

153
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,539
let's share the benefits

154
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:49,340
of this beautiful path with all beings everywhere

155
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:57,440
may all beings be safe from harm

156
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:11,659
may all beings be easy and contented

157
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:18,460
may all beings be peaceful

158
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:25,020
[Music] and may all beings everywhere

159
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,860
be free

160
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:34,569
[Music]

161
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:47,380
[Music]

162
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,460

171
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,480
correcting something that I said yesterday in the Q a

172
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:28,080
in response to a beautiful question about

173
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,600
how does one recover from trauma

174
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:40,559
and I I spoke about my own experience from the trauma of being

175
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:47,580
physically and psychologically violently abused

176
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:53,480
when I was a child and

177
00:32:54,299 --> 00:33:01,559
the the path that I went on included lots and lots of psychotherapy

178
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:10,080
and help including uh analyzing my dreams and

179
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,600
uh a lot of professional help

180
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,840
and then there was a lot of support

181
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:30,120
especially from Suzuki roshi and the community of practitioners that

182
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:37,399
is in Monastery in tasahara where I

183
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:42,960
cried every singles Us in period I didn't make any noise but the tears were

184
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,260
just streaming and this was a kind of you know a purification that I had to go through

185
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:55,320
and everyone was very sweet and accommodating and compassionate towards

186
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:59,299
me that was really of

187
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:08,580
and so and then also in my case since it was having to do with my parents

188
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:13,858
um forgiveness became a big deal in letting

189
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:19,740
go of trauma so

190
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:26,339
um I think when I identified as a trauma victim I was

191
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:32,598
um still bitter

192
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:39,319
and when I moved to being a a trauma Survivor

193
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:45,898
um through the practice of forgiveness and understanding that the sort of ancestral

194
00:34:45,899 --> 00:34:54,118
dimension of what we inherit uh I was able to deeply forgive my

195
00:34:54,119 --> 00:35:01,320
parents knowing that they did the best they could and

196
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:09,839
and then um in a practice discussion one skill helped me by suggesting that I just drop

197
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:16,579
any identification with PTSD with being a survivor

198
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:21,839
that it was not necessary for my identity

199
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:29,780
that was really um helpful at that point in my breakfast

200
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:39,540
uh and then um I mentioned that not all trauma comes

201
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:45,660
from family history as it was in my case but I have a dear beloved Dharma buddy

202
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:54,060
named Francisco who has become a marvelous teacher who has shared a lot with me about

203
00:35:54,060 --> 00:36:01,740
the drama that he went through in a devastating car accident where he was just smashed to smithereens

204
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:08,099
and um and in the Q a I kind of tried to guess

205
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:15,119
what his process might have been like but I regret having said that because he

206
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,640
didn't I didn't hear it from his own lips so um

207
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:27,359
I'd rather let him tell you if if you're interested then you know

208
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:35,359
inventing what I think he might have been through so forgive me for that

209
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:42,660
and then by request in the chat yesterday for the list of the Bali words

210
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:49,339
for you know what we're exploring this week um

211
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:58,260
I'll I'll talk about that today and I need to give you a disclaimer that

212
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:04,740
this is not a canonical list from the early Buddhist texts it's one I put

213
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:10,280
together for the purpose of teaching this week

214
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:17,640
and in addition I add some of my own efforts at translating the terms

215
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:23,460
into English so

216
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:28,619
Monday was Raza and

217
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:33,900
Raza in uh both poly and

218
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:40,820
Sanskrit the root means doesn't mean taste so it literally means to taste

219
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:46,380
and then more figuratively it's the flavor of our experience or the Savor

220
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:54,000
and then a really interesting sort of development in where we can go with

221
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:01,440
tasting is the second meaning of Raza which is essence you know like in perfumes it's

222
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,279
sometimes the essence of such and such uh

223
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:14,099
but it that essence also means essential function

224
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:21,180
so in a way we're um we're tasting our essential function as

225
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:26,700
humans our experience our ability to be sentient beings

226
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:32,280
how does that taste so that was Monday

227
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:40,759
and Tuesday was viveka uh which literally means separated

228
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:50,880
um it's usually translated as seclusion but I think a preferable translation would

229
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,099
be Independence it also can means solitude

230
00:38:56,099 --> 00:39:01,140
detachment disengagement

231
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:06,660
and interestingly another meaning in Ali

232
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:14,040
goes farther than that and takes the vecca to also mean

233
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:21,500
discrimination understanding true knowledge

234
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:31,740
so the Sanskrit root is very interesting also the the poly root literally means

235
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:37,500
um uh separated but the Sanskrit means to

236
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:44,280
sift sort of like we're we're sifting um grain or something

237
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:50,339
um so the idea is having a clear sense of separation

238
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:56,820
from the unwholesome and according to the commentaries it

239
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:03,720
often applies seclusion from the hindrances so a lot of times you may you may see

240
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:10,740
you know once you know once um a monastic was secluded from the

241
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:17,180
hindrances at that point they could go deeper in meditation

242
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:25,020
um but I've taken the liberty of broadening that idea of seclusion to in

243
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:32,300
the context of our meditation to seclusion from distractions

244
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:38,820
how do we you know just the the it's it's really very powerful

245
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:45,780
to be able to leave our distractions on the shoe rack outside the door

246
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:51,440
and to stay present

247
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:58,859
and then yesterday we evoked viraga

248
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:04,579
which and probably literally means Away From Desire

249
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:12,960
um The Fading of Desire or something or dispassion towards something or

250
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,839
detachment or indifference

251
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:25,200
um but the word Raga in Pali also means

252
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:33,000
color phew or a dialogue for dying cloth

253
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:40,400
and it might evoke the image of a a blood stain

254
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,500
on a pure white cloth

255
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:50,700
that Fades Away by washing it and hanging it up

256
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:56,640
in the sunlight so we can take the the stain to be a

257
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:03,359
metaphor for the impurities of our mind and the white cloth

258
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:09,119
to be a metaphor for the Purity the innate purity

259
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:16,980
of our mind which we all have but which we may not be experts at

260
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:22,140
accessing it's the treasure inside of us that all

261
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:29,839
this work of meditation and mindfulness practice aims to reveal

262
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,619
so it's it's a beautiful image I think especially since the varaga fading away

263
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:43,140
uh happens naturally you know wash it and let it dry in the

264
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:50,060
Sun healing through sunlight

265
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:53,240
um

266
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:02,339
so in Pali it also goes farther than uh dispassion to also mean

267
00:43:02,339 --> 00:43:09,180
um uh leaving aside infatuation or lust or

268
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:16,920
passion uh like like I said there's there's often a whole spectrum of meanings for

269
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:21,960
these uh dhammas these poly um

270
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,160
mind objects

271
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:33,960
um and then today and I see that the clock is ticking

272
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:40,319
um the theme is niroda which literally means without

273
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:47,780
obstruction and it's usually translated as cessation

274
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:54,900
uh the ending or termination finishing off

275
00:43:54,900 --> 00:44:02,819
ah and both the poly and the Sanskrit roots are the same it comes from root

276
00:44:02,819 --> 00:44:08,400
uh meaning obstruction so um

277
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:18,060
the commentary says it also means release from imprisonment uh or confinement being locked up

278
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:24,599
and in the Chinese agamas translating the polytexts into Chinese

279
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:31,740
the character given to represent uh niroda is stop and see the two

280
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:39,300
characters stop and see together um so that's the value of stopping if we

281
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:45,420
can stop long enough we can see what our

282
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:53,220
foils we can see what our Temptations are and with that

283
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:59,099
we have the freedom to make a choice whether we want to go that way

284
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:04,579
or maybe we want to just be peaceful

285
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:14,760
so um yeah we stopped long enough

286
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:21,420
to be able to see what's happening with the clarity of an open

287
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:26,300
quiet and steady mind

288
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:40,578
so tomorrow we will look at vasaga meaning relinquishment

289
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:50,339
and the homework for today if you're so inclined

290
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:56,099
is to stop from time to time to observe the mind

291
00:45:56,099 --> 00:46:03,839
and to see if there are any obstructions you need to remove from your path of practice

292
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:11,300
so that you can continue on your wholesome journey to end suffering

293
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:20,940
thank you and a last announcement is that I learned

294
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:27,180
um just today that A revolution is happening in the terravada forest

295
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:32,819
tradition um used to be called the Thai Forest tradition

296
00:46:32,819 --> 00:46:38,700
but now there's a kind of official uh

297
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:46,740
new um breakthrough which uh is the I remember when I when I

298
00:46:46,740 --> 00:46:53,460
first moved back to um California after living 40 years in

299
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:59,579
France uh it was a full moon night and the first thing I did was drive up to buy a Gary

300
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:06,780
to meditate with the monks all night long in the Moonlight and at one point I

301
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:14,540
the next day I had an opportunity to ask John Posner a question and I asked him

302
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:21,780
what's the problem with bikuni or ordination why why don't you you monks

303
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:28,020
here support that I was kind of an indelicate on my part which that's kind

304
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:33,359
of who I am you know stepping in the bottles

305
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:39,839
um but he he he really got it and he really replied beautifully saying that

306
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:45,660
you know the the hierarchy of the lineage in Thailand

307
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:51,000
is old guys and they're unlikely to

308
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:57,480
change and so it will require you know gradually they'll die and they'll be

309
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:04,079
replaced by more moderate um officials in the in the Thai Forest

310
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:12,540
tradition uh so what's happening is that uh Audrey

311
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:18,780
and pasino has um sort of been able to put in motion

312
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:24,780
um this revolution as specifically what that means is that there's going to be a

313
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:33,660
monastery in the Seattle area um gathering around uh John's nisabo and

314
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:40,859
corvilo and yes including bikunis

315
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:47,040
and on the body santusika and chitananda so I'm just I'm getting Goosebumps

316
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:52,980
telling you about it there's I have so much more data and uh in the chat There's the link so

317
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:59,099
excuse me for going over time and if you're interested in joining

318
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:05,040
the Q a and you're uh watching from YouTube you're welcome to transition

319
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:10,640
over to the zoom thank you so much

320
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:18,900
okay thank you Mega so if anyone has any questions or comments you can either put

321
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:23,960
them in chat or you can raise your hand uh and zoom

322
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:31,980
and while we're kind of waiting for people to collect their thoughts

323
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:38,160
um there was a question on YouTube yesterday um

324
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:43,619
and it asked the person asked uh if you could touch on how to be in a

325
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:51,240
contemplative mind skillfully without leaning into a ruminating inclination

326
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:57,078
so I don't know if you want to touch on that Meg

327
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:02,880
um I I tried to touch on that at the end of our discussion yesterday in the Q a

328
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:07,920

Virginia and uh I'm I'm so happy about

335
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:07,619
what you just said um so I just want to thank you for sharing that um and bringing in all that

336
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:13,859
other stuff I guess I don't know what to call it um but uh

337
00:51:13,859 --> 00:51:20,040
yeah um uh my other comment was just to sort of

338
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:29,760
say like I I did really appreciate your sharing about how we transform our suffering and how

339
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,859
much like that you know I just kind of had an Insight yesterday when you were

340
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:41,780
talking about um how how like

341
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,180
um I guess the compassion for your parents comes in and how how like I have

342
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:54,119
a similar experience um that you know and I've never understood it

343
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:59,520
before like I used to feel so much pain but now when I sort of think about that

344
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:07,099
suffering like I'm overwhelmed by like compassion for the people who hurt me

345
00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:14,819
and stuff yeah and it's yeah like I've never understood it I've I've like like I'll be trying to

346
00:52:14,819 --> 00:52:20,000
explain it to people and I'm like I don't know what's happening to me now

347
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:26,220
um thank you so much for sharing that Marilyn I'm crying I actually was on a

348
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:33,059
retreat with Gil in May at IRC my first uh residential retreat in three and a half

349
00:52:33,059 --> 00:52:38,880
years and boy was oh wonderful to have that

350
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:45,000
seclusion and um and that sort of came to my mind

351
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:52,319
because it at one point Gill asked us to he was doing a a guided meditation and

352
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:58,020
he asked us to go into the place

353
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:04,500
in our body where we identify as the self where we reside

354
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:09,960
and for me it was just right away the heart center and I started crying

355
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,318
and

356
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:22,440
it's amazing because etasahara I was you know when I was 21.

357
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:30,240
I was crying out of pain just raw pain and that's a purification process that I

358
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:36,900
had to go through and this time at IRC

359
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:43,140
I was crying with compassion for my four parents who must have had an

360
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:52,020
even more difficult childhood than I did and so that transition from raw pain to

361
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:57,480
compassion I know exactly what you're talking about because I just went through it myself

362
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:04,740
it's it's really amazing when it happens and I think you know that's also part of

363
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:10,500
the purification process it's kind of like growing up into

364
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:14,480
compassion from being angry

365
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:25,559
yeah okay well that again just um I'm so moved and I will be I mean

366
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:32,040
just be metabolizing this week so thank you again sure thank you for sharing

367
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:37,280
yeah uh

368
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:54,359
I guess we can also take this opportunity to thank our uh wonderful kind of like editor team that we've got

369
00:54:54,359 --> 00:55:00,720
uh they've kind of been stepping in this week um uh there's uh Dimitra

370
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:06,540
job Julie and uh Kevin H um they've been helping out this week

371
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:15,300
like Julie's been helping to post some of the announcements in in chat chats and everyone else has been kind of

372
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:20,579
pitching in to help out with the audio editing for our guest teachers and then

373

374
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:33,540
you're you're not just amateurs you're you're you know you're pretty Savvy about all this stuff and I'm very

375
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:39,839
grateful to you for what you've taught me about teaching on Zoom so thank you

376
00:55:39,839 --> 00:55:42,859
thank you

377
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:08,579
while we're waiting for to see if anyone has a house has any other comments um it's kind of I don't know if this

378
00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:14,160
will help anybody but I actually like now that you kind of mentioned Francisco actually had the chance to talk to him

379
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:19,859
once when when we were doing a zoom um live stream and we were talking about

380
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:25,500
back pain um and uh he was saying that I asked him well how did you get over yours it

381
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:31,740
sounds like a hundred times worse than what I go through and just kind of simply said oh I just meditated so that

382
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:37,440
was really cool to hear sure it sounds simple yeah that that's sort of what I read

383
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:43,740
into you know um so it but like what I guess yesterday was probably accurate but still I I

384
00:56:43,740 --> 00:56:49,440
didn't want to just leave it at that yeah yeah he just went deep deep deep

385
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:55,920
into his meditation like you know like I think that's pretty safe to say

386
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:02,220
okay hey Bill you uh you got the floor thank you

387
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:08,760
um once once in my entire Buddhist career

388
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:15,000
um my mind got so still burn extended period of time what six

389
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,900
and a half hours that my back pain completely disappeared not a trace of it some yeah only once

390
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:29,160
but now I know what's possible at least uh but what I really raised my hand to say is um hearing hearing people talk

391
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:34,280
about um they're um imperfect upbringings and their

392
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:40,800
imperfect parents it's such a common story yeah uh

393
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:46,800
certainly you know true for me you know so I had a little bit too overcome

394
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:55,440
um like 20 years of depression um very common I hear it from other people

395
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:04,680
all the time not all the time but but often enough um and um my reaction to that is just to

396
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:10,020
look around me as I go through the world and um if I

397
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:15,780
see people unhappy realize what a common thing this is and and um

398
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:22,680
just kind of feel compassion for it makes it easier understanding this makes it easier for me to feel

399
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:28,040
compassion for other people who may be acting up

400
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:33,240
um are are not doing well in one way or another

401
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:38,940
and for their parents and their parents and then you know so

402
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:44,119
the whole society it's in in a way

403
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:52,140
um being happy and and relating well to other people

404
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:58,700
it seems so simple yeah just let go demand just let go

405
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:04,260
uh I've been in practice that does seem to be hard doesn't it so anyway I just

406
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:10,559
wanted to mention this way of relating to the world a little bit better because of

407
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:16,559
understanding of what people have gone through thank you so much for sharing that

408
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:22,140
deerville uh and I remember you know I I started

409
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:28,859
practicing with a wonderful zen master at the age of 21. well I'm 76. uh that

410
00:59:28,859 --> 00:59:37,619
looks like 55 years of practice but uh you know I'm I'm just kind of you

411
00:59:37,619 --> 00:59:43,079
know starting out in a way um

412
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:48,540
and it's true and and you know I can remember over the years thinking you

413
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:54,720
know if almost every Retreat I would go on I would be so frustrated with myself because I know that I

414
00:59:54,720 --> 01:00:01,200
don't want to go down the you know the river on that uh pleasure boat of

415
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:06,480
thinking or planning or whatever and

416
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:13,619
and yet uh it keeps coming back and I just I just think Meg you know

417
01:00:13,619 --> 01:00:19,220
anyway uh for some of us it takes a really long time

418
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:25,460
well I've only been doing this 21 22 years so that's

419
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:34,559
uh 48 or nine um really late starts so um so there's

420
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:40,020
this so there's hope for me huh the Buddha you know he said there was

421
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:46,380
vote for everybody I mean he he gave uh unguly Mala or the nation you know so

422
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:53,160
yeah yes we was for those of you who are not familiar he was the this mass murderer

423
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:59,819
at the time of the Buddha who wore a necklace of uh not 199 fingers because

424
01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:05,520
he his goal which was imposed upon him by his own spiritual teacher was to kill

425
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:10,799
a thousand people in order to become enlightened and he only had one person to go and it

426
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:16,980
was going to be the Buddha anyway and instead of him being able to kill the Buddha the way he was able to

427
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:22,500
overpower everybody else whoever came across

428
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:29,640
um it would have got the best of him and then showered him with compassion and

429
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:37,559
ordained him as his own disciple if anguli Mala can do it so and he did

430
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:43,319
become an our hunt in his lifetime so we finally Molly can do it being that evil

431
01:01:43,319 --> 01:01:52,220
uh we haven't killed 999 people so there's a there's hope for all of us

432
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:59,359
thank you Leila you got your Andrews

433
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:07,859
hi I um I'm curious about because in the vadenas

434
01:02:07,859 --> 01:02:13,079
I find neutral to be such a powerful

435
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:18,480
State and I just wonder is there is it similar to no Road high it's like

436
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:28,819
a secession I'm just curious but I and I think it's under supported or under rated neutral

437
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:38,540
and what's the rest of your mind like when you're in a neutral feeling tone

438
01:02:41,339 --> 01:02:49,260
well the whole state feels like ah you know like a kind of relief in this

439
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:56,240
it reminds me of tignat Han's celebration of I don't have it too fake

440
01:02:57,299 --> 01:03:03,119
nice but it's just it seems like I don't know I celebrate neutral and I I

441
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:09,000
think that's a great uh contribution to our discussion because

442
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:15,960
um you I I may be wrong um but I don't remember reading anything

443
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:22,799
like this in the canonical texts that neutral vedana

444
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:29,700
uh was a was a good thing it's usually in the commentarial tradition it's usually

445
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:38,099
strongly associated with delusion and uh it's but I think that you're

446
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:44,220
absolutely right if if in your case you know it feels like a relief and you're

447
01:03:44,220 --> 01:03:49,859
not just um escaping from

448
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:56,819
uh going after pleasure or going away from pain

449
01:03:56,819 --> 01:04:03,200
uh and you just don't know which one

450
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:12,960
I think that's um a very positive way an instructive way

451
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:18,260
that you've found yourself to

452
01:04:18,260 --> 01:04:25,920
appreciate when you have neither pleasure nor pain and um

453
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:32,640
congratulations that's like becoming your own teacher you know well and I know because I I work with

454
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:39,440
trauma with myself and with people and the trauma is really big and sometimes

455
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:48,000
resourcing to access anything that might feel like pleasure just feels unaccessible but to move from

456
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:56,279
yeah an overwhelmed trauma state to neutral is a doable movement yeah

457
01:04:56,339 --> 01:05:03,540
that actually offers something other than yeah the vortex it's a door opener

458
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:09,359
for you and it's a valid door opener for you and so this is something that we we

459
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:15,000
need to take from uh the Buddha's example also

460
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:22,920
is that it wasn't one teaching for everybody it was a different teaching for each

461
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:29,040
disciple and for each situation with that disciple and

462
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:35,280
um and in fact at some point

463
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:41,220
it's really up to each of us to have the the wisdom the discernment

464
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:49,020
to be able to wisely know that this is a good thing this is this is wholesome and that's

465
01:05:49,020 --> 01:05:56,099
kind of what we were talking about um yesterday with uh viraga

466
01:05:56,099 --> 01:06:02,160
you know letting are on wholesome Tendencies just kind of quietly fade

467
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:08,280
away and you know it sounds like you're uh

468
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:14,579
feeling tones of um desire and aversion just sort of faded

469
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:20,160
away and you were left with a nice Open Door

470
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:26,700
it's almost a gateway to Equanimity exactly exactly

471
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:32,700
perfect well thank you thank you for asking that thank you for

472
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:36,440
bringing that to the discussion

473
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:59,640
okay I think we don't have anyone uh we don't have anything any other comments or questions in chat or uh

474
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:05,099
um so thank you for teaching today Meg and

475
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:11,039
