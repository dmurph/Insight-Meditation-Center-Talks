1
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,859
so warm greetings and welcome to

2
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:24,439
this meditation session and as an introduction to the meditation

3
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,660
that the theme for this week is equanimity particularly particularly the

4
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,960
kind of love that has a quality of equanimity in it

5
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,120
in talking about Equanimity uh one of the things that we can lose

6
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,340
Equanimity around is if we're operating too much from

7
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:54,660
conceit too much from holding on to some fixed idea of who we are who we should be or

8
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,760
what who we shouldn't be there's something about that um

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:07,860
hardness or that grasping to that those conceit that makes us easily agitated

10
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:14,340
easily Restless easily reactive to what's going on and that one of the movements in

11
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,460
Buddhist Meditation is uh

12
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,540
so warm greetings and welcome to

13
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:53,160
so warm greetings and welcome to this meditation session

14
00:09:53,160 --> 00:10:00,180
and as an introduction to the meditation mentioned that the theme for this week

15
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:05,339
is equanimity particularly particularly the kind of love

16
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:12,899
that has a quality of equanimity in it and in talking about Equanimity uh

17
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:20,339
one of the things that we can lose Equanimity around is if we're operating too much from

18
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:27,720
conceit too much from holding on to some fixed idea of who we are who we should be or

19
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:35,459
what who we shouldn't be there's something about that um hardness or that grasping to that

20
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:43,260
those conceit that makes us easily agitated easily Restless easily reactive

21
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,980
to what's going on and that one of the movements in Buddhist Meditation

22
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:55,140
is called lowering the flag of conceit

23
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:01,680
and this ancient metaphor of uh likening conceit with the flag that's

24
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,720
held up high I believe it's a little bit of a war metaphor

25
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:12,779
that maybe it's like Capture the Flag if one person is holding the flag

26
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:18,480
then the other team will be really trying to get that person or you know

27
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,300
get to that person but if they if they put the flag down then they

28
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:31,140
don't care so much about that person so if you're holding up the war Banner for your army then the other Army is

29
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:36,320
going to go after you perhaps it may be a less uh

30
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:43,800
war-like metaphor is that of an open window that if you throw the baseball through

31
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:50,519
a closed window the window will break but if the window's open the ball just goes right through

32
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:57,839
and um so to lower the flag to not have something

33
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,600
that can be attacked within to not have something that is struck by the words

34
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,480
and actions that people have towards us to have like an open window and things

35
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:17,160
just go right through they don't land anywhere or strike anything within and in particular what that is is the

36
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:23,880
the absence of conceit the absence of self-preoccupation and self-definition

37
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:29,279
and um there's a lot more Equanimity then and things will just go right by

38
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,680
kind of like yesterday's metaphor of um the boat and just um you know the

39
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:41,880
water just washes off the hull of the boat and it's kind of kind of left behind

40
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:49,260
so to sit and meditate without conceit to sit and meditate without

41
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:56,399
with the with the windows wide open where nothing has any nothing can land

42
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,459
anywhere nothing it doesn't strike anywhere with a thought a feeling all kinds of

43
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:07,740
things might arise but it just let it arise and go let it

44
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:13,079
wash right by imagine yourself just an open window

45
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:18,180
with vast fast space in front and vast space

46
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:23,700
behind and things just passed right through and

47
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:30,600
and then the mind the heart can be at ease can be equanimous by with what arises

48
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:37,700
and passes so to take a meditation posture

49
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:45,000
and a posture that hopefully will allow you to

50
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:52,740
feel recognize some part of you is alert some part of

51
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:58,760
you is has a certain energy of presence engagement

52
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,839
in some way it kind of means be careful you're not too comfortable

53
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,660
but also be careful you're not too uncomfortable

54
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:29,880
I think kind of an idea would be that a happy middle way where we're no longer concerned with any

55
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:35,579
discomfort and no longer involved with any comfort

56
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:44,600
we're just here unconcerned with Comfort or discomfort

57
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,759
but alert present

58
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:59,720
and to gently close your eyes

59
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:10,160
and taking a deep breath gently settling your heart

60
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:17,459
as you exhale settling the upward activated energy

61
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:23,779
that if you have that in your body in your heart

62
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:32,720
so that the your sense of energy in the body your sense of activation in your body

63
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:40,320
settles down and it allows you to kind of

64
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:49,459
your whole system to come to rest on the foundation of your lower torso

65
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:55,699
feeling the lower torso if you're sitting if you're sitting

66
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:03,120
if you're lying down feel your rib cage not your your back grip gauge and your spine if you're on

67
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,540
your back place that receives the weight of your

68
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,779
body

69
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,279
as you exhale let go into that

70
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,720
relax into that

71
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:56,180
taking a few long slow deep breaths

72
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:04,160
and then to soften the shoulders the belly

73
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:11,360
Release Yourself to the pull of gravity

74
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,360
while sitting upright

75
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,480
letting your breathing return to normal

76
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,799
and on the exhale continue the process of relaxing

77
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,440
both the surface of the muscle surface of your body

78
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:57,059
and also deep inside as deep as you can feel or

79
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:02,480
sense where there's holding or activation

80
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:17,480
and if you feel some tension activation that doesn't relax that's okay soften around it

81
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:37,340
soften the muscles of your face

82
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:49,559
and soften your eyes

83
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:55,140
maybe letting the eyes in a sense Look Backwards and down if

84
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:01,380
that is more restful no need to be looking

85
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,919
at anything

86
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,860
and notice any tension or activation pressure

87
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:23,220
in the area of your brain forehead temples

88
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,740
sides of your skull inside your skull

89
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:34,880
and for a few breaths breathe with that activation that tension

90
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,240
and then see if you can relax the brain

91
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,240
that whole area the thinking muscle

92
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:06,260
giving your brain your thinking at rest

93
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:12,559
from trying and doing making something happen

94
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,200
always thinking so much

95
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,980
and then and then really now becoming aware again

96
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:38,660
of the body breathing

97
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:58,880
in a sense having your awareness join the rhythm of breathing

98
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:41,779
breathing in and breathing out

99
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:52,340
imagine that as you breathe all the rest of you is like a big window

100
00:21:52,919 --> 00:22:00,659
that opens as you breathe an open window

101
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:06,019
through which the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out flows

102
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:05,539
and with the help of your breathing

103
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:15,600
maybe as if breathing is the window with well lubricated hinges that just opens

104
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:23,639
easily stays open whatever arises

105
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:29,220
instead of it hitting anything or being a concern

106
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:35,120
or something to react to or be involved in

107
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:41,960
imagine that it just travels through the open window of your being

108
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:48,600
with vast space in front of you

109
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:57,919
fast space behind you fast space above you and Below you

110
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,480
and you an open window

111
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:13,340
things just pass through no need to be involved or react

112
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:21,120
judge compare no need to relate it to conceit or sell

113
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:27,960
for Me Myself and mine whatever occurs

114
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:34,679
does not need to be taken personally it's just something that passes through

115
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:42,019
the vast window open window of awareness

116
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:11,000
if you find yourself caught in some concern or preoccupation

117
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:18,440
see if you're going to open your window really wide

118
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:26,240
create a wide open vast space of awareness

119
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:37,580
it just allows whatever is happening I continue to just pass by Flow by

120
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:44,480
without touching anything without disturbing anything

121
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:53,520
without it hitting anything within you it's just phenomena that appears and

122
00:32:53,520 --> 00:33:01,380
comes and goes it doesn't touch anything

123
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:08,480
that makes it personal no definition no involvement

124
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:16,019
and your your job is keep the window open fast open

125
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:22,340
awareness through which phenomena travel

126
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,760
thank you

127
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,880
and with a vast open awareness the open window

128
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:49,020
keeping the window keeping your awareness open is a vast space that things can just

129
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:56,339
travel through open that window widely wider

130
00:37:56,339 --> 00:38:00,500
to include the people in your life

131
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:08,660
and see if you can just keep the window open

132
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:16,880
so there's love and care and friendliness but without

133
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:23,520
the stories the ideas the responsibilities of with those people

134
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,859
Landing anywhere just let it pass through the vast field

135
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:32,480
of awareness and love

136
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:40,280
and opening more widely to include the people of your communities

137
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:48,559
of your lands of your continent

138
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:56,579
and the world and what is the quality of your good

139
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:01,800
will love care compassion

140
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:08,640
if you settle back and allow the love the care

141
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:16,320
to be like a vast open window with no going forward no going back no

142
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:24,320
closing down just a field of care

143
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:32,180
nothing to do nothing to be

144
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:38,700
nothing in the field do you need to use to define yourself or

145
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:44,060
prove yourself defend yourself

146
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:52,940
just fast peaceful equanimous Goodwill

147
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:03,780
perhaps a way of being that you'd wish on others

148
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:09,660
May others also feel safe enough open enough

149
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:15,900
wise enough to rest in their capacity

150
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:24,260
for vast love Goodwill compassion and care

151
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:32,880
may they be happy enough and safe enough to rest in this vast field of love

152
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,400
without needing to prove themselves defend themselves

153
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:45,859
assert themselves May the people I know

154
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:52,400
experience this wonderful happy way of being

155
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:03,060
and wishing it for others remembering

156
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:10,200
to wish it for yourself give yourself the gift

157
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:18,560
a vast open window of care and love Goodwill

158
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:25,200
that doesn't automatically need to do anything or prove anything defend anything

159
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:30,380
be anything just an open window

160
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:41,339
it may it be that we learn how to abide this way

161
00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:45,500
so we can share it with others

162
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:52,520
so we can meet each other together in this space

163
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:08,220
so that way when we wish people happiness and safety health and freedom

164
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:15,740
we kind of have a deep reference point for how full and complete that can be

165
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:26,540
from our open window of Good Will to whatever degree we have it

166
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:35,960
to express to evoke the wish

167
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:40,460
may all beings be happy

168
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:48,079
may all beings be safe and healthy

169
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:58,279
may all beings be free of suffering

170
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:06,660
may all beings live together

171
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:12,540
sharing this wonderful capacity we have

172
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:20,520
for open liberated love so open is the window

173
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:24,619
the frames of the window disappear

174
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,170
[Music]

175
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:54,060
so the topic on this fourth talk on Equanimity Brahma vihara

176
00:43:54,060 --> 00:44:01,440
is that of the relationship between this Equanimity this kind of love or

177
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:09,780
care Goodwill that is non-reactive or non-contracted

178
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:17,040
non-agitated or in the classic language isn't automatically involved in pursuing

179
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,140
or can being attracted to things chasing things

180
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:27,318
or isn't automatically involved in

181
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:32,960
repulsion or pushing away or pulling away

182
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:39,599
but a mind that's able to be present and open to what's happening in the world and to

183
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:44,839
maintain its Good Will its friendliness its love its care

184
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:52,500
in spite of the dangers in the world and now we're coming into maybe uh where

185
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:59,220
the wisdom and practice really comes to a kind of maturity

186
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:05,280
it's easy enough to have some idea of in

187
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,859
that we're supposed to be loving and everything is wonderful and practices

188
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:15,900
accept things as they are and and um

189
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:22,579
and um and for that to be kind of a pastoral image of Life a kind of idea that

190
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:27,839
everything is wonderful and good and and sometimes when there's a lot of

191
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:33,119
teaching Buddhist teachings about just sitting in with awareness accepting

192
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:40,140
things as they are being open to how things are and non-reactive I do feel that sometimes it's the

193
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:46,200
teachings of people who are relatively privileged and well off and don't have a

194
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:52,140
lot of challenges in their life that um that many people in this world have

195
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:57,540
many people live in danger zones and of all kinds in their families and their

196
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:04,800
communities and their countries and um and there are dangers in this world

197
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:10,560
so how do we maintain a loving heart a Caring Heart

198
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:17,520
in the face of dangers so that's one of the important topics and perhaps it's a nice way of also

199
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:23,940
coming to the end of 2020. where a year ago many of us did not see

200
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:31,260
the dangers that were going to come for this year and a surprising amount of danger even

201
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:36,300
fear that now exists in our society that didn't exist a year ago and

202
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:42,740
or maybe caution at least I mean it's remarkable that walk down the street and people

203
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:48,599
will avoid each other and I'll step out into the street and let someone else

204
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:53,640
have the sidewalk someone else will step out in the street and let me have the sidewalk

205
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:59,400
um even though everyone's wearing masks and um who would have thought I mean it's kind of like living in a science

206
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:05,400
fiction movie or something too to uh you know it's such a radical

207
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:13,319
uh kind of change in our society and um so how how can we be wiser with

208
00:47:13,319 --> 00:47:21,060
this how can we be equanimous with this in a wise way an appropriate way and how can we learn from 2020

209
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:27,180
so that we enter into 2021 with more wisdom with more

210
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:33,680
Street smarts with more Equanimity and more love and compassion

211
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:38,940
given what happened during course of this year how we learned how we've matured with all the challenges we've

212
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:45,180
we've had so I say all this because in the ancient texts the path of the book called The

213
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:51,780
Path of purification where they talk about the near enemy

214
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:55,520
of equanimity

215
00:47:56,819 --> 00:48:02,460
they the uh

216
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:07,500
it's the near enemy what looks like it and it's not really Equanimity but it

217
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:13,920
looks like it is the Equanimity is it's called ignorant equanimity

218
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:20,400
and its Equanimity that's ignorant of the dangers in the world so it's easy to be equanimous if they do

219
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:26,460
you know don't if one that doesn't see the dangers doesn't understand uh what's going on in this life

220
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:33,079
and um the

221
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:42,300
so here it says the near enemy is the ignorant Equanimity that is not aware of

222
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:48,420
danger the far enemy is greed and repulsion

223
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:54,780
it is not possible to have either greed or repulsion and equanimity

224
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:59,880
but there's near enemy uh that doesn't really also doesn't really

225
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:08,160
allow true Equanimity to be there is not aware of danger and I don't think we hear very often in

226
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:15,839
Buddhist teachings like sit down and close your eyes be aware be in the present moment and now become

227
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:20,880
aware of danger that there are there is danger in this life

228
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:27,480
life is fragile life is short they say even with a hundred years life

229
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:34,819
it's a short life and life is it's easy to get sick

230
00:49:34,819 --> 00:49:40,740
there are people who are not good people go in the wrong

231
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:48,599
places the wrong times and it is dangerous we live in a world of danger where our

232
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:55,440
lives can change Forever on a dime in a very quick and I've had I've known plenty of people

233
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,720
and myself and involved also where some accident happens and then we're never

234
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:06,740
quite the same again and we didn't anticipate the danger that would come

235
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:12,900
so this is not meant to be a depressing way to end 2020 but it is the classic

236
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:18,780
way of appreciating that true Equanimity also understands

237
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:25,800
that the world has dangers and learns to develop the strength the capacity or the openness

238
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:33,000
and the wisdom of how to be equanimous and loving in the face of danger with

239
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:39,839
Danger and without that message it's easy to kind of think that we're supposed to just live in a protective and

240
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:46,319
environment live in a monastery or someplace where you know we're completely safe so we can do this work

241
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:52,160
of just being completely non-attached to un you know

242
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:58,500
unfazed by what goes on in the world but I hope that that's not what we're doing I hope we're learning how to live

243
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:06,119
in the world as it is with its dangers and learning to be

244
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:16,040
loving in a way that doesn't succumb to repulsion and and pursuit or or

245
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:22,920
actively kind of you know going after things or actively pulling away automatically automatically going to

246
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:29,760
help when help is not really needed trying to fix automatically trying to push away or

247
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:35,640
deny what's there and in some ways this is the maybe one

248
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:41,880
it's it's said that Equanimity is one of the most mature and developed forms of Buddhist practice it comes after many

249
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:48,420
years of practice to really have this strong sense of equanimity so it's kind of like the North Star

250
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:54,960
but it definitely doesn't make us indifferent in fact I mean sometimes here in the west people often say that

251
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:01,740
the near enemy of equanimity is indifference and um and it's certainly not an indifference

252
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:10,260
it is it involves a deep caring a deep love and in having it to have an open window

253
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:17,579
to not have hold on to something that can be hit that can be hurt

254
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:23,280
and a different analogy for this is that if we hold our hands in a fist

255
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:29,460
then something can hit it and it can hurt because it's you know maybe it doesn't move very well with very well

256
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:36,660
but if we open our hands up wide and the fingers wide then things can hit but they kind of just kind of we kind of

257
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:42,660
like a bamboo flows With the Wind you know back and forth or or maybe it just goes right through the fingers open

258
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:48,780
fingers and doesn't really touch us and um and so there's a we we go in the

259
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:56,160
world very differently if we're fists it up and knotted up in something then if we go with an open hand an open heart

260
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:02,180
and so this ability to not have attachments not have clinging not have

261
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:08,400
self-definitions we hold on to for dear life but to just relax the heart Relax The

262
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:15,000
Mind open the clinging and in that be able to be present for danger because

263
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:22,140
then actually we're in less danger in our hearts we might be in physical danger but the

264
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:27,960
heart is never in danger if the heart doesn't cling

265
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:33,540
because there is one way that one kind of implication a Buddhist teacher teachings

266
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:39,300
is that the greatest danger that we live under live with is it is a danger we

267
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:46,800
provide ourselves the danger of clinging the danger of giving up our ethical life the danger of

268
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:53,339
giving up our ease our peace the danger of giving up our love and our freedom

269
00:53:53,339 --> 00:53:59,160
which we do if we cling and get attached there is no intentional and ethical life

270
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:05,359
without clinging there is no intentional intentions maybe stronger word

271
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:11,760
the the deepest well-being of the heart doesn't is not lost because of what

272
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:18,780
people do and the world does around us it's lost because of how we react and respond to that

273
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:23,819
and so to realize that there's danger here too

274
00:54:23,819 --> 00:54:29,880
and as we practice to learn how to really this idea of staying open an open

275
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:37,619
window is partly so we're protected from ourselves and then we we're much more protected in

276
00:54:37,619 --> 00:54:43,079
the heart from the dangers of the world we might still things might still happen to us

277
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:48,720
but um you know they don't run into this you know tight Fist of the heart or in

278
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:56,700
the mind that things are hard and difficult so to cultivate to discover the form of

279
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:04,460
love called Equanimity the flavor of of loving equanimous love

280
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:11,579
that is able to be equanimous and loving in the face of danger

281
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:17,339
so this is a tall order it's not an easy thing to discover how to do

282
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:24,180
but uh today you might spend time reflecting on this

283
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:29,660
and maybe you wouldn't be served very well by arguing against what I'm saying

284
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:35,460
maybe there's arguments to make against it but maybe you're better served yourself

285
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:42,480
by exploring and experimenting with this idea is how can you stay loving caring

286
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:48,000
friendly in the face of what you might think is

287
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,040
dangerous and um don't put yourself in danger please

288
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:59,040
please take care of yourself but but maybe you can explore this and ride the

289
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:05,760
edges of it and and maybe there are dangers that you think that you're worried about that maybe

290
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:13,500
aren't as dangerous as you think as you open up and no longer have anything knotted up inside

291
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:19,859
maybe talk to friends about this and explore this topic of having equanimous

292
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:26,460
Goodwill in the face of danger and um

293
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:33,420
so seems like a wonderful way of learning from this last year

294
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:40,500
and reflecting on this last year and becoming better people because of this last year and not being the victim of

295
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:49,920
last year's but really building and preparing for how to go into the next year 2021 and wiser more caring more

296
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:55,680
loving more Mindful and more for the benefit of the world

297
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:02,040
so I look forward to seeing maybe as many of you tomorrow morning if you're up early enough

298
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:09,599
and uh we'll welcome in the new year with um the last Reflections on

299
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,700
equanimity thank you
