1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:09,080
so tonight I'd like to talk about the roots of dharmic happiness

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,279
and as introduction just visualize if you're a visualizer

3
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,439
imagine that you're on a path winding through an Ancient

4
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:32,040
cathedral-like Forest canopy like a rainforest or something like that

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,980
it's very quiet very deep silence

6
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:44,480
maybe a few bird calls light filtering through the leaves

7
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,379
and there's a sense of presence growing things and reverence

8
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:58,320
as you walk the path turns a corner and you come

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:05,040
upon a clearing and in the middle of the queering there's this massive beautiful Bodhi

10
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:13,080
Tree and the path kind of goes around circumambulates around the tree

11
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:19,080
so that you can see these big sloping partitions of the tree going down deep

12
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,600
into the Earth The Roots

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:34,280
there's a feeling of silence and awe and deep Trust in the Majesty of this place

14
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:44,659
so tonight I'm going to talk about some important roots

15
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:51,258
sources of dharmic development and happiness on the path

16
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:58,079
these are attitudes that are onward leading in both personal and spiritual

17
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,020
maturation and joy and they are

18
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,599
kind of trust or confidence in the path itself

19
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,300
there are a sense of and then the other three are called the three wholesome

20
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:22,800
roots the three wholesome roots and Buddhism and those are a non-greed non-hatred and

21
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,599
non-delusion so first the trust the con confidence

22
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,900
in the unfolding of the path of practice there are two poly words commonly used

23
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:44,160
to um that are commonly used that are translated as trust or confidence and

24
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:51,379
they're both very closely related to the word for tranquility or calm

25
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:59,040
passati and those two words Sada and avicha Pasada

26
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:05,700
you can hear the similarity right sadha is to rest the heart upon it's a

27
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:12,500
certain kind of trust settling at the heart

28
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:18,900
now vecha Pasada is verified Faith it's called it's the taste of something good

29
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,019
that's already unfolded or come from the practice

30
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:30,239
some little taste of freedom maybe a big Taste of freedom

31
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,480
in either case I'm a little bit more talking about the first one that's settling the heart the trusting the path

32
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,360
here but in either case they involve trusting the process the

33
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,819
intrinsic journey of the joy itself

34
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:56,459
just being on a path can be satisfying right maybe some of you have reference points

35
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:03,060
for this for me when I was a kid I went hiking in the Appalachian Trail with my parents my sister for weeks

36
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:09,000
and the act of the hiking itself was really

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,519
part of what was enjoyable right being surrounded by trees and nature and

38
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:20,280
silence and rhythms water for all that time

39
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:27,300
and occasionally we would come upon these kinds of viewpoints and they weren't that different than the

40
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:33,900
sorts of places you could drive up to in the Appalachian mountain range but the view was so much more beautiful

41
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:40,800
because we had sunk into it we were in the process we were working with it

42
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,979
um the completely different experience and just kind of like driving up and parking and hopping out of the car and

43
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:52,740
taking picture and going on right so

44
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,080
there's this satisfaction that deepens as we commit

45
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,780
more to the path commit more to the process

46
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:10,500
trust also can come in a sense of trusting the benefits of training the

47
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:18,840
heart training the mind the conditions of our lives are rarely chosen in entirety right some of them we

48
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:24,660
choose a lot of them come to us genetics happens dance culture family

49
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:32,759
whatever but still our choices our choices matter

50
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:38,039
they create new conditions the Derma teacher Susie Harrington has

51
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:46,259
an analogy a simile I really like it's of a kayaker kayaking down white water rapids

52
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:53,340
so the kayaker she doesn't choose the way the River cuts through the land or even the amount of water in the river

53
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:58,380
she certainly doesn't choose how intense the Rapids are or the Eddies or the

54
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:04,080
trees that have fallen any of the challenges yet

55
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,240
Choice matters there's a skill in operating that kayak even though all the

56
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:14,460
momentum is going in One Direction in the Stream of life

57
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,280
she dances through it right there's a way through

58
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,680
so this sense of the trust can also be

59
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:32,000
trusting the unfolding process while making wise choices

60
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:39,960
committing to a virtue to goodness is a really powerful form of conditioning

61
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,900
there's kind of a power or a purpose and putting that boat in the water in

62
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,259
the Stream choosing the path

63
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,880
the next three sort of wholesome sources foundations roots of dharmic development

64
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,100
and happiness are actually called the three wholesome roots in the teachings

65
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,819
and they are as I mentioned earlier non-greed non-hatred and non-delusion

66
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:26,400
and this kind of clunky wording is classic ancient Buddhism it's often

67
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,099
framed in the negative and or in the absence of the negative

68
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:38,580
it's via negativa framed in the absence of the negative and

69
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:45,960
there's some wisdom in that right non-greed is a huge range of things it's

70
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:54,978
not just generosity or contentment it's all these different ways of being

71
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,919
so I'll talk about a bit of the range of each of them but as I'm talking just

72
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:07,919
notice what branches of each root might you recognize or see in your heart and

73
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:16,800
your mind and your life so non-greed there's sort of a range of

74
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,699
meanings there the first being contentment just simple contentment

75
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:29,940
contentment of being on a path contentment of showing up for

76
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:37,740
yourself for the moment can also arrange towards generosity

77
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:43,979
as I mentioned a moment ago chaga is the poly word for that and that is the

78
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:50,640
primary practice of most Asian lay Buddhists sometimes it's the only practice and it

79
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,580
is a powerful practice it develops a sense of

80
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:02,700
non-self-centeredness and it's a type of letting go right

81
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,100
the kind of letting go it's also really powerful for

82
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:14,160
relationship building there's a lot to quote it's actually on

83
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,339
one of my walls it's kindness and giving creates love

84
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:26,040
kindness and giving creates love and I'm not necessarily talking about

85
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:32,160
romantic love here of course but connection

86
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,120
connection between us there's this sense of the Open Hand the

87
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:47,000
gesture of offering the Open Heart the letting go that happened through this

88
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,980
there's another dimension of non-greed which is Simplicity itself

89
00:09:52,980 --> 00:10:00,680
the Simplicity of wants needs the Simplicity of one's schedule

90
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:08,700
this leads to a certain kind of a word that's not very popular in English

91
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:14,399
which is renunciation renunciation

92
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,500
which is another level of non-greed the not needing to begin with less about the

93
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:26,100
giving away and more about the not needing to take not needing to grab more

94
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:33,240
very counter cultural right in our society where we get all these

95
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,000
messages more and more and more you need to buy this get that to be this way or whatnot

96
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:45,660
this is instead a sense of enoughness just enough

97
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,319
it's okay

98
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:58,140
this kind of commitment to simplicity opens up time

99
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:05,160
time it's a gift allowing extra space excess baggage doesn't have to be taken

100
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,680
with us it's traveling light on the journey so to speak

101
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:19,019
I learned this really in a powerful way it's now been many years ago maybe 15 years ago I was traveling on an extended

102
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:24,120
trip through South Asia and at the time I was quite injured so I

103
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,360
couldn't take very much stuff even though I was gone for almost a year I had a carry-on wheelie

104
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,300
and I had like this ergonomic very light backpack couldn't put a lot in it

105
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,579
that taught me so much because on that trip occasionally I would get things

106
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:48,660
right and I realized every time I got something I had to give something else up because I couldn't carry all of it

107
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:54,300
and as the trip went on gradually I was shedding more and more giving more and

108
00:11:54,300 --> 00:12:00,600
more away because as many veteran Travelers know

109
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:08,040
it's kind of a pain in the butt to manage that stuff to track all that stuff to keep all that stuff safe

110
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,860
it actually does not lead to a better experience it's a little bit harder to see in our

111
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:21,420
daily lives but there's truth there too how much time do we spend

112
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:29,300
keeping track of all of our stuff managing it

113
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:37,620
this is true of thinking even the thought processes

114
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:45,180
or the information we take in like the endless grasping for news or

115
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,220
Internet information can be stressful right

116
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,860
so the enoughness okay that's this is enough I've seen enough headlines for today

117
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:01,740
I've seen enough social media for the year whatever it is right [Music]

118
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,440
so um psychologists talk about I can't remember when I first learned this but

119
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,600
maybe some of you have heard of it there's the um the circle of concern

120
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:19,680
and the circle of action or efficacy and it's two co-centric rings in a diagram

121
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:26,940
and a very valid predictor of human happiness is how close those circles are

122
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:32,579
to each other if my circle for of concern is massive

123
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:38,220
and my sense of efficacy or action is Tiny what does that lead to

124
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,560
overwhelm fatalism stress

125
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:50,579
it's not to say we shouldn't be aware of what's happening around us but to balance those two

126
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:56,180
take actions that link those two

127
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,980
and to have a wise diet about this stuff right

128
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:08,579
it's um it's a kind of Simplicity that I've

129
00:14:08,579 --> 00:14:13,920
really come to value and it does quiet the inner mental chatter as well

130
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,339
it's hard to have a peaceful evening meditation if all I've done is listened to news for the

131
00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:28,040
last two hours or you know pick your own flavor of what this is right

132
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:35,120
so the Simplicity of thinking also involves

133
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:45,540
a Simplicity of relationship to life to my interpretations of things I mean

134
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:53,040
our minds our interpretation meaning making organs right that's what Minds do

135
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:58,380
and yet there are ways of having a simpler relationship to what that is

136
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:03,839
and to maybe not taking it so seriously all the time right

137
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:10,079
like oh yeah I remember one of my teachers used to say yada yada blah blah blah blah when he was talking about the

138
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:17,160
mind because it just goes on and there's a way of just stepping back and being simple with that

139
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:23,399
and over hours and days and weeks and years of practice

140
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:29,940
the mind starts to do it less I was really struck by this at one point

141
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:35,399
I don't remember at what point it was in my practice that I realized the inner narrator just doesn't talk very often

142
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:40,500
anymore I was like no wonder there's so much more space

143
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,660
wow so that can start to happen and then

144
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:51,779
everything else opens up right and there are times it comes up again of course

145
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:57,240
for us humans that's what Minds do but even then there's the distance it's

146
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:03,779
like the difference between being this close to the flat screen television

147
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:08,880
or being on the other side of the room and having a lot more space about

148
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,480
context or maybe even being outside the house glancing at the TV from across the

149
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:23,100
street through the window we don't have to be glued to the content of our thoughts when there's simplicity

150
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:29,639
it's just thinking conditioning mental habit

151
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:36,360
whatever it is and then there's a Simplicity of

152
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:42,480
awareness itself and that's more of an attribute of mindfulness Lucid awareness and I'll talk a little bit more about

153
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,899
that later but all of those things the contentment the generosity

154
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:55,440
the Simplicity the renunciation all their kinds of branches in the root of

155
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:02,279
non-greed and then we get to non-hatred Avera is

156
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:08,058
the Pali of era and

157
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:15,839
non-hatred is has it's got a very esteemed place in the Buddhist teachings

158
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:21,959
it's a really big deal it's often a cognate for meta Goodwill

159
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:28,700
love kindness and that's a beautiful thing it's a beautiful quality

160
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:35,600
it's also a whole range of non-hostility

161
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:45,840
and John pasano on a meta Retreat early in my practice named you know you don't have to start

162
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:52,140
out by loving all living beings that's a really high bar then why don't you practice not being

163
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:59,880
averse to them quite so often right that itself is a high bar depending on

164
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:07,400
the being and depending on my mind and the day right so

165
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:14,240
non-aversion non-hatred this broad flavor includes respect

166
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,100
non-contempt equanimity appreciation

167
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,140
kind curiosity all the way up through Goodwill

168
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:30,080
benevolence altruism

169
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:36,000
compassion there's a whole range maybe you can

170
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,299
think of others even not particularly caring

171
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:49,039
just letting someone be that's not hatred allowing

172
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:06,179
there's a distinction that has kind of become clearer to me over the time

173
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:12,559
I've practiced this path which is um

174
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:20,400
even the smallest movement of the heart or mind can be considered an action

175
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,820
right sometimes in meditation you might actually feel that it's um

176
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:31,919
the about twoness of maybe like getting up or the weaning forward of wanting or

177
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:39,919
the leaning back of not wanting but those kinds of really subtle actions

178
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:47,039
and these actions also aggregate to more of an action life action

179
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:55,640
to quote Saint Thomas Aquinas to love is to will the good of the other

180
00:19:55,799 --> 00:20:00,559
to love is to will the good of the other

181
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,179
so there's an active component to that

182
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:12,840
compassion anukampa is um sort of the natural

183
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:19,200
compassion that arises it's a quivering or movement of the heart caring

184
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,980
and it has an implicit the wish to respond may not be able to respond depending on

185
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:33,200
the context or the circumstances but that movement of the heart is there

186
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:40,860
this kind of love compassion kindness and it belongs to all Humanity not just

187
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:47,520
Buddhism not just any religious tradition it belongs to all of them runs through all of them underpins all of

188
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,220
them whether it's Love by enemy or meta for all beings

189
00:20:53,220 --> 00:21:00,299
or simple generosity and charity for those who need it

190
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:05,880
those all kind of interweave and the ultimate aim in this tradition

191
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:12,179
of Metta of loving kindness is to hold everyone in that kindness

192
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:17,960
without wishing harm on any of them again Avera

193
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:24,539
non-harming ahimsa these are powerful powerful intentions

194
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:30,380
to cultivate and Powerful moments to experience

195
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:40,620
what is it like to hold that intention without even

196
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:47,820
harming or deprecating oneself when it's not there when it's not actionable

197
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:55,200
when I might want to be feeling love and kindness what I'm feeling as grumpiness irritation or even rage

198
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,500
can there be kindness to the mind or heart that's not there

199
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,320
right now is that possible

200
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,240
and the discernment the discernment not to buy into

201
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,179
the unwholesome movement the unwholesome tendency

202
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:23,539
by honestly turning towards it with awareness

203
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:32,159
this kind of stuff strengthens the muscle of emotional and spiritual maturity

204
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:38,520
requires discernment right it's like understanding there's little bitty differences about what's happening in

205
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:45,299
the mind or what causes what in our hearts there's a story I love this is from a

206
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:50,700
podcast invisibilia some Seasons back I honestly don't

207
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:56,760
remember how many but it's the story of this family who's having

208
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:02,280
it's like a barbecue or a cookout in their backyard and it's you know maybe a

209
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:08,760
Saturday afternoon or a Sunday afternoon and you know they've got something grilling and other stuff on

210
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:15,480
the table and everybody's hanging out having a good time there's a little bit of wine and it starts getting towards dusk

211
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,000
it's a semi-urban environment right right and out of the Dusk and the space

212
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,140
between the houses comes a man with a knife intending to Rob them

213
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:33,900
and he shows up brandishes this knife and demands money

214
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:39,500
and the hostess without missing a Beat stands up

215
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:44,940
Smiles at him and said welcome would you like some food here have a

216
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:50,100
glass of wine the man is dumbfounded completely

217
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:56,280
perplexed just and he was kind of young and the way the story goes his lips sort

218
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:02,700
of started quivering and he accepted the wine put away the knife ran off I didn't see

219
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:08,460
him again but the next morning when they were finishing their cleaning up

220
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,559
they found that wine glass empty very carefully laid against the side of the

221
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:20,700
house he didn't even take the glass he made sure not to break it

222
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:26,580
that that's the power of meta kindness in the face of

223
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:33,659
something quite different in Psychology this is called a non-complementary response

224
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:39,120
when someone comes at you with rage what's the most natural thing any of us would have

225
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:44,520
fear or anger right depending some maybe both

226
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:49,919
there might be a fight flight or freeze response on a nervous system model

227
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:56,640
it can be an extraordinary Jujitsu of the moment to have a

228
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:03,659
different response than what that calls out by instinct

229
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:12,260
I've discovered this in my work as a Chaplain too one of the hospitals that I trained at

230
00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:18,780
I used to get called they they did it once by accident I think because the person who usually dealt with such

231
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:24,480
things didn't couldn't respond and then after they figured out that it worked

232
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,419
they kept doing it um I'm very very upset family member

233
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:37,440
was in one of the waiting rooms I mean they were yelling and they were spouting off sort of like Angry comments and

234
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,020
just making a real scene and so they asked me to go down and talk

235
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:48,419
to them and I was happy to go talk to him security was sort of in the background they weren't coming up but

236
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:54,600
they were nearby in case things went South it was absolutely amazing just going up

237
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:01,140
to this man and very kindly meeting him and listening and eliciting

238
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:07,879
all the concerns and empathizing with the feelings the emotion just went down

239
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:15,919
and by the end of that conversation he was praising the service

240
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:23,159
he needed to be heard that's what you know I mean there were issues we needed to help with too and we

241
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:28,679
did but as far as the emotion went it just needed to be heard to be met

242
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:32,840
with attention and kindness

243
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:47,220
so I want a name that's not always the correct response or the wisest response

244
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:53,580
to these situations right and so a counter story this is one that

245
00:26:53,580 --> 00:27:01,440
Sharon salzberg loves to tell so you may have heard it she is traveling in India by Rickshaw in

246
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,659
New Delhi and those of you who haven't been to India New Delhi is huge

247
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:12,360
it is busy it's chaotic and it's notoriously crime ridden

248
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:18,980
so she's on a rickshaw it's the bicycle kind not the motor kind and they're headed off to see her teacher menendra G

249
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:24,779
and the Rickshaw turns down a side street off of this just like massive

250
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:30,840
packed flow of traffic and a man tries to jump on the Rickshaw

251
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:37,679
and pull Sharon especially her purse off it's terrifying I'm sure

252
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:43,320
and together she and the driver were able to fend this man off and they made it to her teacher and she's

253
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:49,860
understandably very shaken and she looks at him and she said what do I do as a

254
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:56,720
Buddhist in a case like that immunity looks at her

255
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:04,440
and with a lot of love in his eyes he says my dear with every ounce of loving

256
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,960
kindness in your heart you hit him over the head with your umbrella

257
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:16,860
right so sometimes a really strong no is the

258
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:23,340
wisest thing this is not advocating being a doormat

259
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:28,620
non-hatred is not meaning opening ourselves up to violence or

260
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:35,640
abuse or anything else but it's more the attitude with which we

261
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:42,179
hold the boundary and the discernment to know when the non-complementary response is

262
00:28:42,179 --> 00:28:51,440
appropriate and when the really strong no it's the most helpful response

263
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:59,640
so that brings me to us to non-delusion

264
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:06,679
discernment falls into that category discernment wisdom Clarity are all in the

265
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:14,340
non-delusion category so non-delusion

266
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:22,580
from a Buddhist perspective I think one could say it starts with Sati with mindfulness awareness

267
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:29,580
and that eventually matures into clarity

268
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:35,480
and wisdom discernment and wisdom and clarity

269
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:43,620
so Satya is like kind of an information gathering process

270
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:49,320
mindfulness mindfulness is got many nuances one could give an

271
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:54,480
entire talk on just what mindfulness means but it's got

272
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:01,320
different aspects to it and one of them is to be present with what is right

273
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,779
to be actually present with what is and that seems like a really powerful

274
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:12,299
underpinning for any kind of wisdom or non-delusion

275
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:19,799
if I'm in the virtual reality machine that runs up here my chances of non-delusion are a lot

276
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:26,460
smaller than if I'm present with what's actually unfolding

277
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:32,840
with the eyes see the ears here the body consents

278
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,940
so starting with mindfulness wherever it's

279
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:46,080
at occasional intentional sometimes it can even feel labored and

280
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,460
guilt sometimes says there's parts of the practice that can feel like manual labor

281
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:58,320
all of that still starts to cultivate the conditions for non-dollution

282
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,899
little by little later it can become useful

283
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:10,740
can get momentum and even feel completely natural and for some people it ends up becoming a trait actually

284
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:18,320
shifts our minds over time that neuroplasticity shifts in really beautiful ways

285
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:28,919
so that moment to moment process also includes a Resonance of recollecting or

286
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:36,020
recollecting there's a part of mindfulness that um

287
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:44,460
kind of casts it to way back just a little bit enough to recognize the thread between

288
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:50,700
the immediate past and the present and that's where wisdom can start to come it's when we see cause and effect

289
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:56,760
or conditions affecting each other and it starts to gain momentum that way

290
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:03,480
too it's like the moments of mindfulness gradually widen like puddles widening together to create a pond or something

291
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,020
like that

292
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:16,140
there's also though the recollection aspect of recollecting

293
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:21,480
the virtues in the practice your own virtues

294
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:27,539
this is also a form of non-delusion for some reason in our culture it's so

295
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:34,500
easy for people to feel like it's important to be down on ourselves to have some kind of critical Inner

296
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:40,580
Voice or that we won't somehow get stuff done if we're not hard on ourselves

297
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:46,399
recollecting virtues is actually an ancient practice it's one of the fundamental practices

298
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:54,480
our own virtues and those of others the good things we've done that too is a form of cutting through

299
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:01,860
delusion particularly particularly delusion if there's a negative mental habit

300
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:06,899
about the self for those people who are more apt to

301
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:12,840
cast flame outwards a better practice is to recollect the virtues of others

302
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:19,679
right that annoying office mate or the family member who chews wrong or has

303
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,840
the wrong political views or whatever it is

304
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:34,380
so this gradually begins to mature into the

305
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:41,880
kind of discernment I alluded to before and when mindfulness starts to mature

306
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:46,919
into discernment it's likened to being the gatekeeper of

307
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:53,460
a village keep in mind most of the similes and the Buddha's teachings are from the Bronze

308
00:33:53,460 --> 00:34:00,720
Age in India right so the gatekeeper of a village a gatekeeper just kind of monitors all

309
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,059
the traffic going in and out knows how to get to the king

310
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:11,339
it's judicious about who to tell that information to and is judicious about

311
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:16,500
who to pass along Lord you know you might want to keep an eye on this gang of people

312
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:25,338
and it's kind of the same in our minds right to monitor the in and out traffic

313
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:33,060
the Buddha talks about there being two kinds of thought there's beneficial and unbeneficial

314
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:41,398
wholesome and unwholesome and so it can be as simple as that noticing is the effect

315
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:48,720
opening me up settling me motivating me or is it making me feel

316
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,480
kind of small and hopeless and yucky

317
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:01,260
is it resulting in actions that are helpful for myself and others or actions that bring greater suffering

318
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:07,020
to me and or others not to actually kind of the definition

319
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:13,440
of a wise person versus a foolish person and you know any of us can be wise or

320
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:20,040
foolish in any given moment but a foolish person is engaged in actions or thoughts that bring more suffering to

321
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:26,520
themselves others in the world different day

322
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:34,260
that person might be engaged in thoughts or actions that bring benefit to themselves and others in the world

323
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:37,400
and that to wisdom

324
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,780
so all of this kind of discernment kind of evolves into a greater wisdom and

325
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:52,320
this includes this more of a settled strength to see the opposite of the three

326
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:58,800
wholesome roots greed hatred and delusion and all of their cronies all of their henchmen

327
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:06,060
without losing our seat without being thrown off

328
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:11,940
because with the exception of the very rare fully enlightened awakened beings

329
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:17,460
all of us have some of it in our hearts Hearts just

330
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:22,680
Being Human and understanding that

331
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:28,800
when it's held well it can actually increase compassion and empathy connection

332
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:38,040
wisdom Alexander Schultz Nixon writes

333
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:43,380
if only it were all so simple if only there were evil people somewhere

334
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:52,020
insidiously committing evil deeds and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and Destroy them

335
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:58,020
but the line dividing Good and Evil cuts through the heart of every human

336
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:03,480
being he then goes on to say the line

337
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:09,599
separating good and evil passes not through States nor through classes nor through

338
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:16,740
political parties either but right through every human heart and

339
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:22,920
through all human hearts it's what we do with it

340
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:29,940
how we relate to it how we act on that that's what matters

341
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:36,540
some days it's more or some days it's less you do a ton of spiritual practice and work on yourself and it's going to

342
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:43,200
get really small and even then I just think of many of you have

343
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,920
probably seen or heard the Dalai Lama laugh and he has this just amazingly

344
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:56,700
infectious laugh it's kind of like a little kids right and at one point

345
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:01,800
I've read this but I've also heard him say it he he laughs at seeing the

346
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,980
selfish and sneaky parts of his own mind the man's been practicing since he was I

347
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:15,200
don't know four and when asked you know fully purified in there it's like no

348
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:22,020
tries to sneak up on me now and then not mind so it's that holding it lightly

349
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:29,000
the Tendencies start to attenuate when held lightly

350
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:38,339
so all of this all this starts to kind of

351
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:46,320
pull together in a way to noticing the impact in our hearts

352
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,920
and in our relationships on how we're relating

353
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,140
to the things we don't like in ourselves and noticing the things that we

354
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:03,780
appreciate in ourselves and others the non-greet the non-hatred the non-delusion

355
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:09,660
because that whether you believe in terms of energy or neurology

356
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:15,740
that has Ripple effects in our lives

357
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,900
there's a second gatekeeper story and this one

358
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:27,839
this is a more sort of friendly human human like he's he's rendered in more

359
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:33,660
human way in the ancient discourses and there's a story he's like you know

360
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:39,960
the friendly sort and talks to everybody and people ask him questions going into this Village they're coming in for the

361
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,240
first time or relocating and so one group passes by and the head

362
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:51,060
of the group says so um tell me what are the people like here

363
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:56,460
and he smiles and looks at them and he said tell me what the people were like where

364
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:01,980
you used to live mean cunning conniving you couldn't

365
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:07,800
trust him as far as you could throw them they were awful and rude

366
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:14,480
you just nods I think you'll find people like that here

367
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:21,960
a few more parties go by maybe an hour or two another group comes by and someone poses the exact same question

368
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,300
maybe worded a little different what are the people like here anyway

369
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:33,000
give me an idea how did you find them where you used to live

370
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,180
kind generous trustworthy

371
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:45,180
I really I didn't want to leave but you know my husband he got this new job and here we are

372
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:50,460
they were amazing really good neighbors gatekeeper nods and he says

373
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:56,000
I think you'll find people much like that here

374
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:06,680
right so all of this wraps back around

375
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:14,180
to trust and contentment in the path

376
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:20,940
noticing what we put out is a lot like what we receive not always

377
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:28,260
but sometimes but trusting the process of the meditation this internal development

378
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:34,820
commitment to cultivating virtue and how that can shift things

379
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,460
there's a hidden almost selfish Joy with being involved in a path like this

380
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:50,099
particularly if it involves orienting around service to something

381
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:55,200
bigger than we are service to others

382
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:01,980
and um that can feed this light healthy sense

383
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:08,280
of a bigger picture that undercuts the greed hatred and delusion and helps the

384
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:15,440
non-greed non-hate non-delusion those roots to really grow

385
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,960
so just to recap in closing

386
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:34,380
trust in the unfolding path explore Express the many branches of

387
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:40,619
these roots of non-greed non-hatred non-delusion like contentment

388
00:42:40,619 --> 00:42:48,200
simplicity generosity respect

389
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:56,160
kindness and good will mindfulness discernment

and enjoy it when you can thank you for your kind attention

391
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:12,359
we have just a moment or two if anyone has questions comments

392
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:20,059
um I ran a little longer than I expected so sorry it's a moment or two

393
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,260
