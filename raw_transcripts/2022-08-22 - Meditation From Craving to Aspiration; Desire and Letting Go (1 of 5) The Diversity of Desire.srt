1
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:10,099
okay then I think we'll go ahead and get started

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,000
so it's nice to be with all of you again as you can see um Gil will again be away

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,920
this week so we'll have five days together and this week uh the theme is going to

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,279
be desire and letting go and you know we know that desire is a

5
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,579
big part of human life and once one begins mindfulness practice we see in

6
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,620
fact how frequently the mind is trying to get something or hold on to something

7
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,520
that it likes or finds Pleasant or useful even which incense just kind of wanting

8
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,160
wanting all the time and why is that

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,059
um mostly it's because we think that it will bring happiness and you know getting what we want is is

10
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:10,680
good getting things that are Pleasant or beautiful but mindfulness also shows us that this

11
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:17,759
isn't entirely true our quest to find happiness only by fulfilling desires

12
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:25,759
gets more and more suspect doesn't it on the path and it's tiring and it's not entirely in our control

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,020
um of course on the other hand it's also obvious that not all desires are harmful

14
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,840
for us and some of the happiness that desirable experiences bring is is hardly

15
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,899
a terrible thing so we're going to have to look more carefully at desires

16
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:48,240
and then maybe on the flip side we know that the Buddhist teachings are frequently

17
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,000
about letting go and how does that relate to desire so we're going to talk about some of

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,240
that during this week I think it should be an interesting Adventure

19
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,579
but first let's go ahead and get started meditating

20
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:11,520
so please settle in and find a

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:19,140
posture for meditation where you can be upright and also relaxed or if you're

22
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:27,660
lying down that's fine too but somewhere where you can be in a a straight posture

23
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,840
foreign

24
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,940
just allow yourself to feel where you're sitting

25
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,280
maybe your seat against the cushion or the chair

26
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,200
your legs or feet against the floor

27
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,819
and just allow yourself to be supported by what you're sitting on

28
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:28,140
thank you and we'll deliberately invite some ease

29
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:35,400
in the body so softening the muscles of the face

30
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,159
particularly around the eyes and even the eyes and the eye sockets

31
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:46,700
they tend to get a little tight when we're looking at the screen

32
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:08,900
releasing the jaw down through the neck

33
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:24,720
and letting the shoulders settle maybe letting the shoulder blades slide

34
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,380
down the back

35
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,860
softening the arms and the hands

36
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:00,840
and down into the chest area around the heart

37
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,039
rib cage

38
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,580
just sensing into that maybe letting it expand

39
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:15,319
use the three dimensions

40
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,300
softening down through the belly

41
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,900
in the hip joints and again feeling into where you're

42
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,120
sitting maybe releasing a bit more

43
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,720
and then letting go of any bracing in the legs

44
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:09,660
foreign [Music] for ease in the body it might be that

45
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:15,419
there's still places of tension or pain or places where we couldn't feel it very

46
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:22,819
well and that's fine the body is fine right now

47
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,680
so we also invite some ease in the mind

48
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,460
with how things are

49
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,319
we may gently turn attention to the breath

50
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,840
just the sensations of breathing in breathing out as a simple

51
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,880
present moment object

52
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:47,400
and just touching into the state of the Mind

53
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,500
as we continue to breathe

54
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:59,460
just noticing if there's any mood present

55
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:05,400
or generally the energy level is the mind a little bit tired right now or is

56
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,020
it a little bit agitated

57
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,379
just so that we have a sense of how things are

58
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:43,260
and I'd like to invite just a brief recollection

59
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:56,160
so I'd like to invite recalling a a past experience of

60
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:02,399
craving or grasping that was strong for you

61
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:10,320
and and clearly unbeneficial in some way it doesn't have to be the heaviest one

62
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,860
but you know the time when you wanted the coffee so bad that when the person

63
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:24,540
at the counter said they didn't have that kind you felt angry something like that an instance of

64
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:30,180
grasping that was where the mind was clearly

65
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:35,760
in a contracted state not a long story about it but instead

66
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:43,339
recollect what it felt like to have that craving or clinging

67
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:57,480
and once you have a sense of how that felt

68
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,519
then you can turn your attention back to

69
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:09,839
the meditation on the breath and inviting ease through the body

70
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,360
you can feel the contrast between those

71
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:23,480
and kind of let that recollection settle out as you breathe in and out

72
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:31,320
maybe even the grasping affected the way you were breathing you can just let it naturally

73
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,600
said aloud into how it is now

74
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:53,579
okay if it helps you can take a fuller deeper breath and on the out breath

75
00:10:53,579 --> 00:11:01,220
encourage relaxation throughout the body just to help reset

76
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:15,959
and then continue on with simple mindfulness meditation of

77
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:22,019
noticing what's happening as it happens and in particular if the mind is

78
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:29,180
inclining toward wanting or not wanting noticing that

79
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:37,339
but mostly just saying with the simple object of the breath or the body

80
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:42,680
in mindfulness meditation

81
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,120
foreign

82
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:25,459
and as you're watching the mind and resting with the breath or the body

83
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,880
you might notice that various present moment

84
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,339
wanting or desire that comes in

85
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:44,880
has some similarity to that grasping that was recalled

86
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:52,079
maybe there's a sense of Leaning or contraction even if it's just a slight

87
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:58,320
one like I want a little more peace in this sitting or

88
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,839
I want that twinge in my back

89
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,839
to settle out it's maybe milder but it's of the same

90
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:18,240
family is that craving or clinging

91
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:25,260
and we just notice that this is just one of the movements of the

92
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,940
Mind the movement of wanting or or desire

93
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:19,100
foreign

94
00:19:41,059 --> 00:19:49,200
as we continue to sit we may notice

95
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:55,320
some things that are kind of Desire that has to do with the body just the needs

96
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:03,059
of the body like maybe you're getting thirsty after

97
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:10,559
having sat here for a while or maybe there's some discomfort related to

98
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:18,240
being in the same position maybe you need to go to the bathroom

99
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,000
these are also basic kinds of desires and how are they similar

100
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,460
to these other desires that we've looked at

101
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,460
as we continue to sit with breath and body

102
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,299
mindfulness

103
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,899
and now I'd like to invite another

104
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:07,159
reflection or thought

105
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:15,000
so now please bring to mind an aspiration that you have for your

106
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:22,340
life or for your practice something that is clearly wholesome

107
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:28,860
maybe you're working on a degree or a certification

108
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:35,960
so that you can work in a way that serves other people

109
00:25:36,179 --> 00:25:41,700
or perhaps you are aspiring to go on a

110
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:49,140
three-month retreat at some point or maybe you wish for awakening for

111
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:55,919
freedom bring that into the mind and then feel

112
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,240
how that is in the body

113
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,019
breathing with it

114
00:26:08,539 --> 00:26:16,020
this is also a kind of Desire how is it similar to the other kinds of

115
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:22,760
Desire that we explored in this meditation and how is it different

116
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:31,639
without thinking about that just just rest with it

117
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:40,279
so what we see as we begin to explore

118
00:27:40,279 --> 00:27:48,179
this very natural very normal quality called desire

119
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:53,000
is that it has a wide range

120
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,980
has a wide range it can be a wide range of how wholesome or unwholesome it can

121
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,639
be and how strong it can be

122
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:11,340
and how we relate to it let me relate to different Desires in different ways

123
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:16,440
so it's a big part of the mind of life

124
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:24,299
and it's a big part of what drives the world to be doing all that it's doing

125
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:29,240
and so it's very important to start looking at it

126
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:37,919
we can maybe see in our own life the drivenness that comes from some of our desires or or has come in

127
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:45,299
the past and this connects us to all people

128
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:50,520
because all people have this and we can also feel

129
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,679
compassion for how it is to be driven if we're not

130
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:03,720
seeing not seeing that so we can feel the wisdom even just of

131
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:10,200
these few minutes of looking at this quality of mind this Factor

132
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,580
of the mind and heart

133
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:24,240
and we can wish that our particular desires can be pointed

134
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:30,720
toward helping those around us and even if they're not doing that

135
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:37,799
directly simply knowing about our desires and being able to see them

136
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:42,960
that's going to give us some choice about how we interact with others how we

137
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,260
make choices in our life so we can

138
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:54,600
wish that those will be of benefit you'll be glad that we have the

139
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:03,020
awareness in order to make some of those choices instead of only being driven

140
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,820
foreign

141
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,940
[Music]

142
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:04,919
okay so we are talking about desire

143
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:11,640
and letting go this week and as I mentioned before the Sid

144
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:19,580
mindfulness practice reveals to us that are quest for happiness that's based in

145
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:26,519
fulfilling desires may not be fully effective

146
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:33,299
um because we start to feel the the disadvantages of how tiring it is to

147
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:40,200
always be chasing desires and also that we're not totally in control of what it is that we want to get

148
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:45,539
but on the other hand some desires are certainly useful in life and on the

149
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:50,700
spiritual path so we'll start to look at that and the

150
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:57,260
the topic for today is the diversity of Desire

151
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:02,460
so I think it's important maybe to say right up front

152
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:10,200
is all desire bad no no so we'll just say that clearly at the

153
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:17,640
beginning the Buddha was a lot more nuanced in his teachings on desire which is a very

154
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:25,080
fundamental movement of the human mind maybe we could call it something like we

155
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:32,279
could say there's a movement toward in the mind yeah we can feel that there's a movement toward and there's also a

156
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:38,640
movement away which is related but we're focusing now on this movement toward as

157
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:45,899
event very general aspect of the Mind and as we'll see as we go along this

158
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:51,720
week the Buddha actually used our tendency to move toward things as part

159
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:56,940
of the path to Freedom that he described and laid out for us

160
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:02,700
but often we know that moving toward is not not about freedom

161
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:09,299
you know we we know from the second Noble Truth the craving or clinging is

162
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:16,380
closely related to suffering so we're going to have to look at this desire this movement toward sooner or

163
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:22,559
later you know it's an important part of the practice to look at that

164
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:29,220
it's important territory let's say so we can see that there's a range of

165
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:35,940
Desire or a diversity of Desire I don't think it's quite a linear

166
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:41,460
Spectrum it's more like a space a space

167
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:46,620
or even a mandala of different kinds of Desire and the way I want to talk about it

168
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:52,799
today is to say that there are five different aspects of Desire that we

169
00:33:52,799 --> 00:34:01,080
could maybe identify and so as we touch into each of these five different aspects of Desire or facets of Desire

170
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:08,638
see how each one resonates for you notice notice if and how it may be present in

171
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:14,960
your mind stream or even in your body or how it's been playing out in your life

172
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,980
so clearly in the unwholesome realm of

173
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:26,878
the space we find what is called a tanha in the Buddhist teachings and that's a

174
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:33,060
word that literally means thirst but it's usually translated as craving

175
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:38,280
and this is that grasping kind of Desire or clinging that is obviously painful

176
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:46,800
and harmful and it relates to things like lust or greed or strong wanting

177
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,138
and when this craving is about the world of the senses like something some

178
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:59,420
taste or sound or touch that we desire we call it comma

179
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:05,280
which means basically sense desire or sense pleasure like the Kama Sutra it's

180
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:13,260
the same the same word so comma tanha is strong grasping of sensual objects

181
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:19,079
um but it's not really about the object of course that the grasping is occurring in the mind

182
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:26,700
or we might habitually grasp but comfort food or or sex or sexual fantasies even

183
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:34,079
so you know we also see things like addiction to drugs and alcohol and then also tanha can relate to things

184
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,500
that aren't sensual like craving for power or for certain identities

185
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:44,940
and these kinds of desires I think I can just State clearly these do not support

186
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:52,740
our path to Liberation there it's clear enough because they are themselves they're binding the mind up we can feel

187
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:58,740
that when we are under their sway so that's one kind

188
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:06,180
and then you know to kind of fill out more of the space another kind is that we have some basic desires that are

189
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:12,420
related to bodily needs the desire to eat the desire to drink or to use the

190
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,579
bathroom um and sex as a basic desire in some

191
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:23,880
stages of human life so these desires are not usually seen as

192
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:30,000
inherently harmful but they are somewhat stressful aren't they take some effort

193
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,060
to do all these things um and I would say that how we relate to

194
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:42,000
the desires of the body influences how happy or unhappy we are

195
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,660
even awakened people have the desire to pee and they still feel physical hunger

196
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:53,760
um there's one suit that says that even arahants fully awakened beings

197
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:00,359
feel Sensations that are dependent on the body and conditioned by life

198
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:06,660
which I think means these basic bodily feelings so there is some distinction between

199
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:11,760
beings as to whether or not these very fundamental desires bring any Duco

200
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:19,260
so we'll talk a little bit more about that at some point but that is a kind of Desire

201
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:24,839
and then the Third Kind of Desire is that there are there are desires that

202
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:31,680
accompany trying to live a typical human life among other humans so we have the

203
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:36,839
wish to find livelihood we may have the wish to find a partner to be part of a

204
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:42,960
community to secure a place to live and to have enough food that's nutritious

205
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:49,740
and so forth and these desires I think we can say take a lot of energy and a lot of

206
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:54,859
attention and they're Myriad I don't think I can even name all of them

207
00:37:54,859 --> 00:38:00,200
relationships family life all these worldly desires all of our political

208
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:07,380
interests and so forth Gill has said that we should be called a human desirlings rather than human

209
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:13,920
beings because there's so much Desiring and doing involved in all of these

210
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:20,339
and these are often the desires that we will defend as being very necessary and

211
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:26,040
very normal and in some ways yes um of course of course we have to do

212
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:31,440
these things but this is a big realm for Dharma practice

213
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:38,339
because many of these are actually mild forms of what I called comma before the

214
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:44,240
world of sense desire and sense pleasure we don't have to have deep pathological

215
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:51,300
grasping in order to be somewhat enslaved to our sense desires

216
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,640
isn't that true so the Buddha aimed a notable amount of

217
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,820
his teaching about desire into this space and we'll talk about it more as

218
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:08,599
the week goes on you know the desires that go with being human

219
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:15,300
so then as we continue with this space or mandala of desires

220
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:21,660
the fourth one out of five uh we could call the more elevated human

221
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:27,900
wishes if we could if we can use that word so these are things like desire for

222
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:34,079
the well-being of others aspiring to be a better person wanting to learn to

223
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:39,780
meditate or to study spiritual teachings wanting a peaceful and happy life where

224
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:44,880
we care more about how we're living than about money or status

225
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,040
these are generally very good desires there can still be some delusion there

226
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:56,579
could be a cell for an ego behind them but some of these wishes can actually

227
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:01,619
serve our Spiritual Development and our ethical development and our development

228
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:09,119
of compassion so the the Buddha used are elevated desires as part of the path he

229
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:14,280
encouraged these kinds of skillful wishes in order to draw us along the

230
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:20,040
path so it's good to pay attention when we have these kinds of desires and don't

231
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,079
don't worry about them don't worry oh I'm not supposed to want anything if I'm

232
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:30,300
on the spiritual path some of these good desires are very helpful and they will

233
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:36,960
they will lead us along the path and then the the last kind of Desire

234
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:44,040
that I would it's kind of part of the fourth but I want to separate it out it's the most powerful expression of

235
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:50,460
spiritual desire which is the desire to awaken the desire to be free to be liberated

236
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:55,500
and this even within this one there are several different facets of it one word

237
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:02,099
for it is somewega often translated as spiritual urgency and there can be times

238
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:09,240
where that's an accurate term it can really feel urgent that we need to we need to wake up or we need to do

239
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:14,700
something to move toward Liberation it can have almost a grip to it except you

240
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:21,780
know but not not like the group of tanha but we could also so sometimes it doesn't quite have that urgency and the

241
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:28,560
wish to Awakening to awaken is captured more by a word like calling you know a

242
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:34,079
calling to practice or a deep sense in the heart of wanting to be free knowing

243
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:39,300
that there's something more than what we're seeing conventionally

244
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:47,099
something that we tap into that's deep in our heart so we have this range we have

245
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:55,460
on the one end one hand tanha grasping clinging and then you know the animal

246
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:03,060
desires of the body the wishes of a human life the elevated wishes toward ethics and

247
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:10,200
compassion and then this wish to Awakening and so although they aren't quite on the

248
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:17,060
linear Spectrum there is clearly a division of wholesome and unwholesome skillful and unskillful

249
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:22,319
that's definitely relevant as we look at these different kind of desires some are

250
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:29,220
blatantly painful we might still be succumbing to them you know but it's clear enough that they're

251
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:36,540
painful right um for others of these desires we're making choices you know we decide to put

252
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:43,020
up with the stress or struggle of them because we decide that the result is worth it

253
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:48,660
um there's a kind of a cost benefit analysis going on in our mind to maybe subconsciously

254
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:55,680
and the Buddha asks us to look very carefully in that realm we'll talk a little bit more about that

255
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:01,560
and then some of the desires are clearly helpful like Compassion or ethics but on

256
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:06,839
the other hand even though we know they're clearly helpful that doesn't mean we always do them does it

257
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:13,200
so there's a lot of potential here for training um it's a lot to learn about our mind

258
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:19,859
and our heart and a lot of good effort we can put in to releasing the ones that

259
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:25,680
are really binding us and doing more of the ones that are helpful and that are elevating us

260
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,720
but to do that effectively we're going to need some wisdom some clarity about

261
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:37,859
what is actually onward leading on the path and what is actually binding our heart up we're not always clear on that

262
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:43,740
as humans in this realm of Desire and then to complicate things a little

263
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:49,800
bit more it changes along the path so something may not really feel like a

264
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:56,700
burden or a hindrance to us at the beginning of the path some kind of Desire that we have doesn't feel uh so

265
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:04,560
so stressful because there are other more pressing issues that we're working on but then later we might start to feel

266
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:12,119
the contraction or the limitation of certain kinds of Desire that we didn't feel before we start to realize oh this

267
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:19,079
is more like attachment the cost-benefit analysis doesn't work for this one anymore and so we have to change as it

268
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:26,280
goes along so this is the space that we're in this week this space of desire and letting go

269
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:33,060
and tomorrow we're going to have a look at this kind of Desire that I call comma

270
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:39,720
sensual attraction or sensual desire and also the movement of mind that helps us

271
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:45,720
to restrain it or shape it in various ways

272
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:51,960
so I hope you'll want to continue Along on this adventure and

273
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:58,040
um thank you I will see you tomorrow be well
