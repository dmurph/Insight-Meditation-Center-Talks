1
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,320
warm greetings today from the inside meditation center

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,679
and here in Redwood City and

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:23,359
I have the Good Fortune of being able to go between these two wonderful meditation centers

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:32,119
and this is the kind of the Home Center happy to be back and happy to be with you here

5
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:39,540
and um so

6
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,360
people associate Buddhism with truth often What's called the Four Noble Truths

7
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,059
and sometimes put those at the center of Buddhist Buddhist teachings

8
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:59,520
and that's fine but uh in terms of practice what is repeated over and over again in

9
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,978
the teachings of the Buddha much more often than any reference to truth

10
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:10,619
uh which uh is um knowing and seeing

11
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,939
and perhaps knowing and seeing are meant to be a alternative way of talking about

12
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:23,640
knowing and seeing truth because you want we want to be able to see and know what's happening in our

13
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,200
direct experience and one of the things to distinguish is between

14
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,220
what's directly known directly seen

15
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,860
that we can really verify through our direct experience and what is our

16
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:47,700
interpretation what is the value you we put on something what's the meaning we assign

17
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,939
to it and how do we what do we what uh meaning

18
00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:00,540
do we assign it to ourselves or what do we what do we make up about ourselves in

19
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:07,039
relationship to experience and the interpretation the meaning the

20
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:12,480
purpose the value um they certainly have a place in this

21
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,540
world and practice it's important but we want to really see the difference

22
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,000
between the direct experience and the added layers we put on

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,120
and then we sit down to do meditation mindfulness meditation we want to

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,860
emphasize the directness what we can know what we can know directly

25
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,680
and it's possible to know directly that we are adding meaning we are adding

26
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,760
layers of interpretation we are adding values

27
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,860
judgments commentary projections into the future

28
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,660
associations of what we have in the past and there's layers and complexity of all

29
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:04,140
the stuff that we add that's extra and and even if it's has some value and

30
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:10,379
important to do so it's still not the same thing as direct experience

31
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:17,700
so when we sit we want to kind of become sensitive to this so that we can prioritize direct

32
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:24,540
experience when we're meditating after meditation there might be a time

33
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:32,720
for a deep contemplation deep reflection about meaning and purpose and and um

34
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,800
contextualizing what what's happened but for meditation we want to try to

35
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:43,620
keep it really simple as if the what we could know and see directly

36
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:51,120
that's the door forward uh in the Dharma that's where we can begin freeing

37
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:59,400
ourselves from the layers of reactivity free yourselves from the layer of of

38
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:06,780
uh cloudiness the filters through which we see uh it's the way in which we could see

39
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,819
more clearly what's happening and in doing so become wiser

40
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:17,100
so in this meditation you might um you know

41
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:24,479
do the basic meditation mindfulness of breathing being here in the present moment

42
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:31,139
but keep an eye out from the difference between the Simplicity of the direct experience

43
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:38,639
and what we add to it meaning interpretation even something as simple as

44
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,280
you know are we at the end yet or boy this is

45
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,500
taking a long time or um or Gill is talking a lot

46
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:57,060
all that is commentary and there's nothing wrong but necessarily but uh oh there's the

47
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:03,600
commentary this is not the direct experience the immediacy of it is just like Gail

48
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,620
talking just a voice talking and um and the sound happening

49
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:16,320
uh the breathing as you breathe and if your mind wanders off a lot

50
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,900
the idea that I'm a poor meditator that's an interpretation that's a

51
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,360
made-up layer on top of it it might have and and um

52
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,419
the immediacy what we can see directly this is so simple and sometimes and this

53
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:39,720
is the relief that can come from it is so simple that we're freed

54
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:46,820
from the weight of these interpretations so the mind wanders off a lot in thought

55
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:52,500
then we see oh the mind is wandering off it's that simple

56
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,840
and uh even the idea that it's doing it a lot

57
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,060
means that we it's higher level of interpretation based on history based on

58
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:08,580
what we remember the repetition of it all at the moment what we can see and know

59
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,860
the mind is involved in thinking let's bring it back

60
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:21,539
that simple can be a relief so to become sensitive to

61
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:25,520
how you leave direct experience

62
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:33,360
and then return to what can be known and seen known and perceived directly Here

63
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,259
and Now so assuming a meditation posture

64
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,520
and

65
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:54,120
the beginning of knowing and seeing directly in our own experience

66
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,360
is to do so in our physical posture maybe moving around a little bit

67
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:07,620
twisting rocking a little bit to really feel and sense ourselves into

68
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:14,000
an aligned balance good posture

69
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,240
slowly closing the eyes

70
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:49,280
and as already now just sitting here like this are you telling yourself

71
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,539
stories interpretation about what's happening how it is for you and how you are and

72
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:09,720
are you judging or you're evaluating are you interpreting

73
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:17,759
even if it's accurate it is not the same thing as direct experience

74
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:24,020
if we're seeing through the lens of those interpretations

75
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:37,020
if we see interpretation as interpretation then we're back to the world of direct

76
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,680
knowing

77
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,779
and then gently taking some long slow deep breaths

78
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,240
relaxing on the exhale

79
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:27,360
letting the breathing return to normal and continue to relax on the exhale

80
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,240
anywhere in the body where you feel holding

81
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,700
and then centering yourself on your breathing

82
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:55,800
the direct experience of an inhale knowing how it's felt and known

83
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,940
through the body

84
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:13,399
knowing and seeing knowing perceiving the exhale

85
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,639
as it's known in the body

86
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:37,640
and now their thoughts or feelings that interpret react

87
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,540
assign meaning or

88
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,200
a sign of future

89
00:11:53,339 --> 00:12:00,140
and if so recognize it as such

90
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:09,260
and come back taking refuge in the direct experience

91
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,520
foreign

92
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,900
when you are more involved in thinking than with breathing

93
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:14,940
chances are as you're involved in the story making mind the interpretive mind

94
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:21,660
the planning mind you're involved

95
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:30,860
you've lost the touch with the breathing the direct experience perception

96
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:41,840
and then with whatever with whatever energy or capacity you have to think

97
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:50,419
direct it instead to knowing and perceiving breathing

98
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:03,020
if you're telling stories or interpretations or

99
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:10,919
thinking about something perhaps it's something deep inside that

100
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:16,440
needs to be reassured it's okay

101
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:22,980
for now and then to find a refuge

102
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:30,559
a place of safety for a few minutes in the Simplicity of direct experience

103
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,600
here breathing your body

104
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:41,760
just knowing what is actually happening here

105
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:46,460
without story interpretation

106
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,500
and then as we come to the end of the meditation

107
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:40,940
how simply can you now

108
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,440
open your heart to The Wider world

109
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:52,260
open your thoughts to simply know

110
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:58,100
or sends or have a general idea of the people of your life

111
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:06,799
people you know the people you don't know people you'll learn about today or meet

112
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:14,159
and to perhaps aspire

113
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,340
to the best of your ability to know them directly

114
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:26,240
without the lens of our interpretations and stories and

115
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,700
judgments values meaning

116
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:39,120
Futures and pasts just to be with a person in their basic

117
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,240
simple way Humanity of the moment

118
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,480
and to have good will

119
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:04,320
to wish them well the kind of Wellness

120
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:11,520
simple safety stability contentment

121
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,100
we're being happy being well

122
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:21,500
brings out the best in people

123
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:31,340
may all beings be happy

124
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:36,200
may all beings be safe

125
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:42,260
may all beings be peaceful

126
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:47,240
may all beings be free

127
00:29:48,899 --> 00:29:55,399
and may it be that the way that we are together with others

128
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:05,340
makes it more likely for them to feel some happiness and safety

129
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:10,220
some peace some freedom

130
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,039
may we be a refuge for others

131
00:30:23,310 --> 00:30:32,680
[Music]

132
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:40,460
thank you

133
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:52,260
hello everyone and here we have the third talk on the

134
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:58,220
Dharma of challenges and

135
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:08,240
maybe in some ways life is one continuous challenge with little interludes between them

136
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:13,500
and so learning to be with challenges learning to be wise about them and find

137
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:20,299
our way through them in an effective way is a very important part of Dharma practice

138
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,860
so Dharma has different meanings in today's

139
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:33,960
meaning that the third meaning that I've listed before is Dharma as truth

140
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:43,559
and what we mean by truth is very important to consider and and one of the simplest ones that I

141
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:49,200
like a lot is um mindfulness is a practice of

142
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:55,440
truth-telling that the truth means that we're honest and um

143
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,200
that uh honesty is basically truth out loud

144
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,240
or truth that we discover is to be honest

145
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,960
with ourselves and whether we should be verbally honest and truthful about everything we

146
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,659
experience is questionable since sometimes truth can hurt people

147
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:23,760
but we always want to be truthful towards ourselves we're really honest to

148
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,880
learn how to be honest and um we are honest with ourselves

149
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:36,299
and so how do we learn to do that how do we learn to stop and take a

150
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:41,640
moment or take time to really recognize how we are and what's happening for us

151
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:47,220
the truth of how we feel and one of the important really

152
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:54,299
important things to learn this quest for truth and to honesty is to be able to distinguish between our

153
00:33:54,299 --> 00:34:01,940
direct experience and the interpret interpretations we add to it the layers of meaning making

154
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:08,099
judgments commentary value that we add on top of things

155
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:14,460
the time that we add on top of things for example if this continues this will

156
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:22,980
end up some terrible way this means that you know terrible things will happen or passed this is just like what

157
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:28,020
happened before and uh and therefore I know what this is about

158
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:33,300
so some of that layers of meaning making and thoughts and interpretations that we

159
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:39,599
have are appropriate and wise to do but it's also a place where we get into

160
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:47,339
tremendous trouble and when we have challenges in our life the chances are fairly high that the

161
00:34:47,339 --> 00:34:54,720
interpretive story making mind predictive mind value mind judgment mind

162
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,660
um uh is operating more strongly than usual

163
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:06,599
it kind of makes sense we have a challenge we're difficult and so what does this mean for me you know how do I

164
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:12,599
find my way out and what's wrong here I have to understand what's happening so it makes sense that we get into that

165
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:18,000
mode but the interpretive meaning making story making mode

166
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:27,540
is a fair amount of time is inaccurate it doesn't have the full picture it generalizes it it uh it uh

167
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:33,599
settles in a particular interpretation a particular aspect of what's Happening sometimes it has blinders on it doesn't

168
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:38,940
see the Fuller picture sometimes we don't really depending on

169
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:45,780
what the challenge is we don't see ourselves fully and one of the ways to learn to

170
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:51,060
distinguish between really see or this is an interpretation this is an added

171
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:56,220
layer maybe it has some accuracy some truth to it maybe it's something that we

172
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:01,560
have to principle or an idea that I need to somehow take into account and act on

173
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:09,900
but it is an interpretation is a story it's an added thing and so to take the time to see that then

174
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:16,619
we have more ability to have choice and clarity about what we're doing

175
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:23,540
so that if we have a challenge with another person if we can say

176
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:28,800
you know something what happened what you said yesterday was very difficult

177
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,800
for me and part of the reason it was so difficult is I understood it to be or

178
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:42,420
interpreted to be uh you were angry with me as soon as you say I understand it or I

179
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:50,880
interpret it I add you know that's how I understood it there's a little bit more room for it not to be dogmatic you were

180
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,640
angry but rather to let the other person participate than explain well I was

181
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,760
irritated but I was also really scared and then you get a bigger picture of what's going on

182
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,040
so to be able to know to hold and see something a little bit more

183
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:13,380
provisionally when we know it's an interpretation or

184
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:18,839
story or as opposed to what's happening to us directly

185
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:24,420
also when we are challenged with other people or with ourselves even to

186
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:30,839
perceive the direct experience as a direct experience gives us a a much

187
00:37:30,839 --> 00:37:37,440
very important reference point for how to go forward or what needs care needs to be made so if someone was angry with you

188
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:46,260
yesterday and the direct experience is because of that you feel hurt

189
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,780
and you have a tendency to maybe when you're hurt to be angry back

190
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:57,119
and be in the attack mode and so but if you what was the direct

191
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:03,540
experience what happened to me oh yes uh I was hurt

192
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:09,420
and and now I'm in the attack mode or yes I was hurt and now I'm trying to

193
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:15,599
run away or I'm afraid or I'm sad

194
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,420
and um and then also when you know that information then you can begin looking

195
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:28,440
at well given that I'm hurt or afraid or sad or angry what what do I practice

196
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:34,440
with that how do I be with it how do I be with it so I don't act reactively

197
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:41,280
how do I be with it so that I'm caring for myself because sometimes when we react to

198
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,680
challenges um then we often lose ourselves in that process

199
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:52,099
so in so to take time to find out what's true here what's a direct experience

200
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:58,260
what's what's the direct experience and what's the interpretation or the story that I'm telling

201
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:06,119
and but stories are important and so one of the interesting things to do is uh when

202
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:13,079
there's challenges is to tell the story but uh maybe to a neutral party

203
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:19,200
can I tell you how I understood this what happened tell you the story and what happened

204
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:26,520
and some of the story will be accurate and sometimes here and you said you say it in a neutral way and and having it

205
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:32,520
kind of the taking the pressure off the the bottled upness of the story and the

206
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:37,680
feelings by telling the story gives us more clarity of what's going on

207
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:44,760
and um and one of the ways to tell the story is to tell it to yourself some people Journal about it

208
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,920
and then it's interesting to journal because it's a there's a record now of what you what you're thinking what

209
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:56,359
you're interpreting and illness it's possible then to go back and reread it and much better understand where the

210
00:39:56,359 --> 00:40:01,680
interpretation is where the story is where the story making is the values the

211
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:07,740
all the things we add to the the basic raw story The Raw Story versus how we

212
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:15,000
are interpreting it and um and also uh the way we think

213
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,300
and the way that we write or the way that we speak sometimes pools are a different part of the Mind

214
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:27,599
and one interesting way of doing seeing this maybe is that maybe when you're dry sometime

215
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:34,920
when you're alone um uh speak out loud to yourself to speak about what's happening around the

216
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:41,280
challenge out loud and uh and maybe in speaking about it out loud rather than it ruminating in

217
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,980
the mind uh you'll find a different relationship to it maybe you're speaking from a

218
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:53,880
different place you understand more your reactivity or you understand more your place of wisdom you're more likely to

219
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:59,579
come and maybe in speaking out loud you can it's clear it's clarified much more

220
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:04,740
what's happening for you and maybe you'll find your way with it

221
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:11,280
so all this is a way of being honest about being truthful the truth of what's

222
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:17,460
directly happening and to know that what that means direct immediate seeing and

223
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:23,520
knowing uh and the truth of oh this is one of the story I'm telling myself about it

224
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,760
this is how I'm interpreting it this is how uh the values I put on it the

225
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:36,240
meaning I put on it the predictions of the future I put on it the this is what

226
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:41,640
I I dredge up from the past to include as part of this what's happening

227
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:49,260
and um and the truth of seeing what you're doing in the mind with all this is invaluable

228
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:54,960
this means that hopefully the challenges we have they're not crises of the moment

229
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,839
but if there's you know it's ongoing in some enough way that we can take time out

230
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:06,180
uh ask reality if we're a little time out to go meditate to go journal to go

231
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:11,520
for a walk to spend some time with a neutral friend and just really kind of

232
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:17,900
begin discovering what is really the truth here versus what is the interpretation

233
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:23,820
what is really the direct experience interpretation does have a role

234
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:28,940
but if we know its interpretation then as I said earlier we can

235
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:37,578
say that when we're in conversation with people and then there's much more space to maneuver and find a way

236
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:43,859
and um truth is uh makes us uncomfortable you

237
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:49,200
know it's much much more comfortable sometimes to oddly enough to be caught up in our

238
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:56,820
interpretations our meaning making our anger our blame our fear than it is to stop and really feel it to know it and

239
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:02,099
be present for our direct experience but that's what we're trying to do in this Dharma practice this kind of

240
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:08,960
truthfulness about what's actually happening here and um

241
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:15,180
and uh and then also to put ourselves in situations

242
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:21,359
where we're more likely to kind of pop the bubble of our interpretations and

243
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:27,660
our stories and what I mean by this is sometimes I've I've had difficulties with other people like I'm angry with

244
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:33,240
them or something and I've learned that my mind thinks

245
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:38,579
about the other person I don't think so accurately about the person when I'm

246
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:45,540
angry towards them and so I've learned that it's really important to go find the person and be

247
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:52,619
in conversation with them because that pops the bubble of the projections the meaning the interpretations that my mind

248
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:57,900
is making up around the anger and um it's much safer for me much safer

249
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:03,740
for the other person if we can meet and have this uh you know

250
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:09,720
direct experience of each other rather than being involved in this a whole other

251
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:16,680
world of of uh meaning making story making interpretations

252
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:23,339
so um so today if you want to kind of explore

253
00:44:23,339 --> 00:44:31,520
these ideas in your daily life is ask reality for a timeout

254
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:36,780
and it could be a minute it could be five minutes it could be depending what's going on and might be a need

255
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:43,740
longer in order to go for a walk meditate Journal do something that you

256
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:51,119
begin asking what's true here what's true in the direct experience and what is interpretation

257
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:56,579
oh oh that's an interpretation that statement that's an interpretation

258
00:44:56,579 --> 00:45:04,200
is a statement of Truth oh it's true that that's an interpretation that's a judgment that's a meaning making that's

259
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:11,700
oh that's what my mind is doing that's how I'm relating to all this and maybe it's really important to see

260
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:18,420
it clearly that's what you're doing maybe you'll see that it's false maybe you'll see that you have to take

261
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:23,880
this into account and act accordingly but to know clearly oh this is what's

262
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:30,060
happening this is what's happening is one of the really important ways to work with challenges

263
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:36,240
in the in the long term to get a skill of doing this makes all challenges a lot

264
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:44,339
easier so um thank you very much and we'll continue on this

265
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:46,880
theme tomorrow
