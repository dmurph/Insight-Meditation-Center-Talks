1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:08,400
so warm greetings at the beginning of our week and I

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:16,800
am happy to be here and uh and to be able to share this

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:24,800
wonderful practice that we have and a practice that has been um one of

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,119
the most uh constant

5
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:38,520
source of gratitude and appreciation for my adult life it's uh the regularity of

6
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,840
meditating for all these years is a through line it's a thread that runs through the life and and forms the life

7
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,039
and uh it's a reference point for my lived life that has been

8
00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:00,239
invaluable so thank you for this opportunity to be here with you all

9
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,359
and

10
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,520
um

11
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:27,920
so so there's a famous line in po poems called the four

12
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:35,960
quartets by TSL it that goes something like teach me to care and not to

13
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:44,040
care and to oriented towards what we're doing today teach me that I'm important and

14
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,399
not important the

15
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,840
um so by and not important

16
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,959
is not that we're unimportant but rather we often see ourselves as important in the wrong

17
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:16,080
ways we see ourselves as important enough to be attached to our ideas of

18
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,400
who we are attached to ourselves clinging to ourselves clinging to

19
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,680
life and uh sometimes that attachment is negative and so sometimes we treat

20
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,800
ourselves with less respect and care than we would our house plants there's a

21
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,360
lot of uh struggles that people have with their identity with who they are

22
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:47,200
and criticizing themselves feeling inadequate in some way and one of the symptoms of that is

23
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,519
not seeing ourselves as important as valuable and then the other hand people

24
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:01,640
will have too much conceit and too uh filled with their self-importance

25
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,959
so it's the importance that we assign ourselves negative importance positive

26
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:17,840
importance the way they were important enough to judge and hold on to ideas that I mean by teach teach us to

27
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,480
to be not important and then the to teach us that

28
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:31,159
we're important to know we're important is to know that independent

29
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:37,640
of our attachments that we can see the

30
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,319
world without attachments we can see the world with

31
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:49,879
kindness independent of our

32
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:07,159
we can have a heart that feels deeply and caringly for the others and

33
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:14,200
ourselves and when we see ourselves as important enough that who we are how we

34
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:21,000
act how we live in the world can bring into the world the absence of attachment

35
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,039
the absence of hate and greed that we can bring kindness and

36
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:33,520
goodness then we can also begin seeing that we are

37
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:40,520
important that each individual is phenomenally important and Buddhist premise is that

38
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:46,360
we are important enough that we can dedicate ourselves to a path of

39
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,720
practice it's invaluable to engage in a practice like it's invaluable to give it

40
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:58,080
one's lifetime to doing it uh because we're

41
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:06,039
important and it's important important enough we're important enough to learn to let go of what

42
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:12,360
diminishes our Humanity our value and all that which often has which sometimes

43
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:17,919
has to do with our attachments to self or conceit around self positive or

44
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,680
negative conceit so to

45
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:31,080
meditate as if or because we are are as important as any

46
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:38,360
other person important enough for our respect important enough to

47
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,319
feel meditate in a in a field of

48
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,160
worthiness for this

49
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,600
practice with confidence so to assume a meditation

50
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,600
posture

51
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:10,360
and classically a meditation meditation is meant to be done in a posture of

52
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,199
dignity and there are four dignified postures

53
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:24,039
they say lying down sitting standing and

54
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:31,479
walking whichever one of those four postures you think will work best for you for this next

55
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:37,479
now 25 minutes

56
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:44,319
please assume a dignified posture that you feel allows your body

57
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:53,240
your inner most life to reveal itself to

58
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,319
you in its dignity in its worthiness

59
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,080
as if it your your life your inner life is

60
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,039
important closing your eyes and gently in a way that's right for

61
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:25,919
you take some longer slower deeper breaths and relax on the exhale

62
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:57,199
maybe on a deeper inhale to have it be a filling of

63
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,800
yourself with a sense

64
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:10,720
of presence value certainty that here you are an

65
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,479
important person engaged in this practice

66
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,560
letting your breathing return to

67
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,839
normal and feel where in your body

68
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:03,959
the inhale

69
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:14,240
begins maybe even a particular spot where the first little inkling of

70
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:21,360
sensation appears for an instant and then expands and spreads as

71
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,920
you breathe in

72
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:48,680
and perhaps you can allow the place where the inhale begins be a place that's free of any way

73
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:57,399
in which you diminish yourself diminish your value and importance

74
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,600
and maybe instead be the

75
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,360
opposite a location with which you can view yourself as least as important as

76
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,800
any other person on this planet you yourself are a valuable

77
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,640
person a human being

78
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:37,320
and as you inhale let that sense of dignity value

79
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,360
importance grow and spread throughout your

80
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:03,360
body and then as you exhale let yourself relax

81
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,560
into a sense of embodied value and

82
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:18,000
respect so that your thinking becomes quieter any self-criticisms or

83
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,800
self-doubts quiet on the exhale

84
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,560
inhaling and exhaling be like

85
00:11:52,680 --> 00:12:00,639
a central a center for all things that

86
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:07,680
occur to you a central resting place being

87
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:17,680
place that reminds you of your own importance important

88
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,839
enough to let the thinking mind become quieter and

89
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:32,120
Stiller maybe a relief from the

90
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,120
fragmentation of discursive

91
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
thought

92
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
for

93
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
for

94
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
for

95
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,000
e for

96
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,880
for

97
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

98
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,679
e for

99
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:33,120
to be present here here in this body with every

100
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:39,720
breath as if here your lived experience

101
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:48,720
now is the place in which to experience

102
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,880
your tremendous importance your dignity your value

103
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,120
and that

104
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:12,000
mindfulness is a way of making room for each thing that

105
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:20,679
occurs within you as an expression of your

106
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:33,880
value that softens all the ways that we diminish ourselves criticize

107
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,480
ourselves not opposed to those

108
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:50,200
Tendencies but creating the conditions that those can

109
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:56,880
relax relax into our fundamental importance

110
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
en

111
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

112
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

113
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

114
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

115
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

116
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,278
for e

117
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:22,760
and then as we come to the end of this sitting to

118
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:29,840
consider how when we're present with others with a simp simple

119
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,520
unattached sense of personal dignity

120
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:43,640
value where we don't diminish ourselves with SH shyness with feeling

121
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:49,600
unworthy don't diminish ourselves by not wanting to be trouble for other

122
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:58,640
people where we show up with a nonassertive Clarity of attention

123
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:05,799
then when we engage with others we can meet them more

124
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:11,480
fully and our kindness can be transmitted more clearly

125
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,799
our friendliness has more

126
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:23,679
clarity our generosity more impact

127
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:36,080
then if we diminish ourselves with half

128
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,840
withdrawal so imagine yourself going into this world today into your

129
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,760
life with a nonassertive uprightness

130
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:58,360
dignity we're part of your gift to the world is the

131
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:07,600
full way in which you appear non assertively but non

132
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:15,919
submissively you appear with a kind of personal dignity and value and

133
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:23,480
importance through which you can convey the dignity and value of

134
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:34,320
others the fullness of your presence for others indication that you value

135
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:40,360
them as they are without needing

136
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:47,559
to exchange or get anything from others or want them to be

137
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:55,440
different in our own dignity our kindness can spread more

138
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:03,880
widely and deeply into the world May our personal dignity be the

139
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:10,320
source of wishing others well promoting the welfare and happiness

140
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,880
of Others May all beings be

141
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:24,480
happy may all beings be safe may all beings be

142
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:29,960
peaceful may all beings be free

143
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:40,240
and may our personal dignity show that that is possible

144
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:52,859
[Music]

145
00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:04,949
thank you [Music]

146
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:47,120
So today we're at the halfway point through the 10

147
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:53,919
Reflections that um are Central

148
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:59,120
to can be Central to the offering of spiritual care

149
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:05,519
and I like to think of it as spiritual care to oneself as much as it is to

150
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:13,480
others and to wish ourselves well to care for ourselves in a deep way allows

151
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,559
us to care for others and one of the phenomenally

152
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:24,240
important roles of people who offer spiritual care to others chaplains and

153
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:30,600
clergy and monastics and Buddhist

154
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:36,559
teachers is to um uh is

155
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:42,559
to convey to others their dign dignity their value their

156
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,919
importance to be dignifi what a great role it is to be

157
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:53,480
able to be a dignifi of other people I think of that is being an affirmation of

158
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:00,320
others a deep appreciation of others to recognize what is is wonderful about

159
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:08,159
others and not enough people have been seeing uh uh in valuable ways have been

160
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:14,120
really seen with respect and care as we grow up the mirroring of

161
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:20,679
people who respect us and care for us is invaluable sometime people you know love

162
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:27,519
us or they say they love us they think they love us but the love is so entangled with control with wanting us

163
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:34,120
to a certain way with making us safe and protecting us that there's no room for

164
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:40,440
us to kind of stand on our own two feet and be fully ourselves in a clear and

165
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:46,760
full way the excessive parenting sometimes gets in the way of having room

166
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:54,720
for us to be recognized and seen as autonomous as being as having

167
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,240
agency and so uh to dignify others but

168
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,480
we can do that better if we know that uh we have a sense of our own dignity and

169
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:11,919
so dignity is the six of the 10 Reflections and maybe you'd prefer a

170
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:17,679
different word for than dignity uh it could be worth self-worth

171
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,720
self-importance it could be respect uh maybe there's other kind of

172
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:31,158
synonyms for this territory as well I like the word respect a lot myself that we have a deep respect for

173
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:36,638
ourselves and yes you I say often that I like the word respect because it kind of

174
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:45,200
means in Latin Latin origins of it to see again to have enough uh valuing of

175
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:53,079
others and ourselves that we give a second look we make space to really get to know somebody ourselves other people

176
00:34:53,079 --> 00:35:00,160
the situation we respect it so let's get to know it more uh respect is not the diminishing

177
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:05,720
diminishing of ourselves it's not a sub submiss ourselves or lowering ourselves

178
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:12,119
in order to hold someone else up um respect is um with all our dignity and

179
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:17,960
respect and value importance with that offer others respect and in a maybe in a

180
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:25,480
kind of American way to see each other as equals to meet as

181
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:31,000
equals um one of the profound way ways in which I was trained in Zen practice

182
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:38,599
is that the relationship between a teacher and a student was supposed to grow into uh a time when uh when they

183
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:43,839
met it was the meeting of Buddha and Buddha only in the meeting of a Buddha

184
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:49,720
and Buddha as the practice comes to fulfillment and so this the the mutual

185
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:55,400
respect and kind of dignity and value that was built into kind of cultivating

186
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:01,000
as Zen student teacher relationship uh was um very impactful for me this idea

187
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,040
that we meet uh with that kind of care and love and respect as if we were

188
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:14,440
mutually me Buddhas meeting each other so um to there's uh so in the

189
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:20,920
reflection about res respect and dignity self-importance it might be useful to

190
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:26,680
begin uh to really understand all the ways in which we do the opposite all the

191
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:33,960
ways in which we do not maintain our dignity we give it up all the ways we do not respect ourselves there's actually

192
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:41,200
disrespect all the ways in which we feel unworthy some of that is learned from

193
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:48,359
the world around us that uh we internalize people's um projections and

194
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:55,880
opinions and ideas that we're unimportant that we have to be different um and so sometimes uh growing

195
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:01,839
into our dignity is to is like a snake shedding its skin so we have to shed all

196
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:08,079
these inherited views and opinions that we received from family our religions

197
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:15,319
our society so that we can take a stand we can take our seat in a full and clear

198
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:21,599
and dignified way also uh we have to understand that

199
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:29,119
the difference between uh dignity and conceit how that uh uh how and we have

200
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,240
over importance for ourselves that we we are asserting ourselves think it has to

201
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,839
be my way and you know and I have to be the one who has my 15 minutes of fame

202
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:46,680
and and um and somehow we're projecting ourselves to the world uh because we

203
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:54,880
want to be seen in a certain way and re and held up in a certain way and praised in a certain way um so both diminishing

204
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,400
ourselves and overvaluing ourselves um should be understood deeply and

205
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:07,960
clearly and so that's part of the value of mindfulness practice that as we learn to stay in the present moment to see the

206
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:14,480
operating systems that areer operating for us not only do we see it but we also

207
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,400
more importantly we see the cost of it we see how life gets drained from us

208
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:26,599
when we diminish ourselves we see how we fragment ourselves and stress ourselves

209
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:31,720
through conceit overdoing it for ourselves we lose part of

210
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:38,079
ourselves and now so as we begin understanding the ways in which we the

211
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:45,520
the problems of the different forms of absence of dignity um then we can maybe begin

212
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,880
understanding something about the middle way of a kind of dignity and respect and

213
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,960
value that allows ourselves to be to really inhabit ourselves really be here

214
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,920
fully and clearly without anxiety without fear without

215
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:10,800
assertion without um diminishing yourselves or feeling

216
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,079
unworthy and uh but to do it in a simple very peaceful way no one no one has to

217
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,599
be afraid of us and I've met people who conventionally seemed

218
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:28,720
somewhat um I don't know what to say that's respectful for them but maybe I can willing can say somewhat Meek and

219
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,200
quiet and gentle people and uh the last last people I

220
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:40,319
would be concerned about that they thought they were going to be overpowering for others and somehow they

221
00:39:40,319 --> 00:39:47,640
live concerned that they're going to do that very thing overpowered be too strong for people too much for people

222
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,800
and I don't know what the psychological dynamics of that combination is but uh I

223
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:57,839
think uh we ideally we want to have a

224
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:04,720
society of strong people and some of us could do well to develop a sense of

225
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,520
strength to grow up in a certain way and but not diminish ourselves for people

226
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:16,680
who are gentle or maybe even difficult uh Meek or something but to find a way

227
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:22,640
to support them to see them with dignity so to help them grow and uh so they also

228
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:29,560
can be strong and if we feel for ourselves that we are are

229
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:37,560
somehow I don't know we too much for people uh maybe that's a time for a lot

230
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:44,599
of attention and study what's really going on there and maybe sometimes it's useful to really recruit friends and

231
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:51,680
family to get feedback how do this work for me am I too much sometimes we are

232
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:57,880
and so maybe we have something to learn sometimes we're not and we have something else to learn but to learn how

233
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:05,040
we navigate in the world and the impact we have on other people um and and and and to be mirrored

234
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:11,560
by other people to understand our who we are and how we operate so that we can

235
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:17,680
find that middle way of dignity the middle way of um

236
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:24,880
where we can stand upright and strong without assertion without being overbearing and

237
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:31,200
without being under bearing so the idea of dignity follows in a

238
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:37,680
sense grows out of these earlier Reflections that when we have a sense when we know what we have a sense of

239
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:44,119
meaning and purpose when we have agency and we can act on it um when we have a

240
00:41:44,119 --> 00:41:51,640
sense of autonomy uh and uh and a strong sense of identity we know who we are all these

241
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:57,800
build on each other support each other so that when we feel our dignity

242
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:04,680
it arises out of knowing ourselves well it arises out of um

243
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:11,720
knowing a purpose a value in our life what's most important and from the Buddhist point of

244
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:19,760
view uh we we develop our dignity not because we're inherently human as as if

245
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:25,960
inherent Humanity of everyone is worthy of our respect and and reverence which

246
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:33,400
it might be I don't want to say it's not but that's not the Buddha's orientation I think the Buddha's orientation is that

247
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:38,920
um our dignity is something that we live it's how we live in the world how we

248
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:44,400
speak how we act how we even how we think and so that's why the earlier

249
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:51,280
Reflections are so important to really have reflected on what is a meaningful way to live what's a meaningful purpose

250
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:58,640
to live what is our ability to act and to do rather than just sit back and rest

251
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:06,800
in some kind of inherent goodness what is the way of of uh discovering a healthy autonomy

252
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,880
that then allows us to grow into a kind of dignified sense of

253
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:21,280
humanity that grows as we know learn how to uh that who we are uh has a lot to do

254
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:29,079
with how we act how we live our life um and so we try to live our life with

255
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:35,680
freedom with generosity with love with compassion with care and um and then

256
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:43,359
start inhabiting a fuller place here on this planet so I hope that these words um

257
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:49,359
make sense and appropriate for you and um if somehow it didn't quite work for

258
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:56,800
you um I hope at least that these words these ideas about dignity and value uh

259
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,160
is Catalyst for you to really reflect deeply for yourself how this works for

260
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:09,400
you how does uh how do you uh live with a healthy kind of self-importance

261
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:16,640
and how do you avoid unhealthy forms of self-importance and how can you tap into

262
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:24,240
your Healthy sense of self-respect in order to

263
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:29,800
support the creation of a better world for all of us starting with the people near

264
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:39,400
us so if I was off track it's your task to if you'd like to

265
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,839
do a course correction and find how it works for you most valuably for you and

266
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:50,079
hopefully in that process of finding that for yourself that you um have some

267
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:56,559
wonderful conversations with friends and family around this topic of dignity and

268
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:04,720
respect than self-importance so um thank you and

269
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:10,640
um I look forward to continue this series tomorrow
