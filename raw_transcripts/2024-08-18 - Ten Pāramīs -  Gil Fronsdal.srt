1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:07,160
good morning everyone and welcome and today I'd like to talk as an

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:13,160
introductory talk of sorts of uh something is called the parames in the

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,960
ancient P language and uh one of the meanings in it's often translated to

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,000
English is as the Perfections which is a dangerous word for some of

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,119
us and um but uh the word also means something which is kind of ultimate or

6
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:35,800
fantastic and um and there are 10 of these 10 parames so I'm going to go talk about

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,120
these 10 and some of you might be already disappointed because here we go

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,280
one more Buddhist list Buddhism has a lot of lists and

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:55,359
there's actually books of lists lists of lists and um and uh but uh I think it's

10
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:01,760
reasonable to be somehow discouraged by all the lists that exists in Buddhism and until you understand their

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,880
purpose and part of their purpose is that uh they're describing some aspect

12
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:15,400
of the Ecology of the heart mind the the the natural processes that operate as we

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,720
practice the Dharma that get awakened and move through us and develop over

14
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:27,600
time and the metaphors that Buddha uses for this growth are all organic metaphors of the the growth of a tree or

15
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,439
a plant that flow and develop in contrast to what is made

16
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:41,520
synthetically so we don't build up the Dharma we don't build a practice like you build a house or or make synthetic

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,960
Products plastic or something but uh it's more like a gardener that allow something to grow to develop and so

18
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,000
you're supporting something to happen and so these 10 parames these 10

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,920
Perfections are natural qualities capacities that we have that we can uh

20
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:06,719
we that we can grow that can develop and they grow most specifically when they are rooted or

21
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:14,599
connected to compassion and Liberation to care for the world and a sense of

22
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:20,239
non- clinging not holding on tight to things and in fact that's what kind of

23
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:28,000
defines them as Perfections when they have an intimate connection to compassion and Liberation they both

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,319
support the development growth of compassion and Liberation and they're an

25
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:40,680
expression of compassion and Liberation in the world and uh when I was in Burma a

26
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:46,440
common uh statement among some of the meditation teachers there was that if

27
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,480
someone was having challenges in their spiritual life they would say oh that

28
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,120
person hasn't developed all the enough of the parames or someone has a really

29
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,200
easy time which maybe once in a million it happens in in Buddhist practice

30
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,360
they'll say oh that person really has already had the parames in place and so

31
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,159
because they were there the person you know was able to practice quickly or

32
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:18,720
something so I want to talk a little bit more about this this organic process um

33
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,440
it's like a if you ever been through a forest after a forest fire it can be sad

34
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:30,840
devastating to see everything charred in Black uh burnt and um but how quickly

35
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,400
I've seen in some some areas how quickly sometimes within months um life comes

36
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,480
back and uh things start getting green again some of the trees if they haven't died will Leaf out some of the plants in

37
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,959
the understory begin to appear and um and then uh if some person comes along

38
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:56,400
and says well it's not supposed those those things that are coming back there those plants that are growing now that's

39
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,239
not the those are not the forest trees we want the forest trees to be to be way it was before so they cut cut away the

40
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:10,319
things that are growing up um you're actually preventing the return of the forest because there's a natural process

41
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,239
by which um succession of plants will appear after a forest fire each of them

42
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:23,080
kind of preparing the ground for the next succession of plants until the forest returns there's a natural

43
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,560
succession and a botanist who's following this might make a list of 10

44
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,240
different successive plants and we don't complain like oh 10 plants one one after the other but actually oh

45
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:42,520
they recognize oh this is how it grows this is how develops one succeeds the other until we're back at maybe in 20 30

46
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:50,720
50 100 years we're back into the forest that that burnt when I um uh lived at uh I lived

47
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,479
at Green Gulch s center it's in M Beach m m Valley which is um near M Woods in

48
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:04,120
in Marin County and um uh the San Francisco Zen Center bought the place in

49
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:11,400
19 I'll tell you the full story because this amazing succession we're we're all living succession of amazing things who

50
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:17,720
knows why what we have is here because of today uh there was a man named George

51
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,600
wiri who invented the Polaroid camera long ago I don't know they have any more

52
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,919
they make them anymore they do so so uh polar camera and so you can imagine got

53
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:36,160
a little bit wealthy so he bought a huge Ranch in the

54
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,199
Marine headlines and and ran it as a ranch maybe kind of like a I don't know what

55
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:48,319
they call a gentleman farmer or something for a while I don't know if he did this or the previous ranchers did it

56
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:55,520
but they cut direct channels down the down the valley to so there wouldn't be this mandering River Creek that went

57
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,880
through because they they wanted to make fields and farms and they kind of of rectified the the rectified they kind of

58
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,080
changed the wetlands that were down near the beach where the two Creeks came together and they kind of made again

59
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:17,160
probably deeper channels and made a canal and then they put pumps in the in the uh in the canals and they had Fields

60
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:24,280
down there and they grew plants and they had horses and cows and hay and all kinds of things at some point uh he

61
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:31,199
decided to sell it all he was getting older and he sold most of it to the

62
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:37,400
Golden Gate natural Recreation Area so the state the national park system and

63
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:43,639
but the the the actual Farm itself he wanted to go some good place and he sold

64
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,680
it to San Francisco's end center it's a remarkable thing to have this Buddhist

65
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:56,199
center in the merid Headlands this beautiful property and they were able to kind of now have this very thriving uh

66
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:01,479
Buddhist Retreat Center uh in this beautiful place that was

67
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:07,240
1972 and I came there Liv there first in 1979 and it was very much like had what

68
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,000
had been and I me remember I used to help with the farming at the bottom the the

69
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,879
bottom Fields down by the ocean and they were kind of salty so they all they could grow was potatoes and we were was

70
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:26,120
down there harvesting potatoes and helping at some point in these since 45

71
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:33,280
years since then since I was there someone had the idea that it should be returned to this

72
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,080
natural habitat the natural way the the lower fields at least were a a um

73
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:46,639
Wetland and partly to allow the salmon to come back up to those two creeks and partly to let it return to what it was

74
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,879
but that took a lot of steps first there had to be a lot of discussion they were going to actually turn some of the

75
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:58,080
property over to the Golden Gate natural Recreation Area hand it over to them but there had to be a lot of discussion

76
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,759
negotiations and all this and that was so the succession of things that had to happen to return to a natural state it

77
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:10,360
was a lot of steps there was a lot of discussion people had to be part of it and money had to be raised grants had to

78
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,560
be made and then at some point they had to kind of clear out everything that was

79
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:21,080
there I don't if they brought in bulldozers or what they did and uh to kind of get rid of weeds

80
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:29,039
that had come in and I don't know what had come in and then they had to change the the the canals and the rivers to

81
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,200
make it flow the way it used to be and and so river banks could overflow and

82
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:41,200
create kind of wetlands where things could grow and I hadn't been there for years until I think about two years ago

83
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,360
and I walked by the place where I used to do the fields where I used to grow uh

84
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:52,399
you know help with the potatoes and I couldn't quite see it anymore because now it was overgrown with the wetlands

85
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:57,920
and trees and it was beautiful but it took this sucession and

86
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,279
all this planning and step by step had to happen so it turns out that our

87
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:10,120
Buddhist spiritual life is the same way it's a succession of different things we create a foundation the foundation

88
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:16,320
allows other things to happen and it's not something that we build but it's something that the conditions we put in

89
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:22,240
place so that something can grow and develop and a lot of these lists the

90
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,600
Buddha provides if you actually study the lists you see many of the key ones

91
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,760
are actually descriptions of that the the of spiritual

92
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:39,399
maturation the five faculty starts with faith it's a great place to build to start with you have to have some faith

93
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:45,720
and some confidence and with that faith and confidence uh you do the second faculty

94
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:53,160
which is the you put some energy and some effort into studying learning the Dharma practicing the Dharma engaging in

95
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:59,880
it and as you put effort into it that allows um mindfulness awareness

96
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:05,000
present moment awareness to grow and develop as you develop more more present

97
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:14,120
moment awareness and you understand how the mind gets distracted and gets fragmented it pro supports the growth of

98
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,360
concentration and as you get more stable and concentrated that is a foundation

99
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:26,279
for wisdom so there's a sequence there that follows a progression that's not everyone follows that exactly that way

100
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:32,240
but but um this is the how way it's presented so many of them so Faith

101
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,720
effort mindfulness concentration and wisdom they're kind of a describes a succession that one grows strong allows

102
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,800
the other one to grow and so forth so the 10 paramas are

103
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,839
this the 10 parames and um in mahayan Buddhism they

104
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:56,600
have something called that's why I said it paramitas they call it in Sanskrit and they have a slightly different list

105
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:02,440
of 10 they're not quite exactly same as our school has the

106
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,480
10 and now these 10 qualities are things that are already in the teachings of the

107
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,720
Buddha and way after the life of the Buddha the tradition gathered these

108
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:20,279
together uh to create this idea of a succession is and they gather together with a brilliant idea or brilliant

109
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:25,959
brilliant recognition that these things starts with generosity that's the first

110
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:32,560
one that these things are intimately intimately connected to Liberation and

111
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:39,399
compassion not that generosity is but for generosity to be a parmy to be a

112
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:46,160
Perfection it has to have some relationship to our capacity for compassion our capacity for freedom in

113
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:51,920
the heart's Freedom that's what makes it a part of me it's great to be generous just for

114
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:58,360
its own sake don't don't wait but U but it becomes a par ofy when

115
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:05,160
it has this wonderful ful part of an e it's part of an ecosystem that supported or in reference

116
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:12,839
to our capacity to have caring feelings compassion kindness love uh friendliness

117
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:20,639
for others and and it has a intimate connection to our ability to not hold on

118
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,440
not tighten down not cling or grasp or crave not be caught in addictions and

119
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:33,000
obsessions of the mind and the Heart and as we get a feeling for what it's

120
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:38,639
like not to hold on to freedom of being free then generosity has a can have a

121
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,839
very different feeling because generosity then can be more an expression of that freedom it can be

122
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:51,279
done with freedom not a few of us will have genuine feelings of generosity but

123
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,600
it gets so entangled with our attachments and our expectations and our

124
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,800
Dias of exchange well I feel generous but they better give me something back

125
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:08,440
you know it's not just it's not completely pure you know generosity it's then fre with no clinging and

126
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:14,560
expectations at all and um and then uh yes it could be

127
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,519
nice to be generous but to be generous with a kind of sensitivity to how this

128
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:25,959
supports others and the key one is compassion which is attuned to the fact

129
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:33,000
that there's a lot of suffering in this world and we could so we can work as a community as part of alleviating some of

130
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:39,519
that suffering in the world and so part of the motivation for generosity can be

131
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:46,760
how to uh support this you know and alleviate suffering in this world which I think is a very profound profound

132
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:54,800
Instinct that we have so the first part of me is generosity that's the foundation for all

133
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,920
all the nine that are going to follow and one of the brilliant things about it

134
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:05,759
is generosity is uh done in community you you can be generous to

135
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:11,880
yourself but chances are it's not quite generosity um generosity is usually

136
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,360
something we do to others to living beings for the planet there can be it's

137
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:24,440
done in relationship to the world many people start Buddhism in the west with

138
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,279
meditation and it's the first instruction for some people in some schools like us sit down and close your

139
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:37,160
eyes which is kind of like sit down and shut out the world you know kind of just shut out

140
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:43,920
your senses to what's around you so you can really focus here it could for some people uh give

141
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:50,839
the message that being self-serving you know just like it's me myself in mind it's my practice and like all these

142
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:59,440
people to get in the way and I I just want to become a Buddha you know just you be the best Buddha on the Block

143
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:07,199
and um it could do that um but uh but the classically the practice begins with

144
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:13,680
generosity it begins by by caring for how we're relating to others it's a

145
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:19,199
relational practice that's rectifying or purifying or making healthy the

146
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,959
relationships we have cleaning them up so that they can be have genuine sense of

147
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,040
compassion that's related to our beginning we start beginning some ining

148
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:35,360
of what it's like to not cling to be attached and generosity is a wonderful

149
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,920
place to learn that because generosity is to be generous it can't be obligatory

150
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,680
to be generous it can't be a should it's a like here please so there's a kind of

151
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:55,120
a letting go in being generous does it have to be compassionate no but perhaps we can see

152
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,839
where is the compassion here so to give uh you can feel generous to someone and

153
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:08,440
you might want to give them you know something someone is allergic to peanuts

154
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:15,639
you have peanuts here I want to give you that's not compassionate uh you

155
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:23,000
know I had I've had people who I was so full of food already and they just wanted me to eat more and more you know

156
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:29,120
like please like you know it's now I'm feel uncomfortable because I feel obligated and I'm making you feel bad

157
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,480
and they're just being generous but in a certain kind of way but it just feels like some something's off

158
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:42,959
here so there generos have generosity to be ATT tuned to people and their suffering and their joy and benefit it

159
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:49,720
makes makes generos makes generosity to be much much better so so so the first

160
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:56,839
one is to have be generous is establishing healthy relationships I I would suggest I just told my wife a

161
00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:02,920
story I thought I told her be long ago she said when never heard that story I've told it here sometimes so don't

162
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:09,160
worry um um I when I was about 19 or something I read a study of it of they

163
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:17,438
called it back then a tribe and Liv in the mountains of the Philippines and there were uh uh people who uh uh had a

164
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,720
huge practice around dreams and apparently every morning families would get up and at breakfast they would tell

165
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,038
each other the dreams they had and one of the Customs was that if you had a bad

166
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:35,200
dream where someone in the village someone in the tribe was in that dream like scary or

167
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,320
something the custom was to always go find the person as soon as you could and give them a

168
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:49,400
gift so who knows you know what was going on socially with that fear that or that bad dream around someone there so

169
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:55,360
they they didn't necessarily analyze it but they just did something positive imagine you know generosity what it does

170
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,919
to our relationships if that's what we're if that's the Instinct and uh I've done this and I've

171
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,880
known people have done this when there's been bad relationships people are upset with each other and someone comes with a

172
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,720
gift and here and um I've done that number of times with people had trouble

173
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:21,320
with their in-laws bring them a gift and uh and that seemed to have

174
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:27,320
worked well so um so uh paries begin with

175
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,880
generosity it continues with another social capacity that helps clean up our

176
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:40,360
make healthy our relationships so emphasizing how important this is in Buddhism and the

177
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:47,000
second one is being ethical and so uh being being very

178
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
careful not to harm people uh live at least a non-harming life it's one thing

179
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,280
to know how to benefit people but and do you know do what's ethical in a sense it's easier to know

180
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:06,360
what's what is unethical what is causing harm and the the idea in Buddhism is

181
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:13,000
that sometimes it's easier to know what's the the the uh what it is to

182
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:19,960
avoid doing than necessarily knowing what you should be doing so the line is supposed to be quite strong in Buddhism

183
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:27,240
don't kill anyone how to benefit people and life flourish that's not so clear but don't

184
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:32,520
kill them don't steal from them just don't

185
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:39,320
steal don't this gets more complicated around sex but don't cause harm sexually don't

186
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:45,360
be involved in sexual misconduct uh don't lie maybe it's hard

187
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:51,080
to understand exactly where those are but you know but still don't lie and

188
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:56,720
don't don't don't don't get drunk don't intoxicate your mind so that you're not

189
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:03,480
so you're foolish and part of the reason the argument for not to do that is if uh if you're drunk

190
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:10,280
or intoxicated sometimes you're more likely to break the first three pre first four precepts you you kind of

191
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:16,080
people become careless and act ways that they when they're wise would not do that way do

192
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:22,240
it so the idea is to be ethical and uh and that can include positive ethical

193
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:29,520
beneficial things but the key thing about it it's relational and how is that tied to

194
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,000
compassion is there a relation between ethics and compassion you better believe

195
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,679
it that if you're concerned with people suffering you don't want to make more suffering for them you want to make it

196
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:47,760
better is there something a connection between uh non-attachment Liberation and

197
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:54,080
ethics of course there is because most I would say most the great majority of

198
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,960
unethical Behavior where we actively harming other people we we are clinging

199
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,720
to something you don't break the precepts without some kind of clinging you don't kill people without CL

200
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,000
clinging to something stealing lying these things and so as we get a stronger

201
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,799
sense of of Liberation Freedom then uh you know these are the natural ways this

202
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:23,840
grows ethics grows from this as we're more generous and we have this healthier

203
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:30,080
relationship to people around us the instinct is to be more ethical because we have this connection we understand

204
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:36,240
each other we are tuned to people then the next one takes some

205
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,000
explaining and some of you will flee if maybe if you could politely if you hear

206
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,960
what it is the next one is re enunciation isn't that a big dangerous

207
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:54,640
word and that's the English word which comes from Latin meaning to announce

208
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,480
again that when you uh when you in in the ancient Latin monastic tra uh

209
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:07,120
Catholic Traditions when a monastic declares themselves to be a monastic that take vows they're

210
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:14,000
enunciating these these vows of do uh doing without wealth and all kinds of

211
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:19,640
things without sex and things so so it's just stating against something so I like

212
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:25,120
it to see it that way because it's something that's voluntary you

213
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:32,360
voluntarily renounce something that you know to do and in Buddhism the word doesn't mean

214
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:41,360
the same doesn't it's a different word of course it's p and the literal meaning of the word is closer to um going forth

215
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,960
freely going forth freely into the inter Freedom it's a very different feeling

216
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,000
than the English word pronunciation but as we are living the

217
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,440
world of generosity as we're discovering the value of being ethical and how it

218
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:06,600
benefits us and what begins to grow inside of us with generosity and ethics it becomes a natural thing to recognize

219
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:12,159
when we are harming ourselves by clinging and holding on to things we

220
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:17,520
maybe we feel pretty relaxed and happy and content and we find ourselves now

221
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:25,039
holding on to um you know some lie that we want to perpetuate so somehow to

222
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:31,159
create a better impression on people how great we are and then we feel oh that having that lie

223
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:37,400
doesn't feel good having that clinging doesn't feel good of course I want to let go of it of course I want to want to

224
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:43,360
go forth into freedom of course and some people actually come and renounce

225
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,679
announce to teachers um on Retreats it's beautiful I love it when people come

226
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:54,760
they meet with the teacher and talk and then they come next time and say I want to tell you and apologize I wasn't 100%

227
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:00,960
honest when I talked to you about how my meditation was going and uh and because people get so

228
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,000
sensitive on Retreats they can feel and sense how how they feel off it doesn't

229
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:11,799
feel right and to rectify that they feel like they need to just say it to someone

230
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:18,720
so the renunciation and um so there's a movement towards Letting Go not because

231
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:25,399
you're supposed to let go because we know this is really good it's something

232
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:33,120
benefits from letting go and so it you again Liberation is right there

233
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:39,200
in the letting go and it turns out that compassion too is heightened and

234
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,960
developed in letting go clinging interferes with our healthy social

235
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,080
emotions and so here we have the compassion coming in relationship to

236
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,039
renunciation letting go as we let go more

237
00:24:56,039 --> 00:25:02,120
fully uh it feels good it it feels wonderful to not not hold on

238
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:07,559
and cling and grab and that becomes the source of

239
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:14,799
wisdom and wisdom is the fourth of the parames so wisdom here is experiential

240
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:20,159
wisdom here grows out of what we're learning from the first three parames

241
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,640
we're and we're learning for example that uh how to recognize clinging and

242
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:32,200
attachment and how it diminishes us how limits us the downside of it and we're

243
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:39,760
learning something about how good it is to not cling and to have wisdom about that we can't always act on the wisdom

244
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,679
but we're starting to see this Dynamic going on and we see that this wisdom

245
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,840
around clinging and non- clinging is also again connected to compassion and

246
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,480
helps connects to our instinct to for further Liberation to let go because we

247
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:05,919
understand the Dynamics of clinging that sets the stage for effort for

248
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,520
action for courage for engagement in the practice more because now we have the

249
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,640
firsthand firsthand personal proof of what is possible in this

250
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:26,039
practice we know for ourselves it's possible to be free it's possible to let go I might be 99% of the time completely

251
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:32,039
attached but that 1% that I had I know something now I didn't know before and

252
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:39,159
I'm inspired this is the direction to go I see the downside of being attached I'm

253
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:44,600
harming myself I'm harming others it's not really healthy let me trust this

254
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:50,200
path of letting go of compassion and so after wisdom there is

255
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:56,039
this more effort and that the word in poly Veria could probably be translated

256
00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:02,880
as courageous effort and um and sometimes it takes a lot of courage to do this

257
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,120
path with but once you start making effort you're going to have to learn

258
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:16,000
patience which is the next part of me so this is a you know this is not like

259
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,120
going like getting onto a conveyor belt you know and just kind of sailing to

260
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:28,720
Nirvana sailing you know sing along you know there's ups and downs and challenges and and um it's kind of like

261
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:36,679
a really good romantic partnership where one of the partners is troublesome and one is not and so you know so you're

262
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:43,720
engaged in the practice and the practice is difficult one of the partners is difficult it's not the

263
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:49,600
practice it's you and you get to meet yourself and see yourself and all the

264
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:57,000
ups and downs and the good Bad and the Ugly and your challenges and rather than being discouraged by

265
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,320
now uh you you have enough experience you know this is part of the richness

266
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:10,080
this the this is invaluable to see this part of course you'll be patient with this and keep practicing and find your

267
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:16,440
way with patience uh and exactly how this moves to the next stage maybe you

268
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:23,440
you have a better rationale but remember I'm describing a growth succession of how things can develop over time this

269
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,640
tradition says the next one is truth becoming truthful Maybe if you've been

270
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:35,840
patient and really can stay present and see what's there the Good Bad and the Ugly that allows us to be

271
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,679
truthful and some of us need to be truthful about ourselves about the things we don't want to look at see in

272
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,799
ourselves things we'd rather not admit but to really be able to have the wisdom

273
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:52,519
and the patience the acceptance to okay I have to admit this is what I'm

274
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:59,240
doing you know and so and sometimes that's you know hard to come to that truth

275
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:06,600
but then to understand that telling the truth about ourselves what's going on can be a compassionate and liberating

276
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:13,880
move that makes it a par ofy Perfection with truth when you see the

277
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:21,080
truth that's the condition found for the next par ofy which is

278
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:27,720
resolve resolve is taking a stand this is where I want my life to be

279
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,440
about this is where orientation this is the purpose this is the values I want to

280
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,559
live by and it could be all the previous parames I'll take a stand I'm resolved

281
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:45,559
on generosity I'm resolved on being ethical on healthy Letting Go healthy

282
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:51,480
renunciation I'm resolved on wisdom I'm resolved on effort the right effort

283
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:58,159
practicing I'm resolved on patience I'm resolved to be truthful these are invaluable if you're

284
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:03,799
going to your life is going to be rooted in something these are fantastic Roots if these are going to provide the

285
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:11,120
meaning the purpose of life These are fantastic and for people who are devoted to Buddhist practice the Buddhist path

286
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:17,200
that's actually the foundation you know that to okay I'm committed doesn't mean I can do it but this this mother

287
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,840
orientation I really want to make my life about gives purpose and

288
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:28,880
meaning and then uh with that purpose maybe we feel really good about

289
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:35,360
ourselves with compassion and letting go having a healthy good purpose having a

290
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:41,559
strong sense of connectivity to other people in our society practicing not only for ourselves but practicing for

291
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:48,840
the benefit of others as well um is now in the domain of uh of even the social

292
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:57,399
emotions becoming even stronger feeling even more connected to the world and to others and from this then grows uh our

293
00:30:57,399 --> 00:31:04,679
kindness are meta loving kindness friendliness kindness and um and so the

294
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:09,960
the ninth part of me is growth of a strong feeling of

295
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:17,399
kindness isn't that that can't be too bad if after all the the the goal the purpose the all this is this where's it

296
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:23,480
going it's going to becoming a kind person isn't that nice I think it

297
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:29,320
is and um and then the last one is not always so inspiring for people when they

298
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:38,840
hear but in Buddhism if you understand what it is and you understand that it's a powerful state of heart mind that is

299
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:44,120
only there because the first nine parames have been there first they've

300
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:50,000
been set in place set in motion these are like the like you like you you've

301
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:57,600
built a beautiful you've you you grown a beautiful tree in your yard it taken

302
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:04,120
years to let that tree grow there you had to clear the clear the clear what was there there all this terrible weeds

303
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:09,919
there it shouldn't have been there invasive plants you had to condition the soil you had to plant the tree you had

304
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:17,360
to water take care of it slowly slowly slowly the tree grew and you protected it from the deer or whatever it took and

305
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:24,000
eventually you had these beautiful blossoms That Grew there wow but maybe it's a fruit tree and you have these

306
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,279
wonderful fruits and that's kind of the final so we're growing the

307
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:35,440
parames and the last one is kind of like the blossoms of the tree or the fruit on

308
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:41,000
the tree so so if you don't like the word the idea I hope I set the stage now

309
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:49,159
for you to appreciate a little bit more it's equinity the capacity to be have all

310
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:56,600
these wonderful parames have them alive in you and with those alive that

311
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:04,039
support to to be able to look at the good and the bad in this world the good

312
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:10,480
and the bad in yourself and to have a clear open channels to see to know to be

313
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:17,200
wise without being reactive staying balanced not being

314
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:23,480
pushed around or dismayed or crash not be goes up not go up and down

315
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:31,279
with praise and blame just be completely have this tremendous balance and Clarity

316
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:37,960
equinity and for that that equinity to be intimately connected to the sense of

317
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:43,000
Liberation that's possible liberation of heart mind and the sense of compassion

318
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,559
for the suffering of the world these are the parmes and so these were put together as

319
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:55,960
a list this way probably 3 400 years after the time of the Buddha when people

320
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,559
were beginning to think about how do want become a Buddha and the Buddha became a little

321
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:09,118
more a distant memory but they wanted to they you know the people who are close to his lifetime they had him and they

322
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:16,398
were happy with who he was and what he had to teach they were kind of fueled by that but probably as over the centuries

323
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:22,440
afterwards the idea of him being more distant inspired people to say how are you going to have the next Buddha how do

324
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:29,358
you become a Buddha so they put together these 10 in this way that I described as

325
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:36,720
a description of what it takes to become a Buddha you have to cultivate all these qualities to become a Buddha so if

326
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:44,599
someone asks you what does it mean to be a Buddha to have these 10 Perfections perfected these 10 qualities not that

327
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:50,960
that's not enough to become liberated but the liberation of Buddha requires this to be in place

328
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,878
first and then down through the centuries after that once this list was created it turned out to be a fantastic

329
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:04,079
list to support people to understand how you develop your heart mind to in a good

330
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:10,960
way to develop your own practice towards Liberation toward Freedom how you develop your own uh life of compassion

331
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,480
service in the world and um and

332
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,200
um and so now it's become kind of a reference point and for many people in

333
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:30,560
the modern world and I don't know about the ancient world but the modern world especially here in the west that where more to Buddhists it's proven to be a

334
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,680
fantastic reference point these 10 parames as things to practice or

335
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:42,960
cultivate or reflect on in daily life and some people so you know

336
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,160
meditation is one thing but it's you know meditation shouldn't just be about

337
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,880
your private little meditation Life Buddhism is about also how you live your

338
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:01,160
life and some people then have found that the teachings on the par uh have been invaluable for bridging

339
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:08,920
their meditation in their daily life and some people don't even like to meditate don't even meditate some of you

340
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:15,319
maybe but the parames learning them and practicing with them is an invaluable

341
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:21,240
way of of developing the Buddhist path developing this capacities and

342
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:26,480
potentials that Buddhism points says that everyone has and so to maybe spend

343
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,680
a month on each of them and I teach programs where we do you a month on each

344
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:38,800
of the paramis and other people have done this as well and and I think Diana Clark Can Has Done programs here on the

345
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,520
parames and I think she go she rushes through them in five

346
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:50,400
months and um so um so the 10

347
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:58,480
parames so if some of you felt that that was a long list I apologize the what the I was hoping to

348
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:06,160
do through telling you that the narrative around these was to inspire in you that there is you have a capacity

349
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,720
for an organic growth and whether it's you whether it's

350
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:17,520
your growth is described by these 10 parmes that's not that as important but

351
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,880
there is a healthy way in which Dharma practice meditation

352
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:30,200
practice and mindfulness practice uh allows something to unfold fold to mature and develop that you

353
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:37,520
can't make happen but you can be the gardener of your own garden The Garden

354
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:43,599
of your heart mind and make create the conditions that allow something inside to grow and

355
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:51,760
develop and uh maybe you'll be surprised by what grows in you when you

356
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,599
begin watching your equivalent

357
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:04,920
dangerous what I'm going to say your equivalent of the forest fire the what will grow after that and

358
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,960
mature in you and and and it goes you know it can

359
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:17,520
go quickly things the the The Greener will come back and

360
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:24,319
grow so the 10 parames so we have you know about five minutes before the

361
00:38:24,319 --> 00:38:30,480
official end here would any of you like any questions or protest anything

362
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,480
or

363
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:45,359
what hi girl uh thank you for the talk um I wanted to ask why are dadin pares

364
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:54,760
different from Mahayana pares it's a I have that question too I

365
00:38:54,760 --> 00:39:00,960
I I don't have a good answer maybe maybe if you dig deeply into the doctrines of

366
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:08,000
of mahayan Buddhism you may see what why the differences are um and um one of

367
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:15,200
them that's interesting is that uh uh the Mahayana list has jna or meditation

368
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,839
as one of them and uh and the terava doesn't have that listed as one so you

369
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:28,000
know is maybe meditation more important for Mahayana than is ter I doubt that so

370
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,160
but why that is I don't know and so so I I don't really have an answer for you

371
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,359
thank

372
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,480
you so I'm back on uh the first param gener that's great I'm happy to hear

373
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:52,078
that okay I'm usually back there too okay starting

374
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:02,000
over when I'm I'm thinking that I um am not generous in

375
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:09,920
spirit not so much giving of things but more um when I find myself

376
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:17,560
judging other people uh assuming things about them that strikes me as not very

377
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:24,119
generous um and I wonder if you might have some ideas about how to deal with

378
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:30,920
that in those circumstances what would be generous what would be generous yeah in

379
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:37,079
the circumstances where you're judging people that way where do you find generosity given that that's what's

380
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:42,599
happening to you rather than thinking you have to wait is there could you find generosity

381
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:51,000
even when you recognize you're that way no

382
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:59,560
oh then I'll then I'll offer you a way okay you'll be you become generous if

383
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:04,680
you decide to if you decide to discover what would be

384
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:11,520
generous if you have the desire I don't want to be generous here but I think I'm going to try to understand H where where

385
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:18,280
and how to be generous that's generous then that begins with that desire to be that way I

386
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:24,119
would don't underestimate that so that's I'm not answering the question the way you answer asked it because you asked

387
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:31,000
what to do about when your spirit is not so generous and and I I answered by saying um don't

388
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,359
wait to be generous just do it anyway uh and uh don't wait until you've

389
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:44,079
rectified yourself and worked with this that's that's one answer I think it's a valid answer good answer I hope what to

390
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:50,200
do about it though to answer your question the way you asked it is uh uh

391
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:55,680
become the conosur

392
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,880
of your your lousy

393
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:08,240
Spirit get to know it really well so well you can see it coming so

394
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:15,440
well you see the conditions for that that also comes from conditions that are in place that grow that you have to

395
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,400
understand the conditions where that give birth to that for you and what what supports it and makes it grow and become

396
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:29,520
strong become the and I use the word connoisseur so that um you're not doing it in aers way or angry way or think

397
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:38,760
that you're wrong for being this way so you but you really get in there and Savor feel or sense until you become the

398
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:46,359
expert thanks so you can choose between those two or do both ideas both I'll take both oh fantastic so I saw over

399
00:42:46,359 --> 00:42:55,480
here there was a hand yes maybe one more and then we'll stop I can just shout no no because okay

400
00:42:55,480 --> 00:43:01,760
hi um this is a historical question uh about the intoxication part yeah um uh

401
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:08,400
in modern day there's obviously a lot of ways to be intoxicated with drugs and and all kinds of things historically

402
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:15,520
what were they referring to back in the Buddhist time alcohol so that was that that was the words were literally

403
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:22,119
alcohol that's you know they had and they listed the three different types of alcohol in the precept so you know

404
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:28,960
exactly how we beer liquor gint tonics I don't know what

405
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,280
they list three different types and so it's literally alcohol okay and uh and

406
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,720
by extension uh people have in the modern world have including drugs that

407
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:46,280
have the same uh s that have the same negative can have the same negative consequences that people get the literal

408
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:54,280
word in P that will make you careless and uh a pamada careless uh uh

409
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:01,400
and um pamada careless and um and the um uh in careless means

410
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:07,440
that you do things that you later regret that are not not healthy is that

411
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:15,440
good yep yeah okay okay so we're look at that 10:45 we're right on time and so

412
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,559
thank you all very much and if you want to say hello to the people next to you that's always nice but you might not

413
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:26,599
