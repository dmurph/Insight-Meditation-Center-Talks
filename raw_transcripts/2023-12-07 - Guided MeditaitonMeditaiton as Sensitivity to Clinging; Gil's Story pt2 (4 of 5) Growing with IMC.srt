1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:07,480
so hello and welcome to our meditation

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:16,480
session and one of the things that I think meditation and

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:23,000
is associated with often is calming becoming calmer and to only think of it

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,039
for that purpose is pretty reductionistic but becoming calm is

5
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:34,800
certainly extremely valuable one of the purposes of becoming calm and

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:40,000
one of the means of becoming calm and one of the consequences of

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
becoming calm is uh the relaxing of clinging the

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,239
relaxing of attachment of gripping of

9
00:00:53,239 --> 00:01:00,519
uh strong ways in which we hold on or resist in a way that's stressful for our

10
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:07,400
minds our hearts our body and to emphasize letting go to

11
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:14,159
emphasize non-attachment non- clinging in the abstract sometimes it's hard to

12
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:21,759
understand why or but in um or the value of that but

13
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,920
one of the things we're doing through mindfulness practice is uh developing a

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,360
heightened sensitivity uh a greater uh

15
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,000
awareness of what it's like physically

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,680
emotionally mentally when we're clinging to feel the unpleasantness of clinging

17
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,280
to feel the tightness of it the the pain of it

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,560
even to feel to really kind of be present such a way we feel of course we

19
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,479
want to relax that kind of tension it's like holding if someone's really angry and they hold their hand in a fist

20
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,840
that they might even know that they're holding their hands in a fist and then a friend comes along and sees how tense we

21
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,959
are and just picks up our Fist and holds it gently lovingly and then oh now we

22
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:24,360
realize and now we can we realize how painful it is to hold the hand that way and we

23
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,640
relax so part of this practice then is to

24
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,040
be in the present moment so we can feel and sense what

25
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:43,920
this living life is like for us so we can see where we are hung

26
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,200
up and to loosen up Let

27
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,560
Up release because we know we

28
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:04,080
feel and if we don't feel well if we haven't really taken in the

29
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,319
experience of clinging of attachment and see in the

30
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:17,560
moment the unsatisfactory of of it unsatisfactoriness of it then I suggest

31
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,680
you don't let go you don't relax but you bring a greater attention

32
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:28,680
to it until you feel how unsatisfactory it is to do it to be that

33
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,760
way so assuming a meditation

34
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:43,000
posture and now think of this posture as a posture that your body is going to

35
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,560
be an instrument a fine well calibrated

36
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,879
instrument for sensing and

37
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:03,760
feeling your lived experience giving some care that it's a posture

38
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:11,079
that supports a heightened

39
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,319
sensitivity and gently closing the

40
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,680
eyes and this instrument of the body to be more connected to

41
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:39,120
it take a few long slow deep breaths just deep

42
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:46,919
enough that you feel more connected but not

43
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,440
winded then a long slow exhale little longer than usually

44
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:08,720
would as a way of relaxing the body sensitive to the body as you

45
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,880
breathe in relaxing as you

46
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
exhale

47
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
for

48
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:32,400
and letting the breathing return to normal and with normal breath

49
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:39,120
continue just allow yourself to feel your body more fully as you

50
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,000
inhale maybe the Torso shoulders the

51
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,120
chest wherever the body

52
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:57,280
is activated by breathing in and on the

53
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,400
exhale relaxing

54
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:31,319
breathing in and feeling more fully the mind

55
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:39,800
the thinking mind and as you exhale soften Relax The

56
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,240
Thinking

57
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
mind

58
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:24,440
and if you're relaxed and it's easy to just ride the breathing easy to settle into the

59
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:31,240
present moment continue practicing this way

60
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:39,080
but if there's any way that you're hung up you have concerns

61
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:47,000
preoccupations resistance or contractions anything that can be

62
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,880
called an attachment or a clinging holding

63
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,880
on

64
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:06,200
resisting it's okay that you're this way the task is as you breathe in feel

65
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:13,200
it more fully allow yourself to feel

66
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,240
it till you feel how unsatisfactory it is how there's

67
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,440
something deep inside of that attachment that

68
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:31,120
clinging that wants to let go

69
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,920
and on the exhale let go

70
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:46,200
soften loosen but only after you've

71
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:53,360
known felt what it's like to be

72
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,560
attached never let go without knowing first

73
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,200
what attachment feels

74
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
like

remembering to take your time to sense and

89
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:04,159
feel the physicality of clinging of being

90
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,880
preoccupied holding on

91
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:18,360
fixating whatever way whatever version of clinging you

92
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,760
have the task is to know it well feel it

93
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,960
well until you feel almost as if it comes out of the

94
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,080
clinging itself the desire to

95
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,760
relax the wisdom that letting go is

96
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
wise

111
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:49,720
and then as we come to the end of a sitting to take a brief few moments

112
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,679
here to feel yourself more

113
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,720
deeply is there something about how you might be more subtle or calmer or a

114
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:07,200
little bit more clear and

115
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:17,559
aware that makes you more sensitive to clinging and grasping

116
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,840
contraction holding on

117
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,520
resisting and even if those things are not present

118
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,360
present is there a reference point

119
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,600
now for deeper feeling of them when they

120
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:51,880
occur not a judgment of them not ideas about clinging but to

121
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:59,519
actually feel and sense what it's like

122
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,880
how can you become

123
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:14,158
wiser when you have a deeper sensitivity to clinging and

124
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,559
grasping to desire and

125
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
aversion

126
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:43,799
and the more we can become aware of the remaining ways that we still

127
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:51,480
cling or hold on or attached maybe the greater

128
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:58,799
patience and generosity and Care compassion with we can have for

129
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:04,518
others who are clinging and grasping and holding

130
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:12,679
on that we see in others ourselves we see in ourselves

131
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:21,120
others we feel and know the challenges that are deep

132
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,919
inside and now our own perhaps allows us to

133
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:37,158
be to gaze upon others more generously more

134
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:43,760
kindly as we all go through this difficult World difficult

135

[Music]

140
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,720
suffering thank

141
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
you

142
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:25,440
so so then I continue with uh the story of my Dharma life and for this week it's

143
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,840
more my life as a teacher and uh I ended yesterday by talking

144
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:37,080
about how we decided to become incorporated as a religious

145
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:43,559
nonprofit and that happened in 1997 and the purpose of that was to uh

146
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:51,720
be able to purchase our own property to have our own Center and um so that process began

147
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:58,519
of seeing how we could do that and uh early on we had this idea

148
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:04,039
that um actually we had the the first and maybe the only fundraising committee

149
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:09,399
meeting group of people who were interested in trying to fundraise for this purpose and we met in someone's

150
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:17,000
living room and um Terry lesser who's our yoga teacher here for many years at

151
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:24,600
IMC she said uh Money Follows the practice and as soon as she said that we

152
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:31,679
stopped talking about how to raise money and rather talked about how we could offer more practice

153
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:38,519
opportunities and we did a survey of the community see what kind of practice opportunities they wanted and one of the

154
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:47,320
things that was desired was to have a Sunday morning program other was to have a yoga program and um and other things and so

155
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:55,760
we started a Sunday morning program uh in ptoa valy and by now we were using many

156
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,919
different facilities around during through the week through all the different programs we have been

157
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:07,159
developing we had two programs a week at the Friends Meeting House we had at the

158
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:12,600
community center in Porta Valley we had the Sunday morning program we had a

159
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:18,240
dayong retreats in um uh in a couple of other

160
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:25,559
churches a Presbyterian church and a Unitarian Church that we did on often on Saturdays we started started doing

161
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:30,919
Retreats kind of weekend Retreats at a Zen Center up in the mountains here

162
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:37,720
called jakoi wonderful little Z Zen Center and uh and then a SAA kind of

163
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,679
connection uh offered me a uh a room in her house that had its

164
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:49,000
own door to the outdoors that I could use as an office where I could meet

165
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,840
people because before that if I had to was going to meet oneon-one for practice discussions with people when the weather

166
00:33:54,840 --> 00:34:02,159
was good on meet in Parks as City city parks and when the weather wasn't good I would meet at coffee shops and and that

167
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:08,760
was kind of you know interesting to be having very deep difficult conversations in a coffee shop and sometimes people

168
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:15,158
were crying telling me about their life or something and and but that was the only we didn't have any space because we

169
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:20,200
had no place of our own and so then we had this so then I

170
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:26,398
had this office in uh this person's home and so we had all these different places and it became clear and clearer that we

171
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:32,720
were we had enough programs through the week that we can consolidate them all just move them all into our own Center

172
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,960
it kind of like Justified having our own place but we just developed our practice

173
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:45,440
as um and then we also in having deciding to have first uh we had first Monday evening then Thursday evening and

174
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,800
then Sunday evening one of the clear decisions that I made was that I didn't

175
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:58,119
want to be a teacher uh teaching too many people at one time and and uh so when we had about

176
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:04,560
a 100 people coming Monday nights we started the second program on Thursday nights to take the pressure off Monday

177
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:11,960
and then we started Sunday morning and um it would have been a lot easier for me to just give one Dharma talk a week

178
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:18,359
to a big group of people and maybe it would have been more efficient in some ways but I felt that

179
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:24,280
the Dynamics of being a teacher in the front of a very large group of people there was a lot there's a lot of

180
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:30,480
projection even if it's unconscious it just that fact that so many people are focused on one individual and the way we

181
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,920
do it in the inside World giving Dhat talks I think it creates kind of a skewed relationship and uh or

182
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:42,960
projections or associations to all that and I wanted to uh I wasn't interested

183
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,960
in that I wanted to keep you know things kind of simple and more basic and I didn't I didn't want to become like a

184
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,720
big teacher somehow and and one of the aspects of that was that when we meeting

185
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:04,599
at the Friends Meeting House um everywhere we met I just sat on the floor on a zapaton on a meditation mat

186
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:10,119
but uh then slowly people said well we can't see you at the big room you have to be up elevate a little bit and I

187
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:17,119
resisted that a lot to even to go up I think eight or 10 inches on a little platform was I didn't want that because

188
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:26,119
I felt associated with kind of becoming a little bit too special or something and then at IMC we brought that platform

189
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:32,079
with us here and then they wanted it higher and I resisted that and and um and would only

190
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:39,000
use it sometimes but now and that's what I'm sitting on now it's probably 15 Ines or so and uh and now it just seems like

191
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:47,560
what we do but I had this concern about you know the the uh elevation of uh projection

192
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:52,640
the elevation of authority power all kinds of things that goes in being this

193
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:59,760
role as a teacher so we were started to looked for a place and uh we I think we were pretty

194
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:05,640
naive but how we were going to finance it and how you know we didn't but we were surprised that before we even

195
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:11,359
started asking for money when people learned that we were wanted to buy a place people walked up to us with checks

196
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:19,119
and said here it wasn't like big checks necessarily but people just started offering US money and and um and then we

197
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:27,119
started raising money with the fundraising letter once a year and then at some point uh we heard about um uh a

198
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:32,480
minister couple in Redwood City who were the Ministers of this building here and

199
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:39,920
it had been a um it would built by a small uh Christian denomination called

200
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:46,240
First Christian Assembly and um they were a little bit mystical Christians they sat in silence

201
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:52,800
a lot and the uh elderly couple were ready to sell it but they wanted to sell

202
00:37:52,800 --> 00:38:00,480
it to someone who um also sat inside silence and we had a middle a person

203
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:06,200
between us a bridge to us between the them who knew us and knew them and introduced

204
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:12,640
us and um and so uh I called them up and they were

205
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:20,079
certainly interested but the message we got back is don't call us we'll call you so we drove by the place and saw it but

206
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:25,200
and it was the kind of the furthest limit of how the geographical area we

207
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:33,440
thought we would maybe could move to and um and so we didn't call them for

208
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:41,359
I think I called them one more time this was in January I think and or something like that April and then uh the

209
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:47,240
following January we still hadn't been shown the church and so I called them up

210
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:55,319
and a little bit honestly a little bit as a kind of a way to see if we can get some contact going I said

211
00:38:55,319 --> 00:39:02,079
um um you know we were looking for a place to be able to hold some kind of event we want to do could we use your

212
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:09,000
church and uh and uh the one Minister I talked to on the phone uh basically said

213
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:15,800
no I think but we had an hourlong conversation and that was really nice and then I was next day I talked to the

214
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:22,280
the spouse in other hourong conversation and by that time we were like best friends and we talked a few more times

215
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:28,240
on the phone it just felt so much love so much warmth going on and they just assumed that they were going to sell it

216
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:35,800
to us they hadn't even shown it to us and uh they even said that they would uh carry the loan which we didn't have

217
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:41,560
really the money to do that with you know to buy it ourselves and um it was very strange to

218
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:50,318
have all this going without actually having seen it and um and so finally in September of

219
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:56,200
2021 uh the um uh they showed it to us

220
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:02,520
and and uh it was just kind of a wonderful connection with them and they were so happy with our community and us

221
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:08,480
with them and we bought it and then in 20 January 2022

222
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:16,400
20 2002 so September 2001 we we saw it bought it and then moved in January of

223
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,839
uh 2002 in looking for it we had uh we

224
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:30,480
visioned for it and the we did I had we had I had a bigger Vision at just having a center uh the dream I had was since I

225
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:38,680
was going to be rooted here in this area now that it would be nice to be able to provide uh a Buddhist practice

226
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:44,079
opportunities or support for people uh throughout their lifetimes from uh

227
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,640
childhood to from Cradle to grave kind of thing and so they one of the Visions

228
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:56,640
we originally had was to find a property that was big enough to have a community Meditation Center a place for people to

229
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,599
do long-term self- Retreats and a hospice and uh those three would be kind

230
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:08,720
of synergy of a certain kind of depth of spirituality and connection we had thoughts about

231
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:14,920
children's programs and when we finally moved here uh we were kind of a little

232
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:20,560
bit of pioneers for the mindfulness in schools movement and um the few of us

233
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:27,480
here met rically and organized the first conference uh in the country on mindfulness in the school systems and

234
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:34,560
people came from all over to uh you know because it was the first one and to have this conference so there was a bigger

235
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,920
vision of what was possible that started with a looking at a center like

236
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,440
this as I continued teaching uh before we bought the place I

237
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,680
had my first CH my my wife and I we had our first child and uh that was a real

238
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:57,560
turning point for me because um it uh we had a high-spirited child

239
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:03,040
and uh parenting for me was quite demanding monastic life was easier for

240
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:08,359
me than parenting and I often was very tired and and um my wife and I were

241
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:13,680
often very tired from the constant care of this child and we had no support we

242
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:19,520
didn't have grandparents nearby we didn't have we didn't have any Nanny and

243
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,960
things like that and one one point we we brought our child to a uh the first kind

244
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:33,079
of kind of a preschool kind of thing and and um and it was

245
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:40,240
a he kind of was expelled from preschool uh within a few weeks flun throughout

246
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,559
out of preschool so that was a glorious beginning to his uh educational career I

247
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:51,720
think because he he woke up other woke other kids up during the nap and that was a no now for that

248
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:58,079
place and um but what happened for me as a teacher was I no longer had time to

249
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:04,599
prepare for my talks and I um and I was

250
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:09,800
tired so I would show up to teach and I thought that my the quality of my talks

251
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:15,280
I thought was really dropping dramatically but the odd thing that happened people seemed to appreciate my

252
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:22,920
talks more and more and I think what was happening was that I was becoming less intellectual about the Dharma and more

253
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:28,079
talking from from some you know from the state that I was in talking about how

254
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,319
things were for me personally and and uh and people resonated more than with the

255
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:39,319
talks and and that also then was a beginning of uh I felt really the

256
00:43:39,319 --> 00:43:48,520
beginning of be of starting to be ATT tuned to how being a teacher is uh its own practice and uh an

257
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:55,559
example of this would be I'd be sitting like I'm here now in my meditation posture to give these talks and as I

258
00:43:55,559 --> 00:44:01,280
taught uh I would be paying careful attention to where if I was leaning forward or

259
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:08,200
being pulled back or the tone of my voice and there were so many little feedback loops inside of me of where I

260
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:15,400
got caught I was concerned about what people were thinking about me or you know if one person in the in the

261
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:21,480
hall walked out I could feel like like I got oh no I'm failing or something and

262
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:27,000
and I could feel you know sometimes it was subtle but I could feel the shifts of attachment or

263
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:34,119
uh uh I have fear sometimes if one person was sitting looking down shaking their head like this I noticed that my

264
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:41,400
eyes went to that person all the time as if that person was the arbitrator of how successful I was in teaching and so I

265
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:46,440
got to see a lot of the conceit a lot of the attachment a lot of the fears there

266
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:54,440
was a in this posture I could see the subtlest shifts and movements represented how I got caught and so as I

267
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:02,119
was teaching um um I was kind of using this as a practice thing and uh and that

268
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:07,599
was uh really important for me I learned so much about myself uh practicing

269
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:13,800
paying attention as a teacher in this role and um and that was a good thing

270
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:19,240
because as we got the center here then I started teaching even more and and um

271
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:25,559
and that just stly grown over time so I think we'll do one more day on

272
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:35,440
this Gil story and um and then we'll see what's next after that so thank you and

273
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:42,280
um and um I appreciate all of you and this chance to

274
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:47,520
tell these stories and I hope that uh it's somehow instructive or helpful for

275
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,520
you thank

276
00:45:52,599 --> 00:45:55,599
you
