1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,379
okay so welcome welcome everyone welcome to happy hour lovely to see you all

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:14,839
and lovely to be with you feel your presence from around the country and the world

3
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:23,279
so so for today's practice ah and I wanted to bring in the sense of

4
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,300
um of uh patience as meta patience as meta

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,719
patience with ourselves patients with others patients with this body

6
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:42,120
patience and kindness with causes and conditions not being what we want them

7
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:49,379
to be patients with our to-do list patience patience patience patience can be such a

8
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:55,739
beautiful um practice it's really an aspect an

9
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:02,760
expression of love and and again to have discernment patience is not just oh

10
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,900
postponing and I'm procrastinating that's not patience but there is a wholeheartedness there's a kindness

11
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,020
there is a a gentleness to appreciating when is

12
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:25,259
um when it's appropriate to have patience and when it's appropriate to lean in and and not impatience but but

13
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,420
of course holding ourselves or others accountable so so and that is the role

14
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:35,700
of wisdom because compassion and kindness without wisdom

15
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:42,900
become what Tibetans like to call idiot Compassion or idiot kindness so so in

16
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,259
that way what is the appropriate

17
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:54,240
expression of patience as kindness as love as meta for ourselves and for

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,780
others without veering into enabling and unhealthy enabling so

19
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,680
so I leave that as as a little contemplation and then knowing the guided meditation that I lead us to

20
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,280
explore that a little bit so so let's uh let's begin let's land in our

21
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:19,940
seeds let's arrive

22
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,780
here here In This Moment

23
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:33,920
In This Moment In Time in this body

24
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,660
starting with patience with this body

25
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:59,180
with this mind the body might still be settling

26
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,680
reverberating from the busyness of the day

27
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:18,180
patience with this mind might still be running around like a

28
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,280
little puppy can we have patience with ourselves in this moment as we start to

29
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,480
settle connecting with the breath

30
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,800
and the attitude of spacious patients with the breath

31
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,659
as it finds its way

32
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,159
through our bodies

33
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,380
having patience with the hard mind

34
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:03,800
as it connects with the sensations of the body feet the feet on the Earth

35
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:10,080
hands and lap on our lap your sit bones and

36
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,978
the cushion

37
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,860
patience with the unfolding of settling and arriving

38
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:09,860
patience with this body maybe it's a key or

39
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:19,880
creaky your little unsettled thank you or sleepy

40
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:28,139
or whatever else might be arising as if we're opening our hearts

41
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:35,160
kindness with patience accepting the body just as it is in this

42
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,520
moment

43
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,740
with each breath

44
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,460

71
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,140

72
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:22,519

76
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,839
this body mind and heart

77
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,579
and you be patient if their judgments are rising

78
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:03,120
can you be patient loving with the judgmental mind

79
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,438
if it's arising

80
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,579
thanking it thank you

81
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:21,438
thanks for trying to help me the best way you can you know

82
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,620
there's plenty of patience with whatever is arising

83
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:43,879
plenty of love for it to transform into wisdom

84
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,940
I love and be patient with myself

85
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:04,460
as much as it's available in this moment not pushing as much as it's available

86
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:25,020
and can we open up this space of patience

87
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:32,159
patience has love love has patience Good Will can we open it up

88
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:38,658
include others can we offer our patience

89
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,759
to someone we care about

90
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:54,200
in our life as an expression of care Goodwill

91
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,020
taking the long-term View

92
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:11,820
what they are doing or not doing part of it is of course there

93
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:19,039
militia and responsibility and a lot of it is part of the causes and conditions

94
00:25:20,039 --> 00:25:24,259
and we offer our support our patience

95
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,200
not our judgment

96
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:43,620
Transformations happen more readily in a loving patient

97
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:49,260
container than one that is filled with impatience and judgment

98
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,220
we know this

99
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,200
loving patience foreign

100
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:14,539
loving patients

101
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:26,159
and patience not as a chore but as a gift

102
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,500
it's a gift of generosity from our heart

103
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:27,179
and then can we expand further to have patience loving patients

104
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:31,039
with causes and conditions

105
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:42,600
that feels too abstract and stay with a being stay with

106
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:49,580
someone in your life or with yourself

107
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:49,640
unless we're bringing this sitting to a close

108
00:29:53,940 --> 00:30:01,679
and reconsider the gift of patience is it gifts with as a gift with no

109
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:08,059
strings attached to ourselves to a loved one

110
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:12,260
release

111
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:34,500
pressing that patients Conte is one of the ten

112
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,779
Perfections and parames

113
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:47,880
exploring the equivalence of love and patience and

114
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:53,760
offering this goodness the equivalence of this goodness love and patience loving patience

115
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:00,059
as a gift may I love and accept and be patient

116
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:02,600
with myself

117
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:14,000
just as I am to create the conditions for growth

118
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,679
not for impatience and judgment

119
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:27,480
and sharing our goodness sharing our cultivation the seed of goodness and

120
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:33,919
cultivation with all beings everywhere may all beings including myself

121
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:38,720
be happy be well and be free

122
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,740
thanks everyone thanks for your practice

123
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:06,960
so so much to say and explore with with patience and and the way we

124
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:15,419
try to approach and and poor patients in the sitting was um

125
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:20,460
as an ex as an expression of love as expression of Goodwill for ourselves

126
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:27,659
and others and in this container of loving patience again it's not

127
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:34,620
idiot patients but it's one that enables transformation in Naples growth

128
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:40,020
um enables wisdom whereas if we're just impatient with

129
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:45,299
ourselves seeking the next thing or the judgments it just contracts the whole

130
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:51,899
heart both for ourselves and for others anyway get a lot this is a very rich

131
00:32:51,899 --> 00:33:02,700
topic but but maybe just a bit of exploration today so select invite us to uh

132
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:09,360
explore this topic this practice together in small groups with patience

133
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:15,480
for ourselves patience for one another and um

134
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:23,580
and the the question to explore in the breakout rooms for with one another

135
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:30,360
um it could be about this this guided meditation if there was something that showed up for you something that

136
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:36,240
revealed itself something that was surprising um or maybe this just the general

137
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:42,779
question of um how does patience and lack of patience patience and its opposite

138
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:48,539
patience and impatience how does it show up in your life and

139
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:55,500
um is it supportive when you lean into patience for yourself and for others

140
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:00,840
and by and the opposite of it impatience is it uh

141
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:06,360
what do you notice it's just exploring exploring a little bit the invitation is

142
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:13,080
for you to say just if you have 10 things to say just say one nugget just one thing maybe it takes a 30 seconds or

143
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:19,320
a minute and then the next person will say something if they want or they can say pass

144
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:26,878
just bow and hold silent presence and then the next person will say something and then your turn again go around and

159
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:27,300
thinking about how um how not having patience

00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:33,180
um and busyness that that they are they they kind of

161
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:41,280
like are a way to sort of distract from um from thoughts like from a

162
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,400
person's own thoughts and also like from being in the present moment

163
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,800
and a way to escape reality and um

164
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,380
and then uh yeah it also can cause suffering and then I was thinking about

165
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:03,960
how like where my mother's family is from the Philippines how

166
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:10,460
um my memories from when I was a teenager there and how there's no internet there's no cell phone service

167
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:15,780
there's no running water there's no electricity and so when we're not like

168
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:21,540
working or doing things like that we passed the time by telling each other

169
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:28,440
stories and then how people would tell the same stories over and over again but you'd be

170
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:34,500
patient and you don't tell someone oh you already told me that story because they enjoy telling the story so

171
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:40,260
much you just let them tell you the same story again day after day

172
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:45,599
and then when we don't have anything to say we would just look at each other and then

173
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,320
when we were really bored and it was getting late we would just go to sleep

174
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:59,640
sweet beautiful thank you so much for bringing that in Malaya that is lovely this gift

175
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:04,859
of kindness and patience and letting people tell the same story that they

176
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:13,079
enjoy telling over and over again there's such sweetness about that and and uh just patience with life patience

177
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:19,619
with one another patients with ourselves or something about the pace of the the

178
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:24,839
um the modern world especially with social media that it's it's unimaginable

179
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:30,720
to be quote unquote bored a single minute that you just have to pick up

180
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,119
this this uh device and keep scrolling and news and information and this and

181
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:41,220
that sort of just be here just be patient just cultivate patience so maybe

182
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:46,619
the next time each of us find ourselves with moment of waiting the doctor's

183
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:51,839
office or here or there can we just ah take that moment to cultivate loving

184
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:57,060

188
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:25,140
okay not working Vicky so tell you what we'll go to Quentin and you can figure out

189
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:30,680

190
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:39,960
hi can you can you hear me yes absolutely good um I I experienced something uh with my

191
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,480
partners that was very unique from me um that I definitely think relates to a

192
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:51,900
lot of a lot of experiences including patients um I've been I've been studying Buddhism a

193
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:58,380
while and um I'm trying to say this in a gentle way um many of the practice groups that I've

194
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:05,339
been to mostly have been Western Buddhists there is a lot of philosophizing

195
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:10,980
and the politeness feels very very surface

196
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:16,980
and my partners were able to share their thoughts and I was able to share my

197
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:24,359
thoughts with kindness at the same time it wasn't the affect the facial expressions of

198
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:30,660
warmth but still speaking intellectually and so sometimes over the years

199
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:38,579
I have not been able to feel comfortable sometimes with speaking intellectually feeling that the body was left behind

200
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:46,380
but my partner showed up with this kind of boundary of like I will get to know them over time and I

201
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:53,280
will still receive and give kindness and I will get to know them over time and I will still receive kindness and it was

202
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,320
just really nice to be felt that I was being received of kindness and still

203
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:06,540
allowing people to express themselves without having to be vulnerable in a particular way to feel connected

204
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:13,859
um and that that's very different I haven't experienced that before in a long time so I really appreciate that it

205
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:21,740
definitely helped me with the idea of being patient and being comfortable with being intimate as things grow

206
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:27,960
beautiful thank you so much Quentin thank you so much for articulating that

207
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,420
um and and feeling touched by that noticing that and articulating it so

208
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:39,599
beautiful and also I want to reflect back in just the way you were actually speaking about it was you were sharing

209
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,900
this intellectual idea this thing that you had noticed in the space that's interesting to put it into words and yet

210
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:51,240
you were so embodied sharing your own care your you being touched your own

211
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:58,200
vulnerability of oh it's been challenging in the past and this was really different tonight I so thank you

212
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,960
for you modeling what touched you in the community in the group tonight

213
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:11,099
um and and I do want to say I think this is something that I love about about the happy hour Sangha because there is this

214
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:18,480
sense kindness embodiment not an idea but an embodied kindness through our practice that we show up for one another

215
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:25,980
holding one another holding ourselves and of course we discuss our practice what arose challenges and yet there's an

216
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:31,980
embodiment of kindness which is our Our intention in these hard practices so

217
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:39,300
right on thank you Clinton really appreciate you reflecting that thank you so beautiful okay Vicky I think you've

218
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:46,140
succeeded in unmuting yourself yes I did thank you I loved the thought

219
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:51,780
of finding wisdom as you are having patience

220
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:58,319
and I remembered a yoga teacher a long time ago saying that rushing equals

221
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:05,700
violence and I thought about that with patients that a lot of it is holding one's desire

222
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:13,560
to fix something or make it different and having that that calm to do it in

223
00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:20,160
the middle of being really wanting to get things done or wanting to move things in a different

224
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:27,599
way yeah yeah beautiful thank you Vicky beautifully said yeah this the gift of

225
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:35,400
patience in so many different ways in the midst of busyness in the midst of oh impatience can we feel into it as not as

226
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,220
violence the impatience as violence of our minds but uh yeah thank you

227
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:49,079
beautifully said and and um one of you sent me a direct reflection having patience with mind was

228
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:56,819
a beautiful concept during sitting beautiful having patience with our own mind yay having patience with our bodies

229
00:43:56,819 --> 00:44:02,819
if it's not exactly you know the cause and conditions are challenging right now

230
