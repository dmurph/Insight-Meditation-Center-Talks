1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,480
so good evening everyone is this volume okay for everyone

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,519
this is good so i didn't know i was supposed to be here today

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,760
somehow the scheduling happened such a way that i didn't know it so much and then i see

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,279
like somebody texted me 20 minutes ago and said that then i looked at the

5
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,560
schedule and sure enough there i am

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,480
so uh i'm happy to be here but um i think that uh

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,079
we're gonna have to do this together i don't have a talk to give

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,680
not anything that maybe you want to hear so um at the moment

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,440
so um there's a few things we could do one is you could just the classic thing is you

10
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,760
could ask questions i was home with my wife just now and i said oh there's no one

11
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,518
to be there and i'm scheduled to be there and what do i do and she said well you can just go do

12
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,960
questions and then i said okay i'll go

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,720
and uh so we could do that or i could ask you questions but that

14
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,799
might be scary and so what would you like to do

15
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,640
yeah or you have other options

16
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,159
but that's those are the two i can think of

17
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,799
sorry questions okay let's see if you have any questions

18
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,880
and i'll do my best to respond or ask a question in return

19
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,719
maybe we can maybe pass out the mic i'll be ready with that to put someone

20
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,039
test test

21
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:21,680
i always have lots of questions for me uh

22
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:30,239
i'm very new to all of this sorry i'm new to all of this but uh one question lately has been

23
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,760
what is the role of fun you know the role of fun

24
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,200
having fun just fun pleasure

25
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:48,160
how do how do we work that into improving uh-huh

26
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:55,840
yeah that's a good question the uh i think the fun

27
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,840
some people find this practice to be quite fun believe it or not i don't think i

28
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,640
associate it with fun but um the greatest happiness three greatest joy that i've

29
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,480
ever had in life in a long sustained way is through this practice

30
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,920
i've had uh i've been on retreat for months

31
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,680
and it'll be it was kind of like non-stop joy just kind of ecstasy

32
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,040
so it was that fun um you know i don't know if that's exactly

33
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:39,040
fun but uh it was kind of unsurpassable kind of joy that was wonderful so that that

34
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:44,640
can happen that way um to this morning i had a conversation

35
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,159
with someone about um grief in

36
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,159
this practice you know in buddhism is there a place for grief because it's in the ancient texts

37
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:03,360
it seems like there's no real place for grief grief is something to overcome and there's no mention of

38
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,560
fun there's a little bit of mention of play but there's not much in a fun either

39
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,120
and so does that mean that this is like a really flat uh tradition and you the only thing

40
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:24,160
you're allowed to do is sit and close your eyes and be quiet you know and just deal with it or is there fun is there grief is it

41
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:30,560
what are the range of things a human person can do and

42
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,800
so that now i'm speaking for myself rather than for buddhism is that

43
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:44,479
i'm not that interested i don't about looking to buddhism to tell me how i'm supposed to be

44
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,680
i'm looking at buddhism to inspire me to look deeply at what is happening to

45
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:57,600
me so if i have having fun i don't have any idea that i

46
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,039
buddhist should have fun or should not have fun i'm just having fun

47
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:09,360
and then the practice of mindfulness is for me to look at that as i'm doing it and there's a ways in which i'm attached

48
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,639
to some things a ways in which something unwholesome or unhealthy is coming out

49
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:22,320
in that fun and if it is then i'd like to stop that

50
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,479
but if it's not then i'd like to keep doing it i don't see any reason not to fun is fun

51
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,680
so the same thing with grief if if i feel grief

52
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,360
i don't i don't really care whether the ancient tradition has no room for grief it's just supposed to really matter just

53
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,720
overcome it and not have it and it's a complicated question what the ancient tradition really says and what

54
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,320
it means and and scholars are you know looking looking into this try to tease apart

55
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:56,720
because we're talking about a language that no one speaks anymore from 2500 years ago and to understand exactly where these kind

56
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,960
of crucial questions are played out is a big is a topic but um i'm not so

57
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,080
interested even with grief or anger or anything

58
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,919
to judge it automatically as as i should or shouldn't be that way

59
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,680
if i'm having it then it's real and if it's real i want to see it i want

60
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,639
to know it more deeply i want to see what's going on and i want to see if there's something unwholesome unhealthy in the way that

61
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:33,039
i'm engaged in it am i attached to my clinging to something and if i'm clinging to something

62
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,880
then for me it is

63
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,319
i'd rather not but if i'm not clinging whether it's fun or grief or whatever it

64
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,360
might be if i'm not causing any harm to myself or others then i'm fine with

65
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,520
it so that's not answering your question directly but it's offering you a

66
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:03,000
buddhist principle which is uh

67
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,240
be mindful when you're having fun and see what it's like see what's going

68
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:17,039
on so it is probably not a satisfying answer but if you have if you want to ask again

69
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,199
or maybe maybe you want to say why you're asking

70
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,800
i think at the center of it is that question of i should or shouldn't

71
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:42,160
and behavior based off of let me have this clear cut i should do this or i should do that

72
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,759
but i think your answer to me kind of says

73
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,520
that there isn't this or that that it's an investigation of each thing

74
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,840
and just again that mindfulness approach of

75
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,240
when i recognize what i'm calling fun what what's there

76
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,720
is there attachment

77
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:19,280
is this something is it behavior that is moving towards what i want to be

78
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,599
or is it behavior that's moving towards something else right yes so that's so i think you understood what i had to say

79
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:32,240
yeah so shows and shouldn'ts are not as interesting as looking deeply and if you look deeply

80
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,959
then you maybe have an answer to whether you should or shouldn't you know if you see that it's causing harm to you maybe then you shouldn't do

81
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,000
it or it's causing harm to others maybe you shouldn't do it but you don't start

82
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,160
with that premise you start with investigation

83
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,200
great thank you yes

84
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,560
uh hi um if you say say your name i'd love to know oh sure i'm theresa

85
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,399
teresa priva uh teresa like mother like mother teresa it's hard with the masks

86
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,080
it's not so good so we could turn it up a little bit because my hearing is is hard

87
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,600
um i also went swimming it's about evening and so i think there's a little bit

88
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,360
of water in there uh so um so i've been on a journey uh so

89
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:34,000
i have been meditating for maybe like uh three years now but still like i noticed there's been

90
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,959
like like phases in my psychology um and like uh kind of like

91
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:48,000
observing myself and seeing how i react to things that i anyway i'm still i'm still kind of going

92
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,360
through phases and i was kind of curious since you're taking questions

93
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:00,080
um in your journey in this practice of mindfulness

94
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,440
have you kind of been through a similar journey

95
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,120
of like the evolution of your psyche um like going from like like right now i'm

96
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:19,200
observing my tendencies and then now i'm like watching myself in action and trying to observe those actions

97
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,360
and then i noticed i've been um kind of just like shifting in my perception

98
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:31,200
and and then it influences my actions but anyway i'm still like kind of in the mix of it all wonderful

99
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,839
and i was actually really curious for somebody who's been practicing for longer and deeper and kind of

100
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,680
way more uh you know progressed i was curious if there was like a

101
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,880
like a progression or like some sort of like phases or like um trends of like

102
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,240
observation yeah and then like and then and then where did you end up i'm sure

103
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,440
that's still a journey but like like now when you practice do you

104
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,560
are you just kind of going back to center and like do you like do you feel like you're

105
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:11,519
going to different states of consciousness where i mean samadhi is like kind of like you know like a a huge

106
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,519
thing i'm just kind of curious like how that like how has evolved and gone towards them

107
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:25,040
wonderful yeah so the um i love i love the very much the

108
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:33,440
metaphor of the journeys of journeying the unfolding the evolution of practice and uh and i find that

109
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,800
the stories that people tell or the teachings that kind of lay out an arc of practice

110
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:49,040
inspiring to me and uh yes i've had all kinds of journeys arcs phases in my practice

111
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:55,440
i probably wouldn't have worded the way you were did yours but that's always going to be personal

112
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:02,320
so i was delighted delighted to hear the things that you were mentioning and that so what i can affirm for you is yes

113
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,519
there are phases and what you describe is are good faces to go through

114
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,639
and there's a lot more there's some more that are more classic for buddhism

115
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,480
and uh and some which are very personal and you know that aren't really part of

116
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:26,000
i wouldn't say they're not part of buddhism but they're not really classically discussed or something but one of the

117
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,440
that one of the interesting things to the shifts over time that makes an interesting study

118
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,880
is um how does your interests shift over time

119
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:44,560
how do your your perception shift over time how does what you tend to notice in yourself and environment shift over time

120
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:52,079
um what how does your motivation shift over time and these all will unfold and change

121
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:58,480
and uh sometimes uh intentionally so it's like this is what we want to see the change and we move

122
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,040
towards it sometimes you know it's a surprise how we change

123
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,160
but if you do this practice you will change so is that

124
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:15,360
you can you can welcome to ask more more specif specifically because

125
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,600
i'm not sure i touched exactly what you wanted to yeah i i guess i was curious if there were like

126
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:28,079
like what are the arcs and i guess we don't have to sit here listening to like the whole scripture but like um

127
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:34,720
was there like very uh striking like clear like i'm like where did it take you on

128
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:41,120
your journey um and how did that help you um

129
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:49,040
evolve the like you know i've been doing this for almost 50 years so there's been a lot i

130
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,800
could cover a lot over this time it's still unfolding the

131
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,880
the when i was a beginner

132
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,160
i started i was introduced to meditation at first and it was kind of nice for me and it

133
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,760
wasn't buddhist meditation but it was it was nice to do and then it wasn't college and then i

134
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,199
had summer vacation and then i stopped meditating and then later about nine

135
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:24,720
months later i was introduced to buddhist meditation through zen meditation and i wasn't just really caught by the

136
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,560
meditation but i was interested in the some of the teachings that i read about

137
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,160
and then it took a little i got serious about doing it but i felt like

138
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,880
so i was ready to really give myself over to zen practice but uh i i didn't feel like it was the

139
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,720
right phase in my life for it to to give myself over to it in a big way

140
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,199
and so i felt like i had to take care of loose ends in my life i was 21 20 or 21.

141
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:00,240
and um and so one of the loose ends was uh i'm from norway

142
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:06,560
and i had i didn't grow up a lot in norway but i had this uncertain relationship with

143
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:12,079
and so i thought before i you know i need to go back and resolve my relationship to the country what you

144
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:19,279
know where i should live and things like that so i went back to norway for a year and

145
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,120
and then eventually i came back to the united states to continue college and

146
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,639
and i was suffering and i had this idea that if i meditate it started zen meditation it would help

147
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,959
me deal with the suffering i had so i started meditating every day twice a day

148
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:43,040
and and something shifted for me after a few months of meditating and then as i

149
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,440
discovered i was meditating for no reason and i'm kind of a rational guy and so it

150
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,680
was kind of strange for me to not have a reason to do what i did but i was going to do it anyway there was no question about it that was you know there was

151
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:02,160
something in me that was motivated but i didn't know why why am i doing this you're doing it

152
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:08,800
and uh and so i thought about it for a while and i came up with the um

153
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,480
the two things i began to realize was happening to me one was that

154
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,519
that i wasn't doing meditation for a reason

155
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:25,360
any more than a musician plays music for a reason or a dancer

156
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,560
dances or an artist paints it's a kind of an expression in the moment

157
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:36,880
and not you know and that's not so much to get through the music as fast as you can it's to express something in the music

158
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,000
or the dance with something so i thought yeah i'm not doing it for a

159
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,399
reason but it's a form of it was the fullest kind of self-expression i discovered i knew and that was so

160
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:54,000
meaningful for me and as that became clear then i i felt what i was

161
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,600
experiencing was integrity and uh later i realized i don't think i

162
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:05,600
meant moral integrity ethical integrity i think what i meant back when i was 21 or something

163
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,798
a sense of wholeness i was developing that i hadn't had before and

164
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:16,959
and that sense of wholeness then changed my trajectory of my life

165
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:23,120
and so first i had it in meditation and that was really nice and then i discovered that then i had

166
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,840
this question what kill the line between meditation and daily life is an arbitrary line

167
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:36,480
why do you only be this way in meditation so i i said i wanted i want to be able to do

168
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,080
this whole this integrity thing in the rest of my life as well

169
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,280
and and so that's when that's the reason i moved to live at a buddhist center

170
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:53,200
and so i lived there i lived at the san francisco zen center for many number of years and

171
00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:00,720
and in this quest to kind of be more integrated with this wholeness

172
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:07,760
be able to live it in my my everyday life paradoxically i kept going i went deeper and deeper into the monastic life

173
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,200
more and more meditation but it wasn't exactly i wanted to meditate more yet i just wanted to

174
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,720
somehow ex expanded my life and then

175
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,400
but in the process of all that there was all these phases right so in the process of that i

176
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,440
began seeing my psychology my neurosis

177
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:36,160
uh the the uh social games i played and uh it became more more obvious you

178
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:42,320
know this kind of this the oddities the foibles of my mind

179
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,000
and i really was motivated to then work with them and like in the monastery one of them

180
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,160
that i saw painfully was how much i wanted people to like me

181
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,600
and i was doing a social gymnastics to get everyone to like me and i was the manager of the kitchen

182
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:06,240
managing a kitchen crew and that's like the last place you want to be if you need to have people like you

183
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,919
and so it was really hard and it was exhausting and and after i you know and

184
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,520
one of the ways wisdom works is gift wise if you you do something long enough to

185
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:25,360
see the suffering of it so i saw the suffering of wanting people to like me and how it was just it was overrated

186
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,520
and so and then because i was meditating a lot it was a very interesting juxtaposition between seeing the

187
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:38,640
suffering of this psychological complex of wanting people to like me and feeling it was i was ready to let go

188
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,679
of it but i go and meditate and meditation not to have this feeling of wholeness and

189
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:50,720
goodness and deep some deep deep satisfying feeling of just being alive kind of

190
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:56,240
and so that going back and forth between that um between this radical alternative to

191
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,679
wanting people like me and this that was kind of like reconditioning me whatever conditioning

192
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,720
i had growing up that that was difficult that led me to want

193
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:13,200
everyone to like me in meditation that was being reconditioned by this that something was changing and

194
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:20,080
shifting for me and uh

195
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,120
anyway so i know that i mean i i could say i could go on all night for 50 years and

196
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:32,000
tell you but that that's what comes to mind the kind of beginning years of the things so is that uh relatable for you yes very

197
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,840
much thank you so much it's definitely a good journey it's definitely a wonderful thing to go

198
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,120
through their phases and and uh yeah

199
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,880
it's uh it's one of the greatest things in my life is to have done doing this practice and

200
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,320
you know where it's taken me and brought me and things i've discovered and got to see and

201
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:00,600
it's you know it's been the greatest thing thank you

202
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,840
so this is kind of actually a segue uh i think that will move on from teresa's

203
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,960
question i actually happened to be listening to a dharma talk

204
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:32,080
that norman fisher gave at green gulch today while i was walking my dog and he started talking about you

205
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:37,200
and he was saying that he was talking about how

206
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:44,640
you received dharma transmission in zen but now you're a vipassana teacher and as someone who kind of has like a

207
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,320
foot in both camps myself i'm kind of curious about what made you ultimately

208
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:59,400
kind of make this commitment to to be a vipassana teacher rather than a zen teacher oh because of all your students

209
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:06,720
clearly all the people who came to practice and were studied coming wanting to get to vipassana teachings for me and they were so such sincere

210
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:14,240
practitioners and it was so clear that how good it was to be that had a big a lot to do with it

211
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,280
um and my idea of right as you know i

212
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:26,080
i came to go to stanford in 1990 and i was also being trained to be vipassana teacher then

213
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,080
and i was still doing zen training and there was a small sitting group in palo

214
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:38,400
alto and i was asked to take it over and be kind of a teacher for it and that group grew and grew

215
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:45,200
and my plan was at some point it was growing and i said okay i think the plan is to i want to grow it

216
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:52,480
big enough so that i can invite another teacher and i can leave

217
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,360
i wanted to live in the country someplace and um but then uh you know i've been out here

218
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:05,679
32 years so i haven't left yet um and so it was um but at some point it

219
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:11,120
became clear for about seven years that i wasn't going anywhere because

220
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,960
i felt a commitment to the people who were here and practicing and and

221
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,559
so we had a meeting where i wanted i wanted them to know that i was making a commitment to be to

222
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:29,280
be a teacher for the group but i didn't have any expectations or you know requests i just wanted them to

223
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,520
know that's what i was making this big life change life decision so at that meeting i said that and then

224
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,600
somehow the meeting kind of quickly unfolded to it we should get a center

225
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,799
and so then we started this process to buy this place it took about five years

226
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:54,000
to do it so that's not your question uh the question is oh the zen be pasta thing

227
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,440
well norman fisher

228
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,799
he has a dual allegiance too you know did he confess in that talk oh he did

229
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,520
not oh i hope he's listening on youtube

230
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:15,440
he's deeply immersed in judaism and i don't know exactly what his

231
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,480
connection to judaism but i think he's very deeply connected in his heart and

232
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,919
his best friend for until he died was a rabbi and so

233
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:32,720
um so this idea of you know having it being in two traditions is there's lots of room for that

234
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,360
in buddhism

235
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:45,679
so to be more specific to your question i never made a

236
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:53,120
in the early years of doing this i didn't make a definitive decision to i loved zen i had no i really had no

237
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,960
trouble with it i'm actually i felt very at home in it i was ordained as a zen priest and uh

238
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:05,919
and uh it worked really well for me but then we had um

239
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,760
a back in the 1980s there was a whole slew

240
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,480
of buddhist teachers who had ethical challenges to say it politely

241
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,679
and and that was the abbott of san francisco zen center was one of those

242
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:29,279
and so when he uh kind of was that happened

243
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:36,000
that kind of freed me up from zen center to go and i went to japan to practice in japan

244
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,320
and uh but while i was in japan i oh and when i got my airplane ticket to go

245
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,760
to japan i knew i had to leave japan after some months to get a new visa

246
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,120
and i discovered that for 25 dollars more i can get it then it would cost a

247
00:25:53,120 --> 00:26:01,360
round-trip ticket from san francisco to japan i could get a round-trip ticket to bangkok with free stopovers in japan

248
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,640
both ways and so i knew i had to leave japan to get the visa a new visa

249
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:13,679
i thought that's really cheap 25 to go get out come and so and so um i got a round trip ticket to

250
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:20,640
bangkok so after being in japan for about three months i'm you know working in monasteries

251
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:26,880
there and i flew to bangkok and and and i and i

252
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,559
knew that uh i was as a zen priest then and i was

253
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:38,880
beginning to have conversations with people who had meditation experiences i hadn't had

254
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:46,000
and they thought i didn't feel like i needed to have them but as people coming to talk to me i felt i needed to know the map of practice

255
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,400
and i knew that in thailand the map of my practice was in some ways much more

256
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,080
clearly laid out than they ever do in zen so i think i'll go to i'll just while

257
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:04,960
i'm waiting for my visa i'll go visit different the monasteries and talk to the teachers and find out that map

258
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,159
but then i decided when i got there no i'm just going to go to one monastery

259
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:16,080
and just say i'm here tell me what to do and so i had a little address for a dog

260
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,279
patch little meditation monastery in the edges of bangkok dog patch means kind of archaic

261
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:28,559
and pigs running around and all kinds of interesting things going on

262
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:35,360
and i showed up and the guy said teacher said okay here's a little hut for you to live in

263
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:42,159
and you all day long you just do sitting meditation and welcome meditation and come and talk to me in the morning

264
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:48,000
and it's okay so i was happy to do that and so i was waiting for the visa to

265
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,600
come and it took me 10 weeks to realize the visa is not coming

266
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:59,440
and then i realized i could i could go back to japan now and i'll get another six months under you know without a visa or

267
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,799
something so i can you know to finish my year there but those 10 weeks it was like 10 week

268
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:10,640
retreats and um i'd never sat in silence that long the most i'd sat in zen is seven

269
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,559
days so to do it for 10 weeks was a and i got more concentrated than i ever

270
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:21,760
been before and i touched something uh inside that

271
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,799
i'd never touched before and it became essential to touch that again and it was kind of when i left

272
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:34,799
there was kind of a dark night of the soul time i went back to united states but all i could think about was go back because i

273
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:40,799
didn't know anywhere else to touch that place again except through that practice

274
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:46,080
and so uh and so as quickly as i could i i worked

275
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:52,159
at a restaurant fast food restaurant for a while to earn the money and when i had the money i went back and this time i knew that the

276
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:57,600
meditation practice i had studied for in thailand came from burma so i decided to go up to the

277
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,520
headquarters this the source and um but you know i hadn't i wasn't leaving

278
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,880
then it was just like it was just accidentally discovered accidentally set

279
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,000
a 10-week retreat it made an impression on me that changed

280
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:20,320
me so i had i had no choice but to continue with it so i did and that was next retreat was

281
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:27,440
eight months long and that made a huge impact to me it was a life-changing event for me

282
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,480
and and then i came back to zen center and

283
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:38,720
actually i didn't come back what happened was in those eight months i hope i'm not boring you

284
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:45,440
it's okay stories like this so san francisco zen center is where i practiced but when i was on that eighth

285
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,799
month retreat i got really really quiet and deep and

286
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:56,080
still it was really you know and then i would still have these little thoughts

287
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,840
and i had thoughts about zen center and positions in zen center an advancement in zen center this teacher

288
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:09,440
at zen center and you know it was all these zen center intrigue kind of thoughts and i said gail what in the world how

289
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,679
did the world did zen center get into the depth of your psyche and i made a vow i'm not going to go

290
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:22,640
back to zen center until i i've zen center out of my mind so i went back came back to us from

291
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,880
burma and um i wasn't planning to be back at zen center but i had a girlfriend

292
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,240
and she really wanted to live she was she had psychological challenges

293
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:41,279
of and so she really wanted to live at zen center and so i went back to zen center to live

294
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:47,279
with her and then i stayed for another year year and a half and

295
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:53,039
and then i went and then i was ready to go back and continue with the vipassana practice

296
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:58,159
and so i went to the three-month retreat at the ims but by that time they wanted me to come

297
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:04,559
be a shouso the head monk at sahara it's kind of like a rite of passage for just in the cups cusp of being a zen

298
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:11,360
teacher and i said you know i didn't have anything going you know i wasn't like i was i had a career

299
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,880
it wasn't like i was had ambitions you know i just wanted to

300
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,278
practice and so i was delighted to go back and be the sad monk

301
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,480
and then it felt enough i'd done 10 years of intensive practice modest monastic practice

302
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,240
so then i thought i need to figure out i'm not it doesn't make sense to go back to zen center but it makes sense now to find but what

303
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,559
am i going to do i'm a zen priest i'm dedicated to the dharma that's what i want my life to be about

304
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:49,440
and how do i get make a living or what am i going to do and so i decided i would get a master's in religious

305
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:56,320
studies specializing in buddhism so that i could teach in a community college like an intro class to buddhism

306
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,799
so i went to get a masters and while i was there

307
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:08,880
uh jack cornfield called me up and i hardly knew him i met him once

308
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:15,200
talked to my phone on the phone once and uh he invited me into his teacher training

309
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,919
and then i had this very strange very can you can't hear this

310
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,799
they said that my life came together it's like wow so of course i said yes i mean who would

311
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:34,240
who wouldn't say yes to that to study with jack to be a teacher like that i wasn't really thinking so much that i

312
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:40,000
would be a teacher maybe i don't know what i was thinking but i just like just oh this is right

313
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,279
and then i came back to the bay area and was it living at zen center and studying with jack and

314
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:53,519
so it was like i was always in and out it wasn't like i chose one or the other and uh

315
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:59,679
and then i started studying to get dharma transmission from mel weitzman

316
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:06,159
there's antiqued my zen teacher and he knew i was being trained to be vipassana teacher

317
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,200
and then at some point i got this it's called dharma transmission

318
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,240
authorization to be a zen teacher but um usually the understanding is when you

319
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:23,519
get this dharma transmission in zen you're kind of responsible to pass the the lineage on to the next person like

320
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,640
pass it down but mel gave me a dharma transmission and he said to me because he

321
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,000
um i'm giving this to you with no expectation

322
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:41,919
you have this other path that i trust you i trust what you're doing and and you do what you see is fit

323
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:48,159
and and then so i wasn't living at zen center anymore and uh

324
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:54,880
and being outside of zen center they didn't really invite me back to teach much i had something to do with them but

325
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:01,279
but the vipassana world invited me to do a lot of teaching and so i entered into it

326
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:08,079
and i studied it a lot and studied the teachings the early teachings of the buddha and i felt a strong affinity to

327
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:14,320
it and and right now i feel a strong affinity to these early teachings more than i do

328
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,919
to the zen teachings and so what i say to what i said i said to myself or say to

329
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:26,638
people is that in a kind of way zen is my religion

330
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,158
and theravada or vipassana is my practice is that kind of different however i'm

331
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,838
not very interested in religion

332
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:43,679
i'm interested in the practice and this this is the my the practice tradition i'm really practicing it now but i love

333
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,599
zen i'm very grateful for it and i stay connected to san francisco and

334
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:56,878
my gratitude resent center is really great so i have this commitment if they ask me for something i say yes i try to say yes

335
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:02,560
so does that tell you kind of the convoluted story of my connection between the two yeah i've

336
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:10,400
been so curious so that was really interesting and super nosy this is very satisfying

337
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,640
thank you

338
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:21,280
someone else said something over here did you have a question

339
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,560
i kind of answered it okay

340
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,799
and then

341
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:42,480
um so you said you went swimming and you hold it up kind of yeah you said you went swimming earlier yeah what's

342
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,800
what's your relationship and connection to swimming and meditation what do you see in the overlaps of those

343
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,040
oh i know there's people who are swimmers who feel like that's what they have what

344
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,800
they do they meditate they get concentrated they get absorbed and just really right there with a swimming

345
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:07,200
i'm not a swimmer like that i just swim because i enjoy swimming and

346
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,839
i like the exercise and and i have a little year and a half ago i got a

347
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:18,880
cataract surgery and so now i can for the first time in

348
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,839
like 50 years or more i can see when i'm in the

349
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:32,400
water because they don't eat without glasses and it's so wonderful to um swim now in this lake up here that

350
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:39,119
is outdoors in the lake and i just like look around at the trees and they have green herons sometimes there

351
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,640
and they have ducks and i swim sometimes it depends how i swim if i'm crawling i look around it's so

352
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:49,839
nice and then i do the breath then i do know when i do breaststroke i look around my

353
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:55,359
crawl i don't look so i just [Music]

354
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:01,920
swim and with this mindfulness practice that i do it's kind of i've done it so long that

355
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,760
it's second nature for me so no matter what i'm doing i'm being attentive

356
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:16,079
to what i'm what's happening with me but i'm not using swimming as a means of concentration or getting quiet

357
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:23,680
the those are all great states but the primary thing i'm interested in these days in terms of phases

358
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:28,720
i've been i've had so many wonderful states of mind and concentration states and

359
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:36,480
all kinds of things and they're they're great but that's not the point the point is not to suffer

360
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:43,359
it's to be a and to be just to have some feeling of freedom to be able to kind of have that freedom

361
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:50,480
as a as a current is a threat that goes through everything we do and so i'm swimming and

362
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:57,520
and one of the primary practices i do whatever i'm doing including swimming is it could be summarized by a simple

363
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:03,040
question am i am i suffering

364
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,160
and if i am then i stop and take a good look at that and i practice with that

365
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:15,119
but if i'm not suffering if i'm having fun i'll just continue doing what i'm doing

366
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:21,599
and i think i think swimming is fun is that uh how's that answer for you

367
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:27,280
i mean every answer so far has been amazing so i can't complain

368
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:34,640
great maybe if we have one more time for one

369
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:39,520
more question if anyone would like to ask or comment or

370
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,040
you want to ask or you have a question from chat great do you want to can we

371
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,079
have the mic back so that maybe sveta can read it

372
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,720
so we have a question from robin [Music]

373
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:08,240
i have a question could you speak about setting intentions at the start of your meditation practice uh can i speak about

374
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:14,640
using intention at the start of setting intent heading intention and start a meditation practice

375
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:21,279
yeah it's some people i've done it and it's some people find it tremendously helpful

376
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:29,520
to be conscious about the intentions that you live by one of the questions one of the uh ways

377
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:35,119
i've understood i stood i learned one things i learned from zen practice is that

378
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:41,760
to to be investigating considering what is my deepest intentions

379
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:48,400
uh it was one year that uh yeah anyway uh what's the deepest intention you want to live your life by don't take your

380
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,400
life for granted kind of reflect and what's the deepest heart wish or the deepest thing that you want to do and

381
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,640
and so this deep intention and so to live with that intentionally maybe why not follow your deepest intention

382
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,400
are you scared are you do you have some kind of ambition or greed for something else or but what

383
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:13,119
about your deepest intention i think it's the one of the greatest resources we have and i trust it very much

384
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:18,640
if i keep asking questions what is in there what's is there something deeper than that something deeper than that

385
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:23,680
and i spent a whole year asking that question every day

386
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:30,319
and uh it was phenomenal useful to do that and were phases that i went through asking that question asking the question

387
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:37,200
every day and and so as we get in touch with some

388
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:43,119
intentions that are important for us then it's uh interesting at the beginning of meditation

389
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,560
to uh remind oneself of that intention and then make maybe make that the

390
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,839
context for why you're practicing so you know

391
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:59,359
or it could be the deepest intention is um the way to reach it is through

392
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:06,160
becoming more concentrated or becoming more mindful or more clear and so to set an intention at the

393
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,440
beginning of a meditation is um is a little bit like

394
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:18,319
setting a direction for yourself but there's many ways of doing it but the way that i found it most useful

395
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:25,040
is to set the intention at the beginning and then don't think about it again

396
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:32,560
and it works a little bit like um uh it sets the mood sets the kind of general container for what we're doing

397
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,079
and so it's kind of like rather than going along merrily and whatever motivations you're living your

398
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:44,079
day by and there's a real much bigger shift then to really be here intentionally to

399
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,520
be to practice but also uh it works a little bit like um

400
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:56,160
some people have the experience of going to sleep at night and saying to themselves i'm going to wake up at 5 00

401
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:01,440
a.m and without an alarm clock and boom at 5 am they wake up

402
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,400
and so there's something about setting an intention going to sleep the intention kind of can survive and live

403
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,880
and be expressed somehow in the subconscious you know that kind of offline and because we're sleeping

404
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,880
so sometimes setting an intention in meditation can be the same thing you said it

405
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,079
you set the direction the course you're going and then you don't think about it anymore

406
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:32,560
trusting that something has been set in place in the deep conscious parts of the mind

407
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:41,040
and then sometimes you'll be surprised about how it kind of is there to support you or guide you or open new things up

408
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,640
so i think it's it's a fun thing to do to practice with intention

409
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:53,119
but you don't want to get busy with it don't have too much high expectations of

410
00:42:53,119 --> 00:43:00,160
what it can do for you but it's a wonderful thing to do so i hope that was okay

411
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:06,079
so it's uh just about nine o'clock so thank you

412
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,680
and uh thank you for accommodating me not coming with a talk maybe this is probably nicer

413
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,680
it was nice for me so thank you for coming and and um

414
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:23,119
and we're going to uh probably change the

415
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:30,640
for july change the protocol for coming into one for the the sittings here monday

416
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:35,680
so it'll be posted or you know i think you'll probably get an email you're probably all registered

417
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:40,720
right you get the email so it'll you'll be notified about the change it'll be easier to come

418
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,560
and now you probably will stop doing the sign up so um it'll change and it'll stay in

419
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:55,000
july when we get to july so thank you very much
