8
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:23,640

9
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,759
um Global Sangha here all together

10
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,900
so we will begin momentarily um

11
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,619
diving through our meditation

12
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:59,040
and so if you like to join me [Music] um please find a posture that's a

13
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:06,439
supportive of her um meditative for practice for about half an hour

14
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:17,940
yeah to begin maybe you just if your eyes are still on the computer

15
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,040
screen is allow the chat messages to flow

16
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:30,599
through soft eyed

17
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:36,620
feeling a sense of a Sangha right here

18
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,519
now we're practicing together as a community

19
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:48,260
an ancient tradition

20
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:57,120
and when you're ready you can gently close your eyes

21
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,819
or look down softly

22
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:17,659
allow our energy in the thinking

23
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,420
planning to turn inward

24
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,980
this meditation is an explicit

25
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:41,400
form to gather our attention

26
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:45,739
collect our attention

27
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:53,959
so we're entering into here and now

28
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,459
deliberate and kind

29
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,720
of feeling and sensing the global

30
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:34,520
sense of the body sitting lying down

31
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:49,880
in different dimensions of our being heart mind and body

32
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:57,380
began to come together as a whole

33
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,699
maybe a sense of all Gathering into

34
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:13,759
and through the posture we're taking

35
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,180
the pelvic floor the lower half of the body

36
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,320
feel steady set out

37
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,680
grounded

38
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,300
earthy body resting on Earth

39
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:07,400
from a grounded a place there is a natural uplift in the Torso

40
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:13,759
all the way through neck head

41
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:34,740
and it feels as you've all aspects all around

42
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,919
Within ourselves and out outside of ourselves

43
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:48,379
are gathering here through the body

44
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:13,680
what a wonder that the Earth's element is naturally grounding

45
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:21,479
settling and relatively unmoving

46
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:33,680
offering grounding for our heart to mind right here

47
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,539
the Stillness in the body is a felt

48
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:54,138
right here

49
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:07,159
borrowing an image on my teacher

50
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,440
like a stones in the riverbed

51
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:25,220
quiet Stillness is felt

52
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:38,360
maybe there is a hint of it

53
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,760
are just a hint of a possibility

54
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,939
however it may show up for you

55
00:09:30,019 --> 00:09:37,640
Stillness in the body naturally highlights the movements

56
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:43,579
without looking for or searching

57
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:51,680
it's natural the movements of the body to be known

58
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,680
movements of the breath

59
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:07,760
the sound vibration of the sounds

60
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,459
tinkling Sensations

61
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:27,019
maybe on the fingertips Palms

62
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:41,880
areas of Stillness in the body there is a movement

63
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,839
in the body

64
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:19,820
feeling and sensing the movements

65
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:32,040
feeling and sensing is a raw

66
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:39,180
Direct without the need for

67
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:43,759
words ideas

68
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,339
whatever you feel is just right

69
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,560
letting go of the judgments comparisons

70
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,860
evaluations

71
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:38,300
resting in the Simplicity of your experience

72
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,600
noticing

73
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:36,120
rather than knowing capacity or the knowing

74
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,579
of the movements can be quiet

75
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:44,779
and distill

76
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:21,440
emotions and thoughts they may pull through

77
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:30,360
you may feel it somatically energetically

78
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:47,060
as some sort of movements wavelets in the body

79
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:54,199
and just in the energetic field

80
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:12,000
there is a Stillness silence

81
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:16,220
in the knowing

82
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,860
in the feeling

83
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:27,440
in the sensing

84
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,959
emotions can be strong

85
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:07,220
or mild and soft

86
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:19,139
however it is quietly

87
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:26,060
lovingly receiving them

88
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,459
being available

89
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:44,940
[Music] shifts

90
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:50,639
changes in the inner ecology

91
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,480
of our being

92
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,960
this Stillness and quiet that you feel

93
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,240
do not need a location

94
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:04,400
may feel pervasive all around

95
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,640
while the movements in the body mind and heart

96
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,900
are happening

97
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:41,299
if the Mind becomes busy

98
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:51,559
this body is a refuge

99
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:04,080
you're always return to the felt sense

100
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,640
of the Earth element

101
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,460
s in the riverbed

102
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,520
movements of the breath

103
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:34,158
a quiet humming in the body

104
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:26,960
being available to feel

105
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:32,360
sense deeply

106
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:10,799
in this line that my their drama buddy

107
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,980
said in the last Retreat stayed with me

108
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:25,380
our practice is not about

109
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,460
feeling good

110
00:25:33,539 --> 00:25:39,840
instead or cultivating

111
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:46,400
a capacity to feel deeply

112
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:04,880
and feel and sense the depth of our being

113
00:26:06,299 --> 00:26:11,960
the vastness of our being

114
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:19,740
noticing not the Stillness and the movements

115
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,720
have no boundaries

116
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:53,419
Flux Of happenings are just a flux of the happiness

117
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,778
center of a Stillness is everywhere

118
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:45,020
maybe this is a hint my hint of a hint

119
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,559
my hint of a possibility

120
00:28:55,799 --> 00:29:00,380
just being easily satisfied

121
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,019
however it is for you

122
00:30:09,779 --> 00:30:18,860
the dance of Our Lives happen in all forms

123
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:26,340
all kinds of shapes texture

124
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:42,860
being available

125
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:13,398
warm welcome of all forms

126
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:40,640
in a warm welcome that's all forms in all beings

127
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:24,260
deep bounds to each other to ourselves

128
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:32,640
into the possibility of a boundless

129
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,679
loving quiet hearts

130
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,599
[Music]

131
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,760
foreign

132
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:59,120
for me to transition into

133
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:09,320
a Dharma talk the dharmette and today I brought

134
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:17,899
a story of a modern day Giant in the terravada we discussing

135
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:25,138
and I use the word Giant to describe

136
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:33,658
how she was a human being with immense heart mind qualities

137
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:38,700
immense goodness in her heart and mind

138
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:44,220
even though physically she's quite small

139
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:51,419
and so this is the story of dipaman

140
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:58,080
I'm going to show the pictures some of you might know her or

141
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:05,160
no aphaher or maybe have read the book or heard the stories about her in various

142
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:13,880
Dharma talks and so why dipama

143
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:22,280
I want to start with a story and this is a story told by

144
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:29,640
Maria Monroe who's one of the senior teravada practitioners in the western

145
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:36,000
teravada scene and this was the time when dipama and

146
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:44,579
Maria were on an airplane coming to the United States from India a flight was

147
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:49,859
very turbulent at one point the flight hit an air

148
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:55,260
pocket and dropped as the drinks and stuff all flew up in

149
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:00,260
the ceiling and um

150
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:10,020
you know it took a moment for the airplane to finally settle to kind of a stable air

151
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:18,119
and so Maria kind of screamed a bit and diploma was sitting right across the

152
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:24,480
aisle from her and so she reached out and took her her hand

153
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:31,980
and it just held it and then at some point

154
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:42,260
and a deep amount whispered to her the daughters of the Buddha are fearless

155
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:52,220
this is Steve among The Fearless daughter of the Buddha

156
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,940
so what was her path how did she come to

157
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:05,480
this possibility of fearlessness

158
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:16,320
and so she was born 1911 in India and passed away in 1989 that her life

159
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,660
actually overlapped with mine and so I kind of there is some sort of a

160
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:29,160
warmth in my heart um connecting to this and so she got

161
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:35,760
married when she was 12 12 year old and maybe this was

162
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:42,060
kind of the way back then and she moved with her husband from

163
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:48,359
India to Burma because he had a work in Burma

164
00:37:48,359 --> 00:37:53,400
and I in the early years maybe not just early

165
00:37:53,400 --> 00:38:00,000
for a couple of decades she wasn't able to conceive to have the babies

166
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:07,740
was not until mid-30s she began to be able to conceive

167
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:16,140
that was a daunting period as well she lost two babies

168
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:24,839
early on shortly after birth and I was only able to keep one daughter

169
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:33,359
and this daughter's name is Deepa and so she's known as the mother of the of the

170
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:41,119
daughter Deepa and so her name is known as dipama

171
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:49,320
and so you can see this was immensely painful for people

172
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:55,260
and so she got very sick she had heart disease high blood

173
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:01,680
pressure other things so she was bedridden for many months she couldn't

174
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:07,380
get out and her husband was a very kind soul and

175
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:15,359
very gentle and kind and loving and so uh he um

176
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:21,359
not only had to take care of the deepama and the Deepa but also had to work

177
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:29,160
through time in order to keep the family going so one day he came home

178
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:34,160
not feeling well and died

179
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:42,240
so this was a a Breaking Point

180
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:49,140
and dipama was in her early 50s without health

181
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:59,119
work support and had to support her young daughter

182
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:06,319
and without health and so she didn't know what to do anymore

183
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:14,579
and ever since she was a little girl so she always wanted it to meditate so she

184
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:21,060
decided that she had to go visit a meditation center in Burma uh she didn't

185
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:26,420
know what else to do so she sorted out all her belongings

186
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:33,540
and give it to her neighbor and asked them to take care of the depot

187
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:40,859
and in her own mind she thought she would never return probably

188
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:46,200
and so she went on to her first Meditation Retreat

189
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,740
when she arrived at the center she was offered with some basic meditation

190
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:56,940
instructions and a room and so she began to practice

191
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:04,500
and very quickly she got very concentrated and she was so concentrated that one day

192
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:12,300
she didn't realize a dog was biting her leg she couldn't move she just saw a

193
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:20,099
thought she couldn't move for her leg but she wasn't aware that the dog was biting her leg

194
00:41:20,099 --> 00:41:25,700
not until she turned around and looked dead the dog

195
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:32,160
while the kids and you know the dog bites made her very

196
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:38,820
weak and so she was sent home and she didn't complete her first

197
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:44,940
retreat and yet just with some of this basic

198
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:50,099
meditation instructions and she began to practice at home

199
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:59,760
whenever and however she was able to do it and she also had an opportunity to

200
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:08,579
um meet a teacher who actually spoke her own language in her home state

201
00:42:08,579 --> 00:42:16,440
I didn't mention that you know and she was a living or in Burma and and she

202
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,780
didn't speak the local language that was yet another challenge

203
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:28,859
and so this new teacher whose name is anagarika munindraji

204
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:34,020
I taught her meditation

205
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:41,940
um and so with this instructions she progressed rather quickly and

206
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:47,160
dramatically within Sometimes some period of time

207
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:53,160
and the Dharma began to transform her in ways that

208
00:42:53,160 --> 00:43:02,460
she could never have imagined first her blood pressure was gone

209
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:08,460
high blood pressure was gone and she was no longer so sickly all the

210
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:13,520
time and she had much more energy

211
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:20,819
and this uh offered such immense trust and faith in

212
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:28,260
the practice and quickly she had a deep insights into

213
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:33,900
the Dharma and so she just gave herself completely over

214
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:42,180
to the practice and so this was um what was that in the

215
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:49,020
um descriptions about her as even as a widowed a single mother

216
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:56,040
trying to undertake her spiritual path within the confines of a patriarchal and

217
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:02,640
a hierarchical buddhistamanastic system Department never doubted that she could

218
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:08,700
reach the highest to go at that time and place there was no such

219
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:18,078
thing as the woman's Liberation movement dipama simply liberated herself

220
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:23,819
and so she once remarked I had no fear

221
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:28,940
and I am at peace now

222
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:42,980
and so that was such an immense transformation that became possible for her

223
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:51,839
and that's in the midst of the ups and downs the turmoilers of her life

224
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:58,319
and indeed a deeper continue to face all kinds of challenges

225
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:03,900
uh after this period of life in Burma

226
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:10,160
in 1967 56 year old

227
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:15,960
Burma and Burmese government asked all foreigners to leave the country

228
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:21,240
and she had to leave with her daughter to go back to India

229
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:30,740
and so they moved into a tiny small apartment in Calcutta and that's where dipama

230
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:39,079
began her Dharma teaching career in this tiny apartment

231
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:47,359
maybe one of the most significant equalities of dipama was

232
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:53,040
embodied the Dharma and she taught her students

233
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:59,980
whatever you're doing be aware of it ironing nursing cooking

234
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:06,119
[Music] nothing is outside of the practice domain

235
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:13,800
and so one of her students said she's the patron saint of the

236
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:21,839
householders I was a very athlete uplifting for me

237
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:26,940
and in a way that kind of she's a Superhero

238
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:32,339
woman in my heart if I'm allowed to have a superhero in my

239
00:46:32,339 --> 00:46:40,079
state of I guess a field of consciousness and so her teachings in some ways change

240
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:45,839
the how I practiced I remember shortly after giving birth to

241
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:53,180
my son I realized that my life was more or less kind of turned upside down with

242
00:46:53,180 --> 00:47:00,359
diapers bottles sleepless nights and hormone changes in the body and all

243
00:47:00,359 --> 00:47:05,579
sorts of things and it was a phase of my life where I

244
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:12,599
had so much enthusiasm for retreat practice and it was very clear that I couldn't do

245
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:20,700
the kind of retreat practice that I used to do so that was devastating to me

246
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:26,880
but I remembered dipama and she taught the nursing mothers to

247
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:33,780
practice while they were nursing she taught the busy students to practice and where they were in school

248
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:40,220
and somehow remembering the stories opened myself up

249
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:46,980
to a whole new way of practicing that I never imagined

250
00:47:46,980 --> 00:47:54,420
I began to realize oh there may be kind of new possibilities for me here

251
00:47:54,420 --> 00:48:02,240
and I decided that I wasn't going to wait for the next retreat

252
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:07,400
and the practice can start where I was

253
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:14,579
and so that was um kind of a turning moment for my Dharma

254
00:48:14,579 --> 00:48:19,680
Journey and my practice began to expand

255
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:26,280
gradually and little by little I wanted to say emphasize on this word

256
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:33,720
gradually because it wasn't like it was life-changing in the moment it was a

257
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:39,200
gradual process and it's still on voting even to the state

258
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:47,059
but as I opened to all these different forms of a practice in my life and

259
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:53,819
um it enriched my practice deepened it

260
00:48:53,819 --> 00:48:59,060
and I had so much confidence and Trust in it

261
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:08,660
and says this were the teachings of the deepama a profound householder Drama teacher

262
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:18,480
and she was said that um A's path wasn't attached to a particular

263
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:24,180
place teacher lifestyle or the monastic model

264
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:29,359
the world was her monastery

265
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:36,900
and she was a teacher for many or as she taught some of the senior

266
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:43,440
Western teravada teachers in our own lineage in Jack cornfield

267
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,680
Joseph Augustine Sharon sasberg

268
00:49:50,339 --> 00:49:58,460
and she had taught a three-month retreat in inside meditation Society

269
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:06,720
but I want to wrap up this week's great women disciples stories of the

270
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:12,260
Buddha by saying that

271
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:20,280
stories are not meant to intimidate us ask us to become them

272
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:26,099
or something like that I'd like to read the afterword in this

273
00:50:26,099 --> 00:50:33,260
dipama book that I was showing that's written by Jack hornfield

274
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:40,500
who summarized the point that I I was hoping to make much better than what I

275
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:46,280
could come up with and this is what he said

276
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:53,700
simply beings whether they are the Dalai Lama Mother Teresa dipama

277
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:59,940
or a thousand unknown simply beings living among ourselves

278
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:05,099
share the same fundamental characteristics of selflessness

279
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:13,700
great compassion and a peace each one of us can carry deepamas Legacy

280
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:19,740
in terms of having that much peace and love

281
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:28,020
it takes its own time yet it's possible for anyone

282
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:37,619
in the end the point is not to be like dipama or some other great Yogi or Saint

283
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:45,420
you might read about or hear about the point is something much more

284
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:54,300
difficult to be yourself and to discover that all you seek

285
00:51:54,300 --> 00:52:02,059
is to be found Here and Now in your own heart

286
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:07,889
thank you everyone [Music]

287
00:52:14,730 --> 00:52:17,840
