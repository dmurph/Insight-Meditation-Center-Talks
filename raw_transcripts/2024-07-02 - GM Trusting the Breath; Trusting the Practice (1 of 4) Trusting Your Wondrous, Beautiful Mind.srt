00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,960
greetings dear sa thank you for your kind comments in

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:17,279
the chat yesterday uh But be sure to let me know if you have any suggestions for

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:23,359
improvement this week our meditations will be guided by the Buddha's own

4
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:29,480
instructions on mindfulness of breathing drawn from his foundational

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,480
discourse on Buddhist practice the

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,879
anap we started yesterday actually with the introduction to this

7
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:50,600
discourse which is on the key practice that's at the heart of the Buddhist

8
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,879
path in which the Buddha tells us to go to some place empty in order to

9
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,559
establish awareness some place

10
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:10,880
uncared and with a mind that's empty of self-

11
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:18,600
preoccupation the Buddha then instructs Us by summarizing his entire discourse

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,000
on mindfulness of breathing as follows always

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,680
attentive one breathes in with awareness and breathes out

14
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:37,960
with awareness so our effort today is to rest

15
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:44,680
the mind with continuous Awareness on the entire process the

16
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:53,000
whole cycle of breathing we want to know

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,640
intimately how we're experiencing the beginning

18
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:14,360
the beginning and end of each exhale and the pause after the exhale for the next

19
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,440
whole cycle begins

20
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:27,879
again of course the mind is likely to wander away from the breath and that's

21
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:33,800
okay as soon as you see that the mind has

22
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:41,200
wandered then without any irritation or frustration just come back

23
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:48,280
lovingly to your breathing always attentive we breathe in

24
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,239
with awareness and breathe out with

25
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,840
awareness so begin by closing your

26
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:06,920
eyes or if you prefer just lowering your gaze and give yourself permission for

27
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,879
the next 30 minutes to leave all your worries

28
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,959
concerns obligations and responsibilities outside the door of

29
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:26,040
your meditation room allow yourselves to drop down into

30
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:34,040
the flow of your lived experience resting in being

31
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:43,159
here in the present moment and letting go of past and

32
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,439
future for these minutes of meditation the invitation is to drop the

33
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:55,879
burden of the ego so

34
00:03:55,879 --> 00:04:02,400
now set your intention your aspiration for this period of

35
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:10,599
meditation perhaps something as simple as may my practice serve as a condition

36
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:16,919
for awakening for myself and all

37
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:24,000
beings with such an aspiration is important to

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,720
know that you like all of us practicing here have the potential

39
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:38,880
for awakening so settling into a posture

40
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,639
that expresses your

41
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:01,320
intention posture that is grounded and balances being being both

42
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:10,160
relaxed and quietly energetic being friends with this

43
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:19,759
body offering it compassion as we do a brief fluid body

44
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:30,120
scan with this body however it is we can offer it our thanks our care

45
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,280
were supporting us and keeping us alive for all these

46
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:44,919
years so bringing appreciation and care to the body starting from the

47
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:50,199
head down through the neck

48
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,600
shoulders arms and

49
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,880
hands down through the Torso the

50
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,000
pelvis glowing down the thighs the lower

51
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,440
legs and the

52
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,919
feet our priority is to establish

53
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:28,199
Sati awareness that is embodied

54
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,759
and as continuous as the predominant quality of

55
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,960
the Mind

56
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,039
taking a deep Long satisfying

57
00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:11,400
breath and connecting with the flow of

58
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,910
breathing then letting the breath gently come back to

59
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:23,720
[Music] normal and discovering the

60
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:31,280
Rhythm and the texture of our natural way of breathing

61
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,280
our task during this meditation is to stay connected with the whole process of

62
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:54,199
breathing and to know the quality of the breath just as

63
00:07:54,199 --> 00:08:00,680
it is letting the breath

64
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,879
itself become our meditation

65
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:27,080
guide every breath is its own microcosm so see if you can stay with

66
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,880
the whole process of each inhale and each exhale

67
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,440
noticing the moment it starts how it grows then

68
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:46,120
Fades and finally ends with a slight pause

69
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,760
before the next one

70
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,440
begins as I mentioned yesterday I find it helpful to visualize the cycle of the

71
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:06,480
the breath as an energetic oval with the bottom of the oval at the

72
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:12,519
panum and the top at the crown of the head where there's a little

73
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:21,079
virtual opening in the skull so if this works for you you can

74
00:09:21,079 --> 00:09:28,480
visualize the in breath starting at the paranam then moving up the back as the

75
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:36,040
inhale begins [Music] and then Fades with a brief pause above the top

76
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:44,800
of the head where the out breath then starts and Cascades down the

77
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:53,079
face and the Torso then ending again in the

78
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,360
parum or the whole cycle begins again

79
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:07,720
we are resting in and trusting the whole process of breathing

80
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,920
naturally we don't need to intervene in any

81
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,920
way just letting the breath breathe

82
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,279
itself e

83
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:34,680
if visualizing this oal doesn't work for you another way I find it helpful to

84
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,120
stay with the breath is to use the in breath as a

85
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:50,480
reminder to connect with the body and the out breath as a reminder to

86
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
relax

87
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160

88

92
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:33,319
knowing the breath feel feels intentional

93
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:39,720
conscious spacious we start to know the details of

94
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,440
the breathing the texture of the

95
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,920
breath and its

96
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,319
Rhythm by staying with and trusting the

97
00:15:57,319 --> 00:16:05,360
breath we're cult AC ating our capacity for knowing the present

98

tenderly as a way of caring for our own

105
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720

123
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,759
attention to

124
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:24,760
this sending loving wishes of

125
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:30,760
well-being to everyone here medit meditating

126
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:42,000
together and now we return to our circle of compassion for ourselves and all

127
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:48,480
beings may all beings be safe and

128
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:55,279
protected being safe may all beings including

129
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:00,039
yourselves be happily at ease

130
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,158
PE may we all abide in

131
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:12,799
peace and may all beings everywhere be

132
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:24,679
free as I join my hands together and bow to you now I'm honoring your practice

133
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:36,339
[Music]

134
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:50,230
[Music]

135
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:02,069
[Music]

136
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,120
readings dear SAA is good to be here with you and

137
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:06,480
thank you for your kind comments in the chat yesterday but know that I'm uh

138
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:14,120
really interested also in hearing any suggestions for improvement you might

139
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:21,639
have so in the early texts the Buddha often describes the

140
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:28,200
mind as luminous and bright

141
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:36,080
Gil's teacher in Burma upand once said that the mind is like a

142
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:41,200
garden if neglected defilement weeds will

143
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:50,200
grow but if the plot is well tended it will be beautiful and

144
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,519
fruitful and this quote comes from a book of Up's

145
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:04,000
teachings which is called the State of Mind called

146
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,799
beautiful and the poly word for the noun

147
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:17,639
mind and the adjective for beautiful are the

148
00:32:17,639 --> 00:32:24,720
same cha so if I were to tell you in P that

149
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:32,200
your mind is beautiful I would would say it's Chang

150
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:41,039
Chang in the ancient text there's another word

151
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,159
kalana which also appears frequently and which is usually

152
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:54,760
translated as good or wholesome however it literally means

153
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:05,000
beautiful the word k is closely associated with virtue and inner

154
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,639
goodness and it's true that as we get in the habit of following the Buddhist

155
00:33:11,639 --> 00:33:20,039
precepts to abstain from taking life to abstain from taking what is not freely

156
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:26,799
given to abstain from doing harm with our sexuality

157
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:36,799
[Music] speech and from intoxicating the mind we gradually do purify our virtue

158
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:43,240
and inner goodness I'm in utter admiration of the

159
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:50,240
NS and monks I've practiced with because they all go to Such Great

160
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:57,200
Lengths to cause no harm painstakingly avoiding even the

161
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:04,080
slightest things that might cause harm to themselves or to

162
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:12,599
others and it's no exaggeration to say that they all move through their lives

163
00:34:12,599 --> 00:34:18,960
with Beauty in everything they do or

164
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:26,720
say I've heard Gil say that we all have the potential

165
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,839
inside for something amazingly beautiful a

166
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:39,919
treasure that can be discovered cultivated and grown

167
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:47,879
inside so let me read you a teaching that Gil gave in this forum the 7 amm

168
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,638
teachings he said in meditation practice we're touching into a capacity of the

169
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:04,160
mind to be beautiful and wondrous something that may border on or feel

170
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:12,440
sacred the great value of this practice is to discover a rich wondrous beautiful

171
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:18,079
inner life that can inform how we live in the

172
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:24,560
world I like to think that as we discover this wondrous inner life we get

173
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:31,280
turned inside out what was inside is no longer inside but

174
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:39,960
is something we share with the world around us oh thank you Gil for

175
00:35:44,359 --> 00:35:51,319
that and it's similar in the early texts the Buddha stresses that the

176
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:57,359
Dharma is Gana in the beginning Alana in the

177
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:05,599
middle and kalala in the end so literally our Dharma path is

178
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:13,480
beautiful in the beginning beautiful in the middle and beautiful in the

179
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,920
end we all have this capacity for inner

180
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:27,000
beauty and we need to trust the fact that our potential is

181
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,680
unlimited we all have the same

182
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:39,119
Birthright which is our enormous potential for goodness and

183
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:47,359
wisdom the Buddha also talked about being skilled in the beauty of

184
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:54,599
meditation and as you know in meditation we train and cultivating

185
00:36:55,319 --> 00:37:00,920
awareness and when we're fully aware the mind is

186
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,599
beautiful and what we do becomes

187
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:14,839
beautiful my beloved zen teacher shunu Suzuki taught me that instead of having

188
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:22,440
a deep understanding of the teaching we need strong confidence in

189
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:29,520
our teaching which says that originally we have Buddha nature

190
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:36,400
and that Buddhist practiced is based on this faith in our

191
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,560
Buddha nature so let me read you some quotes

192
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,200
from Suzuki rosion Buddha nature and big

193
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:55,680
mind our original mind includes everything within itself nothing comes from outside your

194
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:01,680
mind the true understanding is that the Mind includes

195
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:07,560
everything when you think something comes from outside it means only that

196
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:14,680
something appears in your mind nothing outside yourself can cause

197
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:20,640
any trouble you yourself make the waves in

198
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:27,800
your mind if you leave your mind as it is it

199
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:36,599
will become calm this mind is called Big mind and to exist in big

200
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:45,200
mind is an Act of Faith big mind is something you have not

201
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,640
something to seek for big mind is like the great

202
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:58,880
Sky whatever kind of bird flies through it this Sky doesn't care

203
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:14,440
so for me existing in big mind as an act of faith means that I deeply trust the

204
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:24,280
Dharma the practice is supporting me it's taking me in the right

205
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,880
direction and I'm hoping to convey to you that in this practice whatever kind of

206
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:37,359
bird you are you're okay it's just

207
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:44,480
fine and then in the world of Buddhist PR practitioners you have plenty of

208
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:53,400
company the Tibetan teacher PMA children Echoes Suzuki ri's words when she says

209
00:39:53,400 --> 00:40:01,440
our true nature is not semi-ideal that we have to live up up to is who we are right

210
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,520
now and that's what we can make friends with and

211
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:14,920
celebrate we already have what we need the wisdom the

212
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:23,359
strength the confidence the awakened heart and mind are always

213
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:28,440
accessible here now

214
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:37,000
always we're just uncovering them we're rediscovering them we're not

215
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:44,440
inventing them or importing them from somewhere else they're

216
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:55,280
here so this doctrine that our very essence is an unborn and undying

217
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:02,160
awareness is not limited to Mahayana and Tibetan

218
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:12,880
Traditions the ter terava Tha Forest teacher aan sha asserts that the original heart mind

219
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:19,680
shines like pure clear water with the sweetest

220
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:27,560
taste he often referred to the one who knows as a pointer

221
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:33,440
to the inherent wisdom within awareness

222
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:41,599
itself also in the Thai Forest tradition aan Mahaba says of

223
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:47,920
impermanence this vanishes that vanishes but that which knows they're

224
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:55,000
Vanishing doesn't vanish All That Remains is simple

225
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:02,359
awareness utterly pure and another teacher from our tradition

226
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:10,280
aan buddhadasa teaches that emptiness and mindfulness are

227
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:18,359
one most of us unconsciously identify as a separate threatened

228
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:24,760
deficient self but if we trust in the Dharma our practice will reveal the

229
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:30,200
freedom of our beautiful mind our true

230
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,800
nature our capacity to know and be aware is a beautiful

231
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,400
quality and one of the potentials of the Dharma is to be able to discover what's

232
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:50,960
beautiful inside and outside us to have eyes the inner eye and the physical eye

233
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,800
which is able to see what's beautiful

234
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:02,880
the quality of how we practice comes into play when we're looking at the

235
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:10,319
quality of the mind that's beautiful when we're aware we'll make

236
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:17,599
ethical choices do the necessary house cleaning and discover more of this

237
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:25,480
beauty that we already have so I'll close with the story of the

238
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:33,000
Musketeer very early in her life a musk deer began

239
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:40,680
to notice this heavenly scent in the air Intoxicated by this Divine Aroma she

240
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:46,839
set out to find the source she searched the depths of every

241
00:43:46,839 --> 00:43:53,920
Forest smelled around every tree every blade of grass and still couldn't

242
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,040
discover where this scent was coming from

243
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:06,160
she determined because the scent was So Glorious she knew deep down that she

244
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:13,680
would be profoundly happy once she finally found it she spent her whole life

245
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,760
searching and one day fell exhausted to the forest

246
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:25,200
floor and as she fell one of her horns pierced her own

247
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:34,640
belly suddenly the air was overwhelmingly flooded with this Divine Heavenly

248
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:40,839
scent after a lifetime of searching in the final moments of her

249
00:44:40,839 --> 00:44:48,160
precious life she realized the scent was coming from her

250
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,400
all

251
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:01,160
along you may have heard the Navajo tribe of Native Americans have a

252
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:09,839
concept of walking in Beauty so if you'd like a little homework for the next 24 hours you might

253
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:17,599
reflect on or try out how it might be to sit in

254
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:25,559
Beauty walk in Beauty stand in Beauty and lie down in

255
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:33,680
Beauty what might it be to live in

256
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:41,280
Beauty may your practice serve you in bringing light to your beautiful

257
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:48,800
mind and inner goodness thank you for your

258
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,640
attention thank you for your practice
