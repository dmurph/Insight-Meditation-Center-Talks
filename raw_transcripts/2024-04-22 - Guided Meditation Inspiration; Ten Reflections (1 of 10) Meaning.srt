1
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:09,040
so good morning good day everyone welcome to this Monday and I'm happy to be back after

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,599
having a two week vacation which is uh not so

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,880
often that I do something like that with my wife and um did a lot of

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:26,439
hiking and uh now happy to be here

5
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,439
so um

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,920
many years ago I met a monk in Thailand I was staying at a

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:48,120
monastery and um he was somehow known for his great

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,640
meditative accomplishments very deep practitioner and I met him and there was

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:01,920
something very special about looking into his eyes and seeing both this something had never seen such depth in

10
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:11,600
someone's eyes and such peace and um so I asked him what had he

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,880
attained in his years of monastic practice and his answer surprised me

12
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,439
given how the buildup of this is a person of great meditative

13
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,479
accomplishments and um maybe attainments and he said he had attained

14
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:34,680
not nonc contention and this was this was said in

15
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:43,000
Translation so I don't know what the PO exactly the tie word was but the translator said nonc

16
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,000
contention and that uh really made a big impression on me and one of the first

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,759
times that I was being introduced to this Insight practice was at that Monastery and so the here's idea of

18
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,640
non-c contention and the way that uh it's been

19
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,520
for me very inspiring to practice mindfulness for all the different

20
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:12,440
purposes that mindfulness can fulfill or can address and one of them is this

21
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:20,000
ability to uh sit with ourselves and not make anything worse simply to sit with a

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
respect a non-c contention a feeling the tremendous

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,959
value of non-reactive attention non-reactive clear

24
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,640
seeing that something very profound begins happening when we can see clearly

25
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:47,159
without being for and against and reacting not making it worse with our judgments just seeing clearly The Good

26
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:52,080
the Bad and the Ugly clear

27
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:58,239
seeing and just that is enough but then to learn that clear

28
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,080
seeing can lead to to freedom freedom from the reactivity freedom from our

29
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,319
attachments that the clear seeeing begins uprooting so many different

30
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:17,519
things ways that were attached and clinging and holding on and Afraid and resentful

31
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,840
and and these slowly maybe sometimes quickly to begin to fade and we find

32
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,959
ourselves free of these afflictions that can follow us for a lifetime

33
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,680
and so to see and know that this is the purpose of mindfulness this is the

34
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,920
possibility this is how mindfulness provides a tremendous sense of

35
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:48,799
meaning and to take it further and to realize how this non-c contentious

36
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,959
attention this freedom from Affliction allows us then to enter into

37
00:03:53,959 --> 00:04:00,560
the world in a deep way in a friendly way in a way that we don't

38
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,599
lead with fear we don't lead with aversion we don't lead with desires and

39
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:14,000
and uh wanting things from people but we lead with love with care with kindness

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:22,520
with respect so I mention these because one way to sit in mindfulness is

41
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,960
to really appreciate the value of mindfulness the importance of

42
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,280
it how meaningful it is and not perect purposeful it

43
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,240
is to awaken our inspiration that kind of fa faith that

44
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,280
is energizing us yes I will do this yes

45
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:51,479
I want to be here and inspiration yes this is important so that the other

46
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:59,880
things we're inspired to do with the mind to worry to be anxious to review the past to spin out

47
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,400
in fantasy that they don't have as much get

48
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:13,039
as much energy from our ourselves fuel from ourselves because

49
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:19,520
the fuel the energy of our life is inspired to go into

50
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,000
mindfulness so to assume a meditation

51
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,680
posture and to

52
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:41,400
now maybe not close the eyes right away unless you already have but rather to lower your

53
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,400
gaze and allow your eyes to be

54
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:52,080
soft soft eyes that may be gently float in the

55
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:59,639
sockets not fixating on anything not stuck on anything

56
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:07,199
soft eyes and now perhaps to gently close

57
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:14,680
your eyes letting the eyes be soft

58
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,680
gentle and taking a few gentle deep breaths just deep

59
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:33,759
enough so so it's not uncomfortable for you you so it's enjoyable for you to breathe

60
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,039
in

61
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,599
deeply exhaling as you relaxing as you

62
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,120
exhale and maybe in the way that you soften your eyes as you exhale

63
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:07,120
softening your body maybe softening the edges of where

64
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,919
you're tight

65
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,280
frozen stiff

66
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:38,319
and then letting your breathing return to normal and on the

67
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:46,080
exhale softening in the face around the

68
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:54,759
eyes on the exhale finding where there is softness in the

69
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:59,479
face and let that spread

70
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:12,520
and if there are places that are not soft it's okay let it be held in

71
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,199
softness on the exhale softening in the shoulders

72
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:41,839
on the exhale softening in the belly

73
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:13,519
and on the exhale softening in the mind as the Mind

74
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,800
softens maybe there's more space to be

75
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:28,160
inspired more space for faith in being present here and

76
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
now e

77
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,800
as you exhale to soften your

78
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:31,240
heart so that more of your life energy the energy of the heart

79
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:41,399
can be inspired to be attentive here and

80
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,560
now and then settling in in to be here and now with your

81
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:10,760
breathing having the breathing being at the center of all

82
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:20,360
things even if other things require attention breathe with those

83
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,040
things the massage of breath

84
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,000

85

e e

144
00:31:07,159 --> 00:31:12,158
so hello excuse

145
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:19,840
me hello everyone and welcome and

146
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:25,080
um I have a little

147
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:32,279
me I seem to have a little heness and um this

148
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:39,799
morning possible from traveling yesterday and possible from allergies the last week or

149
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:45,440
so team s that goes away usually goes away after a while in the

150
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,080
morning so um this this morning being Monday I'd

151
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:57,440
like to start a new series of teachings and I'll do that for the next

152
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:04,399
two weeks week so it's a 10p part series and it's um 10 areas of

153
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:11,200
reflection for a Dharma life and so each of these days we'll be

154
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:17,840
giving one of those 10 and I'm hoping that the words I say

155
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:23,279
will uh inspire you to think uh reflect on these

156
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:28,399
Concepts uh I'll be offering my own ideas uh about these concept Concepts as

157
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:35,120
go along but I don't want to offer them as being the definitive presentation this is what these things can be but

158
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,240
rather I want to uh bring up some things that you then will reflect on on your

159
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,720
own and and come up with ideas for yourself how it works for

160
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:55,799
you and um this these 10 qualities these 10 Reflections are being uh uh um

161
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:01,960
adapted from uh my studies of chaplaincy spiritual care

162
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:09,600
that's done in the world of chapy of hospitals and prisons and all kinds of other places that chaplain work and

163
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:16,760
chaplain have a particular orientation especially since they're Interfaith chaplains they're not looking for

164
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:22,760
particular uh religious ideas but they're looking for

165
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:28,240
Spiritual qualities or characteristics that are Central to people's lives that

166
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:36,120
they want to address because often chaplain are meeting people at times of Crisis personal and family and social

167
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:43,399
crisis and in times of Crisis something is often broken something is really challenged for people in their spiritual

168
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:48,840
life in their personal life and so these chap chaplains can have sometimes these

169
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:55,039
10 different areas that they're paying attention to to see where is something broken where is something need to be

170
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,480
healed or worked or understood or reflect Ed on in a deeper way and I find

171
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,600
it very useful to take these 10 qualities from chapy and address them to a Dharma

172
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:13,599
life and so I'll try to do that for these uh two weeks and as I said hoping that you will

173
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:23,000
reflect on them and make them your own or see how it works for you so um uh these 10 are are really

174
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:32,200
five areas that each area has two qualities two characteristics I'll briefly do the five the 10 today

175
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:37,638
and then um and then I'll will uh go through the each one

176
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:42,960
today so when we're divided into just five categories they have to do with

177
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,200
meaning with a uh agency with

178
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:56,878
identity with community and with healing and these five uh I've

179
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:03,760
associated with with uh uh when they're when these go well when these are healed

180
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,560
or resolved or developed well for people um they correlate to five positive

181
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,720
emotional states and maybe you'll think about the correlations and come up with

182
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:21,599
different ones for yourself but for me I was thinking that the meaning corresponds with

183
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:29,280
inspiration agency corresponds to Freedom identity corresponds to

184
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,800
confidence and Community corresponds to love and healing corresponds to

185
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:43,720
wholeness and of being whole so uh each of these five then are

186
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:50,440
are divided into two so meaning with to the world of meaning is added the idea

187
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:57,079
of purpose meaning and purpose to the world to the world interesting I use

188
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:03,119
that word here here this world the world of agency uh is added the idea of

189
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:12,960
autonomy to the world of identity is added the concept of um of um dignity

190
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,640
value worth and to uh Community has added the

191
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:24,520
idea of kinship and to um healing is added the

192
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:30,839
idea of reconciliation so uh it begins with

193
00:36:30,839 --> 00:36:37,200
meaning and I probably in my history of my his personal history with Buddhism

194
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:44,480
especially with Zen starting off in Zen Buddhism I would say that I had a kind of a challenging or difficult uh

195
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,880
relationship to the idea of meaning I I probably thought that it was

196
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,240
overlaying some concept some something on top of our direct experience and I

197
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:01,520
was more interested in just showing up and being Pres present for things as they are not adding some some things on

198
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:08,839
top nowadays I think that's still true that's inv valuable to show up for things as they are but part of how

199
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:13,920
things as they are is meaning that meaning isn't an overlay

200
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:20,839
meaning is its own thing that the the UN meaning meaning has to do with value

201
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:26,599
what we have most see is most valuable uh with our values the values

202
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:33,920
we live in organiz our life by the the orientations that uh that we organize

203
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:40,119
ourselves for deciding how we communicate with other people how we relate to them relate to

204
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:45,359
ourselves that uh all this fits under the category of what do we find is the

205
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:51,040
meaning of our life where do we find meaning for what we do why do we do what

206
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:56,960
we do and I find um and in my zenier years

207
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:04,359
I avoided the word meaning but instead I used the word intention and uh I think that the word

208
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:11,160
the meaning and intention don't have to be so separate where we have meaning we find intention where we have intention

209
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:16,599
there is something that has meaning or importance for us and uh and I found in

210
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:21,680
my studies and myself for my intentionality that there were layers

211
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,640
and layers of intentions that I might have an a surface intention and I

212
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:32,960
wouldn't stop there and say that's the intention I would keep looking what's was there something underneath that what

213
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:39,000
fuels that what fuels that um what is it that's most important here what's the

214
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,240
most important fundamental intention that's the intention prior to all the

215
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:51,680
others what do we hold most important in our life what is most meaningful for us

216
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,960
is it family for some people that's most important is it uh a sense of

217
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:03,520
contribution contributing to society is it personal fulfillment is it

218
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:09,280
having fun and Adventure is it um is it

219
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,640
um um understanding and Truth discovering and

220
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:21,040
learning I don't want to High make a hierarchy of one of these being more important than the other but I want to

221
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:27,400
give you a sense of possibilities that different people for whatever reason for the personality the way they were born

222
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:34,599
born the way they they're raised by their culture will have different things that they hold as being important as

223
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:41,359
being meaningful meaningful enough that they want to live by it it guides them for how they want to live their life

224
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:49,040
guides them for what's important and to do and what they want to like to do and when there's no sense of meaning

225
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:57,400
when something is meaningless people get depressed people feel a sense of hopelessness and feeling lost and some

226
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:03,400
people have done things which seemed meaningful certain phase of their life but as they got older didn't hold any

227
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:11,280
meaning anymore and the certain work certain uh um um things that we were

228
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,480
pursuing um they they kind of we were kept doing them beyond the time that

229
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,200
they were had any value for us and so there was a sense of vacuity or

230
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:28,839
emptiness or lack of energy or inspiration around doing it

231
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:36,160
so when there's no in Inspiration is it because something about what's meaningful for us has been challenged

232
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:43,280
what's meaningful us can't be fulfilled we can't act on it or what we have been acting on for as being meaningful is no

233
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:49,280
longer meaningful we feel deeply betrayed and discouraged uh We've devoted oursel to something we thought

234
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,599
was really meaningful and then we found out the people involved somehow were um

235
00:40:54,599 --> 00:41:01,000
weren't what living up to what we thought they were or the whole thing was kind of a a facade

236
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,280
or didn't seem to be what it promised to be on the surface and

237
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:14,240
um and so get they be discouraged and what was meaningful is no longer meaningful and the sense of meaning the

238
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,200
sense of how we organized and oriented our life is no longer being supported

239
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:29,200
and then we have to look around and see what what is what can I rely on as being meaningful as having meaning

240
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:36,440
so humans there's a tremendous amount of human suffering around the topic of meaning and there can be a tremendous

241
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:43,680
sense of inspiration and joy in finding meaning and having meaning uh there are people who go

242
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:50,640
through tremendous crisis in life who when they have a meaning that they find in the middle of it can go through it

243
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:58,240
with confidence and success uh there was a Victor Frankle the famous book he he uh

244
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:05,200
he wrote uh Man's Search for meaning uh was inspired by his experience in the uh

245
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:11,040
Nazi concentration camps where he had observed that the people who uh had some

246
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:17,760
meaning about their life in the concentration camps the prisoners that that was enough to keep them alive or

247
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:24,440
keep them going and the ones who had no meaning whose meaning was destroyed or lost they're the ones who most likely

248
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:29,960
were going to die in those circumstances I probably didn't say it just right but

249
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:36,599
uh the point being that um meaning uh is a real what really can

250
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:41,640
animate a life and help us through tremendous challenges in our life

251
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:46,800
tremendous uh difficulties that otherwise would be discouraging we can

252
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:53,079
stay inspired if we find meaning what's that what's the meaning in it and for in

253
00:42:53,079 --> 00:43:01,119
Buddhism uh there's tremendous meaning in finding uh practice mindfulness

254
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:09,240
finding a path knowing there's a path a tremendous meaning in not succumbing to

255
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:15,559
hatred and to Greed and to fear not be over overwhelmed by these kinds of

256
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:20,960
forces there's a just knowing we're in a path to become free of those we don't

257
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:27,680
have to be free of them but just knowing we have a path that's so meaningful that leads to freedom from being

258
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,920
uh oppressed by ourselves um and uh and at least not

259
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,160
find um uh add our own

260
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:47,480
suffering uh our own contribution to suffering to the difficulties of life it's like that we can become

261
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:53,559
free this can be tremendously inspiring and can help people go through

262
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:58,960
tremendous difficulties and we'll see later as we talk about autonomy and the agency how

263
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:06,000
important this is as well so for today it's meaning we I would like to propose that

264
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:11,240
uh human beings have a tremendous need for meaning and

265
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:18,960
meaningfulness and um even people who don't recognize they that in themselves

266
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:25,520
it with a deeper reflection you probably see that there's something that or around which they organize themselves

267
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:33,079
that's has to do with meaning so what is your meaning where do you find meaning what are the layers of

268
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:40,119
meaning that you have layers of importance of what you really want to organize yourself around the values the

269
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:46,319
sense of purpose the the um how to be in the world the why to be in the

270
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:51,359
world so that's my proposal that those of you who'd like to reflect on this and

271
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:57,920
think about it for today next 24 hours and you might want to uh write about a

272
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:03,359
little bit if you person who likes to do that something different happens when

273
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:08,880
you write about these kinds of profound things and then go back and read them that allows us to kind of reflect even

274
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,440
further and deeper and deeper or to have conversations with friends around this topic of

275
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:22,838
meaning and then uh we'll continue tomorrow thank you very much
