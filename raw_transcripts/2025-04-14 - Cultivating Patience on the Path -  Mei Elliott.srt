1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,040
so for those who are just arriving my name is May It's so nice to be here with

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:13,759
you especially on this beautiful Sunday And I'd like to start with a poem

3
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,800
So this is called uh Lasu's peace prayer It goes like

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:27,840
this If there is to be peace in the world there must be peace in the nations

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,320
If there is to be peace in the nations there must be peace in the

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:39,640
cities If there is to be peace in the cities there must be peace between

7
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:45,480
neighbors If there is to be peace between neighbors there must be peace in the

8
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:53,960
home And if there is to be peace in the home there must be peace in the heart

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,320
So there's a lot of suffering in the world right now Uh and there's many things that can

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,720
be done when there's suffering in the world Many uh external actions um

11
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,000
volunteering donations having bridgebuilding conversations lots of uh

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,360
really important things that can be done uh and uh I don't think it should be

13
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:26,600
underestimated the importance of uh cultivating a heart of

14
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,040
peace If there's to be peace in the world there must be peace in the

15
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:38,400
heart Uh one way I like to think of it is that uh wars and famines they don't

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,000
typically happen because a of a shortage of land or resources Uh they happen

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:53,360
because of greed hatred and delusion in the human mind As uh Nizaradarta uh Nisaga Darta

18
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:03,000
Maharaj said uh if you want to save the world you must first save the world from

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,959
yourself So uh this morning we'll be talking about a very particular way of cultivating a heart of peace Uh we'll be

20
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:18,959
talking about kanti or patience So the Buddha described patience as uh

21
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,959
the highest virtue and yet what I found is that um not everyone knows exactly

22
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,360
what patience is uh or how to how to cultivate it So that's our focus for

23
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,920
today Um uh maybe about a month ago Gil spoke about patience here for the Sunday

24
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,840
talk Uh but it's such an important topic that I thought it might be useful to return to it and approach it from a

25
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,120
slightly different angle So that's what we we'll be doing today Uh and maybe to

26
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:56,959
begin uh let's start with the basics So uh by one definition patience is the capacity to

27
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:04,200
accept or tolerate delay trouble or suffering without getting angry or

28
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:12,239
upset So it's this ability to uh bear difficulty calmly uh to be steadfast

29
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,840
despite adversity Uh one of my Zen teachers used to say uh

30
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,959
the first element of patience is a willingness to

31
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:30,560
suffer And this actually makes a lot of sense because the uh the Latin root of

32
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,840
uh of patience is pi and pi literally means to suffer So embedded right in the

33
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:45,879
word we have this um uh this uh willingness to rest in

34
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:52,599
difficulty right at the heart of the word patience So I found that one common

35
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:58,879
misassociation with patience is that it it involves gritting our teeth and bearing it kind of bearing our

36
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,159
circumstances Um but true patience it's not uh it's

37
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:10,080
not a tightening against our circumstances Uh rather uh it's the

38
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,400
ability to be with difficulty uh while maintaining a wholesome attitude And

39
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:23,120
this was pretty novel for me to really understand that patience is the the ability to be with what's difficult

40
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,720
while maintaining a wholesome attitude Uh so how then do we cultivate

41
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:35,199
patience how do we actually of bring it forth in our life uh so it could be easy

42
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:43,040
to think that uh the way to patience is uh by getting rid of impatience Uh but

43
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,800
that that is not actually the case Um the way to patience is actually through

44
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:57,560
impatience It's by studying impatience uh that we grow the heart of patience

45
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,720
So um so let's zoom in on this a bit Uh let's take a look a closer look at

46
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:11,840
impatience and that'll be a lot of our study today is looking at how impatience functions because so much of cultivating

47
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,120
patience is looking at its opposite Uh so one thing I found through a closer

48
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,400
look at uh impatience is it's it's actually the coming together of a

49
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,800
variety of different factors of mind And what I found is that uh when impatience

50
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:34,320
arises it's always coming along with a companion And the companion is craving

51
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,400
or aversion wanting or not wanting So impatience is always arising in tandem

52
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,720
with wanting or not wanting They kind of uh we could say they walk hand in hand

53
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,199
So um maybe narrowing in on this a little further uh we can look at the way

54
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,360
impatience arises with wanting So uh let's say something obstructs us from

55
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,479
getting what we want Um let's say we want a cup of coffee or a bathroom break

56
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:10,639
or a better job you know whatever it is Um if anything gets in our way from

57
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:17,280
getting that thing impatience can quite easily take hold So typically we want uh

58
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,639
rapid and unhindered access to that which we we desire and if anything gets

59
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,759
in the way of that then impatience can re supreme Uh this is one of the ways it

60
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,840
functions Uh on the flip we can look at the same pattern with not wanting with

61
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:40,240
aversion So when we experience something unpleasant uh something we don't want uh maybe pain

62
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:47,319
in the body uh a dismal mood an illness um sadness

63
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:53,479
loss when that happens often impatience then urges us to rush through

64
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:59,199
it Uh so this is one factor of impatience wanting or not wanting but

65
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:05,120
there's one additional element um that really makes impatience what it is and

66
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,360
that's the perception of time this sense that um I can't bear

67
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:19,280
this another moment or I need what what I want needs to happen now

68
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:25,039
uh the thing that I don't want it needs to stop now And there's this sense of

69
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,560
urgency associated with this perception of time So with wanting maybe we could

70
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:36,720
say the the universal refrain of impatience are we there yet you know

71
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,440
it's just like sitting in the backseat of our life you know totally oblivious of the beautiful passing scenery and

72
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:50,400
just obsessed about getting to the hotel pool right this is like um that uh that

73
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,680
tendency towards impatience like are we there yet are we there yet or with not

74
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,360
wanting um impatience can have this timebased element of like you know when

75
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,479
will that annoying sound go away or I can't bear this headache another moment

76
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:12,800
or you know how much longer until this meeting ends I imagine all of you have have had the experience of looking at a

77
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:21,599
clock over and over until you know you get to the end of whatever that unpleasant event is So um so we have

78
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:30,840
this these this element of wanting or not wanting plus the perception of time and boom impatience arises

79
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:37,440
So um so what's kind of interesting about impatience and maybe we could say this

80
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:45,120
for um uh many challenging states of mind is um they tag along a little bit

81
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:54,560
like a shadow uh in the way that they they often go unnoticed So um when pat impatience is

82
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,800
present uh often we don't even realize it's there So our very first task for

83
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:06,720
practicing with impatience for getting to know impatience is recognition Just

84
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:13,680
simple recognition that it's there Um and as we start recognizing it

85
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,880
uh starting to see it when it's there uh it can be kind of kind of surprising to

86
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:24,800
see uh what a common visitor it can be like it it appears while driving in

87
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,320
traffic uh during conversations with others uh while stuck with a slow internet

88
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:37,519
connection while waiting in line at the grocery Uh the other morning I pulled my

89
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:44,360
breakfast out of the microwave and rather than waiting for it to cool down I chose to burn my tongue on molten

90
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,680
oatmeal you know so it's like um this sense of like urgency or you I want my

91
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:55,640
breakfast now Um so um so impatience can be really

92
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:02,480
pervasive Um so whe whether it's mild impatience or strong impatience our task

93
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:10,800
uh is just to recognize it just to see it Um and as as humbling uh as our

94
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:17,200
impatience is um these minor league occasions uh they

95
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,120
provide opportunities to grow uh grow the muscle of patience uh before it's

96
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,880
needed in more difficult circumstances So uh we can't really expect patience to

97
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,480
be present for us um in situations where we're we're enduring really difficult

98
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:42,000
hardship if we haven't already cultivated it with lesser challenges So um so in order to to be

99
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,360
able to say patiently endure something really difficult like the loss of a

100
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,519
loved one um we need to start small If we go to the gym uh it doesn't it

101
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,279
doesn't work so well to start with the 100 pound weights Works a lot better to start with the five pound weights So

102
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,720
same story with patience Uh we we start by working with small situations of

103
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,480
impatience and we grow that muscle gaining the capacity to be patient uh in

104
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:18,240
more challenging circumstances So when I was in my my early 20s

105
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,760
um I was presented with a 100 pound weight and I had to learn the hard way

106
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:30,320
So um uh I think I was I was 24 years old and I went to bed a perfectly

107
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:36,800
healthy young person and I woke up the next day not a healthy young person and

108
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,560
I was very sick Um it was kind of like my digestion had stopped functioning Uh

109
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,480
and uh I went and saw the doctor The doctor didn't know what was happening I saw another doctor that doctor didn't

110
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:56,399
know what was happening Saw a doctor after doctor You know days went by weeks went by months went by and I started to

111
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:03,120
get pretty impatient about getting better Really wanted to get better Did

112
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,519
not feel good So during this time uh I went to go see a teacher a dharma

113
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:17,760
teacher in the East Bay and I told this teacher about how unbearable this circumstance was how difficult it was Um

114
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,940
and he said something to me that I that that I found uh really

115
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:31,760
[Music] um that it changed me He said something

116
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,199
that changed me And he

117
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:46,160
said uh he said uh how would you be with this if it were

118
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:55,240
to be this way forever how would you be with this if it were to be this way forever

119
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,760
so of course this uh this prompt it wasn't to provoke future tripping or

120
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,800
fear or anything like that but the way that it functioned was that it undercut

121
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:16,600
my aversion I realized if I were to be with this forever I would have to accept

122
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:25,040
it now Otherwise I'm just going to burn in the um the fire of my own aversion

123
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,399
Uh so if I were to be with this forever I would have to accept it And as you

124
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:39,639
know uh impatience arises with aversion If aversion drops out impatience drops

125
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:46,079
out So uh so over time I found a way to be with this experience uh with greater

126
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:52,720
patience And of course there were times where I wasn't patient you know where impatience

127
00:13:52,720 --> 00:14:00,959
was present and that's when I would do this practice That's when I would recognize impatience when it was there

128
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,560
Uh and then I do the next step And the next step once we recognize impatience

129
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:13,120
it's to feel it in the body What's it actually feel like uh to be impatient is

130
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:20,240
there a tightness in the chest maybe a clenching in the jaw heat in the face

131
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,839
like can you get to know it almost like an ecologist in a new ecosystem like

132
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:33,040
what is the human experience of impatience like so as we do this as we become

133
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,480
curious about what impatience feels like we can become so and this is this is

134
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,399
true for any uh difficult state uh if we become really attuned to what it feels

135
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,959
like in the body the next time it arises we know it right away So we're much less

136
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:56,240
likely to get hijacked by it And I've seen with some states that really used

137
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,519
to be difficult for me Sometimes the moment they arise because I've spent so

138
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:07,360
much time feeling them in the body I can just drop it It's like you know no need

139
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,639
to get hijacked by this because I see it I I've really gotten to know it So this

140
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:19,320
is one of the advantages to to really feeling these uh these challenging experiences in the

141
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,800
body So okay So once we've recognized our impatience we felt in the body uh

142
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:31,199
then we can call on wisdom or compassion So um we might bring in some wisdom by

143
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:38,800
reflecting on impermanence So remembering that whatever this is whatever is happening uh this too shall

144
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:46,160
pass And this too will pass in time now And and in the meantime even as

145
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:52,880
it seems to persist uh often what we experience as fixed kind of es and flows

146
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,320
like there's changes to it And really being able to sense those eb the es and

147
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,360
flows it can begin to um to loosen our

148
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:10,000
sense of of fixity that fixed perception that you know it's like this and it's going to stay like this for too long and

149
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,440
I don't want this Kind of get to see some um uh kind of cracks in our fixed

150
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,600
perception as we really observe change

151
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:29,279
So when we uh when we really begin to see how quickly things pass and that

152
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:36,720
often they pass on their own without our valition um wisdom begins to emerge and this can

153
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:43,199
soften patience or impatience excuse me This can um this clear seeing uh can

154
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:50,480
soften impatience So that's a wisdom view uh we

155
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,600
can also after recognizing and feeling impatience in the body uh we might bring

156
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:02,000
in some compassion So uh the way that compassion functions is that it it

157
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,558
softens impatience with its warmth It softens impatience with its warmth So in

158
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:16,640
the same way where if maybe there's a little kid that's having a tantrum a parent can approach that child and uh

159
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:25,600
speak to that child in a soothing way and really comfort it be kind and gentle with it Um we can do that to the um the

160
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,679
child within the impatient child within Uh often there's uh there's just

161
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:37,760
a vulnerable part of oursel uh that longs for things to be otherwise So can

162
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,280
we meet uh that part of our heart uh

163
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:51,200
with kindness with gentleness with compassion and uh sometimes uh sometimes

164
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:57,760
this softening uh the softening that compassion provides uh it reveals that

165
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:03,360
impatience is covering up deeper hurts So we might find that below our

166
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:09,360
impatience um emotions like sadness or loneliness

167
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:18,440
or grief may be underneath Uh just asking for our loving attention

168
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:28,919
So one time I was uh I was walking through the flower garden uh at Green

169
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:35,160
Gulch Farm and Zen Center up in Marin and I ran into an old friend

170
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:41,600
there This was a friend that I had uh I had trained with as a Zen monk at

171
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,360
Tasahara many years before And uh so it was really love to love it uh lovely to

172
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:54,559
see him and he was there with his daughter who was maybe I don't know four years old at the time So she's very cute

173
00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:02,559
and small and brighteyed Uh and so my friend and I stopped started talking a little and we weren't talking long Um

174
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:08,720
but uh his daughter started to she she was fine at first maybe I don't know digging around in a flower bed or

175
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,880
something Uh but it wasn't long before uh she started feeling like this

176
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,200
conversation is done it's time to go Come on Dad Um and she

177
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:27,039
expressed this in the way that kids do Uh which is not by saying "Oh I'd like

178
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:34,400
to go now." Uh I think I think it began with you maybe pulling her dad's pant leg and then some you know whining and

179
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,440
maybe a little yelling and kicking and it was one of these moments where I just

180
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,039
felt uh awe at parenthood and this sort of like how is it that parents don't eat

181
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:50,400
their young like it's just extraordinary Um

182
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,799
uh and so I just am uh wondering how my friend's going to respond to this And uh

183
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:05,440
and I was just I was just amazed by how tender and patient and gentle he was

184
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:15,400
with her He knelt down on one knee just spoke to her really soothingly kindly just so so soft so

185
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:22,760
gentle Uh so we all have this capacity to meet the impatient child

186
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:31,400
within with that same kindness that same compassion that same gentleness

187
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,520
Now uh ironically um after watching my f

188
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:47,400
my friend respond in this way for a little while um I was so amazed by his

189
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:55,840
composure I I said something like like Kogan like how do you do it you are so

190
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:03,600
patient with her and he raised an eyebrow and with a ry smile he said "You don't know what it's

191
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,880
like in here." And that really stuck with me

192
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:17,080
because I think a lot of times um we don't feel patient we don't feel kind Um

193
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:26,159
uh but what's the next best thing uh and the the way that this friend uh

194
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:33,120
was with his daughter even though he didn't feel patient he enacted patience

195
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:40,880
Uh and so uh in a lot of ways um our practice is about uh not leaking our

196
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,159
defilements onto others to not leak our greed hatred and

197
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:52,080
delusion onto others Uh and I'm not saying that we should never share how

198
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:59,280
we're feeling right uh there's a time and a place where it's tremendously skillful to express our impatience or

199
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:05,440
our dissatisfaction or whatever the feeling is Um certainly so And I think

200
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:11,200
there are often a lot of times uh when we don't need to express those things

201
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:18,000
and when we don't need to leak them onto others in a way that's unskillful So I just I thought that this friend's

202
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:25,760
uh enactment of patience was such a a beautiful expression of um of being in

203
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:33,480
the world aligned with one's values even if the heart isn't quite there yet Even if the heart isn't uh

204
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:39,080
uh isn't going along with the intention

205
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,480
So there's um there's another point of discernment that I'd like to clarify

206
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,880
regarding uh patience and it's that uh patience

207
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:07,159
shouldn't be conflated with complacency or

208
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:14,640
non-action Uh some people think that when um it's like oh well if I'm if I'm patient if I accept things as they are

209
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:22,760
uh then there's no energy to act then we just don't do anything Um uh

210
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:29,200
so I don't know a few weeks ago uh I did a one-day sitting and it was uh one of

211
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:36,200
those days where the mind was just everywhere Uh uh there was tons of

212
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:41,600
thinking and so um it was just all it was a lot of bringing the mind back to

213
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:48,400
the breath letting go of thoughts coming back to the breath letting go of thoughts coming back to the breath over and over and over again I probably

214
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:54,200
brought the mind back a thousand times that day Would I have preferred a quiet

215
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:59,919
mind yes definitely Um but fortunately

216
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:06,600
um there was some level of patience present with the mind as it was Um I wasn't uh striving to get a different

217
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:14,159
mind Um I wasn't uh longing for it to be otherwise Um I was just with the mind uh

218
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,760
as it was and continuing to bring it back So So even though there was

219
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,600
patience present um it didn't mean that I was complacent with the thinking mind

220
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,960
It didn't mean I just went "Oh it doesn't matter if I'm thinking I'm just I'm gonna stop trying." No I kept

221
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,600
bringing the mind back But I did it with a heart of

222
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:44,559
patience So um so tremendous effort can still be made uh from the heart of

223
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:51,520
patience from the heart of acceptance um uh when I was really sick uh I was

224
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,679
able to accept what was happening to me but that didn't mean that I stopped seeking medical

225
00:24:56,679 --> 00:25:03,919
help right there was still action uh that came from that place of of patience

226
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:10,480
from that place of acceptance um yeah so so I share this because uh a

227
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,240
lot of people wonder if fear or anger aren't motivating us uh how do we

228
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:21,679
respond to injustice this you know uh there's no fuel to act

229
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:30,720
Uh and sometimes fear and anger is all we've got Uh and we do our best with that with that Um but uh we don't

230
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,200
actually need fear uh or anger to drive our

231
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:42,320
activity There's actually a much more powerful force for wholesome activity in

232
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:47,400
the world and that's the power of love

233
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,600
Profoundly powerful action can come from a place of

234
00:25:52,600 --> 00:26:01,400
love As the Buddha said "Hatred never ceases by hatred but by love alone is

235
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:07,960
healed." This is the ancient and eternal law

236
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,880
Yeah So you don't need to worry that impatience will uh render you uh

237
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:23,360
ineffective or complacent You maybe uh maybe it's exactly what you need uh to

238
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,960
have the stability and the resilience um to act

239
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,919
most powerfully So patience can really serve

240
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:41,120
us uh can serve us in some really significant ways

241
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:48,080
uh and amazing things can become possible uh when we have access to patience So I

242
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,120
sometimes uh I sometimes think about Nelson Mandela as this really just

243
00:26:53,120 --> 00:27:02,720
incredible uh figure um that personified patients in such a a magnificent way So

244
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:10,400
as most of you know Nelson Mandela is the um anti-aparid activist who spent 27 years

245
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:18,520
imprisoned in Rob uh at Robin Island um in really harsh conditions uh tremendous

246
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:26,400
isolation and who you know eventually became the president of South Africa Uh and I was reading a while ago

247
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:32,480
about uh what the conditions were like there uh on Robin Island And just a few

248
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,440
a few things I learned I learned that he was allowed to have uh one visitor a

249
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:45,360
year for a 30 minute period He could exchange no more than

250
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:52,720
one letter every six months So of course this is just the tip

251
00:27:52,720 --> 00:28:00,679
of the iceberg right uh the tip of the iceberg of what he experienced and what was so

252
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:05,919
um so beautiful for me uh was to read

253
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:15,279
that he related to his imprisonment as quote an education in patience and

254
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:22,600
perseverance An education in patience and perseverance

255
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:30,240
So whatever difficulty we might find ourselves in uh can we meet it as an

256
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:39,480
education in patience and we we all have this capacity for a heroic

257
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:48,000
patience amidst uh amidst even even life's um most significant hardships

258
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:55,919
And we all have this capacity to rise above our aversion uh our craving and really meet life as

259
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:02,000
it is And when we meet um when we meet our

260
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,320
difficult circumstances with this type of patient nobility uh we're not the

261
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:14,480
only ones who benefit right you know our our children our co-workers

262
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:23,120
uh everyone we encounter can benefit from our peace Uh and this peace um it it doesn't

263
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:30,399
require perfection Um uh you know when patience is present

264
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:36,399
great And when impatience is present we recognize it we feel it And when we do

265
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:43,679
that um it opens the door for wisdom and compassion to free the

266
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:51,240
heart And what's um what's amazing is that uh we can even

267
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:58,480
learn to be patient with impatience itself So we don't have to wait for

268
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,919
impatience to leave before patience can arise

269
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,960
So I'll um I'll close with a very short quote from the Daly

270
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:18,960
Lama and it's said that the Daly Lama was once asked uh what's the fastest way

271
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:26,278
to enlightenment he gave a one-word answer

272
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:37,600
So when we are faced with crossing the great flood of samsara

273
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,120
uh we could think that patience uh patience provides us with a raft and a

274
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,760
sail for crossing the flood Uh and when patience is

275
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:57,480
mature we might even enjoy the ride So let's sit together

276
00:31:56,410 --> 00:32:08,550
[Music]

277
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,360
So thank you for your kind attention your patient attention Uh we'll now have a little

278
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:27,200
time for any questions or comments So anything that might have

279
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,559
come to mind for you you can share It doesn't have to be a

280
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:37,480
question Any reflections

281
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:55,360
i just have to say love is the answer Oh okay

282
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,399
It's worth saying twice Okay I just have to say love is the answer Thank you

283
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,399
Thanks

284
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:18,240
Scott I just wanted to express my appreciation

285
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:25,279
for the image of leaking defilements That's very powerful Yeah

286
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:31,360
Yeah there's something that feels different to you know to really recognize a defilement in oneself to

287
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:39,120
recognize our craving or aversion and then to consider you know is this useful to share um how might I share this in a

288
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:48,240
skillful way and to communicate that in an upright way um which might be very skillful versus leaking defilements uh

289
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:53,919
so um some people think oh well either you know you know I should never share

290
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:59,840
my defilements But there's a time and a place for it Um but what happens more often than not is

291
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:07,518
just that we're leaking them which um doesn't work so well Yeah Thank you

292
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:13,240
Scott Oh and please share your name if you're willing Yeah sure

293
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:19,118
Um my name is Craig and my question is in those moments where we notice that

294
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:25,200
there's anger and rage and and kind of pushing away what is that what are some

295
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:30,800
next steps you can take to kind of reorient towards love in those moments

296
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:38,960
yeah So um uh something that's kind of useful is the the um the practice that I

297
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:46,638
offered for working with impatience uh is also effective for any other difficult emotion So if anger or rage

298
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,878
are present recognizing that's what's happening because often I mean often we

299
00:34:52,879 --> 00:35:00,440
don't even know we're angry when we're angry you know we're just hijacked by it Um so to recognize it to feel it in the

300
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:06,800
body Um and something that's really helpful as we do this is to meet it with acceptance We're not suppressing the

301
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:13,079
anger and we're not acting out on the anger We're just allowing it to move through and we're not feeding the story

302
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:19,520
line Often anger is um fueled by the narrative So by landing in the body

303
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,760
feeling the body that's um starting to like um kind of cut off the fuel to the

304
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:33,440
fire Um so we're letting go of the thoughts being in the body uh and grounding in the body In that way um as

305
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:41,200
it starts to diminish the fuel for the fire we can be able to become more grounded more stable more at ease moving

306
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:48,079
us more in the direction of love Um so um so yes sometimes people think that we

307
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,760
need to get rid of our anger or suppress our anger Um but it's really uh it's

308
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,760
going through anger you know we need to allow it to be felt I mean often anger is uh just trying to communicate

309
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,359
something like a boundary You know don't step on me

310
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,359
Thank you

311
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,720
My name is Jill Um my question is only recently I've

312
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:32,720
started thinking that patience and impatience are not

313
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:39,359
opposites It's way more complicated than that But I can't sort out what I mean So

314
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,319
do you have a thought on

315
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:56,240
that maybe could you say a little bit more about what you're sensing into there even if you can't quite fully

316
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:01,400
articulate it i I think I've spent a lot of time

317
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:09,040
thinking patience and impatience were two sides of the same coin but I

318
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:18,040
think that's been really misguided Um and

319
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:27,040
um so maybe it's just we need you I need to relabel impatience instead because I

320
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:33,480
in the in the labeling it sounds like they should be opposites but

321
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:39,200
um I'm I'm just not sure I'm trying to work it out And I thought it you replace

322
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,240
one with the other and it's not that simple right especially you know if we

323
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:52,000
can be patient with impatience if they can coexist Um so here's one way

324
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:59,280
that we can think of patience and impatience as uh not opposites one way

325
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:08,520
that we could think of them a little differently Um uh often forces of mind like um our

326
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:14,800
craving and aversion um uh it's not that they're evil forces

327
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:22,880
in us They're trying to do something good for us You they're trying to make us happy you know Um you know uh I might

328
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,839
feel like like gosh I really just have to have that piece of cake I have to have the chocolate cake Um so that's

329
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:36,320
your craving speaking Um so it's trying to make me happy It's just a little bit

330
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:41,520
misguided about how to do that So most of our desire and aversion it's really

331
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:48,920
trying to do its best for us You know it thinks that you know yelling at our spouse is what'll make us feel better

332
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:55,040
Um so it's just a little misguided And so our impatience you know that's fueled

333
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:01,119
by that wanting and not wanting um you know it's the mind and heart trying to do its best with a difficult

334
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:08,320
circumstance um and just being a little misguided Uh in the same way um patience is also

335
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,359
trying to help us be happy So we might think of them as both forces of mind

336
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:19,839
that are trying to make us happy Uh one is just uh a little off track So if we

337
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:27,440
think of it that way um we're not seeing them as polar opposites Um but um uh two

338
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:35,319
different uh attempted paths of happiness Um one just being misguided

339
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,839
Very helpful Thank you Yeah And maybe I think this is the last

340
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,880
one we'll have time for Hey I'm Colin Uh I have a similar

341
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,640
question Maybe you can help me uh form Um I guess I'm trying to figure out where preferences kind of fit in this

342
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,920
like like when you were sick you know you you said like maybe you maintain

343
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:03,440
that preference to not be sick but you still were able to be patient

344
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:09,880
Yeah There's a a famous Zen poem that starts with um the great way is not

345
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:14,160
difficult for those without

346
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:22,920
preference So that's the Shinshin Ming Uh so um what happens with our

347
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:28,839
preferences so maybe I should start by saying uh preferences are not the

348
00:40:28,839 --> 00:40:35,920
problem Clinging to our preferences that's the problem So it's quite natural

349
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,640
as humans um that we experience certain things as pleasant and certain things as

350
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:48,119
unpleasant And so naturally we gravitate to the pleasant and um away from the

351
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:54,480
unpleasant Um and of course for each of us what's pleasant and unpleasant is different I might love strawberries you

352
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:01,119
might hate strawberries Um uh so that that natural gravitation um that kind of

353
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:06,720
magnetic pull in one way one direction or the other um shape like becomes

354
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:13,200
preferences right it it turns into what we like and dislike Um when we start to

355
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:20,119
cling really tightly to that that's when suffering occurs Um so we can hold our

356
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:25,839
preferences like this and that's going to feel a lot

357
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:33,119
different Like if I did this for another like 10 minutes my hand would really hurt Um or we can hold our preferences

358
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:42,000
like that So you know so we don't get what we want No big deal right so um so it's our

359
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,440
relationship to the preference Thank you Yeah Welcome Thank you all for

360
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,880

361
