00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:07,379
good morning everyone and can you hear all right volume is good

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:15,500
hello everyone online who is watching welcome as well and um

3
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,300
so I want to bring up

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,900
a fascinating topic I for me at least

5
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,420
but a challenging topic for some of you

6
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:42,420
in fact some of you might come up afterwards to me it's a gill

7
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,320
you don't understand let me tell you how it really is

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,700
you're not taking something into account

9
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,860
so I do this talk with great risk

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:07,580
so the topic is the state of the world oh God

11
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:13,798
that was a perfect comment given

12
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:21,740
the state of the world and um

13
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,060
the elicit that just that phrase elicits a lot of responses to people

14
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,240
some people get have despair around the state of the world some people have a lot of anxiety about

15
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,540
the state of the world some people have

16
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,600
a lot of opinions about the state of the world the topic of state of the world for some

17
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,060
people elicits a lot of predictions a lot of imagination

18
00:01:54,060 --> 00:02:00,960
where we don't see the difference between predictions and actuality

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,099
don't see the difference between predictions and what has to and will happen and even to say that is challenging

20
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:14,959
because of how strong the the views are about this is actually what's going to happen

21
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:22,980
and um and the this topic of the state of the world

22
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:30,599
isn't something I've been reflecting on the last few days because earlier this week someone presented this

23
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:37,379
topic in a very open way as a topic for reflection

24
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:43,739
when you think of the state of the world what arises for you and it was obvious when somebody some of

25
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:49,739
you gasped or something that something arises just the topic of it

26
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:57,540
but for me when this was brought up the context in which I this topic of

27
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:06,420
state of the world was brought up was kind of unique by that time I'd spent maybe five days

28
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:12,659
or so four days living Outdoors really Outdoors sleeping

29
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:20,340
on the ground with the Open sky above me kind of There Were Trees canopy a little bit over me I could see the stars though

30
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:27,599
and I'd spend much of the day sitting in this meditation posture on the ground

31
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,480
surrounded by a community of nine large trees

32
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,540
and being at this level the ground was really close it was kind of special and the way I was

33
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:44,879
sitting the ground was uneven so it had to kind of always take it into account

34
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:52,319
and there was a gentle slope on the ground it was kind of grassy ground dried California grass

35
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:58,379
gentle slope going uphill so when I looked out clearly the ground was right there

36
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:04,200
to look at and because I was sitting so low mostly what I was aware of with the trees

37
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:10,200
besides the shade they provided was their trunks

38
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:16,260
big trunks that were stable and strong and had been there for many years

39
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:22,320
and I've done this been there before the same kind of situation for a week

40
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,160
there are some wild and difficult things that happened in that Grove of trees but the truth the stability and the

41
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:36,000
strength of these trees is there and the solidity of the ground that we're sitting on was phenomenal

42
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,880
so in that context someone brought up for reflection the state of the world

43
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:48,979
and my first thought was which world is she talking about

44
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:56,520
there are so many worlds that we live in as the word but the word the interesting English word world

45
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,820
um just like the in the Buddhist language Pali uh they have the word loka

46
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:06,860
which doesn't it kind of mean like crazy in Spanish

47
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:15,120
well that's just a coincidence but the um but the um the word Loca has

48
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:23,100
the different reference points just like the English word world has it can some people just means the Earth

49
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:28,680
but it's not the physical Earth usually it's it's everything that's in this

50
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,520
earth not just the physical Earth is it is it the human world some people limited to the human world

51
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,120
is it the animal world we used to maybe use that expression the animal world and we'd be referring to a certain

52
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,360
subsection of this Earth that we live in is it the political world some people

53
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:56,418
when they hear the state of the world they think politics is like the state of American politics

54
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
and um people have been going ah this is how much people

55
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,660
ever since I was aware of American politics I think the really the first big thing

56
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:16,800
that I was aware of in my lifetime that I was a little bit aware of the Nixon Kennedy election

57
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,539
and as a little kid it was mostly prefer the person who had the nicer name

58
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:28,560
and that's all I knew but then a few years later it was a big

59
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,080
impact to be in school elementary school that is probably third grade or something

60
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:41,520
and had the teacher send tell us and then send us home because President Kennedy had been assassinated

61
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,860
so the state of politics and um

62
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:52,080
as elicited you know maybe forever as long as there's been

63
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,419
politics or as a world

64
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:04,080
the environmental world than what's happening that very difficult things happening the

65
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,020
destruction of the environment the climate is that what we refer to as the world what is the world we live in so I

66
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:17,520
was sitting there I think wondering about this and because maybe because I was sitting on the ground I thought well what's the

67
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,860
state of the world from the point of view of the mountains

68
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:29,340
they're kind of solid I mean they come and go to but uh but you know the mountains have

69
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:34,620
been there stable and strong for so long and the weather comes and goes the

70
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,080
seasons come and go the dinosaurs come and go

71
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,319
all kinds of things the mouth the point of the mountains what is that like the world what is the state of the world to the

72
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,560
point of view of the oceans I love oceans and I spend a lot of time on the surface or the edge of the surface of

73
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,780
waters and I Marvel at when I go to the Pacific coast here and then and watch

74
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:03,599
the waves come in and wash across the you know this temporary wave washes up

75
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,599
on the on the sand and then it washes out over and over and over again I say wow

76
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:17,280
it's been doing this for a long long time I'm seeing some a scene here that I

77
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,639
could have seen a hundred thousand years ago someplace on this planet or a million years ago or 100 million years

78
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:28,740
ago you could have seen this and the oceans you're not point of view

79
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:37,080
of the oceans have seen so much coming and going and ups and downs and in my hometown in Norway there's a mark

80
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,120
on the I don't know exactly where it is but there's a marker

81
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,300
that says that in the year 1200 the water level of the towns it sounds a

82
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:54,839
Bergen it's a bay and the water level from the ocean was

83
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:01,680
here far above where it is now and 100 you

84
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,740
know less than a thousand years ago it was really the ocean go up and down that much was it tied what was it it was kind

85
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,860
of Marvel that this where is the ocean and how does it change over these years centuries and Millennia and millions of

86
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:21,480
years and the state of you the ocean that comes and this there and sees so much change

87
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:28,080
what's the and um is it reasonable to ask these

88
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:36,720
questions from those perspectives the reasonable is that for me at least is that it kind of heightens highlights the

89
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:43,680
perspective I might use when I have this word state of the world and it kind of puts it contextualizes it

90
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,040
oh it's particular State a particular Viewpoint that I'm using is it the only viewpoint

91
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:57,839
is it the best Viewpoint view point of view to say this is the state of the world at any given moment

92
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,660
I Marvel at the redwood trees we have here in California there was some of some of these nine trees that surrounded

93
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:10,680
us but redwood trees and um apparently redwood trees are the

94
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,800
among among the very oldest species of Life on this planet of ours

95
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,940
you know things come and go right but apparently the species of redwood trees that we have here are 100 million years

96
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:30,180
old that's a species that's phenomenal 100 million years

97
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:36,480
humans haven't been around that long and and the

98
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,360
uh and what have the redwood trees seen in 100 million years of coming and going

99
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,700
and the here and there it's phenomenal that what's happened and

100
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:55,500
if you ever want to study tectonic movement of tectonic plates on this planet it's fascinating

101
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,740
I just took I I grew up thinking I took the Earth for granted this is how it is

102
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,779
seven continents and you know this is what but the continents have come and

103
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:11,820
gone gone over billions of years there's continents that have funny names

104
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:17,779
that no longer existed and didn't have names then

105
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,839
and um so it's you know and so the Redwood sees the trees have seen so much

106
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:34,079
it's phenomenal so what is the state of the world and more importantly perhaps what is our

107
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:40,560
relationship to the state of the world to the world and there are people who their

108
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,820
relationship to the state of the world is that they are victims and that's the primary orientation they

109
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:54,779
have some people the state of the relation to state of the world is they are

110
00:11:54,779 --> 00:12:01,380
responsible for it and um and so it's like a big deal like

111
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,779
and I get a sense that some people feel personally responsible except to them too

112
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:12,540
solve the world someone last week talked about some of that might come from the myths

113
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:19,260
the West kind of the myths that somehow somehow have been spread into embedded in kind of many cultural views

114
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:25,320
or subcultural views of the hero's journey which is a very individual

115
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,600
Journey like you have to be the hero and it's up to you alone to do it and so I'm

116
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,000
responsible you know to do something

117
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,160
um is the perspective in which we relate to the state of the world are we

118
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:47,519
consumers of it just for me to consume to have more experiences to have more things to have

119
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,620
more Comfort to more you know just that's that's the orientation

120
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:58,800
is the perspective we have towards a state of the world to have power and dominion over it

121
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,899
to to be have authority and be in control and you know it's all mine and

122
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:09,240
I'm gonna you know and there are people individuals who have that kind of view maybe even

123
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:15,060
cultures have add that to you and maybe even World Views they've been passed down to their Generations that

124
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:22,519
you know we have some kind of it's us to have power and authority over this world

125
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,760
and um so are we consumers kind of the opposite of consumers could

126
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,639
be are we producers of this world what does it mean if we're the producer

127
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:41,820
of the world is that like a crazy concept producers of the world

128
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:48,000
are we stewards of the world are we participants of the world are are we are

129
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,940
we the state of the world to me there's all these very important questions to ask

130
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:59,579
from the point of view of the Buddha I'd like to suggest that he sought us as

131
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:06,420
the producers of the world in a funny way in a unique way

132
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:12,240
that there's a way that the world like the order there are a lot of origin

133
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,800
stories of the world where different cultures religions down through time all these wonderful interesting fascinating

134
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:25,200
creation stories of the world many of them would embed in them a lot of wisdom

135
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:31,079
and that's you know people are making of myths were you know ever since they could

136
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:36,420
make language or something and those myths are fascinating some of them are

137
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:42,959
really wise interesting but creation myths and Buddhism has one too but that's we

138
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,480
don't need that right now but the Buddha is more his point of view

139
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,800
it's more like the creation myth is that the world begins in each of us

140
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:02,699
it's born in each of us maybe Moment by moment now why is that important why would the

141
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:09,300
Buddha say this and of course it's kind of crazy right I mean certainly

142
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:16,620
this planet Once Upon a Time was just I don't know just molten lava that just

143
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,660
it wasn't even water on it and you know and so we have this growth

144
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:28,620
and development of this planet and so how could it just be born right now but remember the word world is this creative

145
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:34,560
world word it's kind of it's not you know it's not the Earth what is the world

146
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,740
so if it's a flexible word fluid world word then what does a Buddha mean when he

147
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:46,800
said that's where the pre he didn't literally use this word but implied that

148
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,740
we're the producers of the world so um

149
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:59,699
there was a man who came to the Buddha and um he said you know in this town

150
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:04,860
here there's people who are your followers but they would have a lot more faith in

151
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,139
you and your teachings if you would send some Monk into town

152
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:16,260
to perform miracles you know that impresses people some people like Miracles are what gets them

153
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:23,040
into some religions back so the more miracles you do the more followers you get so you know so

154
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,920
so the Buddha said no he wasn't going to do that the command among the language in Paulie's command

155
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:35,399
command among the go do miracles no so the man asked again

156
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:41,880
and the Buddha said no and there's something in India or ancient India at least that about if you

157
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:48,839
ask something three times it's pretty significant and you really have to take person

158
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:55,320
seriously now and sometimes you can't say no if someone asks three times or something like that

159
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:02,459
so the man asked the Buddha a third time and so the Buddha and either acquiesced

160
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:11,459
they didn't say yes you do that and he didn't refuse the third time instead he said there are three kinds of

161
00:17:11,459 --> 00:17:18,900
Miracles there's the Miracles that arise from meditation practice the miraculous kind

162
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:25,798
of Wonders that the mind can see there's the miracle of

163
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:31,559
um of um what was it second

164
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:34,220
uh

165
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:42,539
I forget you know because those those things are

166
00:17:42,539 --> 00:17:50,340
not important part of the story but he and then he goes on to say there's a miracle of instruction

167
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:57,120
Miracle of instruction imagine that the instructions a teacher might give that how's that a miracle

168
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:05,520
and then he goes on to explain the miracle of instruction it's the miracle of instructing people

169
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,559
um how to focus their thinking what to think about

170
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,140
the miracle of instructing people how to not just think

171
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:22,980
but to really have some deeper contemplation creative complic contemplation a generative kind of

172
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:30,120
thinking and then there's the miracle of uh of

173
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:36,660
teaching instructing people to what to let go of that's a nice thing right not not to let

174
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:42,240
go but what to let go of and then there's the miracle of uh

175
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:51,120
teaching people instructing people what states of mind to states of heart to enter into and

176
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,580
rest in there are certain states of being that are really useful and valuable to be and

177
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:03,600
and so meditation practice Buddhist practice is it points to this and and it's not just simply doing practices but

178
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,940
to do the practices that open the door to different interstates

179
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:16,799
how to be in this world and to and to enter those doors and to rest in those to abide in it this language

180
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:25,880
those are Miracles so isn't that great that's the miracle so so send a monk into town and perform Miracles well

181
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:33,539
that's send them into town to teach so anyway so he says Buddha says this response to this person and as he often

182
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:39,240
does when he when he kind of dismisses these kind of Miracles ideas

183
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:45,660
but then he accommodates the person by coming up with what I call a myth that he tells

184
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:51,360
and um and to somehow maybe kind of go along with a person with a person's

185
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:58,559
mindset how they see things what they want kind of go along with them and then turn the table on them

186
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:04,919
kind of you know so so he starts off by saying well once upon a time

187
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:10,260
long long ago there was a

188
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:17,820
I think it was a monk who wanted to know where Earth

189
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:24,020
fire wind and and um

190
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:33,240
earth oh earth water fire and wind where they end

191
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:38,520
where do they end and that's supposed to be that refers to the whole physical world that we live in where is that

192
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:46,380
physical world we experience where does it end and part of the reason they would ask this in Ancient India is that there was

193
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:52,039
people back in Ancient India who were deeply dismayed

194
00:20:52,039 --> 00:20:57,120
upset scared aversive to how difficult

195
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:06,320
this world was this world is a difficult painful place to be and the only way out is to transcend it

196
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,600
is to somehow when you especially when you die to go to some good place

197
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:19,080
and to go to some place where this world ceases to exist that we live in so exactly what that place is is it a

198
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,240
place some people believed in a place kind of the Heavenly realm in Ancient India or

199
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:29,940
it's kind of not quite like our Heavenly realm in in the west often we have but you know there's this idea of

200
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:36,299
transcendence like you want to leave this world because it's just too difficult you know there's no hope here

201
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:43,620
so um so those people that probably you said I'm going to bring up talk about the state of the world probably yeah

202
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:49,860
that's going to be heavy talk difficult talk you know because we're going to talk terrible it is and the point is to

203
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:58,020
kind of get it get off this so that's one of the way learn the languages of transcending is to go to where the earth

204
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:04,740
water fire and wind cease so the monk goes to find someone who can

205
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,799
answer this this question where do you where does this cease and um

206
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,559
and uh he um he wants to find so find some some some

207
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:21,780
some great sage and says well you have to go ask some some of the Gods

208
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:28,020
and so he goes travels up to the God Realm and asks one God and now you have to go to a higher realm God

209
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:33,120
and no no you have to go that's the higher realm of God and he keeps going to the higher higher

210
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:40,080
around gods and he comes to the highest God in the Indian Pantheon at the time which was Brahma

211
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,539
and and goes to Brahma and says Brahma where does

212
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:53,400
earth water fire and air wind cease and Brahma says I am the great Brahma

213
00:22:53,400 --> 00:23:00,740
the all-knowing the all-powerful the wise luminous Brahma

214
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:07,860
so the guy asks the question again and Brahma says the same thing you know

215
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:15,419
I'm the greatest well you remember it three times right so the guy asked Brahma again

216
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:20,580
and Brahma gets down from his throne because it takes him by the yellow come over with

217
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:26,400
me and he kind of goes over to talks privately and says you know

218
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:33,600
the other gods here think that I'm all knowing [Laughter]

219
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:40,100
you know and I can't really you know I you know but I don't really know the answer to your question

220
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:47,419
and I can't admit it so it's kind of Buddhist humor

221
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,220
and so they go um he um and somebody said there's a who

222
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:58,260
you should ask the Buddha so the guy goes back to the Earth

223
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:03,840
to the Buddha I guess there's maybe even his teacher and asked the Buddha where does this cease

224
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:10,500
and the Buddha said oh long ago in my previous lifetime I was a sage who looked for the end of the world the

225
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:16,620
spirit word sees I traveled every direction forever and ever in all directions and no matter how far I

226
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:22,500
traveled I could travel like as fast as an arrow for 100 100 years at a time and

227
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:29,340
and I never came to the end of the world and now you won't find a place

228
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:34,279
where the Earth where the world ceases

229
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:43,020
and um the Earth the world ceases

230
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:49,140
this world of ours in your own body this is the world where you find the

231
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:57,059
cessation of but you don't find the cessation of earth water fire and Air

232
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:06,120
it's the place where Earth Fire Water and Air no longer have a footing no

233
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:14,280
longer we no longer hold on to them where Earth the world that we live in no

234
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:21,000
longer has rooted itself in our Consciousness in our mind in our in

235
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:27,480
theirs there's not we're not caught in it still there but it doesn't stick to us

236
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:34,880
so that's a just a fascinating idea itself and it's a place where knowing

237
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,900
knowing is no longer visible

238
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:45,900
knowing has no limits no boundaries no edges

239
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:51,419
where knowing is luminous all around

240
00:25:51,419 --> 00:25:57,480
or clear all around it's fascinating kind of idea knowing

241
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,760
so we're knowing cannot be seen

242
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:10,380
and uh and for the from the Buddhist point of view knowing they can't be seen is knowing

243
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:17,159
that is not attached to anything as soon as the knowing has an attachment then it kind of creates a kind of

244
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:23,220
resonance or contraction or tightness or something that others can kind of tell

245
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:30,440
sometimes you can see that when someone is concerned about something like state of the world

246
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:37,200
it's got them you know they they're knowing something in their mind and you can see now that their mind is caught by

247
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,020
something and um and so you know if someone is full of desire for something you see

248
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:49,620
them searching and wanting you can feel you can see that they're wanting something or they're angry or they're so

249
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:55,919
there's a way in which the state of our mind gets conveyed and you can kind of pick it up in some subtle way

250
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:02,220
and the more sensitive the viewer is the more sensitive we can pick up the subtlety of how people have gotten

251
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:07,559
caught by an idea or involved in an idea but when someone knows something and the

252
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:13,620
knowing has no attachment in it then there you there's no way of you don't

253
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:18,980
read the person's mind you don't read how they are there's a knowing which can't be seen

254
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:24,900
knowing it's free that's so this knowing that can't be seen

255
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:31,260
and knowing that it has no boundaries no limit there's a way the Buddha also felt that as soon as you're attached to something

256
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:37,919
or you're stuck in some idea of things you've created a limit to the world you live in now you define the world that

257
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,960
world is defined for you in a particular way and there's a way of knowing that has no

258
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:51,120
definition there's no limit and that kind of knowing has a kind of clarity openness that's maybe that he

259
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:57,539
calls luminous or like light all around to the mind the Mind The Knowing feels

260
00:27:57,539 --> 00:28:02,940
luminous and wonderful so um so what kind of knowing is that

261
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:08,039
but you know that's where earth water fire and air it doesn't cease that's not

262
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:15,000
the point it's not the point to transcend it the point is to find a place where it's rooted where it's not rooted not we're

263
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:22,679
not mine's not caught in it that's an interesting idea so that so so here this guy wants the

264
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:29,400
miracle wants Supernatural powers he wants a demonstration of it and the

265
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:35,520
Buddha says no no that's not important instructions what's important and then he tells a Mr Smith about

266
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:40,620
supernatural power is this guy going to the heavens and someone traveling to the edges of the world

267
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:46,679
and think no that's not the way and then he turns the table on the guy

268
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:53,640
turns it upside down and says you know yes this you don't find it oh what he

269
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:59,159
literally says to the guy you're asking the wrong question you don't ask the question where does

270
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:07,200
the world cease where does the world have no footing where does it not grab us where do we

271
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:17,400
not get attached to it and then he says we do that happens where knowing is not seeable knowing is

272
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:22,799
no limit no knowing is Luminous because there's no attachment

273
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:28,500
somewhere else someone also is asking the Buddha for miracles

274
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:35,340
and um and similar kind of story and there the Buddha talks about uh the

275
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:40,620
person wants to ask their asks literally where does the world the Loca where does it end

276
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:46,520
where does it come to an end and um and the Buddha reply there is that

277
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:51,779
the world is this fathom long body

278
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:58,940
so here is here and now he's defining the world this fathom long body

279
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:05,220
and um and one of the uh one of the things we see in the teachings of the

280
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:10,679
Buddha he is keeps appointing the attention of

281
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:16,080
a practitioner it's very important to say a practitioner someone who's really engaging in Buddhist practice

282
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,720
not all about how we're in the world out there but Buddhist practice to the world

283
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:27,899
of direct experience so here and now not because Here and Now is supposed is the god of Buddhism

284
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:35,460
but the Here and Now is a place that we're in touch with literally our direct experience the senses the five senses

285
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:41,880
and knowing here and he saw this fathom long body

286
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:47,820
is this world of how we experience the world in the senses Here and Now

287
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:53,659
and he said it's here that we see

288
00:30:53,940 --> 00:31:00,120
the world the arising of the world the origination of the world the ceasing of

289
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,820
the world and the practices that lead to the cessation of the world

290
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:13,020
and in this case he kind of kind of slides back and forth now between calling the world suffering look Loca

291
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:18,899
and dukkha duka is suffering the world of we know suffering we know the arising

292
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:26,220
of it the origination of it we know the seizing of it and the practice it leads to it this world that we that is our Phantom

293
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:32,279
long body that's where we produce the world that's where the world begins for each

294
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:39,779
of us and in a radical way indirect experience not the imagination

295
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:45,659
not the memory both of which have some uncertainty to them both of them would have some

296
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:51,360
inaccuracy through them some other they're all kind of

297
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,840
predictive or imaginary they belong to the world of the imagination often anything that's beyond our direct

298
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:05,179
experience but the word our direct experience always begins fresh and new every moment

299
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:11,279
the world is born here and why why I feel it's very important

300
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:18,419
to say this is that um the world you want to live in the world

301
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:24,659
you'd like to live in if you're just waiting for everyone else to make that happen

302
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:31,620
you're going to wait a long time and if you have the imagination of how

303
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:38,100
horrible the state of the world is chances are you also have an imagination of what's possible

304
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:44,100
what could be wonderful and if there is a possibility of a

305
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:49,260
wonderful world to live in don't wait for other people to make it

306
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:55,320
be the maker of it your world the world your world begins

307
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:01,260
with you and you can be the producer of it

308
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:07,679
be the person who is what you want the world to be

309
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:14,279
if the world is a place where people are kind to each other friendly to each other support each other cooperate with

310
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:20,460
each other a world where people resolve their

311
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:26,220
conflicts be that way be kind be friendly

312
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:33,899
be generous work on solving conflicts engage in that

313
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:40,080
don't pass it on to others expecting others to do it because that's a world if you do that that that's the world you

314
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,600
create other people will do it and I'm the consumer I'm the victim I'm

315
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,940
this you know it's kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy

316
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:59,059
and that's why it seems so real because you're kind of producing the very thing that you're afraid of

317
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:05,220
but to be the producer of the world that's here starts here and then we can do it together with

318
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:10,560
others we find other people who are producing that kind of world and there's a lot of people producing a

319
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,020
good world out there and phenomenal many people there was a wonderful book some years

320
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:22,280
ago that I saw maybe from and gave it to me maybe that um

321
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:29,580
was celebrating how many small non-profits there are in the world right

322
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:35,638
now people small efforts in small little town that little towns here and there

323
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:42,240
and the cities here and there are trying to address the climate change and the environmental issues of our times

324
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:49,020
and if you cook some total of all these little small efforts is phenomenal what it is New York Times today has an

325
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:55,500
article about the exponential growth of alternative energy sources and how there are also so many different small places

326
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:01,260
that are doing it the small governments and so

327
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:07,680
all that you want to live in a world where we do Collective efforts not hero

328
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,079
worship hero worshiping but to worshiping our Collective let it

329
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:18,119
begin with you and find people to share with and work with

330
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:23,160
and then something beautiful is happening here and

331
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:28,700
who knows the San Andreas fault might Shake

332
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:36,240
any minute now yeah some of you don't know but a mile from here so maybe a

333
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,480
little bit more two miles from here is a level of tension of two tectonic

334
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:49,140
plates rubbing against each other and and pressing against each other and

335
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:55,859
kind of by because of the friction not giving it giving in yet but at some point that pressure will be just enough

336
00:35:55,859 --> 00:36:01,020
it'll together and last time it happened in 1906 you

337
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:07,619
can see up in some places where the ground shifted you can still see or jumped and shifted

338
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:11,720
away and it's dramatic

339
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:22,260
so now you'll go home afraid I'm not scared because that's one way to have address

340
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:28,079
the state of the world is to is to be right frightened by it

341
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:36,599
to be a victim of it to be under its way but to be the producer of the world

342
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:41,940
to cultivate the best qualities of a human being

343
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:48,540
so that when the San Andreas equivalent of the San Andreas for fall shakes

344
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:54,300
we're ready for that we're ready

345
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:59,579
for the beginning of a new world of a new town of a new state of a new

346
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:04,740
something we're ready to bring forth the best qualities we have

347
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:11,160
to contribute to what's new in a good way and we see that happens many times in

348
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:18,119
many places that sometimes the level of tragedy that happens that human caused is caused by

349
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:23,280
very few people but but how many people come together

350
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:30,320
to to address the issue and so I'll end with one of the Great American

351
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:38,700
Heroes who I don't think believed in that hero's journey

352
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:47,160
Mr Rogers who said that who attributed a lot of

353
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,440
who he became to his mother because when he saw the terrible things happening in the world

354
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:58,740
he asked her about it and she said oh look look around and look for the

355
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:04,560
helpers the people are helping and that lots of people are helping

356
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:10,560
don't forget that don't be so overwhelmed by what's happening in the world you don't see the helpers

357
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:17,160
don't be so overwhelmed in the world that you don't become one of the helpers that's what's important that's the world

358
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:22,380
we want to live in to so much uncertainty

359
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:28,500
but let's not be uncertain about the goodness of our own hearts let's be the producers of the world

360
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:35,780
let's make it together into a place that's good and I think that's the message of the Buddha

361
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:41,520
here you can be free here you can Free Yourself are your

362
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:48,180
attachments here your heart and mind can become luminous and here's where your kindness and

363
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:53,400
compassion and care and generosity and

364
00:38:53,400 --> 00:39:00,300
wisdom and patience and equanimity can come and meet this world

365
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:05,339
here maybe even as soon as you get in your car to drive home those of you who

366
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:12,260
are driving drive as if you're creating a new world

367
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:20,420
so it's my thoughts today so thank you
