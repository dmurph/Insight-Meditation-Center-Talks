20
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:22,960
where you're coming in from you're probably a little surprised to see me this morning uh knowing that this is gil fransdale's

21
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:30,240
program that he does in the mornings and if you haven't heard already gill and paul haller who was teaching

22
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,840
last week and myself are sharing these three weeks during what we're calling a

23
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,560
zen and vipassana intensive and we've also been sharing this morning program very very kindly

24
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,840
offered by gil so we can introduce ourselves to you um so my name is foo schrader and i'm

25
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,240
the abiding abbess at greengulch farm zen center in marin county california

26
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,919
gill was a young student here a young farm apprentice many years ago and so i've known him for a long time

27
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,960
and i have admired him ever since as a teacher of vipassana style

28
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,400
meditation practice gail welcomed us to participate in this program to share

29
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,680
our own versions of meditation instruction so first of all i want to say that i

30
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:27,120
have never done a western-style vipassana retreat and therefore i am not familiar or trained in guided

31
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,240
meditation i have however done many many years of zen style meditation and that's what i'm

32
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,039
here to share with you this morning and for the next four days so throughout this three-week intensive

33
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:47,039
gil paul and i have been focusing on one of the three classical categories of training

34
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,759
through which the buddha taught the dharma he taught ethics or morality sheila

35
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,919
meditation samadhi and wisdom the first two weeks we focused on

36
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,520
meditation and wisdom and this week we are focusing on ethics and morality

37
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,360
which are basically the guidelines by which we humans not only learn how to live and work

38
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,720
together but also how to take care of one another so for

39
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:24,160
the next 20 minutes or so we are going to enter into a period of silent meditation together in what soto-zen

40
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:31,759
which is my tradition i've studied in what we call silent illumination so to begin this

41
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:38,479
period of silent meditation i want to just briefly remind you about the points of your posture that

42
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,160
help support upright sitting you know first you find a comfortable and stable

43
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:51,039
position for your legs and your torso and then gently allow the energy of your

44
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,840
core body to move upward toward the top of your head like a spring that's bubbling up from

45
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,879
dry ground now let the muscles of your face your

46
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,240
shoulders your back and arms relax and like the water of the spring let the

47
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,759
tension just pour down over the surface of your entire body

48
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:21,520
allowing it to spread out and to nourish the space around you as far as your imagination can reach

49
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:26,639
allow your eyes to remain open with a soft focus on the wide space that's in

50
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:33,279
front of you take a couple of deep breaths through your mouth

51
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,760
and then return to your normal breathing through the nose

52
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:51,600
and now as we are instructed by the founder of our school of zen dogan zenji

53
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,959
think of not thinking how do you think of not thinking a

54
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,080
student asked non-thinking he says

55
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,839
this is the essential art of zazen

56
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,820
[Applause]

57
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,839
uh

58
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:29,359
welcome back from from wherever you might have been um perhaps with the parts of your body

59
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:34,400
or with some feeling maybe some sensory awareness or

60
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:42,079
thoughts about the past plans for the future most likely all of the above

61
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:51,200
so i probably probably should introduce myself to you who just joined expecting gail fransdale uh gill and

62
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:58,160
another close dharma friend paul haller are sharing for three weeks a teaching on

63
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,720
we call the harmony of zen and vipassana so we've all practiced in both of these

64
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,839
traditions well actually i haven't in the papasana but i have now listening

65
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:16,800
in on gil's teaching it's been quite wonderful um so our idea is to help us

66
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,800
here at sen center as well as inviting all of you who are most familiar with vipassana

67
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,838
teachings to have a taste of one another's style of practicing the dharma

68
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:36,960
so the buddha called the many parts of our lived experience the ten thousand things which basically

69
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,640
means reality itself in which a lot appears to be going on

70
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:48,800
and all the time so this we know so when we become aware of just how much

71
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,920
is going on as you experienced this morning it often helps to take a

72
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:01,359
bit of time and enough space to quiet ourselves to slow the many processes of our thinking and the

73
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:07,359
activities of moving around you know just long enough to take a look at ourselves

74
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:13,839
and that the internal clockwork that is driving our busy lives so given how

75
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:20,560
deeply we are conditioned not to stop moving except for dreamless sleep we're most

76
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:25,680
always busy both inside and outside

77
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:32,800
so the buddha met his own busyness by sitting down under a tree for many days on end something that all

78
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:40,320
of us do when we go on retreat either vipassana or zen sashin and even for

79
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:46,880
a brief time this morning as we sat together and as as we're doing now just stopping taking

80
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,599
a break resting a bit so the buddha didn't give us too many words about his experience

81
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:59,760
that morning of the eighth day of his silent sitting when he looked up at the star and then

82
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,040
he said wonderful wonderful i and all beings on

83
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:12,000
earth attain enlightenment at the same time i and all beings on earth attain

84
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:20,160
enlightenment at the same time so this statement has been talked about now for several millennia

85
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:26,000
and just what did he see and what did he mean by what he said

86
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:33,520
so one way of understanding what the buddha meant was that the star what he saw and the earth all things and

87
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:39,280
all beings all the objects of his awareness were not separate

88
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,720
were not outside of himself in other words that awareness and the

89
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:53,119
objects of our awareness are not two separate things and although we can reason how that is so that is not

90
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,240
how we normally think and that is not how we behave

91
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,440
so explaining the buddhist enlightenment experience in this way is called the teaching of

92
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,200
non-duality or of no two things and is a very important

93
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:16,480
understanding for us to have in order to know the deep meaning of what the buddha taught so one of the

94
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,839
things that we're endeavoring to learn on meditation retreats is how deeply ingrained

95
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:27,760
inside ourselves is this notion of existing separately from the world around us

96
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:34,800
we humans have even created languages that confirm that notion all day long

97
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:42,240
my home my children my friends my enemies my country

98
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:48,000
my job so we say in which all of these possessions belong

99
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:56,079
to me which then leaves me as separate singular and isolated

100
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:02,720
and in extreme cases causes great suffering there may in fact be none worse than the

101
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,400
belief that we are truly alone so along with the wisdom teachings the

102
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,359
other body of teachings that point directly at this type of suffering are the teachings of ethics or morality

103
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:21,200
ethics and precepts and moral guidelines have been given to us in order to

104
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,319
connect us to one another you know in order to bring harmony to humankind

105
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:31,839
through connecting practices such as generosity and patience and of course through

106
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:37,200
wisdom so as the buddha traveled through as buddhism and

107
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:43,599
the buddhist teaching traveled through many cultures and crystallized into these many forms and expressions

108
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:50,400
one of the expressions that i'm going to talk about with you this week is called the 16 bodhisattva precepts

109
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:56,880
which are in truth one precept the precept of how i over here

110
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,880
promise to take care of you over there as an enactment of the buddha's awakened

111
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:09,680
vision that i and you are in truth not in any way separate at all

112
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:16,400
so we are interdependent and we are free there's two sides of the same coin as

113
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,880
the buddha declared at that moment of his awakening i and all beings awakening at the same

114
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,240
time one whole being one whole life one whole precept

115
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,960
for embodying just how that is so so the one whole precept when it's

116
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:42,000
broken into many parts that make up our complex human life sound like this beginning with what are called

117
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,640
the three refuges i take refuge in buddha as the enlightened teacher

118
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:54,960
i take refuge in dharma as the enlightened teaching i take refuge in sangha as the

119
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,480
enlightened life and then there are the three pure precepts

120
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:09,119
i vow to embrace and sustain right conduct i vow to embrace and sustain all good

121
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:16,240
i vow to embrace and sustain all beings and then finally there's a

122
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:22,880
more detailed recitation of those actions that we take against others that cause the greatest harm

123
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:30,720
and we can read about these every day in the newspaper breaking the bond of our shared humanity

124
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:39,680
these are the 10 grave precepts or promises that i make to each of you i vow not to kill you

125
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:46,560
to steal from you to sexualize you or lie to you i vow not to poison your

126
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:53,119
body or mind with intoxicants i vow not to slander you praise myself

127
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:58,640
at your expense withhold my possessions or my knowledge from you

128
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:05,520
harbor ill will toward you and as a kind of summary vow i vow not

129
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:13,040
to disparage the three treasures the teaching the teacher of awakening the buddha the teaching of

130
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:19,359
awakening the dharma or the community of those who are devoted to awakening you know

131
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:25,599
this sangha that's us so studying the buddhist precepts is

132
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,640
studying the clockwork of our actions in the world and the consequences of those actions

133
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:35,839
wherein saying and doing are the primary elements through which each of us

134
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:43,040
together creates either a world of bondage or a world of freedom saying

135
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:49,200
and doing both arise from how we think which is why one of perhaps the best

136
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:55,359
known of the buddhist teachings is from an ancient collection of verses called the dhammapada

137
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:00,480
the footsteps of the truth what we are today comes from our

138
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,000
thoughts of yesterday and our present thoughts build our life of tomorrow

139
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,319
our life is a creation of our mind if a person speaks or acts with an

140
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:17,760
impure mind suffering follows them like the wheel of the cart follows the beast that draws

141
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,680
the cart if a person speaks or acts with a pure mind

142
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:30,960
joy follows them as their own shadow he beat me she hurt me they defeated me

143
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:38,079
he robbed me those who think such thoughts will not be free from hate she insulted me

144
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:44,720
he cheated me they defeated me he beat me those who think not such thoughts will

145
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,760
be free from hate hate is not conquered by hate hate is

146
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,680
conquered by not hating this is the eternal law

147
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:02,400
many do not know that we are here in this world to live in harmony with one another those who know this do

148
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:09,040
not fight against each other so not fighting against each other is

149
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:14,240
the main effort that we are all making as teachers and as students of the buddhadharma

150
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:21,440
and the teacher who inspired my understanding of the dharma was a japanese zen master shinrio suzuki roshi who came

151
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:28,079
to america in 1959 to share with us his own unique inspired vision of the

152
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:34,720
buddhist teaching you know he came looking for us so many of you are undoubtedly familiar

153
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:40,800
with zenmind beginner's mind published over 50 years ago now and among the many things suzuki roshi

154
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:48,079
said some of them were directly about the 16 bodhisattva precepts also known in the zen tradition as the

155
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:54,640
blood vein of the buddhas and the ancestors receiving the precepts is a way of

156
00:45:54,640 --> 00:46:00,000
understanding what it means to just sit the integration of precepts and

157
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,359
meditation is the foundation for all of the practices and activities of our daily life

158
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:13,920
so this identity of meditation with precepts is also one by my own teacher attention anderson

159
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:21,200
called his book on the precepts being upright being upright

160
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:28,319
and one image for helping us to understand the function of these precepts as teachers have said is as a map of the

161
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:34,240
buddha's world taking the bodhisattva precepts begins by orienting

162
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:40,560
ourselves to the buddha's example and enlightened vision the buddha's awakening as someone

163
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:48,400
recently said even taking a single step is sufficient if you are headed in the right direction

164
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:54,560
so tomorrow and for the next three days i'm going to be sharing more of the stories and teachings about the precepts

165
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:01,760
that underlie our sitting practice the first of those being taking refuge in which another of our

166
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:08,319
founding sound ancestors dogen zenji said the essence of transmission of bodhisattva precepts is

167
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:14,960
taking refuge meaning that when we follow the map the teaching of nonduality and enter the

168
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:20,559
buddha's world we are taking refuge in clearly seeing reality itself

169
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:26,960
vipassana with all of its dents and illusions mistakes stories and

170
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:32,720
release taking refuge in buddha is another name for intimacy with all the

171
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:38,160
things that we are or rather all the things that we seem to be

172
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,839
another name for turning toward the world the buddha taught that the root of all

173
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:51,280
evil is ignorance or turning away from the world a fuzzy thrilling unreliable ungraspable

174
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,800
creation where the self cannot abide as separate

175
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:02,480
when sitting upright in the fuzzy ungraspable world with whatever seems to be happening

176
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:08,720
we come to realize that something we are used to seeing is missing and that something

177
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:14,079
would be me me in the form of my old habits of thought

178
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:22,640
my preferences my self-centeredness my fears and isolation and most of all my fantasies

179
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:28,640
so it's at times like this that the me tries to take control of the elements of existence for its own

180
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:34,240
safety and benefit and although the shields go up again and again

181
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:40,960
they are not holding so the precepts are a different kind of armor the armor of taking vows of making

182
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:47,599
promises and that's what i'll share with you in these next few days so to end for this morning here is a

183
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:53,760
brief teaching on precepts by the founder of the zen center miyu suzuki roshi from a collection of

184
00:48:53,760 --> 00:49:00,880
his talks in a book called not always so so in the full lotus position

185
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:07,920
we cross the right leg over the left and the left leg over the right symbolically the right is activity and

186
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:13,200
the left is the opposite calmness of mind if the left is wisdom

187
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:18,319
the right is practice and when we cross our legs we don't know which is which

188
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:25,040
so even though we have two symbolically we also have one our posture is vertical without

189
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:31,599
leaning right or left backward or forward this is an expression of perfect understanding of the teaching that is

190
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:37,119
beyond duality when we extend this we naturally have precepts

191
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:42,800
and the study of how to observe our precepts this posture of zazen is not just a kind

192
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:48,880
of training but is the actual way of transmitting buddha's teaching to us

193
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:55,599
words by themselves are not good enough to actualize his teaching so it is transmitted through activity or

194
00:49:55,599 --> 00:50:02,319
through human relationships well thank you very much

195
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:09,440
we're just about a time kevin offered very kindly to relay any questions you have so if you

196
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,559
do i'd be happy to respond uh so i think we've just got one

197
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:21,280
question here from uh leslie she asked what translation of the dharmapatha is that

198
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:28,880
yeah that's good i know it's an old one that i've had for many years um it is penguin classic

199
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,000
juan mascaro and i think this was translated

200
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:41,839
one of the first books i think i got 1973.

201
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:51,920
i know there are many different versions i happen to like this one i like the poetry of it

202
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:58,559
okay well um then we'll end i just want to thank you all who have come i'm sorry i can't see you

203
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:05,440
um but here we are so uh i'll be back tomorrow

204
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:12,400
and i'll be talking about the refuges and offering some more meditation kind of like content

205
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:18,960
or tone from zen teachings that have been meaningful for me and uh

206
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:25,039
and then we'll sit together and have another discussion so again thank you very much

207
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,839
phu we also had actually another question come in um from paul i said what do we do with our eyes

208
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:37,040
while meditating yeah well i noticed that gil gives

209
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:46,640
people the options so absurd i would never say that you don't have the option of course you do um and then we say to keep the eyes open

210
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:52,640
and partly the understanding being with the eyes closed it's much easier to enter into dreams

211
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:59,920
and to fantasies and so by having your eyes open it's a little hard to escape the reality of

212
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:06,319
that whatever is sitting in front of you so it's a way of connecting us to the present and where we're sitting

213
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:13,359
at this time so you can try both i've i've certainly tried them both and i find leaving my eyes opens more

214
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:19,599
supportive uh for my meditation

215
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:27,039
thank you very much foo thank you kevin thank you everyone have a nice day please stay safe
