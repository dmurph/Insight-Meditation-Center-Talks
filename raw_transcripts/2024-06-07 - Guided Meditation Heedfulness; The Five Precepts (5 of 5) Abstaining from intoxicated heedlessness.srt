1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,560
welcome greetings so today we'll

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,280
finish with our exploration of the five precepts at least in this in this uh

3
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:19,640
Gathering I very much hope that this has been inspiring to people to

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:26,279
undertake some um mindful attention to these the

5
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:33,200
ideas in these precepts if not the precepts themselves but certainly consider making these commitments to

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,640
explore non-harming action in our practice as a support for

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,280
practice and take them out into the world may they may they benefit all

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:50,800
beings today we'll talk about the fifth precept I joked yesterday that it was

9
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,879
appropriate for Friday because this is the precept that warns us against or

10
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:01,960
that's the wrong phrasing encourage us us to abstain from from intoxicated

11
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:08,280
heedlessness we'll talk about what that means after we sit together but

12
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,040
uh in the joking manner or light-hearted manner I hope I've conveyed also that

13
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,280
this practice of five precepts can be taken on with a light heart with a

14
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,400
smile uh almost with a sense of play it's a it's an opportunity to find out

15
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,000
how we show up in the world and really it's a it's a way to let our strengths

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
our natural and authentic capacities for doing good emerge by clearing away some

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,399
of the harmful activities we're we engage in or that we're tempted to engage

18
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,159
in so let's meditate to start with prepare our minds for the Dharma with

19
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,399
with a half hour Set uh find yourself into your

20
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,799
meditation posture of emphasized earlier this week and the guided finding some balance or

21
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:10,000
it's actually not finding balance searching for balance cultivating balance as much as noticing the balance

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:16,400
that's there when we bring our attention Inward and downward from the outside world to this

23
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,959
inner life from the head to the heart from the heart to the

24
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:33,000
body balancing and rebalancing again and again the tightness the wrapped upness

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,319
of the Mind in thought with the Stillness that's available here with the

26
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,560
breath the heess and nowness of our experience that's in the center of

27
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,239
things along with the breathing today we'll spend a little bit

28
00:02:52,239 --> 00:03:00,720
more time than we have with connecting with the breath so we can do it in this way this

29
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,319
today in this meditation when we do this activity that strengthens our

30
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,920
mindfulness of redirecting attention back to the center of things back to the

31
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:20,080
ground back to our rootedness here now using the breath most commonly as an

32
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,680
anchor as a way to

33
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,480
reenter we can we can notice how the mind connects

34
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,319
with the breath and with the qualities that are inherent in the

35
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:43,599
breathing in ways that let a little bit of the breaths natural characteristics

36
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,159
and qualities rub off on the mind if you

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,200
will when we find ourselves caught up in thought thinking about the future

38
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,200
thinking about the past thinking about other people thinking about

39
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,000
ourselves we can notice maybe that it's a little tight maybe the pace of things

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,880
picks up the speed of thought is quite quick maybe we notice it's a little off

41
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:24,880
Balan where we feel a little off-kilter when we return attention to the breath

42
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,960
we connect the mind with the Simplicity of the breath

43
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:38,400
the slow pace of the breath the uncomplicated nature of the

44
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,680
breath the balance of the breath and these qualities sort of rub

45
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:51,720
off on the mind when the Mind rests here the mind can enjoy the Stillness

46
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:58,560
the balance the Simplicity and the slow pace that are natural to the breathing

47
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,639
in meditation

48
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,560
when the mind gets sort of tight caught up around a thought something that's got to be done today something that was done

49
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,800
or maybe left undone yesterday some interaction we expect

50
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,479
with someone else or had with someone else some concern with ourselves the

51
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:38,240
usual places that the Mind helps us and can get us caught up and

52
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,919
Tangled when we when we open back up to the breathing in the middle of things bringing the breathing back to the

53
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,919
center of attention to the forground

54
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,759
we can notice the Mind connecting with other aspects of the

55
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,639
breathing the breathing doesn't need to plan the next breath

56
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,360
the breathing seems to be extremely confident in this breath

57
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,280
right here this one and now this

58
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:24,720
one breath doesn't concern itself about the breath five or 10 breaths ago

59
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,240
that it wasn't good enough wasn't adequate fell short should have been

60
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,080
better no the breath is just right

61
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,599
here the breath doesn't criticize itself

62
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:50,759
for being as it is the breath doesn't aspire to become a master

63
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:57,520
breather so again a light-hearted playful way of recognizing that when we

64
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:04,840
bring attention back to the breathing we can connect with all these wonderful qualities of the breath and they're just

65
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:10,720
natural to the breath we don't have to do anything except for make the connection keep

66
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:17,680
reintroducing the the mind to this place of rest in the breath and just let those good qualities

67
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,120
of the breathing slow steady

68
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,280
confident here now balanced simple

69
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:39,479
just let those rub off on the mind the Mind likes this the Mind enjoys this

70
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:50,680
rest this gentle breathing in and out even if it's sometimes quivery sometimes

71
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,159
deeper shallower slower

72
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:01,919
quicker the breathing can be a place for the mind to

73
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
rest

74
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440

e e

107
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:05,480
so so as we reconnect again and again with the Here and Now by way of connecting introducing and reintroducing

108
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:13,480
the mind with the with the Simplicity the slow pace

109
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:17,640
the balance of the body of the

110
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:26,519
breathing we can make this a Point of Departure for dedicating the Merit of our practice

111
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:33,520
today and we share some of the ease and calm that comes to us in the meditation

112
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:41,480
with others can we lean into a heartfelt wish

113
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:48,640
that others benefit from the practice knowing that when others

114
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,279
benefit we also

115
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,120
benefit so so wishing all beings well wishing all beings safety security

116
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:08,120
Freedom from Want wishing all

117
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:15,120
beings Comfort ease wishing all

118
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:23,840

[Music]

121
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:03,360
welcome again everyone greetings and thank you for this week of practice together appreciate you including me

122
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:10,760
in this wonderful Community still following the chat over here um so yeah

123
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:17,640
today we'll bring our uh exploration of the five precepts to a temporary

124
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:22,840
conclusion because I fully hope that you'll continue making

125
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:28,760
these commitments to avoiding harm harmful activity that you'll make these

126
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,840
part of your regular practice

127
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:40,000
um I think another thing that makes some distinct from Commandments is that they're fun to work with actually

128
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,159
they're freeing to work with and so that can make them quite enjoyable to work

129
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:53,880
with before I jump into them uh several people asked last time and I I mention

130
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:01,159
it I mentioned it sorry looking at the chat um because several people asked

131
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:07,120
where do I teach and this gives me an opportunity to tell you if you don't know already about some other offerings

132
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:14,080
of IMC because that's where I that's where I teach IMC and Affiliated organizations I teach occasionally in

133
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:21,120
imc's year round Eightfold Path program if you don't know it's out there check it out um opportunity to work through

134
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:28,159
the uh steps of the eful path over the course of a year coming to a close now begins again late summer keep an eye on

135
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,519
the IMC website I teach at IRC the re Retreat

136
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:39,600
Center um and be aware on the IRC website that there are new listings for

137
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:44,840
what we're calling off-site Retreats offered by um a new group of IMC

138
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:51,720
teachers and teacher trainees over the next couple years all sorts of different kinds of Retreats that allow us to

139
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:59,320
expand outside of the IRC um format and uh accommodate many more practitioners

140
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:06,279
than can be accommodated at IRC and then I also give I also teach

141
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:11,840
with others um through the Sati Center and I there I teach with colleagues you

142
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:18,840
may know Diana Clark Kim Allen Ying Chen and I have taught for several years now ongoing

143
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:23,919
series of study and practice courses with more coming up this summer we also

144
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:31,279
teach a retreat together and finally occasionally I teach with Andrea Castillo in Spanish

145
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:37,240
both course of suta study this year and uh at the retreat center so check those

146
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,039
out check out the IMC offerings on the Spanish parts of the website and uh you

147
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:48,399
know the regular Tuesday night group and if you're a Spanish-speaking

148
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:54,120
practitioner okay I didn't want to spend much time on that but I did end the meditation a minute

149
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,360
early uh always love to talk about other the

150
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:07,080
offerings so the fifth precept is a uh is a precept in which we undertake a

151
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:14,039
commitment to refrain from what I've called over the course of the week it's a tongue twister I know but intoxicated

152
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:23,480
heedlessness I found myself liking this phrase because I think it brings attention to the the challenge of um

153
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:29,519
this uh precept rather than again a commandment a rule to

154
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:36,080
not not you know not take drugs not drink

155
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,799
which um it just wouldn't be super helpful I don't think but the focus is

156
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:49,519
on in a way heedlessness and other words that can translate the term that's used

157
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:58,000
in P pada um negligence indolence remissness carelessness

158
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:03,760
um the particular challenge of intoxicants of all kinds is that they

159
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:11,159
they lead us into actions that are can cause harm it's not so much that and then can

160
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:17,799
cause physical harm to ourselves obviously um but the uh it's that

161
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:23,600
heedless careless action that can result from intoxication that is the that is

162
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:30,200
the thing to watch one thing that can be noticed in our

163
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,519
lives and practice and this is an ancient thing probably as long as there's been fully modern hom Homo

164
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:42,679
sapiens there has been the urge to intoxication and in that way

165
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:48,720
to um

166
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,279
transcend this you know this body this Earthly realm this human life uh even if

167
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,760
it's brief even if it has side effects even if you wake up and not feeling good

168
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:07,360
the next day um that urge is very old and this precept can bring our attention

169
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:15,519
to that urge to not only intoxication but to the carelessness or the carefreeness that comes with it and for

170
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:23,080
interacting with this the Buddha had a framework uh that turns up with frequency in the sutas and it's not as

171
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:29,360
uh in the discourses and it's not as commonly talked about as Frameworks like the four no truths for

172
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:36,440
example but it's referred to as the gratification the danger and the Escape sort of a three-part way of looking I

173
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:43,960
think particularly useful in looking at the fifth precept and are I don't want to say Universal but uh an very common

174
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:50,080
urge to urge to heedlessness urge to intoxication urge to leaving it all

175
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,360
behind stepping outside of it for a period of time

176
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:02,000
um the um the idea there is just that in the

177
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,919
things we we use as intoxicants and again the prescription is very specific

178
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:15,118
in the language actually it's not that specific but it it calls out fermented beverages still

179
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:23,000
Beverages and other substances yeah Maja other substances

180
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:31,240
that intoxicate and can lead to heedlessness but I think we could can extend that to behaviors gambling binge

181
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:40,839
shopping I'm sorry retail therapy binge watching friends there can be a lot of different ways that we um seek to step

182
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:47,878
outside our suffering or to distract ourselves and that's the tendency to watch but to recognize first that

183
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:53,679
there's gratification in that that that it's hard life that there's suffering in

184
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,760
it right as we know from the first Noble Truth that this UNS

185
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:03,839
satisfactoriness and the challenge of living in a world of impermanence and

186
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:10,960
unreliability of experience it gets to us and it causes um it causes stress

187
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,160
that we would like to relieve and we looked all sorts of ways of doing this some are healthier some are more

188
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:23,200
skillful than others but noticing that this provides

189
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,480
gratification and what it does in the system can be extremely EX extremely

190
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:35,359
important because it brings us closer to understanding our suffering the danger can be pretty

191
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:40,400
obvious we notice that in this case the particular danger of intoxicated

192
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:45,599
heedlessness is the heedlessness the carelessness the um what was another

193
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:52,240
word I used remissness the negligence a lot of different words that come in there that help us understand that

194
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:57,400
that's the danger of of the thing maybe it's the hangover maybe it's the physical harm those things are important

195
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:02,800
maybe maybe it's you know harm caused to others by our absence or our distraction

196
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,880
or our inability to be present with others but we can notice that the

197
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:15,319
principal danger is that we we make decisions that we engage in actions that

198
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:21,920
um don't um have in them appropriate care for ourselves or others and that

199
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:28,920
cause harm and then finally the idea of the Escape I say finally third the idea of

200
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:34,560
Escape that there there is from this cycle of gratification and danger that

201
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,760
we can get kind of caught up in there is an escape and of course the Buddhist

202
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,160
remedy is this practice that um this is a way to get close to our suffering

203
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:53,680
understand it and uh ease it and that this is a way out and this it doubles

204
00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:00,040
back on itself as so much practice does that this way right here even meeting together and practicing

205
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:07,960
together this way right here helps address the the gratification we find in

206
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:16,800
um intoxicants and the the danger of getting caught up in them but paying attention um to what's

207
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:22,160
going on in our experience in the meditation in particular is um you know

208
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:28,800
is the escapees a strong word but is certainly an antidote to

209
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,160
um an antidote to the intoxication that leads to

210
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,359
harmless uh sorry harmful um

211
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,200
heedlessness so two thoughts for the day I'm going to say a few things and then just spend a couple minutes summarizing

212
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:54,200
so going a little bit more quickly through the fifth precept than we did with precepts two through four we did do

213
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:59,520
a little intro with the first precept but wanted to summarize a little bit at

214
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:07,160
the end so here's a couple thoughts for the day one of the most useful um ways

215
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:12,560
that has worked for me in in working with the fifth precept

216
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:19,720
is practice known as urge surfing urge surfing some of you are probably familiar with this again not much

217
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,960
original here the recognition that strong emotions including something like

218
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:31,400
the Temptation or the urge to to become intox to lead you know to step outside

219
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:41,280
this human life for a brief moment um or a period of time uh through a uh unskillful

220
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:48,599
activity uh usually lasts for 90 seconds right any strong emotion typically Peaks

221
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:53,760
like the crest of a wave in 90 seconds and this is a practice of riding out that

222
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,079
wave as a surfer would I don't surf so the metaphor is a little lost on me but

223
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:04,680
I have watched Surfers I get the idea that a wave has a Crest and if you can

224
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:09,960
wait through it recognizing fully present with it noticing it happening

225
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:16,319
um with after a fairly brief time which can be a difficult and painful time

226
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:23,000
urges recede and it can be an opportunity to watch urges come and

227
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,079
go um the I think it can be really useful

228
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:36,520
to watch the urge I uh have for for many years I used to enjoy a cold I I hope

229
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:42,960
I'm not oversharing here a cold beer in the afternoon and um I've been very grateful

230
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:50,280
for the um the explosion of all sorts of non-alcoholic bruise of quality in the

231
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:56,480
last I don't know 10 years what I can bring attention to that's really interesting and I encourage you to do

232
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:03,040
this with whatever you know intoxicant you've had maybe some challenges with um

233
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:10,880
and again that can be all sorts of different behaviors is to choose something that um allows you to explore

234
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,640
the urge to intoxicated heedlessness or intoxicated freedom from this

235
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:22,720
realm um but doesn't provide the intoxication but allows understanding

236
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,800
that urge to that gratification and perhaps the urge to that that

237
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:36,599
heedlessness um it really brings us it can bring us very close to our suffering what is it that I want relief from oh

238
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:43,079
it's this it's this and being it allows us to be close with that instead of

239
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:49,440
papering it over or balancing it with good feelings or all the sorts of things

240
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,480
that these kinds of intoxicants behaviors and substances alike can bring us so use it as an opportunity to get

241
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,720
close to yourself to get close to use the practice to get intimate with your experience including the urges that a

242
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:09,520
lot of times we look away from we don't really want to we don't really want to know them and

243
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:14,920
uh this practice encourages us to get close to that stuff step in it know

244
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:22,039
ourselves know that suffering get close to it pay attention to it learn from

245
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,520
it so anyway think about that Friday night

246
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:33,880
right so a little bit of review may be useful in the in the closing minutes

247
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:39,520
um engaging with these teachings with this with this teaching of the precepts

248
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:46,680
as I kind of discovered for myself in talking with you yesterday uh is interesting in part because the

249
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:54,280
abstaining from these things is so freeing that they it does support practice to engage in leaving something

250
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:02,359
behind maybe that should be no surprise it should be no surp surprise to me that letting go is freeing but I it's

251
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:08,200
interesting that this is what the precepts are about they're another way of letting go there another way of

252
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:13,760
inclining the Mind toward Simplicity and particularly uh something

253
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:23,160
that sort of come to me this week is when we let some of these behaviors go um one of the beauties of um the

254
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:30,480
commitment to abstain or refrain from harm from harmful actions is that it's

255
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,040
not an injunction to do the opposite right these it doesn't say these

256
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:42,720
precepts don't say engage in skillful speech engage in giving engage in protecting life helping life Thrive

257
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:49,800
engage in loyal sexual relationships or engage in sobriety they don't say engage

258
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:55,880
what they do is leave room to see what emerges in our practice right because

259
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:01,800
the freeing that happens is very individual and has as many variations as there are people here

260
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:08,839
today and people who practice what we do is we clear those those unskillful activities out of the

261
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:16,520
way we get out of our own way and then we can watch what emerges what particular skillful activities can I

262
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:23,359
authentically and naturally offer to the practice to the world to others to myself each of us will be

263
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:30,920
different and I think when we clear away some of this you know even if they're not super harmful activities they may

264
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:36,839
not be particularly beneficial and it allows us to watch oh here's this

265
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:42,599
arising here's an urge to care here's an urge to be fully present with this

266
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:50,200
suffering here's an urge to give something instead of taking something I could go on and on here's an urge to listen more carefully to give attention

267
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:56,280
to somebody I've said it several times this week but the more we do this the more

268
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:02,760
likely it is that end up eventually in a place where we're unable to engage in harmful activity and and beneficial

269
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,119
activity just emerges naturally from our practice we're kind of out of the way as

270
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:13,480
actors and actions come forth that are that uh are

271
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:19,599
beneficial and to end on that note I want to quote I've been thinking of this all week actually um from the first time

272
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:24,920
I said that this isn't about actors it's about actions the famous Suzuki roshi

273
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:31,640
quote I hope I can get it right or right enough um I think of it because Suzuki

274
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:38,839
roshi was such an important influence on Gil his thinking his teaching um but he has a famous quote

275
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:46,520
where he says strictly I think I get it right strictly speaking there is no such thing as enlightened beings there's just

276
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:52,319
enlightened activity and maybe this is something to take forward

277
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:58,280
into uh the weekend at least or maybe just the next moment strictly speaking

278
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:04,440
there's no such thing as enlightened beings just enlightened activity so it's really when we get out of the way in

279
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:11,160
this way we uh allow activities to come forward when we bring attention to our

280
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:19,640
activities and stop beating ourselves up for being being bad being not perfect actors we allow this free emergence of

281
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:25,119
activities that support us support our practice help ourselves help other

282
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,520
beings so with that in mind uh a general dedication of Merit for our

283
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:37,680
practice this week so much appreciate you uh allowing me to share the Dharma with you in this you know kind of

284
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:45,079
unusual way for me uh where I can't see anybody um I know you're out there love the chat um I'll be back probably

285
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:50,640
sometime I think in July to again step sit in for Gil and I look forward to

286
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:55,680
that very much having done this now this week so take care I'll let the chat run

287
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:02,160
for a while uh um and follow that after we sign off but take care all have a

288
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:08,640
wonderful weekend and uh May our paths cross again soon take

289
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,640
