1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:06,520
welcome good day hope you're doing well and

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,240
uh today we turn to the fourth of the five spiritual

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:21,680
faculties and this is the faculty of the the collected still mind that we

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,240
cultivate in the meditation and I'll talk today in the

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,800
brief daret about how this this faculty this competency

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:39,399
this quality of mind

7
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:46,360
this capacity of mind is related to mindfulness which we talked about

8
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:53,199
yesterday and also give a couple pointers about

9
00:00:53,199 --> 00:01:00,519
um how to create sufficient steadiness of mind to see clearly which is the

10
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:06,438
the particular benefit that this Factor provides to our

11
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:13,920
practice so I may seem a little uh distracted by the technical

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,758
challenge this morning that don't let that throw you

13
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,118
off it's just the

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,840
internet so so let's begin by sitting meditation we'll

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:42,040
bring our attention this morning to the Stillness and steadiness that's

16
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,119
available to us in the

17
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:53,000
meditation and perhaps even as we just begin to sit and bring our attention

18
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,438
Inward and downward we can

19
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,920
recognize the greater Stillness of the meditative

20
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,280
space most of us have been meditating long enough that the contrast between

21
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,440
our what I think of is the walking around world the the getting through the

22
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,760
day in our practice world with the formal sitting practice which we engage

23
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:31,840
now that there's a greater Stillness a greater collectiveness a

24
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,879
greater focus a greater uh Unity of

25
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:47,440
attention and we can bring attention to this knowing that giving it the gift of

26
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,120
attention strengthens it cultivates it so once

27
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,000
again in the case of this fourth fourth faculty

28
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:09,519
wholeness of the mind or wholeness of attention in the meditation we don't have to reach outside our own

29
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,519
experience we can look within and by noticing

30
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:23,200
any degree of Stillness of collectiveness of calm of ease in the meditative space we can

31
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:30,439
further strengthen it and a particular instruction that we

32
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:37,120
can remember today as we come back to the breath over and over again strengthening our ability to return to

33
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:43,480
be here now we can connect again with the breath

34
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,519
at hand whichever one we first connect with an out breath here and INB breath

35
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:56,599
there so we come back to Center we can just say softly to

36
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:01,680
ourselves breathing in steadying the

37
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,359
Mind breathing out steadying the

38
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:15,320
mind we can add breathing in gladdening the

39
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:20,959
mind breathing out gladdening the

40
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:29,400
mind and these soft reminders to ourself Upon Our return to Center

41
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:38,000
can bring greater steadiness collectedness to the mind and also enjoy that greater

42
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,199
steadiness and collectiveness enjoying it in a way that

43
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,800
strengthens

44
00:04:51,720 --> 00:05:00,320
too to these two phrases we can add a third breathing in

45
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,639
letting the Mind rest breathing

46
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,360
out providing a place where the mind can

47
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,240
rest so any one of these three all of them

48
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:26,600
together in any particular order can be useful phrases to drop into

49
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,520
the meditation when we return with the breath

50
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:37,919
steadying the mind gladdening the

51
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:45,800
mind letting the Mind rest giving the mind a place to

52
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
rest

53
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
e

54
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
e

55
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
e

56
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
e

57
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440

58
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440

59
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360

60

e e

61
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:57,880
so it's a natural thing that the Mind Finds Its way into activity gets

62
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,399
caught up and looking forward looking back looking outward looking

63
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:09,920
inward it's the mind's job those are capacities of mind that

64
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:17,000
are welldeveloped we return to

65
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Center to strengthen capacities of mind that are less

66
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:30,399
developed we appreciate the others and in this practice we

67
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:37,160
cultivate the capacity of mind to be still to be clear to be

68
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:47,399
here when we return attention to the Here and Now of our

69
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:52,720
experience we can drop in these phrases connecting with this in breath

70
00:11:52,720 --> 00:12:01,240
breathing in steadying the mind gladdening the mind

71
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,240
resting the

72
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
mind

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,480
finding our way in the practice

to this breath right here and

98
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,640
then breathing in steadying the

Mind breathe in letting the Mind

102
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:36,960
rest breathing out letting the Mind

103
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:04,399
rest we can take this Stillness with us this mindful attention this sustained

104
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:12,240
mindful attention this still collected grounded mind it's

105
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:20,760
portable we can carry it with us into the interactions of daily

106
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:30,039
life we can call on this quality of mind this capacity of mind when it's needed

107
00:26:30,039 --> 00:26:35,760
the stronger it is the more we cultivate it in the practice the the easier it is

108
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,240
to find it when we need it the easier it is that it becomes over

109
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:46,279
time second nature that it arises to meet

110
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,240
life and as we cultivate it we can share it

111
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:08,080
May the benefit of our practice May some of the Stillness the

112
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:17,240
calm the ease and meeting experience the sustained ability to give

113
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:24,480
attention May these Ripple out into the world and benefit other other

114
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:33,520
beings may all beings share and some of this contentment some of this

115
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:39,360
ease may all beings be free

116
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:55,530
[Music]

117
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:10,880
welcome again friends and so far we've been having

118
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:18,360
good good internet connectivity I expected to fail at any moment and that's one place my mind has

119
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:24,000
been going uh if you're just joining now this is Thursday a fourth day of

120
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:32,360
exploring the five spiritual faculties and we'll talk a little bit about some body wholeness of mind and as I guided

121
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:37,960
in the meditation the steadiness collectedness groundedness rootedness

122
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:44,240
heess sustained heess and nness of mind just making up words here

123
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:51,960
right and left where the language doesn't fit the Dharma let's change the

124
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:59,440
language I like to say the heess and nness of our experience so

125
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:05,679
I hope at some point the OED will recognize my coinages in English I

126
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:12,320
mentioned at the outset of the hour that uh I've received the word from the good

127
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:20,679
people at Xfinity that the internet's there're going to be outages beginning at 6:00 a.m. so far we're good um if I

128
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:26,039
disappear I set myself up as co-host on my phone I see all the chats about The

129
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:33,840
Echoes believe me I heard the echoes what I reflected on is how this is a nice metaphor for

130
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:41,799
suffering the constant echoing of One's Own voice in one's head uh and the ease that comes when

131
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:49,440
that Echo is reduced or softened um maybe we come to understand its function

132
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:58,519
better and we can thus let go of it a little bit at some point in attempting to uh

133
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:06,240
address the echo which I I I use zoom a lot so I know the echo thing this is a little different issue and I finally um

134
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,640
thought okay I'm going to use an old trick I'll just put the phone under my leg and there will you know I won't be

135
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:18,480
able to hear the Echo and uh that disconnected the meeting at which point there was this

136
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,760
lovely silence as that Echo stopped and there too I was like oh okay there's

137
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,880
that there's that ease that comes with the relaxing of that echo of my own

138
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:37,039
telling myself about my experience in the world at any rate I did my best to

139
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:45,159
engage the technical challenge with with the Dharma and uh make the echo into a

140
00:30:45,159 --> 00:30:52,399
teaching so and maybe I'm going to keep going with that why not yeah so this fourth factor which

141
00:30:52,399 --> 00:31:00,600
is somati and I love the word in poly somati s m d s m a d h i samade it's a

142
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:06,919
lovely word it has many translations none of them very very accurate um but

143
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:14,679
the closest literally uh as Gil has probably shared is collectiveness of Mind somadi means a bringing together of

144
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:21,399
mind collectiveness of mind Stillness of mind and ease of mind

145
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:26,639
and I'll share this interesting history with

146
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:32,320
you and uh now that I've lost my other Zoom sign

147
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:37,679
in if we get cut off I'll pick it up tomorrow uh

148
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,760
but when the people who first translated the word samati translated it they used

149
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:49,200
the word concentration the word the meaning of the word concentration its associations

150
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:56,360
in English particularly on this side of the Atlantic um have changed since that time

151
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:02,159
when they use the word concentr it meant and I'm quoting here um the action of

152
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,200
bringing to a center the act of collecting or combining into or about a

153
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:15,519
central point and this is a really nice definition of uh of samade this idea of

154
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:22,519
collecting or combining into about a central point right that's one meaning of

155
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:30,000
concentration if you think about it from the Latin you don't have to speak Latin to sit in on these 7 a.m. talks

156
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:39,320
concentrate that is with the center so I like the idea that we're bringing the mind to around the breath around the

157
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:45,559
center of our spiritual life the breathing the body right our ability to

158
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:51,120
be with our experience without adding things as I've been talking about the last couple

159
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:57,399
days and then later the same word concentrate comes to have a meaning which will be familiar from other uses

160
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:03,039
which is to intensify or condense I think for example of

161
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:08,080
concentrated orange juice not very common anymore but when I

162
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:16,720
was growing up um orange juice was kind of an unusual thing fresh orange juice with or without pulp or with some pulp

163
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:23,080
wasn't really a thing fresh in the grocery aisle but rather one thing

164
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:29,919
something that one's parents made from concentrate this idea of of of bringing

165
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:35,760
the mind's ease and the steadiness of mind and the gladness of Mind sort of in

166
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,200
a way that intensifies it also really describes

167
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:48,919
some so when when thinking about this fourth

168
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:57,039
faculty I think the best uh the best word to use is samade and the associations maybe

169
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,840
that you can start create with that with that aspect of the meditative

170
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:10,800
experience so Diana Clark one of my lovely colleagues somebody I teach with uh good

171
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,960
friend uh describes this fourth faculty as if I something like this um a

172
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,760
Stillness of Mind accompanied by a feeling of well-being and these two things together

173
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:30,720
are really important that there's both the Stillness of of mind and the sense of

174
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:38,760
ease or well-being that comes with it and this is why these phrases dropped into the meditation can be so so useful

175
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:45,040
that is steadying the mind gladdening the mind steadying the mind gladdening

176
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,320
the mind as I've been saying the last few days the gladdening is important

177
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:56,000
because it helps us um it helps us appreciate and it

178
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:04,160
actually triggers important things in the brain that this pleasure taken in the steadiness of Mind helps us um helps

179
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:11,400
us strengthen it another way to think about strengthening or cultivating is just it helps us create a path we talk

180
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:17,599
about the path of practice part of the path is getting figuring out remembering

181
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:25,240
how to get back here and you know if you think about a well-known path in your life you know to this 7-Eleven at the

182
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:32,359
corner or to work or to we we we develop a path and then it becomes automatic and

183
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:39,078
this is true with the practice too that as we go oh this is how the mind is

184
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,359
steadied we become so used to recreating those conditions that support that

185
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:51,319
steadiness of mind that we forget that there's a there's a path we're following

186
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:58,480
and part of that path I think the the cookie crumbs along the path or the uh markers the mile markers ERS along the

187
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,280
path that's the gladness oh right right I move this direction because it feels

188
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:10,200
good and it it it feels good because there's more steadiness of Mind there

189
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,280
and we keep inclining the mind in the direction of that

190
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:22,440
steadiness so the

191
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:29,560
um a way that can be very useful to think of this faculty of mind is how it relates to the one we talked about

192
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:34,960
yesterday mindfulness um Andrea fella co- guiding teacher of

193
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,520
IMC has said in the past that she likes to think of somati this fourth faculty

194
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,599
as a sustained mindfulness that mindfulness are attention to the present

195
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:54,599
moment when it becomes sustained and when maybe going two days back when the E when the effort involved becomes

196
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:00,839
effortless right that that that steadiness of mind that sort of

197
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:07,200
consistent bringing of mindful judgment free attention to what's coming up in

198
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,640
our experience in the meditation for example but also other other points of the

199
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,560
day that this is a way to characterize what what suade can be and I think

200
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,520
that's a really useful idea of Andreas just because you can it's it's another thing where we can notice that happening

201
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:30,800
we'll notice oh here's a period of 5 minutes 10 minutes half a day half an hour where there's a lot of sustained

202
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:37,240
mindful attention and we can recognize oh that's this steadiness of Mind

203
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:42,720
similarly in the meditation itself we keep bringing attention back to the breathing and sometimes we'll notice

204
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,880
yeah there's just this easeful being with the breathing where there's not a lot of maybe stuff's going on in the

205
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:56,920
mind but it's not it's not getting a lot of attention it's just kind of coming and going um that sustained mindfulness

206
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:05,440
that sustained gained being here that's that steadiness of mind with as Diana says a feeling of a feeling of

207
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:14,480
well-being this fourth faculty it's true with mindfulness as well in the texts we

208
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:20,280
have in the teachings they're both ends and means they're they're they're a

209
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:27,040
they're a lovely place to sit and abide as as it said and at the same time there

210
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,760
means to an end so mindful attention has benefits in and of itself it's always

211
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:39,560
more useful to be here now rather than there then in the

212
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:45,720
mind right present for what's coming up in our experience

213
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:52,760
um and at the same time mindfulness over and over again leads to this sustained

214
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:59,440
steadiness Stillness of mind with with ease with a feeling of well-being

215
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:05,880
and this fourth faculty samade it also is a pleasant abiding as

216
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,720
the text say a pleasant place to be something to take pleasure in because it's a wholesome pleasure doesn't depend

217
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:18,760
on external conditions doesn't lead to over attachment or holding on we can

218
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:24,280
try but eventually we learn oh it's just a pleasant place to be without strings

219
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:30,880
attached as it were um and it too in addition to being a

220
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:37,160
pleasant abiding in the Here and Now is a means to an end and uh there's a

221
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:44,640
lovely phrase from the texts that I'll read you where does it where does it go what what's how is it a means to an end

222
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,680
I got to make sure I'm not running over time I could talk about this all morning but eventually the internet

223
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:56,640
would get out I'd like to think that this profound

224
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:03,560
teaching could break the internet and yet it's just exfinity service

225
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:10,280
disruption so this phrase says practitioners you you and me

226
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:17,760
both this Stillness of mind with well-being it's like a lake in a mountain range transparent clear

227
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,839
undisturbed and standing on the shore of this Lake a person with good eyesight

228
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:29,440
could see oysters shells and Pebbles and fish moving about and fish holding still

229
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:35,079
and that person might think ah this transparent Clear undisturbed Lake I Can

230
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:40,400
See Clearly shells oysters Stones Pebbles fish moving about fish standing

231
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:46,640
still in shes in the very same way this Stillness

232
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,480
of Mind allows for Clear seeing and in particular it allows us to see all that

233
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,640
extra being added on to experience that causes suffering or that is suffering

234
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:07,119
and it allows us to see that the mind can be free of suffering so this is the particular

235
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:13,000
importance and power of this fourth spiritual faculty or fourth Divine human

236
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:20,800
quality that we cultivate in the meditation I like to sum this up by saying that the still mind the collected

237
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:29,119
mind the sodi mind to make up another word sees clearly the still mind sees

238
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,200
clearly the still mind can see the arising and passing of suffering without

239
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:39,800
getting all caught up in it just noticing the coming and

240
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,640
going so this is how this particular fourth faculty benefits Us in the

241
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:57,800
practice it allows us a way to be very very here with our experience in a way

242
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:05,960
that makes the subtlest arisings the subtest um creations of suffering

243
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:11,480
apparent to us and uh little by little maybe

244
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:16,599
starting with the larger grosser uh disturbances turbulence

245
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:25,760
suffering selfing that happens in the mind we can sort of um notice ever more

246
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,960
subtle arisings of stress and tension and suffering at that subtle level it's

247
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:37,559
easier to let go of it it's easier to just let it Bubble Up

248
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:44,280
and bubble down so may this teaching be a benefit

249
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:51,000
to you and may we I at any rate learn from today just uh uh I I really like

250
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,400
that metaphor of the zoom Echo that I think we've all experienced whenever you try to zoom with somebody in the same

251
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,559
rby if it's your stunt double in my case this

252
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:09,240
morning that uh there's a way to uh recognize that really unpleasant chatter

253
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:15,720
that comes with the echo as a nice metaphor for what it's like to be in our heads when we first sit down and

254
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,960
meditate all this all this me myself and I

255
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:26,559
reverberating um I think it too related the way when

256
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:32,880
we hear our voices it doesn't sound like it does in our heads so there's lots of there's lots of nice little metaphors

257
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,280
there that um and it's just a reminder that we can incorporate even the most

258
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:46,240
random of experiences into our practice at any rate

259
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:54,280
um may your days go well and uh and uh May that may that

260
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:00,680
echo of our attachments and um unskillful engagement with the world

261
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:09,839
maybe may may that be reduced a little bit by our practice today for ourselves and for others and may we have some of

262
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:15,319
that clarity as some of that uh ability to see clearly that comes with the

263
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:21,599
unification of mind or the sustained mindful attention to the here and now

264
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:27,880
may that be of benefit to us and to others all right I look forward to seeing you tomorrow

265
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:33,960
hopefully Xfinity will have completed its work and uh we will'll we'll take

266
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:40,119
we'll move on from here thanks very much take care
