1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:09,680
good morning and welcome to our meditation And

2
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:18,039
uh one of the differences between mindfulness and

3
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:25,760
insight is that mindfulness is the use of attention that uh prepares the ground to

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:34,079
have insight to have a deep seeing and uh or true seeing seeing truly or

5
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,480
actually how things are And

6
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,360
um and so as we sit today in mindfulness

7
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:51,800
meditation the role of samadei is to be able to sit in the

8
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,399
middle of uh all our capacities for

9
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:03,440
attention and have them unified in some kind of wonderful way working together

10
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:10,159
So attentional capacities we have are recognition a cognitive knowing of

11
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:18,360
what's happening And this cognitive knowing may or may not be verbal It might be kind of a nonverbal

12
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,360
knowing It might also be a kind of visual knowing Some people are visual

13
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:33,079
thinkers Another attentional faculty is our capacity to sense and to feel with our

14
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:38,840
senses And in Buddhism the the idea of sense

15
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:46,439
experience just like it it includes seeing hearing smelling tasting and the

16
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,159
tactile which is whatever sensations there are that are born through the body

17
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:59,920
There's a kind of sense door that uh very simply in the simplest possible way

18
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:07,040
uh knows or senses that we're thinking And I use both words knowing

19
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:13,120
and sensing thinking because thinking sometimes is more than just words and

20
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:20,400
ideas or images It's also the the you can feel the physicality sometimes of

21
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,680
thinking the tension or the pressure the contraction that comes along with

22
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:34,360
it Another attentional capacity is to settle back and observe

23
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,920
experience And this is to perceive without being in any kind of

24
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:50,400
way entangled with experience allowing things to be just as they are and not so intimate as feeling

25
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:58,400
sensing the experience and not so not so cognitive as an act of recognition But

26
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,239
it's it's observing without recognizing what something is

27
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,920
but observing how it moves and changes and comes and goes and shifts and

28
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:17,200
oscillates and vibrates and like you would sit and observe um a

29
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,120
river and you don't know the name of the river but uh you just you don't even the

30
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,680
idea it's a river even falls away Just watching the flow the current or the

31
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:36,519
waves washing against the shore or the a fire on a you know in a dark night the

32
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:42,599
outdoor bonfire And

33
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,959
uh and then to bring all these together in samadei is to

34
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:53,400
sit in the general sense of just being

35
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:01,760
present here All of ourselves included So to

36
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,519
begin very simply is to assume a meditation

37
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:17,079
posture A posture that for you supports attention

38
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:22,919
presence to the experience of the present moment

39
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:34,280
And to notice as you sit with your

40
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,360
body by what means

41
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:48,600
are you aware of your body in what way are you aware of your

42
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,720
body that's different than thinking about it or trying to analyze the

43
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:02,919
question analyze the topic of trying to figure out with your mind Nothing to figure

44
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,919
out rather when you're not

45
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:15,080
thinking In what way are you aware of having a

46
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,120
body in the meditation posture

47
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:30,720
is it a knowing recognition cognitive

48
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:40,800
recognition Is it a sensing sensations the

49
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:48,320
body maybe is maybe a broad glow or vibration through the body A diffuse

50
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:55,600
feeling of softness through the

51
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:03,240
body or particular sensations of

52
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:10,560
contact places the body touches Maybe where the body touches

53
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,319
itself the hands on them touching each other or on the thighs

54
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,680
And as you're aware of your

55
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,360
body allow the awareness to go through your body

56
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:46,080
wherever the awareness wants or wherever the body seems to

57
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,280
invite awareness So you're not directing the

58
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:59,000
awareness but rather you're following the

59
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,280
awareness where it goes in the

60
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:15,039
body Maybe you're following whatever

61
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:21,199
the body seems to call on for you to be at

62
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:28,400
with Sometimes it's a knowing sometimes it's sensing and

63
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:39,599
feeling having your awareness

64
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,039
follow and not direct not

65
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,080
letting the directing and actively doing

66
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:55,520
mind at

67
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:10,440
rest So you aren't taking the lead but you're allowing awareness

68
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,720
to join with the

69
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:34,880
body If you're aware of tension in your

70
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,039
body it's okay

71
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,880
See how simple the awareness can

72
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,880
be And if it's easy enough if you feel like it's the wish

73
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:17,800
the body has allow for the body to relax

74
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:40,040
If the body seems to invite you to relax or calm the

75
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,160
body then go ahead and allow for a calming

76
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,879
softening through your body

77
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:53,440
Where your body you seem to be most aware of the

78
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,440
body where is it easiest

79
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:07,480
for awareness to rest in the body

80
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:48,040
And then within the body as part of the body become aware of breathing

81
00:11:53,240 --> 00:12:00,040
Knowing breathing in a simple relaxed

82
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:08,240
way Knowing breathing in as breathing in breathing out as breathing

83
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:19,200
out Or perhaps sensing the sensations that come into play as you

84
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,160
breathe

85
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:38,760
Awareness can follow the sensations of breathing as they appear

86
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:59,079
And the knowing mind can from time to time know

87
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:03,839
recognize some of those sensations of

88
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:15,320
breathing We're knowing the sensations is meant to support

89
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,880
Staying close to the sensations of breathing

90
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:50,200
And as you exhale letting go of your

91
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,560
thoughts relaxing the thinking

92
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:01,120
mind and letting go into the body breathing

93
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,839
thing Yeah

94
00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:03,120
To know to feel and sense to be

95
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,120
aware continuously

96
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:21,000
enough that we find ourselves

97
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,679
settled here in present moment

98
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,559
experience The mind is steadied

99
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,520
thinking has become stiller and quieter

100
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,840
And then at some

101
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:04,039
point the capacity to simply observe

102
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:07,919
experience in the present

103
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:16,720
moment like waves endlessly washing up on the

104
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:21,120
shore A river

105
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,559
flowing Simply

106
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:40,399
knowing the movement the appearing and disappearing of

107
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,840
things without needing to know what they are

108
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,960
or to feel what they

109
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:06,160
are Nothing to figure out nothing to

110
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:13,880
fix nothing to accomplish

111
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:23,120
But to settle back with an overview that

112
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:37,520
observes the river of sensations the river of thoughts and

113
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,559
feelings as they flow through

114
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:57,080
Being careful to not getting stuck anywhere

115
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,240
Just watching the change

116
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,919
And as we come to the end of this

117
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,720
sitting to notice

118
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:41,240
again what you're aware of without any particular effort to be

119
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:47,440
aware except to be awake to be

120
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,000
here and how are you

121
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:04,200
aware is it there simple knowing recognizing

122
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,919
A simple

123
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:14,480
sensing a simple

124
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:25,440
observing or is there some kind of indistinct general sense of being

125
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:33,400
aware that doesn't quite fit any of those three categories

126
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,799
maybe because it's a natural blending of all

127
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,200
three that keeps you right here

128
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:26,960
And then to expand your here outward into your room the building

129
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,000
you're in the place location you're

130
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:41,360
in to expand your awareness outwards into the world

131
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:49,720
Considering how today you can live in

132
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:56,679
a generous way to the people you'll encounter to the world

133
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:05,080
itself How is it that the practice of meditation

134
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:11,520
awareness can lead you to benefit this world even in the

135
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:18,640
simplest ways may it be that the benefit from our

136
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,559
individual practice our collective practice

137
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:30,360
together translate to bringing welfare and happiness to this

138
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:37,159
world May all beings be happy May all

139
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:43,159
beings be safe May all

140
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:48,679
beings be peaceful May all

141
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:53,000
beings be free

142
00:29:54,290 --> 00:30:02,940
[Music]

143
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,440
Thank you

144
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:07,080
So hello and welcome to this third talk um introducing the topic of

145
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:13,279
insight and today I'd like to uh discuss the difference between mindfulness and

146
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:18,799
insight mindfulness and vipasa the word vipasana

147
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:24,360
is uh what we translate at IMC as

148
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:31,919
insight and uh some um people who practice mindfulness don't

149
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,279
uh don't translate vipasa they use it they just use the poly word to describe

150
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:45,600
the technique of practice that they do practicing vipasa and u sometimes in our tradition

151
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,679
in using the word insight we say we're practicing insight side

152
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:57,159
meditation But uh originally in back in ancient Buddha Buddhism the word

153
00:31:57,159 --> 00:32:02,320
vipasana did not refer to a practice It

154
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:09,159
referred to the results of the practice the way in which the practice led uh

155
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:14,840
practitioners uh to be able to see deeply into their

156
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:20,399
experience and um and that deep seeing

157
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:27,840
uh is uh uh is the insight that we see The insight we come to understand the

158
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:33,480
liberating um uh perspective orientation

159
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:41,600
understanding seeing per perception that uh comes into play uh in a way that

160
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:50,279
brings uh uh this liberation from suffering And um so uh mindfulness

161
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:56,159
practice is not the same as insight but it's mindfulness practice that leads to

162
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:04,399
the insight creates the conditions by which we're present enough and clear enough in our awareness perception to be

163
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:11,679
able to see clearly So this word vipasana I often uh

164
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:18,519
as I have on Monday um uh kind of described its meaning as being clear

165
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:23,840
seeing where the v the prefix vi is a uh

166
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:29,679
emp just a prefix of emphasis So it's emphasize it emphasizes seeing how we

167
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:37,840
see or strong seeing So it becomes clear seeing But the V can also uh be a prefix

168
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:45,039
that distinguishes things uh and uh that divides things And so another way of

169
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:53,240
understanding vipasana is that it's uh um uh distinctive seeing

170
00:33:53,240 --> 00:34:01,840
or distinguishing seeing Uh it's uh it's a uh seeing with seeing the the the

171
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,919
clear distinctions of things the seeing the with seeing with clarity so that we

172
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,480
see the particularities of what's actually happening

173
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:21,280
Um and uh and so it's again the emphasis is on what is seen in a sense not the

174
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:28,000
act of seeing So mindfulness is a practice that leads to that In classic Buddhism

175
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,280
mindfulness is not an end to itself but a means to something And um and so how is

176
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,960
mindfulness practiced in the teachings of the Buddha there are a number of

177
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,358
attentional faculties that are engaged that we can call mindfulness practice

178
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:53,839
leading to a very strong established sense of awareness

179
00:34:53,839 --> 00:35:01,040
And uh and so uh there's a we have a lot of attentional faculties and all of them

180
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,880
are awakened and and and uh and brought together in order to be established in

181
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,400
the present moment clearly enough in order to see distinctly And

182
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:19,680
um so there's knowing uh the simple recognition of experience

183
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:26,480
There is sensing or feeling experience experiencing it experientially

184
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,800
uh through the body And then there is something called uh

185
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:38,480
sajana which is uh often translated into as to English as clear recognition or

186
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,599
clear understanding And this is the uh I think the form of

187
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:49,920
practice that's most often taught in uh in what's called secular mindfulness and

188
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,520
sometimes in uh the Buddhist insight meditation tradition as well because

189
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:00,960
it's it's uh it's knowing it's recognizing but more than just a raw

190
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,119
simple recognition of what's there It's recognizing in a particular way So it

191
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,240
said recognize So it comes comes along with a greater understanding

192
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,480
uh perspective orientation So it's a um

193
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:22,640
uh knowing in uh without judgment

194
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:30,440
knowing um with kindness with friendliness uh knowing with spaciousness and

195
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:38,160
openness It's it's uh it's a un some kind of understanding of what we're what

196
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:46,000
we are seeing or knowing or feeling the context of it the the value of it and in

197
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:52,640
Buddhism this clear understanding of things uh is a very important form of uh

198
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:59,200
part of mindfulness training because as we understand uh in some simple way uh

199
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:04,880
the experience we it and guide us more deeply into our experience And one of

200
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,520
the very clear distinctions for clear comprehension clear understanding is to understand whether what we're doing

201
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,599
what's going on mental activity the practices we're doing is helpful or not

202
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:23,280
helpful Is it wholesome is it nourishing or is it not uh is it onward leading to

203
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,480
greater stability greater presence being more rooted here in the present moment

204
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,800
or is it not and uh so we're we're monitoring

205
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,960
ourselves a little bit as we practice so we can adjust how we are adjust how

206
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,000
we're practicing so that uh we begin enjoying it more It's not a strain It's

207
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,760
not hard work Uh but we're learning the art of being present in a supportive

208
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:57,440
um way that uh welcomes attention welcomes us to be We want to be present

209
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:03,040
And so uh clear comprehension of what's happening in the present moment uh is an

210
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:08,599
an aspect of mindfulness practice So there's knowing there's

211
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:14,320
sensing there's uh clear comprehension Uh and then the last one that's

212
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,440
mentioned in the Buddhist teachings on mindfulness practice is to um or two

213
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:26,240
kind of things is to when we're sensing to feel the whole body and as we are um

214
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:33,680
feeling it to relax the tensions and the holdings in the body So there is emphasis on calming the body as we

215
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,440
meditate So that's a that's a kind of a handful of things to hold together But

216
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,839
uh in practicing these in an easygoing relaxed way uh then what we're looking

217
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:52,680
for is uh coming into a place where awareness attention is

218
00:38:52,680 --> 00:39:00,640
now stabilized established um at ease resting here in the present

219
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:08,160
moment in our direct experience And um and uh and that takes a while Well it

220
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:15,280
takes a while for the thinking mind to calm down It takes a while to understand and see the dynamics of the what's

221
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,599
happening within us to be able to settle and relax and to uh be rooted here in

222
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:28,720
the present moment And for people who practice samadei uh that's uh meant to be a great

223
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:35,839
support for this uh uh stabilizing attention in the present moment And so

224
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:41,680
at some point when it's stable being present being aware is not work It's

225
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:48,800
just kind of almost as if it's just an how we are And so as we just are then

226
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:55,280
the uh the next attentional faculty we have ability to be aware comes into play

227
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:03,320
And this is what the Buddha calls observing auasana It has the same word as in

228
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:09,200
vassana And the prefix anu means toward something to si settle back and just be

229
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:15,119
able to observe And the observing of experience

230
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:21,640
uh has some wonderful qualities And sometimes when people teach mindfulness uh this is this is what they're

231
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:28,079
emphasizing And this is uh to um observing is a little bit the mind is

232
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:33,680
quieter than it would be if there's simple knowing of the experience

233
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:41,040
Um there doesn't have to be a knowing and observing Uh and it and um uh and

234
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,440
then uh it's not as intimate It's not connected when we're

235
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:52,960
sensing Sensations and s and the sensing the act of sensing are one and the same

236
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:59,599
They can't really be separated A moment of sensing comes with sensation

237
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:05,040
sensations we have come with the sensing of the sensations If there's no sensing

238
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:13,119
of the sensations are there sensations at all and um and uh if there's no one in

239
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:22,760
the forest and tree falls is there a sound and so um and so observing is little bit

240
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:31,119
removed but not so removed that it's detached or or distant or aloof

241
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,839
um observing So there's a kind of wonderful delight wonderful ease

242
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:45,319
wonderful maybe a kind of intimacy that or kind of belonging or presence that's

243
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:52,560
comparable to uh resting on the beach maybe maybe for hours and just being

244
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:59,839
absorbed and watching the waves wash up on the shore and wash back coming and going Um there's something about the

245
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:05,040
mind that watching very simple motion and the shifts and the changes

246
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,560
that relaxes and settles the mind and watching a river flow can do that

247
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:17,920
Watching a f a fire um uh moving you know just in the fireplace or outdoors

248
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:25,040
Uh people can watch it for a long time just watching it and watching it Sometimes just being outdoors in in the

249
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:32,000
natural world and uh maybe at ease in a bench in a park and just gazing at the

250
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,240
leaves the greenery the scenery Uh uh there's something about just watching

251
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:44,319
and seeing the kids play in the park or watching that we're not necessarily

252
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:50,400
actively recognizing every little thing We're not actually touching anything but

253
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:58,720
there's something about observing it can be very very satisfying It's like everything is uh um um nothing needs to

254
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:07,560
happen nothing needs to be done nothing needs to be fixed just to observe So these are the attentional

255
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:16,599
faculties that are considered part of mindfulness practice recognition knowing sensing feeling

256
00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:22,000
um clear comprehension a little higher order level of understanding that helps

257
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,720
us to relax and be simpler and present for our experience in a useful way Uh

258
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:35,040
relaxing um to some degree and uh observing And

259
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:41,119
when those uh are supported by samadei it's a lot easier for all those uh to

260
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:47,040
keep us here rooted in the present moment in a fully way where all our

261
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,240
attentional faculties are kind of awake and present Samadei not only brings us

262
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:58,240
in samadei well practiced not only supports us to be here but supports us

263
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:04,400
to um to uh be here with uh uh with all these attentional faculties operating

264
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:11,040
kind of naturally maybe in in coordinated in some kind of holistic way

265
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:19,119
that lends itself to a generalized feeling of being aware a field of awareness that's a

266
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:25,160
combination of all these things operating together and then

267
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:35,440
uh the mind our heart is ready for insight uh uh the what what we see in

268
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:43,040
our experience So that'll be coming up So um mindfulness practice is a practice

269
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,240
that leads to insight Mindfulness practice supported by samadei

270
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,960
uh helps that capacity for insight to come alive in a full

271
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:59,520
way So thank you uh and uh so I look

272
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,400
forward to continue tomorrow
