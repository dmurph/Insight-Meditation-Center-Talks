good morning good day everyone so welcome you all

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:15,719

we'll begin momentarily oh thank you i i i do hear on that

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,000
yeah if someone is still pointing out my sound this may still be a little i will

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,160
try to speak a little louder today just being conscious of it i do have a

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,320
somewhat of a high ceiling so it may have a little bit of echoey

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,840
effect here

8
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,840
so good morning everyone my name's ying ying chen so i'll be

9
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,600
offering meditation and dramatic today

10
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,320
um so we will begin again with this

11
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:19,040
arriving sequence that i shared about yesterday the arriving sequence that i learned

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,680
from dana dipoma to arizala

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,400
up a moffitt and so a writing sequence contains three components

14
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,400
arriving arriving here and now

15
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:47,040
and making ourselves available avail ourselves to this moment

16
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,159
and then aligning aligning with the wholesome intention

17
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,798
and so this is um what we will do

18
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,119
see if there's any other thing i can do on my end about the sound before we

19
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:12,720
begin yeah my microphone is actually right in

20
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,680
front of um my computer i tried a few different microphones yesterday

21
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:27,520
none of them seem to work as well as the computer microphone so

22
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,400
let's see if there is a little more that i can do here

23
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,200
yeah for some people the um the sound seems to be okay and

24
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,680
for others the sound seemed to have a little challenge here

25
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,159
okay so thank you thank you for for your uh

26
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,959
yeah thank you for letting me know okay

27
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:15,040
all right i think we're gonna begin just as is um

28
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:23,040
and i'll be mindful about my sound and so today i will go over this

29
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,200
arriving sequence again and to familiar ourselves with this

30
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:36,080
sequence as we begin the meditation and then today i'll incorporate

31
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,239
an additional element of our practice and that is the air or

32
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:50,640
the winged element in our meditation so uh so let's begin

33
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,720
arriving

34
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,599
arriving home home to this body

35
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,640
arriving here and now

36
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:29,440
i'm offering an image of arriving home maybe by letting go and putting down

37
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,960
the bags maybe you were carrying the plans projects

38
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,639
memory preoccupations

39
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,599
if for now we can put them away

40
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,160
we arrive here this moment

41
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:09,320
feeling the connection of your body with the ground

42
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:21,160
feeding your feet legs contacting the ground

43
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,600
maybe a few long deep breaths to let yourself

44
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,440
arrive as you breathe out

45
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:04,400
momentarily we avail ourselves

46
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,199
to this moment a sense of availability

47
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,960
may be that a mindfulness is a present here

48
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:30,880
nothing dramatic just being available

49
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:38,400
receiving the sitting posture the breath

50
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,199
sound of my voice

51
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,720
the sense of availability

52
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:04,680
isn't incompatible with the demanding certain experiences

53
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,080
but opening and receiving

54
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,440
whatever arises

55
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,960
maybe we go back to arriving process again

56
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,720
gathering ourselves and center ourselves

57
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,039
right here

58
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,479
maybe there is a physical felt sense of alignment

59
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,599
from where we sit

60
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:23,120
alignment of the pelvic area the spine

61
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,919
neck and head

62
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,200
maybe there is a sense of alignment inner alignment of the heart

63
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,320
the mind and our body

64
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,720
align with our aspirations

65
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,279
maybe hold some qualities

66
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:27,839
maybe aligned with inner integrity

67
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:39,680
and the word integrity has the felt sense of coming together

68
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,440
everything included

69
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,680
nothing gets pushed out

70
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,399
taking a few long deep breaths

71
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,839
resting into this moment

72
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:41,920
with a sense of deeper registration

73
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,399
deeper connection

74
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:12,839
and turn our attention to our physicality of the body

75
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:25,560
palp pelvic bones supported by the ground

76
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,959
making ourselves available to the felt sense

77
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:49,040
of the earth element this earthy body

78
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,800
resting on earth

79
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,560
the earth element

80
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,720
is hard heavy

81
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,600
you may feel the weight of the body

82
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,320
settling down downwards

83
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:07,839
may feel the earth element with the quality of stability

84
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,800
settled unmoving

85
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:46,399
however earth element manifests so

86
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,519
we receive as is

87
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:59,600
letting go of big ideas

88
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,680
conceptualization of what earth element is

89
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,480
the body knows

90
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:24,360
body is an organ of perception

91
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:53,079
letting go of trying to figure it out from the head

92
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:19,760
resting in the felt sense

93
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,720
of earth element

94
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:59,920
you may feel some sense of a stillness stability

95
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,360
or any hint of it

96
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,839
resting the stillness of the earth element in this body

97
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,880
i'm moving

98
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,400
like the big pillars

99
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,360
of an ancient temple

100
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:00,559
with a stillness in the forefront

101
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,760
of our experience

102
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,799
stability

103
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:19,039
will invite without sense of the air element

104
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,919
wind element

105
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:30,559
maybe you feel the movement of the breath

106
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:39,120
and letting stillness drop in the background

107
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,559
turn your attention to the movement of the breath

108
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,080
maybe movement of the belly rising and falling

109
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,039
expansion and contraction of the torso

110
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:39,840
maybe vibrations in the body

111
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:45,000
moved by the winged element

112
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,600
being available to the first sense of

113
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,640
moving wind

114
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,960
wide range of movements in the body

115
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,919
with the steadiness and the stillness of the earth element in the

116
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:26,000
background maybe the winged element

117
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,080
feels quite alive vital

118
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,840
life-giving breath

119
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:29,720
being available to the air element in this body

120
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,159
letting go of trying to figure it out

121
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:58,760
just available however this is for you

122
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:25,520
wherever you are see if you can make yourself available

123
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,640
to the sense of contentment ease

124
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:38,159
relaxation maybe that's found

125
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,960
in the body

126
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,360
maybe there is some felt sense

127
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,799
with the earth element

128
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,799
resting on earth

129
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,720
or the ease of the breath

130
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,960
kind of a contentment that is independent of

131
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,840
our experiences

132
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,120
the experience of the pleasant unpleasant

133
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:58,799
can be content with that not leaning in

134
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:05,000
to grasp or pushing away

135
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,720
the suitor that i've been sharing yesterday

136
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,240
and the buddha offered instructions to his son rahula

137
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,520
meditate the life of wind when you meditate like a wind

138
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,840
pleasant and unpleasant contacts will not occupy your mind

139
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:51,398
suppose the wind were to blow on both cling and unclean things

140
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:58,880
like feces urine spit pus and blood

141
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,799
the wind is not horrified repelled and disgusted

142
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:13,279
because of this in the same way meditate like the wind

143
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:19,600
when you meditate like a wing pleasant and unpleasant contact will not

144
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,559
occupy your mind

145
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,799
okay

146
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:47,690
[Music]

147
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,920
[Music]

148
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:20,399
so today we'll continue the reflections on sila

149
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:26,480
virtuous behavior and today i'll speak about the second

150
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:34,720
precept undertaking the training rules of not taking what is not given to us

151
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:42,399
or maybe a simpler kind of translation for that is

152
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:49,600
undertaking the training rules of abstaining from stealing

153
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:55,120
and so again i wanted to explore this from the

154
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:00,240
perspective of the inside out kind of orientation

155
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:06,799
i invited you to sense into that inner integrity

156
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,840
and inner dignity in our meditation

157
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,840
and so uh we will explore that from that place

158
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:25,120
and see how we relate to them through maybe the expressions of those

159
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,799
and again i'll use this triple a framework that we talked about

160
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:37,679
aware abstinence and align aware of the inner dynamics inner forces

161
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,799
within us and learn to discern the wholesome

162
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:49,919
skillful versus that is not and we abstain from the unwholesome

163
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,360
unskillful and we cultivate a line with wholesome

164
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,799
qualities instead

165
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:09,839
and so in the last few minutes of our meditation i invited you to check in

166
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:16,320
to this quality of contentment and ease as we were cultivating

167
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,560
mindful awareness kind of contentment that's not

168
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,839
pulled or pushed away by the forces of a wanting and

169
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,520
greed aversion delusions

170
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:41,280
and so we know you know as we meditate that the act of grasping

171
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:47,358
or being aversive to something easily take us out of that kind of a

172
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:53,760
contentment and a well-being and so in this way the second precept

173
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:00,320
that we're going to explore today abstaining from not taking uh um from

174
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:08,320
taking what is not offered to us is coming from a place of non-grasping

175
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,480
non-cleaning non-aversion free of a fear

176
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:21,839
we all know sometimes the fear will drive us to take what is not given to us

177
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:31,119
we've all probably seen this in the pandemic when we're fear fearful of running out

178
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:38,800
of certain kinds of resources we can grasp grasp more

179
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,839
than what we might need

180
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:50,240
of course and this particular uh precept um

181
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:56,400
is about to a one degree not stealing

182
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,320
that are not engaging or participating in kind of full-blown criminal

183
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:08,800
criminal acts like robbing banks and you know stealing expensive

184
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:16,160
jewelry or personal information online now of course you know i think all of us

185
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,320
don't do that right and yet

186
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,800
as a training [Music] as a training in support of

187
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:36,640
liberation and freedom and this precepts is also inviting us to look into

188
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:43,838
the subtle the small impulses or maybe sometimes a big impulses

189
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,720
of grasping claiming perversion in our inner being

190
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,480
and so it invites us to maybe become aware of the areas that sometimes

191
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:04,960
we may overlook and this is where the cultivation of awareness come in

192
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,280
and we began to pay attention to our activities

193
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,800
during the day are movements in our mind

194
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:23,440
and you know i just use a few examples that many of you might relate to

195
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:30,720
and so for example what about taking a piece of the paper from work

196
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,400
what about taking a pen a pencil from work

197
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:43,680
what about taking an extra plate of a food out of a buffet table

198
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,078
even though they're offered to us

199
00:37:52,160 --> 00:38:00,400
so some of this maybe we act out of um wanting to be convenient

200
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:07,920
and isn't it convenient to kind of sometimes just or take a piece of paper you know what you know

201
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:14,880
not not such a big deal right and i remember for myself

202
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:21,200
many years ago i was printing out a personal

203
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,720
thing at work because i thought it was convenient right and

204
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:33,839
fast a printer and on the way back driving downhill from work

205
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:40,480
i remembered this action and then all of a sudden i felt my whole body was une

206
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:47,838
uneasy it was a felt sense of something off in my body

207
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:55,040
and there was a a powerful moment for me i realized that oh

208
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:01,480
this kind of actions have an impact on me

209
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:10,560
and there's a dukkha in this and so i vowed not to do this ever again

210
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,079
in the modern day societies that we all live in today and they're

211
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:25,119
you know we're all driven by uh the convenience and comfort

212
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:33,838
and maybe we take a moment to kind of reflect a little bit convenience and comfort are quite related to each other

213
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,880
and yet there is a cost to the obsession of

214
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,319
convenience and comfort

215
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:52,720
and the the tricky thing about living in our modern day societies

216
00:39:52,720 --> 00:40:00,720
things are interdependent in so many ways so we may not actually understand the

217
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:07,760
impact of leaning in into convenience and comfort

218
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:15,359
for generations to come maybe it's the next generation that feels the impact

219
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,880
and for example you know these days i know there is a

220
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,640
black friday for those who live here in united states

221
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:32,480
cyber monday and i don't know what today is hopefully

222
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,040
it's something good um

223
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,359
and all of this we can just push a few buttons on your computer on our

224
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:51,440
computers and things will show up at the doorstep and they're even cheaper right

225
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:57,680
why not get two or three of something anything

226
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,880
shoes clothes and games and whatever

227
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:07,838
um when it's cost of a one right why not

228
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:17,960
and so this is why it's important to become aware of our inner dynamics

229
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:26,559
to begin to become aware this kind of impulses

230
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:34,000
now someone is typing in given giving tuesday i love that i hope this is a good one

231
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,680
we'll talk about the giving in just a few moments yeah

232
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:47,200
um i wanted to point out that as we cultivate awareness for this specific

233
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:56,240
precept we can begin to tune in and recognize the difference between

234
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:02,119
needs versus wanting or wants

235
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,280
a need for me at least in here today in the way that i'm going to share

236
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:16,960
needs are related to some form of care and care for our body our mind

237
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,720
knowing what's appropriate in our body need food needs shelter and

238
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:30,319
medicine it comes out of a sense of care and wisdom and so we want to take care of

239
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:35,680
this body and others wanting

240
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:42,560
wanting is a form of agreed it comes out of a sense of

241
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:49,200
discontentment with what's here happening right now

242
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:53,200
and so something else must happen

243
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:02,319
so many forms of violations and reach of the second precept

244
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:05,760
are based on wanting

245
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,560
and a strong desire operating underneath

246
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:20,000
so this precept invites us to abstain abstain from

247
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:27,839
acting out of the impulse impulses and abstain from taking what is not

248
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:34,000
given and began to align more and more with our sense of inner

249
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,760
contentment and ease so this speaks to on the other side of

250
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:47,040
not taking what is um or the the other side of the taking what

251
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:52,640
is not um offered to us is to align [Music]

252
00:43:52,640 --> 00:44:01,520
with the hosan qualities and cultivating donna and so today is giving tuesday wonderful

253
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:07,119
i guess it's a perfect timing for this cultivating generosity

254
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,160
giving cultivating contentment to ease

255
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:19,920
simplicity of our being in the meditation some of you might have

256
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:27,680
felt some sense of this when we're content not driven by some of the underlying

257
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:33,280
impulses of jumping out of where we sit

258
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,839
our heart is open and soft

259
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,240
so there's a sense of meditating like when doesn't have to be just a sitting here

260
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:51,480
meditating but as we go about our lives

261
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,480
can we be meditative like the wind

262
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,200
anything comes through the wind is not horrified repelled

263
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:12,160
disgusted it's a wide open free air

264
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:20,000
here sense of a freedom here and so the pleasant unpleasant contacts

265
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,838
and sensations will not kind of get us caught

266
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,760
and so again i've been talking about um

267
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:37,680
cultivating the sense of vasila as a

268
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:46,000
form of a blessing so today i'll end with a few words from this mangala suta again

269
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,599
and let's talk about what the highest blessings are

270
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:57,599
and so here it says giving and the righteous conduct

271
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:05,119
contentment and gratitude this is the highest blessing

272
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:11,200
so may you all faith in inner integrity and ignore

273
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:16,319
addicted dignity may the expression

274
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:21,839
of your virtuous conduct benefit all beings

275
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:29,200
so thank you for being here everyone i'm just delighted to share this space

276
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,960
and this time with you all and we'll continue tomorrow

277
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:40,000
so i have a wonderful rest of the giving tuesday for those who are

278
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:47,560
