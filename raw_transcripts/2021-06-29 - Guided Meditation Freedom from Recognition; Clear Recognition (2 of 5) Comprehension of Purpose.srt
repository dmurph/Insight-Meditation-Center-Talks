1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:16,400
so good day everyone

2
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:23,199
it's good to be here and maybe for some of you as it is for

3
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:31,039
me it's also good to be in your meditation posture one of the

4
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:38,559
pleasures of regular meditation is that the body gets

5
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:45,840
familiar deeply deeply familiar with um the posture and the

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:53,199
entryway the posture the body can be for reconnecting to a

7
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:01,359
you know a deep sense of intimacy with the present moment with

8
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,960
oneself and really be here and perhaps some of that is that we can

9
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,439
we know in this posture how to recognize what it's like

10
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:21,439
or to recognize the place within where we are aware where we're

11
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:29,680
present there's a sense of being present to something that's wholesome and good

12
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,360
so to

13
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:44,560
continue briefly with this idea of recognition clear recognition that mindfulness practice

14
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,759
has many components many aspects but two primary ones one is awareness

15
00:01:51,759 --> 00:02:00,399
and non-discursive present moment attention awareness awareness which

16
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,079
maybe has no words to it awareness which has more to do with our capacity to

17
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:14,640
receive perceptions and sensations and kind of a openness of mind to

18
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,840
be receptive and the other thing that mindfulness has to do with mindfulness

19
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,000
practice is recognition and the recognition recognition is quite

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,519
powerful clear recognition and what i want to

21
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,200
emphasize is that when we bring this recognition recognizing

22
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,599
aspect of mindfulness into play it isn't that we're analyzing

23
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,760
it isn't even that important we should recognize kind of accurately what is obvious

24
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,239
what's observable perceivable in the present moment and just leave it that way

25
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,680
it's not the past the future it's not digging into it and understanding some deep way

26
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:09,280
it's just how it's perceived how it's recognized and that and that there are times when i

27
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:16,080
meditated where you know just kind of lots going on i didn't quite know what was happening

28
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:23,440
and and so i recognized it as chaos and uh didn't try to delve deeper than

29
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,920
that just oh it's chaos and as i recognize it as chaos then something opened up and i started to see

30
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,200
a little bit more that you know more specifically but it wasn't like i was searching for specificity

31
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,120
it was just the recognition one recognition allows for the next recognition

32
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,519
what i want to emphasize this morning is so is that it isn't that you have to understand in

33
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,959
some deep way what is happening and maybe the recognition almost doesn't have to be

34
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,239
accurate it's the act of recognition which can be

35
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,439
freeing the act of recognition creates space

36
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:09,519
the act of recognition helps us not be so entangled or caught

37
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:16,079
in what's going on and so that's the one of the important functions of recognition

38
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:22,720
and so when we when we kind of say to ourselves hearing hearing is happening

39
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:29,759
so we might say it casually and we're completely concerned and caught up in what we're hearing and but

40
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:37,840
to really to do it clearly clear recognition of hearing oh that's hearing hearing is happening

41
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,320
it doesn't have to be those kinds of words but with that kind of feeling to it there's a kind of oh and there's a

42
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,680
moment of freedom a moment of space moment of of allowing moments of

43
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,600
clarity that's what the wrecking power of recognition can provide

44
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:01,600
and so we want to take our time to recognize clearly to feel where in the recognition there's some

45
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,039
freedom and then take a moment just to open to that

46
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,080
and then recognize the next thing or the same thing again if it's still there

47
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:19,360
so that's all i'll say today and now we'll sit and we'll sit

48
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,560
quietly and many of you have been doing this for a long time and

49
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:31,680
and so maybe i don't have to do the introductory words of settling in and you can do it for

50
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:39,840
yourself as you see this as it works best for you

51
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:53,840
and remember to recognize what's happening

52
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,919
you

53
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
so

54
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:35,840
what can you recognize now that sets you free

55
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
do

56
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,440
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

57
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:49,840
there is something quite special about clear recognition

58
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,159
when it comes to recognizing other people

59
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:06,080
to clearly recognize others without the filter of our agendas

60
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:13,039
desires and aversions our judgments and bias

61
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:21,278
but to recognize as if we're looking into people's eyes and seeing their hearts

62
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:30,640
to really see the full humanity of the other person to really recognize this person

63
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,919
for themselves

64
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:44,480
and the training and clear recognition is a training and clear attention

65
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:51,360
that allows us to accompany people to befriend people

66
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:02,720
to be a witness to their depth and their their full humanity

67
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:11,679
and may it be that this practice of ours of mindfulness attention recognition

68
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:18,720
being present listening to others supports us

69
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:30,080
or say differently supports others so they can discover their full humanity

70
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:36,559
so others may be feel feel at ease and comfortable and

71
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:46,320
have the ability to recognize themselves their own goodness

72
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,799
may this practice of ours make lots of space

73
00:29:52,799 --> 00:30:00,240
for others to feel unseen and heard and recognized

74
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,840
and in that way may this be a way to live for the

75
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:16,080
welfare and happiness of others may all beings live together in safety

76
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,278
may all beings live together in happiness

77
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:28,000
may all beings live together in peace

78
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,520
may all beings live together freely

79
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:51,840
and may our practice of mindfulness support that for all of us

80
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:10,320
so continuing now with this second talk on some pagana

81
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:17,039
often translated as clear comprehension but for these first uh first day for

82
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:23,279
this meditation the translation i liked was a clear recognition

83
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:29,120
in this simple simplest way which we do mindfulness practice we bring together our ability to be

84
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,640
present and aware with our ability to clearly recognize

85
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,240
and sometimes we emphasize one more than the other and we go back and forth but as the

86
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,720
practice gets deeper and deeper more and more still quiet peaceful

87
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,320
sometimes the part that needs to be emphasized and really helps the

88
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:59,279
this mindfulness practice come to maturity is the recognition the clear recognition of phenomena

89
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:05,760
what's happening in the moment the clear observation that recognizes and that recognition gets quieter and

90
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:12,240
quieter itself more peaceful almost as if there's just a whisper in the mind or

91
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,320
something so this recognition is an important factor

92
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:25,200
in other situations life outside of meditation sampajana is sometimes better translated

93
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,799
as clear comprehension or clear understanding and uh

94
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:38,799
and this speaks to how a buddhist life maybe a human life involves more than

95
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:44,480
mindfulness more than moment-to-moment awareness and recognition of what's happening now

96
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:52,000
but also involves contemplation reflection wise thinking

97
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:59,840
about what's going on that does in fact involve understanding things that um that you know where things come from

98
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:06,480
and where things are going and and and the kind of the context for why we do things and

99
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,679
and what motivates us to do things and now this fullness of the human life

100
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,600
that we're able to kind of navigate or swim in the all the different aspects of our

101
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:25,440
psychological emotional physical social life and understand and navigate and that

102
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,480
is part of what makes life rich and it's important part of life

103
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:39,519
and so then clear comprehension in the world of activities is

104
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,960
is part of part of a wise practice and so in mindfulness practice there is

105
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,159
this instruction that i read last week about mindfulness in activities

106
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:58,240
that as we reach out our arm bend our arm there's clear comprehension as we

107
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,159
as we do put on our clothes or as we eat or as we go to the bathroom there's clear comprehension of these

108
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:10,240
activities this list of things that and um but in every every ordinary

109
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,638
non-ordinary human activity we engage in there can be clear comprehension of the activity

110
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:22,638
and the ancient commentaries have four different areas that we can

111
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:31,679
reflect on or contemplate so we can live a wise life and so these are a clear comprehension

112
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:40,560
of purpose clear comprehension of suitability clear comprehension of the pasture

113
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:46,720
and clear comprehension of non-delusion and uh and to kind of take some time

114
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,398
with each of these and and long enough so they come a little bit second nature

115
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:58,720
isn't so we have to kind of bring out a checklist and go through this and live this kind of truncated life of

116
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,000
analysis but rather these four areas are meant to open us up

117
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:11,119
and free us live a wiser life so the first is clear comprehension of

118
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:18,000
purpose and that's to ask ourselves what's the purpose of what we're about to do what's the

119
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,520
purpose of the thing we're doing what was the purpose of what we just did

120
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:30,960
and uh sometimes what we think was the purpose might not really have been the purpose or things shift and change or

121
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:37,599
sometimes we're not really aware of the subconscious reasons why we're doing something that some sort of reflection afterwards

122
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:44,480
is very helpful but especially before if you're wondering what to do to really understand what's the purpose

123
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:51,920
for doing this so uh going and standing in front of the refrigerator ready to open it

124
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:59,200
if you ask yourself the question what's the purpose of opening this refrigerator and really ask yourself that question uh

125
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:05,119
simply to answer it in order to open the door that's a fine answer uh in a certain

126
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:12,160
kind of way and some people make that kind of answer as a kind of um i don't know spiritual superiority that

127
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,200
you know look just uh that's all i'm doing the simplicity i'm just being present for

128
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:24,800
this but still the um the opening the refrigerator door has a purpose i'm looking for a snack i

129
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,079
want to fill my loneliness with something or distract myself or i'm really hungry and

130
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:35,359
if i don't have some food now the next conversation i have i won't be at my best

131
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:40,720
and um or my my family's hungry and i'm going to cook for them or i need to kind of go

132
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:47,680
shopping i need to see what's in there and um and what's the purpose so you keep asking what's the purpose of this

133
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:53,440
and um but more more importantly than kind those kinds of things like that is

134
00:36:53,440 --> 00:37:02,400
is the purpose wholesome or in self is it a wholesome purpose is it a beneficial purpose or is it not

135
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,240
so to ask this question what is the purpose it's fascinating to do this with speech

136
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:15,040
in fact i've often taught that if you really want a shortcut to the depths of your inner

137
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,720
life and maybe the royal road to the unconscious is to keep asking yourself

138
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:26,799
why do you say why are you going to say what you say

139
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:33,839
what draw it drives what motivates you to speak and and to really kind of

140
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:40,400
because many people speak somewhat impulsively subconsciously or unconsciously or

141
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,320
without much reflection and there's a reservoir wellspring of motivations

142
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,359
behind what we say and to ask ourselves the question why am i saying this

143
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:58,640
why am i going to say this can begin revealing some of these layers and layers of what drives us what the operating

144
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,200
systems we have and so sitting down to meditate

145
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,800
what's the purpose of meditation not just not to evoke a lot of

146
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,000
reflection but to be clear about it i've sat down to meditate just out of

147
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,599
rote habit this is what i do and and sometimes i've done that and i

148
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:28,560
haven't really been that involved in my meditation it's just like i'm still kind of moving along in my train of

149
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:34,079
thoughts and a little bit distracted and concerned about things and i've sat down to meditate and said

150
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,359
what's the purpose of meditation now and just that question even though the

151
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:45,280
purpose might be this you know same answer then every day like you know i'm here to be present

152
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:50,880
i'm here to let go of my my clinging and attachment to really be

153
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,480
here in a clear way so all kinds of you know answers to that question

154
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:04,079
so even if it's the same answer every day to really say it to oneself oh this is the purpose that recognition that

155
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:11,520
acknowledgement can give us a little bit more kind of stability or emphasis to okay

156
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,560
let's do it let's not just let the the habits of the mind continue to have their own way let's

157
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,240
really show up and be present here and do the practice

158
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:31,920
so asking ourselves what is it what's the purpose we have

159
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:39,760
and it's a great question we can ask if someone asks you know a

160
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,040
in the conversation in supporting other people sometimes it's very helpful to ask them

161
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:51,200
if they're struggling with the decision what's the purpose of the decision what

162
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:57,520
is that what is the underlying value of what you're trying to do or

163
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:05,119
intention or direction you're trying to go so this this is a to ask these kinds of

164
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:10,160
questions is to live a reflective life a contemplative life

165
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:16,400
and uh one of the things i think is very helpful is spend some time uh with uh

166
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,160
that kind of contemplative thinking i like to go for walks by myself and

167
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,680
just that's where i contemplate and um you know i'm delighted by the different things that will pop up in my

168
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:33,119
mind that won't come up in my mind if i'm living my full life doing all the usual things

169
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:41,119
i need to have a fallow time or some time away from everything to let things percolate and bubble up often

170
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:47,839
for me exercising does the same thing it's actually something about exercising where i give my freedom to my mind and there's

171
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:54,400
a kind of contemplation that begins going on and reflection that kind of happens naturally

172
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:02,240
so to live a not just a mindful life but to live a

173
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:10,000
mindful life that's supported by and guided by a conte contemplative life a

174
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,520
reflective life and one of the key forms of contemplation reflection

175
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:22,640
is to ask the question what's the purpose of what you're going to do

176
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:29,119
and that might be for the particular event particular activity for right now but also occasionally it's good to kind

177
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:35,280
of open up that question and ask you know what about what's the purpose for

178
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:43,280
my life for what i'm doing for my work and uh and to really kind of explore

179
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:49,040
and it's when the purpose is whatever purpose comes up for you is that really the purpose you want to

180
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:55,520
stand behind that you really want to devote yourself to what purpose of life do you really want to devote yourself to

181
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,920
this nourishing freeing opening that really feels that it's nourishing

182
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,200
and enlivening and purposeful for you in a good way

183
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,599
and one of those things is to walk the buddhist path the path to freedom

184
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,760
so um thank you and

185
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:29,599
may you reflect today in the next 24 hours on purpose clear comprehension of purpose

186
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:35,760
in a relaxed way may be supported by the simplicity of recognition keep

187
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:40,960
things simple and just kind of kind of contemplate and

188
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:48,560
and see what uh benefits and aliveness comes from a clear understanding of purpose

189
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:56,480
so thank you all very much
