1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:07,680
so good morning to all of you and welcome happy to be here with you and

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:15,480
for those of you who are attending online hello and welcome it adds a kind of richness to

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:23,480
have you along online and um

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:31,400
so we could say that today is momentous day

5
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:37,840
in that it's the last day of 2023 and tomorrow or at midnight we

6
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,120
usher in 2024 and

7
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:52,160
um I think there's a may be a tradition of people wanting to give inspiring

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:58,920
hopeful messages for the new year and it would be nice if I did that

9
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,879
today and maybe I

10
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,439
will you'll have to decide but

11
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:17,320
um as I think ahead for 2024 I think that we're going to have a

12
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:26,240
lot of challenges what's coming and um I mean the level of the

13
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,720
speed in which the climate is changing is surprising the people who

14
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,600
were warning us that it was going to change it's happening faster than we

15
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:46,240
expected it looks like we I know it's too way too early to tell whether we'll going into drought

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:54,360
again in California but the snow levels are quite low again all across the western parts of this

17
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,840
country and um you know we can list all these things and changes

18
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:11,239
some of the wars that are being fought currently today we don't see any end for tomorrow

19
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:17,040
they'll continue into 2024 and some of them might get worse

20
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,840
might expand and stretch and the ways in which the wars spill over across their

21
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:30,800
borders to other borders to other countries around the world to create more and more division uh seems to be increasing

22
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:38,159
and that'll probably continue into 2024 and

23
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:44,920
it's there certain reasonable scenarios for this country is that the

24
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,280
presidential election will be very difficult and we don't know who will end

25
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,480
up being president elected president in

26
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:04,720
November chances are that there's going to be a big part of the population is quite challenged and upset by

27
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:12,480
this so as we look forward to some of the challenges that are coming in

28
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:21,000
2024 one of the things that is important to consider is to prepare ourselves for

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:28,000
this to prepare ourselves for November so it's not a shock and surprise so we're prepared we're ready for whatever

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,400
comes we're prepared for the challenges of this country that who knows how much

31
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,720
stronger they'll become and um so to be prepared and I think this mindfulness practice we do

32
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,000
Buddhist practice is a preparation is meant to be a preparation for the

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,200
challenges we face in our life most commonly it's talked about the

34
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,720
existential challenges of sickness old age and death but the Buddha frequently enough

35
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:06,879
address the social challenges of our time of his times and how the practice was also meant to address those as

36
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,000
well so we make this big turn in a sense

37
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:20,799
tonight at midnight or 10:30 at IMC and

38
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,440
um and we're making a lot some of us are making a lot to do about

39
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:35,320
nothing because nothing actually happens on midnight today I mean nothing

40
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:42,280
real in the world I mean it's kind of an odd New Year's time some cultures have

41
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:48,639
New Years at a time where it kind of corresponds with astronomical changes like it make more sense to wouldn't it

42
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,880
make more sense to have the New Year's on Solstice you know oh that Mark something

43
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,240
real and um not only doesn't it Mark something real it actually marks kind of

44
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:07,280
a fallacy that um you know it's the end of the 12th month of the year but we call

45
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:14,639
it the 10th month in Latin December you know it's kind of a

46
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,880
confusion that uh you know and November is a ninth month and

47
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:28,840
October is the eth month and and then uh we called um then you

48
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:35,319
know September the seventh month so we're

49
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:42,240
confused in our language at least and then we come to this you know New

50
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,759
Year's it's a convention and it's an unusual convention that was somehow invented by

51
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:54,280
people probably men a long time ago it's do not not even a lunar

52
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:01,319
calendar that goes on so in a sense in some very real way

53
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:06,440
as an existentially thing new years does not

54
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,520
exist it's a convention it's a convention a concept

55
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,599
ideas that humans somehow have created and much of the world lives by

56
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:24,759
it and much of the world has other calendars as well one of the great things about living in the Bay Area is

57
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:30,160
that you could celebrate New Year much through the year because there's so many different

58
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,720
cultures here with different calendars you you know for a long time the Chinese New Years was maybe still big but was

59
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,840
big and it was a big alternative to the Gregorian calendar new year but now

60
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:49,720
there's all kinds of other ones as well and there's the Buddhist New Year that happens in

61
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,000
April so you know we could just keep

62
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:02,240
celebrating so it's a convention but actually conventions are

63
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,240
important and that's the emphasis for this talk today that conventions are are

64
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,680
something that we create in relationship to each

65
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,879
other and we either participate or don't participate but if we participate in the

66
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,120
conventions we're actually participating in a way of relating to each other to

67
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:31,599
the world and we might think it's silly emphasiz this around the calendar but

68
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:39,319
it's actually true it's one of infinite number of conventions of bridges of uh

69
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:47,800
networking that reaches out to how we're actually connected to other people for those of us who speak English

70
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,919
here English is a language which is connecting all of us as I speak we share

71
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:58,840
it it's a bridge it's a relationship Rel language is all relational there's there's a

72
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:06,280
relationship ship that's happening with all of you as I speak relationship that you happened to you as you listen to me

73
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,879
and there's a relationship that all of you share in being part of this together listening to this together through the

74
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:20,599
English language what is being conveyed through the conventions that we

75
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:25,840
share what's traveling on the for you may use this language on the

76
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:35,200
wavelength of or the the sound waves what's being carried along with

77
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:42,760
it I watched a movie last night with my family and boy was there a lot of

78
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:51,320
swearing and it wasn't just swearing it was actually talking meanly to other people it was like really heavy that I

79
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,040
mean they were emphasizing it in the movie so it was kind of like part of the movie right but wow how can people be so

80
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:02,480
mean to each other and in the way they were talking they were conveying so the

81
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,399
relationship was something really unfortunate something painful something harmful was being conveyed in the very

82
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:15,240
words they spoke and then a little bit as part of the purpose of the movie was to show a

83
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:20,839
transformation of people and you could see that at some point after the transformation a few of these people

84
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,120
happened that their language became much softer and Kinder and there were little Tears in their eyes and as they spoke

85
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,760
and cared for each other so that was very nice but uh but we have so many ways in which

86
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:40,440
we this network of relatedness is happening and one of them that we all

87
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:47,360
share here in this country is uh this change and for some of us it's not going

88
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:55,440
to it's kind of like you know doesn't really matter that much I mean think we kind of do something at my

89
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,839
house that at 9:00

90
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:06,920
with the excuse that that's like New York Times Square kind of kind of time we don't even turn it on to watch it

91
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,200
just like okay and um and then it's important for our

92
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:20,399
children and one of our neighbors who knows that wants us to do it for the children which is my wife buys

93
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,839
M&M's and she on the at the kitchen table where my kids eat breakfast it's

94
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:35,320
the new year is is written out in M&M's so it'll say you know 2024 my kids

95
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:43,160
wake up and and U and they get M&M's you know the one you know they're

96
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,839
21 and 25 [Laughter]

97
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,959
so in my neighbor who loves this tradition I think it's about 60 wants us to do it she's not coming

98
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:01,560
over for the &m she just likes the idea so it's a tradition that we have and it's a way of relating to each other

99
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:08,680
and caring for each other or loving each other connecting that we have this tradition that we do so there's something in this new year that you know

100
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:16,279
knits our family a little bit together that's nice so these

101
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:22,839
relationships so For Better or

102
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:29,639
Worse Buddhism is a religion and as a religion

103
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:35,160
it tends to offer fundamental for Buddhists fundamental

104
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:41,720
Universal orientations values understandings of this life that we're living

105
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:48,760
in and what I'd like to suggest is that uh through the Buddhist

106
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:54,360
lens this world of ours is not made from

107
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:02,120
atoms it's not made from electrons or protons it's not made of quarks and

108
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:07,279
goans and these subatomic particles that's not what this world is

109
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:13,560
made of most fundamentally that the world is made of

110
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,680
relationships between things nothing exists without being in relationship to

111
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:24,720
something else nothing exists that doesn't have

112
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:32,160
doesn't come from something doesn't interact with something so it's known and has a purpose or has some

113
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,480
existence nothing that nothing exists that doesn't have some impact Beyond

114
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:45,399
itself and whether it's it you know whether what was first was there some kind of fundamental matter first that

115
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:51,760
became explode in the Big Bang and then there were relationships of everything

116
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,240
or was it was a relationship first and then so that's kind of like a chicken egg question and the Buddha never

117
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:04,920
answered such a question because he felt that there's beginningless time there was no

118
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,519
beginning but but uh but the emphasis is not on what's

119
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:17,160
important is not the things of the world like Adams what's important is not the

120
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:23,199
events of the world how people relate how people are doing what they're doing and all kinds

121
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:29,760
of things in the world but rather it's the relationship we have with it

122
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,560
the relationship we have with ourselves the relationship we have with the different things happening with

123
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:43,519
ourselves relationship to our thoughts our feelings our motivations the relationship to the events of Our Lives

124
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,639
the difficulties and challenges our illnesses and our dying and the wars of

125
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,279
our society and our world it's in the relationship that

126
00:13:54,279 --> 00:14:00,600
they're formed that's the fundamental base basis of life from a

127
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:09,000
Buddhist point of view and so what we're doing in Buddhism is having insight and understanding and

128
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,800
Transformations about the ways in which that relationship happens this is what's

129
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,440
key so if we're focusing on money like the purpose of life is to be

130
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,639
wealthy or have money and it's just about the money then

131
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:33,279
we lose sight of the that money is a really a relationship money has a certain

132
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:41,160
relationship it allows us to do things and connect to other people and have an influence and effect on the

133
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:49,880
world it was It was kind of transformative for me financially or like in terms of money that I live on on

134
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:55,120
Donna so the money that I live with is the what's given to me at people's

135
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:02,880
freely given donations that I I don't ask for anything just just like people seem to want to support me as a Dharma

136
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,040
teacher so um that money to me has a in

137
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:15,120
my mind at least has a spin it comes with a relationship of people who value

138
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,680
something about the Dharma who value something certain value certain way of

139
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:26,160
living so I feel like I have a responsibility

140
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,319
or a desire or an inspiration to continue that spin and how I spend the

141
00:15:32,319 --> 00:15:39,720
money so I wouldn't use the money I received from Donna to go Outten buy cigarettes or

142
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:45,759
guns that that would just be seem completely kind of disrespectful or

143
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:52,600
worse for what has the relationship that money

144
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,680
represents so I would like to use it for good in the world and to think about

145
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:04,959
that how do I do that and and um and sometimes because of that when I go

146
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:12,000
someplace and say well this is It's kind of expensive and I'll tell myself

147
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,839
well it'll just support the people who somehow receive it that's good for them

148
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,680
I receed support I'm happy to support them it's okay I don't know if you know that

149
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:30,480
inspires you or not but inspires me and u so the

150
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,519
relationship what is the relationship we're contributing what's the relationship we're forming what's the

151
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,759
impact we have if it's All About Me Myself and

152
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:49,399
mine it's too easy for that to sever relationships it's too easy for that to

153
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:54,880
dismiss how related we are so that we

154
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,720
are more likely than not than causing harm rather and

155
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:08,160
benefit so how do we live our life in the world of relationships not in the world of

156
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:14,558
things how do we live in the world of relationships in a way that supports and

157
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:20,558
helps everyone invol and everyone in this world is kind of the is is is one

158
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:27,038
of the fundamental principles of the Buddhist teachings

159
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,399
um um

160
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,720
so um I would like to propose that to use a

161
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:47,000
non- Buddhist word that it is in the relationships we

162
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,919
have with ourselves with others and the world that we discover what is

163
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,400
sacred that's where the sacredness is sacred is not in something out there

164
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:07,039
but it's in this it's found in the relatedness that we have is that important and for Buddhists the word I'm

165
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:12,679
using for sacred is the word Dharma Dharma is sacred for

166
00:18:12,679 --> 00:18:19,039
Buddhists and it's um and Dharma is about relationships and the most classic way

167
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:24,720
of talking about it I talk about depended co-arising that things arise in dependence on other

168
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:32,480
things things are arise in relationship to other things exist this is a fundamental principles of the

169
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:39,400
teaching the Dharma is found in relationships that's where it's

170
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:48,000
found Dharma is not personal or impersonal it's not in oneself or in the

171
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,440
world it is embedded in everything we are in relationship

172
00:18:54,440 --> 00:19:00,080
with it's it's in that relationship so you do in a sense find it within but

173
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,960
it's not really personal we do find it externally it's not really impersonal

174
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,440
it's all about what is the relationship we

175
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:17,679
have for humans the known universe is sacred because we live in relationship

176
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,600
with it the known universe is sacred I think this idea of known the world that

177
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,919
we know however wide we can know it however far our imagination can

178
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:34,600
stretch whether it's to the edges of your home to your block to the city to

179
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:40,320
the country to the world to the cosmos however far you can imagine the

180
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,799
relationship we have to it that's what's sacred and so if the world is sacred is

181
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:50,159
because our imagination stretches out to include the

182
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,799
world it's in how we relate and are related to that we find the greatest

183
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:07,880
meaning value healing and Liberation the most important values and

184
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:13,520
things we want for our lives is found something some quality of relatedness to

185
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:21,720
something so what's and so the quality of relating and the object of greatest

186
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,159
reverence is not what's on the other side of a

187
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:36,039
relationship it is how we relate so it's not an object out

188
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:42,159
there that we rever but rather the reverence in Buddhism of what is that

189
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:49,000
relatedness how do we relate how we how are we interacting what are we bringing with us what are we seeing what are we

190
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,440
intending what are we supporting what qualities in that bridge in that

191
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:00,240
relatedness that way we use conventions and language and speech and actions in

192
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:10,039
relationship to others what are we conveying in it do we think about it do we become

193
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:15,440
unconscious where we don't care about other people we drive on the freeway

194
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,880
without any concern for others you are still relating to the

195
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,760
others on the freeway but you're not taking responsibility or taking care or

196
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,799
attention ition to what is the relationship being form

197
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,760
there it's sacred it can be sacred how you drive your

198
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,200
car if driving your car you're considering the relationships all the

199
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,679
circles of relationships that are coming into play do you drive on the freeway to make

200
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:58,400
it a better Driving Experience for the other drivers or are they all obstacles for to

201
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:05,120
you having a good driving experience and so you know and so you

202
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:12,159
use your finger to let them know or do you drive such a way that's

203
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,919
easier for other

204
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,679
people so then when we come into this relationships then the heart of the

205
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:32,320
Dharma that we teach the Buddism the part of Buddhist teachings is

206
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:37,600
non-harming an ancient teaching is that the primary characteristic of the Dharma

207
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:44,440
is non-harming if there's any harming involved with Buddhism then it's not the

208
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:52,080
Dharma the primary characteristic primary reference point for understanding the Dharma is non-harming

209
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,360
and non-harming is a relational issue with ourselves not to harm ourselves

210
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:03,760
with others not to harm others this means non-harming in all our

211
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:10,520
relationships including to the animals and to the Natural World the teaching of the Buddha was

212
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,960
actually held this up as a very very high

213
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,200
value the universal the universal emphasis on non-harming the Buddha gave

214
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,440
is a challenge for us living the lives we live for most of us and so it's a is

215
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:35,120
it a challenge that we're willing to accept to live with to relate to in a way that is healthy and hopeful or do we

216
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,679
just shut down say well it's impossible to live non non-harming life

217
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:47,279
and then not think about it again and it's possible that uh one of

218
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:53,279
the most important relationships to rectify to clarify to create move into

219
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:59,880
this non non-harming way is the relationship we have with ourselves

220
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:09,960
violence causing harm harms the one who is

221
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:16,640
violent sometimes more fully than to who violence is

222
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,559
directed so this emphasis on relationships all relationships I'd like

223
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,679
to propose evocatively provocatively and kind of as a catalyst

224
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:38,960
for you to think about this see how it might be true uh relationships are

225
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:47,559
stories every relationship is a story can be explained as a narrative and this happened this is how we relate this how

226
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:54,320
it unfolded so it's been said that the world is not made of atoms it's made of

227
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,600
relationships made of stories what stories do you live

228
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:06,320
by are your stories one that Empower are your stories one that that uh create

229
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,840
peace bring love bring friendship bring kindness bring support that bring

230
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:18,840
respect for every everything that you encounter or do you have a story that

231
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:25,360
you may be unconsciously lived by that does the opposite of that that just disrespect

232
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:32,000
disregard this things are certain things story is that certain things are not important enough to pay attention to or

233
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,000
to care for a story that some people don't count some people

234
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:44,399
are we have a world filled with people who are treating each other as subhuman

235
00:25:44,399 --> 00:25:47,399
treating each other as

236
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:57,880
monsters and this is partly the reason why people can wage war because of the stories that are told

237
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:05,440
about how terrible other people are so what are the

238
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:14,080
stories So What story do you bring to everything you

239
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:21,919
do some people say we need new stories I don't know if we need new

240
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:28,840
stories because I don't know if there's any new stories there's been a lot of stories

241
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:36,360
down through history we just need to choose the right stories there's a lot to choose

242
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:42,360
from the Buddha had a story and I like that story I think you know that's the

243
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:52,120
new story even though it's 2500 years old and um stories that

244
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:58,520
heal stories that unite stories of mutual support and care

245
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,200
stories of peace through

246
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,200
nonviolence we can't solve a problem with the problem

247
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:17,760
itself can't overcome violence with violence greed with greed we can't overcome the problems of

248
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,240
over consumption with more consumption we can't overcome the

249
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:29,519
problem of depleting a natural resources by taking out more natural

250
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:36,480
resources in the world of conflict we can't solve conflict with more

251
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,080
conflict we can't end divisions by continuing to be

252
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,200
divisive we can't end Fighting by fighting

253
00:27:48,279 --> 00:27:55,399
more we don't find self-respect by disrespecting

254
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:01,320
others we don't find happiness by denying happiness to

255
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:08,200
others we don't s we don't find safety by making others

256
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:15,080
unsafe we don't overcome selfishness through more

257
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,799
selfishness so with a Dharma the fundamental aspect of Dharma is

258
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:29,440
non-harming so nonviolence nonviolence is always myopic

259
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:35,760
with for the powerful violence can be successful

260
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:42,679
sometimes in the short term but not in the long

261
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:48,399
term and that happens in small ways in between people between friends between

262
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:54,640
families and spouses that people use power and kind of violent language

263
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:02,600
violent assertions to get their way and they do well that was successful I

264
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:09,320
was angry and yelled at them and they stopped doing what they did great but then something shuts down in

265
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:15,240
the other person that person no longer trusts that person no longer is willing to present

266
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:20,559
to themselves and the the relationship now has been severed in some way can it

267
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,919
ever be

268
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:33,320
healed it might look like like it people pretend people go

269
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:39,840
along so the old Story the Buddha had this wonderful teaching I think maybe

270
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:45,960
painful to hear but maybe not pleasant to to hear but this is the old story

271
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:54,320
that should be the new story The Killer begets a

272
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:01,919
killer one who conquers begets a a conqueror the abuser begets

273
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:07,240
abuse the reviler begets one who

274
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:14,120
reviles I don't know if this is universally true but I kind of believe it's more true than

275
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:19,919
not that when we cause harm in the world we don't create a conditions in

276
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:28,640
the world where the world is going to be safe for ourselves and so often Wars

277
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,760
create more Wars they create people with with um you know who are deeply

278
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,640
hurt and traumatized and so they one of the things they respond to is to 20

279
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,480
years later 10 years later is to fight

280
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:53,679
more um so I don't know how whether this the

281
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,720
data behind this this quote is completely accur accurate but even if

282
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,360
it's half accurate or quarter accurate I think it's a meaningful quote

283
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:09,679
it's my man named Walter wink he was writing in the you know I think in the

284
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:17,000
1990s so in the last century in 18 in

285
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,679
1989 13 Nations comprising 1.6 billion

286
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:31,200
people experienced nonviolent revolutions that succeeded Beyond anyone's wildest

287
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,559
expectations if we add all all the countries touched by Major non-violent

288
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:43,360
actions in our Century the Philippines South Africa the independence movement

289
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:52,559
India the figure reaches 3.3 billion people as staggering 65% of humanity

290
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,960
back then all this in the teeth of the

291
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:05,760
assertion endlessly repeated that nonviolence doesn't work in the real

292
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:11,360
world we don't remember there's something about We

293
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:19,240
Remember Violence we don't remember nonviolence very well soon after Sandy Hook there was

294
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:26,080
a man very similar who had a assault rifle and 500 rounds of

295
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:32,000
ammunition who was able to force himself around the security at a school of 00

296
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,399
kids he was going to try to shoot as many as he could somehow I ended up being HED up in

297
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:45,240
an office with two hostages one of the hostages who was

298
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,840
really scared started talking to him her name her name is antonet

299
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:57,000
t she started talking to him and she started off by telling him the challeng

300
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,919
ches she has in her life that her husband had committed had died and that she wanted to commit

301
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:09,600
suicide or she had wanted to commit suicide she started talking to him about

302
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,759
their shared grief their shared challenges in

303
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:25,679
life she started telling him you don't have to die

304
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:33,880
today life will still bring you about turns but we can learn from

305
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:45,840
it she said that as she started this conversation she started because she saw that this man who wanted to

306
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,880
kill was a sick person who could be cared

307
00:33:54,440 --> 00:34:04,200
for when he said that when he she kind of finally this starting conversation with him that um before she started it

308
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:11,200
um he had shot his weapon once anding into the floor of the the room there and

309
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:17,919
the police had done a barrage of of uh shots through the door that didn't hit

310
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:23,839
anyone so it was kind of a tense situation she has conversation with

311
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:32,079
him and when he kind of she decide helped him understand that maybe he was better off turning himself in she

312
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:38,320
praised him you're a good person I love you I'm proud of

313
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:45,118
you and he and at some point he put down his gun and they open the door and that

314
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:53,398
was the end of it we don't remember this event we

315
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:59,079
remember Sandy Hook shouldn't we remembering this isn't

316
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:06,880
this Monumental that how many people it saved that this act of nonviolence this

317
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:15,000
act of love and care had such a huge impact this makes a

318
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,680
difference so one of my uh Heroes is a man named Michael N nagler who was a

319
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,000
professor of Peace studies at UC Berkeley for 40 years and I got this

320
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,880
story from him he a book his most recent book on nonviolence called the third dimension and he says he studied these

321
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,320
kinds of these kinds of situations these kinds of people have done this much more

322
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:44,839
often than we realize and he says they have four things in

323
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:52,520
common you see a distraught person as a suffering person not a threat or a

324
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,119
monster you show the person they are not alone in their grief

325
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:04,359
you share your personal pain with them you offer one way or the other the

326
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:10,079
teaching this too will pass and then the way he writes it you

327
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:17,400
Buck up the person you Buck the person up you kind of Praise them or do something positive and because many

328
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:23,359
times these people have never been have been bullied or never never seen with

329
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:31,680
respect I find it remarkable that in his study these are the four principles he see that's in common with with um you

330
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:40,119
know so many of these things that don't make the news enough this is what can change the

331
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:53,000
world so therefore respect or love of one's Oppo opponents is pragmatically

332
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,400
useful I think this is the kind of a teaching from his book respect or love

333
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:09,359
for one's opponents is pragmatically useful in being a technique that distinguishes the Deeds from the

334
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:17,160
doers this increases the possibility of the doers changing their behavior and hopefully their

335
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:26,680
belief so this talk is kind of kind of centered

336
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:33,359
around this idea of nonviolence but the reason for that is

337
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:40,520
that this is in Buddhism is that this is a central principle that guides us into

338
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:46,240
what is sacred into what has the greatest value which is the guides us

339
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,560
into the story that orients all the relationships

340
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:58,599
we have to everything to events to things to people to this world

341
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:06,720
it's a fundamentally a relationship of non-harming that's the bottom

342
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,280
line above that there are a few things like

343
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:19,119
love generosity and kindness and respect and this is not necessarily

344
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:27,280
unique to Buddhism but I wanted to read a somewhat famous passage for those who know it um in India I think from the

345
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,920
Mahabharata in this 17th chapter so the the Sanskrit word for

346
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,280
non-violence not harming is Aima many of you probably know

347
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:48,440
it ahimsa is the highest virtue ahima is the highest

348
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:55,520
self-control ahima is the greatest gift Aima is the best

349
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:01,800
suffering isn't that the fascinating a Hima is the best

350
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:10,480
suffering if you're going to suffer suffer because of that a himsa is the highest

351
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,960
sacrifice in United States we have this idea that the higher sacrifice is what

352
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,119
to die because for your

353
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:28,720
country in war aimsa is the finest strength aimsa

354
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:37,480
is the greatest friend Aima is the greatest happiness ahima is the highest truth and

355
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,400
aimsa is the greatest

356
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:50,599
teaching so as we come to this

357
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:58,400
momentous transformation that will happen at midnight

358
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:07,640
or 10:30 or 9 in my house we are voluntarily you didn't

359
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:15,838
realize that maybe you're reluctantly doing it but participating in a mass

360
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:22,119
movement of a of a relate way to we relate to each other a bridge a network

361
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:27,720
a connectivity that we all have and when we celebrate New Year's

362
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:33,880
Eve maybe we're celebrating those relationships and it's arbitrary that

363
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:39,400
this is the New Year's Eve that we call it that but it's not arbitrary the way

364
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,920
that we're related to each other and you could just ignore this one

365
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,440
and to go to sleep that's fine but don't ignore all

366
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:57,359
the different ways that you see don't ignore this fact that we're related to each other don't ignore the fact that

367
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,880
that the fundamental way of taking care of yourself is in taking care of the

368
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,920
relationships you have with everything yourself with your

369
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:17,240
atoms with other people with the natural world it's in relatedness we discover in

370
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:24,960
relationship we discover the Dharma it's in the relationships that we

371
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:30,920
discover where we cling and where we're generous where

372
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:37,160
we're hostile have animosity and where we have love it's in the relationship to

373
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:43,040
things that we discover wisdom and our foolishness and our

374
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:49,000
delusion it's in the world of relatedness we discover how to be

375
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:55,720
free free of all that harms intentionally harms purposely

376
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:02,040
Harms and that clears the clears the room

377
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:09,079
clears the room in our hearts for the best qualities of of the heart to come

378
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:15,119
forth because if the heart did anything the metaphorical

379
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,559
heart it's the deepest most valuable place

380
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:27,920
from which we can relate to anything and everything

381
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,800
may it be that as we go into this new year and prepare ourselves for all the challenges that

382
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:39,440
come that we let our heart that deep place

383
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:45,480
within be the place where each of our worlds

384
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:54,160
begins that if we want to create a peaceful world a loving world don't wait for other people to do

385
00:42:54,160 --> 00:43:02,000
it don't wait for your politicians to do it it begins with you with how you

386
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:08,480
relate to the people close to you how you contribute

387
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:16,520
to harmonious Harmony and peace and the people you know and how that Community

388
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:22,480
then relates to the bigger communities and the bigger communities let it flow from

389
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:28,599
you and let that be the place where you rest let that be the place where you're

390
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:34,200
ready for whatever comes even though the if the world comes with tremendous

391
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:43,520
challenges that are overwhelming for all of us as they are right now for others in Gaza and Ukraine and Somalia and the

392
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,680
list goes on and on and on the places where people are living under horrendous

393
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:54,480
challenges there might be our turn next be

394
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:00,119
ready in such a way way that you always remember that the

395
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:07,440
world begins with your heart the your world that you relate to your

396
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,520
relatedness that's where it is and this practice can support you and

397
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:20,000
help you and help you find how to rest in a from a place that always is

398
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,800
creating a good World from you and who knows what you'll be asked

399
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:34,200
to do the woman who talked the shooter out of

400
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:41,160
shooting until that moment till that day she

401
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:48,040
was the public eye for the news and the books who wrote they wrote and all these

402
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:54,160
things that she was an ordinary person maybe like

403
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:00,319
you but something came her way and she responded to it and related to it in a

404
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:06,040
way so who knows what's coming for all of us let's be

405
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:12,440
ready let's use 2024 not to have hope for what it's

406
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:18,559
going to bring but have hope for how we can relate to whatever comes we can use

407
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:23,599
this practice this practice is

408
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,640
powerful and you give yourself to this prce practice well this practice will

409
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:34,760
show you the way to relate in a way that's beneficial for

410
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:40,040
yourself and this world may it be

411
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:46,040
so thank you
