1
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,359
Good morning friends or good day friends. Just want to do a sound check to see if

2
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:11,080
you're able to hear me. Okay, maybe I'll pay attention to the chat box.

3
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,680
Let me know if you can hear me.

4
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:44,320
All righty. Thank you. Thank you for those who are giving me thumbs up. Sounds good.

5
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:52,720
Yeah, I'm happy to be here. Just seeing uh some of the familiar names and the

6
00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:00,880
ones that I don't know. So, welcome. Welcome everyone. to the 7 a.m.

7
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,200
King IMC. So, I'm happy to be here.

8
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,560
So, I'll dive in. And this week what I brought with me is

9
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:32,080
uh a set of reflections around uh water related simileies.

10
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,800
And so I feel like I've been swimming in that. And so I'm going to um bring that

11
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:48,160
with me and channel it uh in this 7 a.m. meditations and uh dharma reflections.

12
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:54,480
And so uh this the first uh first session

13
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,000
uh in our meditation I'd like to invite everyone

14
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,440
uh to imagine you're stepping into the

15
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,480
flow of our moments by moment of life

16
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:19,280
and to really feel and sense the aliveness from within our experience.

17
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:29,440
And I'm going to start uh with a poem. And this is a poem by David White. So

18
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,200
see if you can find the poetry here.

19
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:44,000
Maybe let yourself settle into a meditative a posture as you receive this

20
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,080
words. um poetry and

21
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,239
uh image images often express things that may be hard to

22
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:05,720
express in words. So this is a poem called enough.

23
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:18,880
This few words are enough. If not this words, this breath,

24
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:24,240
if not this breath, this sitting here,

25
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:34,639
this opening to life we have refused again and again until now.

26
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,120
until now.

27
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:48,720
With that stepping into the flow

28
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:56,120
of life in this moment right now,

29
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,560
right here,

30
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,919
gently softly.

31
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,600
Open yourself to this life. Sitting,

32
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:29,720
lying down, whatever the posture you're in,

33
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:40,039
stepping inside. Feeling

34
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,120
and sensing the sensations,

35
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,680
the flow of the breath

36
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,440
just as it is.

37
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,720
becoming available to the lived

38
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,919
moments here and now.

39
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,080
It can feel tender.

40
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,160
There may be a kind of stir in the heart.

41
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,680
A life

42
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:59,319
This opening to life feels like this.

43
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,639
Your cells in the body may respond [Music]

44
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,960
to this.

45
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,160
The heart may respond to this.

46
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,398
In this last couple of minutes of the meditation together,

47
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:46,080
as you step into the flow of your own life,

48
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,360
touching aliveness from within.

49
00:29:54,159 --> 00:30:01,720
Allow this opening to expand.

50
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:11,760
Maybe there is a way that you can meet all life

51
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,039
with openness. Care

52
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,519
and respect.

53
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:39,600
And may this eating life in this tender open way

54
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,200
bring nourishment. harmony

55
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,760
and a peace to all life,

56
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,960
all forms of life.

57
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,278
May all beings know life deeply

58
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:16,120
and may all beings be free.

59
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:31,248
[Music]

60
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,279
So good morning and good day everyone.

61
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:58,559
And so this week I'd like to share some reflections

62
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,480
um based on a uh

63
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:11,480
polycanon suta. Um

64
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,720
oh I'm just noticing people can't hear me. And let me let me uh check to see uh

65
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:27,159
if uh you're able to hear me now as I'm speaking.

66
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,640
I'm just going to give a moment to make sure the sound is okay.

67
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,679
If someone can type in in the chat box, that'll be helpful.

68
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:59,919
Okay. All right. Thank you. I can see it coming through. So, all right. Then I

69
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:08,320
will continue. So um this week and I brought a

70
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:14,480
polycanon simile uh which is related to water.

71
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,159
It's a very simple and maybe very well-known simile.

72
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,440
And for me um uh the simileies often

73
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,519
have a very powerful uh symbolic kind of a meaning and

74
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:40,000
they're quite rich. And so the similes often are very layered and have multiple

75
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,279
dimensions kind of multi-dimensional quality to it.

76
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:52,799
And and I wanted to uh read uh something from an author Robert Johnson uh who

77
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:59,760
wrote this uh in relationship to symbolic language that people use and

78
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:08,320
and he said speech is literal and rational and it cannot easily contain

79
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:16,800
the depth of the mystery. For that we need symbols and a symbolic language.

80
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:22,960
I resonate with that a lot. I feel that sometimes

81
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:30,320
uh maybe often um Buddha is trying to convey something that is hard to

82
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:38,158
describe using words. And so so often he resort to using

83
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:44,800
symbolic simileies, symbolic rich simileies. And so in this way different

84
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:51,760
aspects of the simile can point to something that's deeper than the literal

85
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:58,400
meaning of the words and they can allow us to kind of stay with what is being

86
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:06,160
pointed to uh in a more engaged way. engaging with the body, with our uh

87
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:15,440
emotions, with our uh uh psyche or psychological uh aspect of being.

88
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:23,200
And so it can uh connect with a deeper part of ourselves. And so I hope uh this

89
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:30,240
uh this form of a symbolic exploration can be useful and maybe evocative in

90
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:38,640
some way. So this suta that I'm going to bring in for this week for us to explore is uh

91
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,160
called crossing the flood. Some of you may have heard this and this is the

92
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:50,640
first suta, a very short suta from Samuta Nikaya.

93
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:56,800
And uh the suta is a short uh captures a

94
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,400
short conversation between uh a glorious deity. That's it.

95
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,800
a glorious deity came to visit the Buddha in the middle of the night and

96
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:15,280
asked the Buddha a question and the Buddha responded um to the

97
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:23,760
question. So I found it quite interesting you know why deity I don't feel like I know and

98
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:30,320
but it's interesting and so this is kind of how I enjoy reading the sutas I don't

99
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:37,440
feel like I always need to know the answers um but they're curious

100
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,599
and so I like to read this uh and even more curious is uh the question and

101
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,720
answer. So this is the part I'm going to read to you

102
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,000
uh which is the question and answer between the two and there are only four

103
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:01,760
lines here. There is a lot in the four lines. So here it is.

104
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:08,960
How dear sir did you cross the flood? The deity asked.

105
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:17,920
By not halting, friend, and by not straining, I cross the flood.

106
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:25,680
But how is it, dear sir, that by not halting and by not straining, you cross

107
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:31,040
the flood? The Buddha answered, "When I came to a

108
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:38,400
standstill, friend, then I sank. But when I struggled then I got swept

109
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:47,920
away. It is in this way friend that by not halting and by not straining I cross

110
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:56,000
the flood. And so it's very short conversation

111
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,320
a lot details to unpack. So I'm going to start very slowly with

112
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:09,119
the susuta in this week. I'd like to first talk about this symbol

113
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:16,000
of a flood uh oga that's the poly term

114
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:24,240
in poly canon suta uh uh there multiple times and maybe many times the symbol of

115
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:30,000
a flood is being used and they're often representing

116
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,040
powerful forces that cause stress.

117
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:42,400
suffering and I'm aware uh the power of the flood

118
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,480
in nature and I'm aware of what's happened recently

119
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:56,400
uh in the United States, the devastating power of a flood. It can cause a lot of

120
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:04,480
pain for so many people and I feel a kind of heartbreak just to

121
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:11,680
name it right now. And in the times of the Buddha, uh,

122
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:18,560
sometimes he stayed in the places that tend to experience a flooding.

123
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:27,359
And so he knew the destructing power force of a flooding.

124
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:33,680
But in his teachings, he has a specific appointing of this

125
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,800
force of um that we observe

126
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:46,400
uh in human lives. And he um equated flood with the forces

127
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,800
of greed, hatred, delusion, the end endless greed.

128
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,480
One of the sutas he said greed I say is

129
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:05,280
the great flood. The antless wanting antless pushing away

130
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,800
not wanting aversion. Elsewhere

131
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:18,200
uh flood is uh uh interpreed

132
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:26,640
with the flood of sensual desire. Endless wanting for comfort.

133
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:33,760
Uh pushing away uncomfort and endless taking birth in

134
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:41,839
identification with the things. endless taking birth in uh you know I am

135
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:48,640
this way I am not that way into this kind of solving

136
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:56,720
and then uh the flood of wrong perspectives mistaken perspectives

137
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,640
can have um challenging can cause a lot of difficulties for ourselves and for

138
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:11,040
others and then flood of ignorance not seeing and not seeing actually

139
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,480
causes flood.

140
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:24,160
And so those are some of the um meanings of being pointed to by the Buddha. And

141
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:32,560
for me, I often ask myself to just pause, kind of reflect for a moment this

142
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:39,760
word flood, what comes to your mind?

143
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:47,359
You know, for me, uh, the first sense of it is the kind of overwhelming

144
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:56,000
amount of water, uh, that, um, a kind of, um, uh, the

145
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,560
normal river channels or normal water flows can't handle.

146
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:10,560
Like our normal life flow um has its ups and downs you know has its pleasant

147
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:16,640
unpleasant has its uh grief and joy and so there

148
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,000
that's part of the being human and sometimes the teacher will call this uh

149
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:30,400
the a realm of opposites and that's normal part of life flow

150
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:39,440
that's natural being human being like that. And yet

151
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:50,240
when and there is um unpleasant our uh allergic reactivities to this

152
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:56,880
uh that we don't want this, we want to push away can often overwhelm us.

153
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:03,839
And so this overwhelming amount of water can come forth and they overwhelm us and

154
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:09,760
they cause more dooka, more suffering

155
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:17,119
and they are dangerous and they can cause stress and dooka uh

156
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:24,480
in small ways in our own minds and heart and they can have effect all around us

157
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:31,280
and maybe even in a bigger uh um space they can have a broader

158
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,800
force for humanity

159
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:43,280
and some examples of this uh kind of flooding you know the activity sometimes

160
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:51,520
I like to think of this uh not as a noun but as a verb flooding being flooded or

161
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:57,280
adject adjectives we may experience experience loss. I

162
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,319
think all of us uh will have experiences of loss

163
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:08,640
and they are unpleasant and they may be even painful. Physical capacities,

164
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:18,280
mental capacities or loss of loved ones or a job. They are unpleasant.

165
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:28,400
But our our um resistance to it or our uh uh immediate

166
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:35,040
reactivity to fix or the uh reactive

167
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:41,040
um emotional forces of a fear, anger, resentment

168
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:47,280
can lead us um into actions and speech at mental

169
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:54,000
activities. uh that began to flood ourselves and others. Maybe we start blaming

170
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,599
ourselves. Uh we think things should not be like this. Maybe we start blaming

171
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:07,280
others. You know that we we can see this kind of effect in ourselves and in

172
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,400
others. And so through the practice

173
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:20,000
we can learn uh gradually to begin to be present for this experiences

174
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:28,960
and pause in the moment of experiencing loss which is a normal flow of being

175
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,599
human. we do experience loss

176
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:43,040
and instead of collapsing or resorting to reactive forces

177
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:50,800
flooding our minds and hearts we may be able to ask ourselves

178
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:58,319
what's the bigger perspective here how might I relate to this loss

179
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:04,560
that how How do I relate to experience

180
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:11,040
without being flooded by the regular um

181
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:16,720
reactivity reactive forces? It doesn't mean that immediately we'll

182
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,880
be able to do this, but coming in contact with this,

183
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:29,880
maybe beginning to open ourselves up into some possibilities.

184
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:35,240
What can we learn from this experience?

185
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:44,000
So today um my invitation is maybe to practice

186
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,560
noticing in your experience. Um, are there uh times that you can

187
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:58,480
begin to differentiate um the normal life flow moments your

188
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:06,800
experience and the reactive forces that tend to uh

189
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:12,160
uh cause cause additional layers of aduka. And so

190
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:17,599
noticing if there are choices that becomes available to us that we can

191
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,760
actually choose not to be flooded.

192
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:31,440
And so thank you for your attention and may this exploration be fruitful

193
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:38,640
uh for you and for the people that we all encounter. And we'll continue uh in this

194
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:49,400
exploration uh in a symbolic way uh in the rest of the week. And so thank you everyone.
