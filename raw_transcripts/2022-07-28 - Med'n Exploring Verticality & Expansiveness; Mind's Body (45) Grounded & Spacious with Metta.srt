00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:55,680
exploring the mind's body and um

10
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,120
we continue the exploration today noticing how

11
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,880
the uh perception of our body can [Music]

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:14,479
be different there's a different sense of the energy body not just that the perception of the body is different but

13
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:22,400
but some shifts can happen energetically too um as we pay attention differently so

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,720
different ways of paying attention in the body not just places uh

15
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,360
to pay attention to the breath as we discussed uh on tuesday that was but also the way

16
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:43,200
the way we pay attention or what quality we choose to attend to

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,399
with our mind can have impacts about um

18
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:54,799
on how we perceive and also what arises maybe also what's called energy channels

19
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,399
in the body shifting and changing and the perceptions so

20
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,560
so without further ado let's practice together

21
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:13,840
inviting you to arrive to arrive in your body

22
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:23,319

26
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,239

27
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,120
turning turning the attention inviting the attention

28
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,640

connected to the earth

49
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:42,200
see yourself see the sense of a brightness that you're sitting with

50
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:57,560
it's not that you have to create it it's already there just bringing attention to it

51
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,519
as if there was a vertical axis

52
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,839
or rather bringing the tension to the vertical axis

53
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,480
connecting your your head

54
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:45,959
to the middle of your chest to your heart center

55
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,000
your abdomen [Music] groin area

59
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,480
and also downwards direction connection connected

60
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:24,240
to the earth while rootedness

61
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:32,399
as if you both have roots into the earth through this verticality

62
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:43,480
and connected to the heavens

63
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:54,360
or the sky proverbial heavens the sky

64
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:12,959
so that you can relax into the verticality

65
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,480
it holds you it grounds you

66
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:33,680
there's a structure so thoughts aren't fleeting here and

67
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:41,040
there and everywhere like getting whiplash there's a sense of a brightness connection

68
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,600

or awareness of sensations fill your body

72
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,079
not just that the breath is moving up and down

73
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,759
but filling your whole body

74
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,240
on its own don't let it be effortful

75
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,520
as if your feet are breathing your legs

76
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,200

receiving the breath

82
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:10,440
the whole body bellowing with the breath

83
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:21,640
in and out like a sphere a round sphere

84
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,679
expanding contracting [Music] bellowing

85
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:45,280
and what if the boundary of your body wasn't at your skin didn't end there

86
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,360
but a few inches beyond your skin

87
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,480
it's porous more space more space

88
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:07,200
imagining this breath being breathed received by the body

89
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:13,440
bellowing further out into the space sense of

90
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,440
expansiveness

91
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,880
you don't have to push it out make sure you're not pushing it out

92
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,520
effortfully just perceiving oh yeah

93
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:44,520
there's more expansiveness than i realized look at that

94
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,000
expensiveness all around

95
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,600
and then a few more inches

96
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,440
further out

97
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:49,039

98
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,559

all around the breath

102
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,799
bellowing and maybe at some point even the edges

103
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,080
completely disappear

104
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,400
the edges of this orb

105
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,840
or above the body

106
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,559

107
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,120
pervading expansively

108
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,840
into space

109
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,799
space all around

110
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,679
and along with the breath being breathed in

111
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,919
breathed out expansively

112
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:59,960

113
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,360

just shining naturally for yourself and all around

117

relaxing into an expansive sphere of the breath intertwined with metal

118
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:37,840
and as we bring this sit to close together

119
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,840

hello friends greetings once again

134
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:06,320
so [Music] so we are exploring this week

135
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,919
the mind's body together and this

136
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,440
sense of um

137
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:24,080
this this and this as i mentioned especially on the first day

138
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:32,080
the way we pay attention the way we perceive we attend to and where we

139
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:39,120
bring not just how but where we bring attention to we touch with our awareness with our

140
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:45,200
knowing places in the body not just the places but how we do it in

141
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,679
the body it can make shifts

142
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:58,000
in our perception in our body perception in our body mind perception arise

143
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,799
and it's actually quite um

144
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,878
flexible there's there's a lot of flexibility and it's important as practitioners

145
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:17,280
to know where we bring attention to how things can shift and move and the results that

146
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,520
they can have in our perception in our my physical perception and in our

147
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,429
mind's perception of the body and the perception of our mind

148
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:36,638
[Music] and connecting this a little bit perhaps to

149
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:42,638
maybe chinese and other energy medicine uh traditions

150
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,800
um [Music] either physically touching or bringing

151
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:55,040
energy bringing minds attention to a point can have impact can have impact

152
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:04,160
and a lot of times these arise in meditation and we may not actually know um

153
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:10,720
well that's interesting how did that come up so it's good to know that yes these are there are some laws in the

154
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,240
body in the mind even if we don't fully understand them

155
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,440
so though um so exploring exploring the mind's body

156
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:29,200
or the energetic sense of the body this week and and today the exploration that we

157
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:36,160
did we did uh two different explorations and and let me spell them out for you

158
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:43,359
the first invitation the first exploration i invited you and again these are very quick brief

159
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:51,040
just you know two different instructions fit into 30 minutes that's that's very brief so i i suggest that you actually

160
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:56,560
explore these on your own time

161
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:05,359
later now more expansive sits um so the first one the first invitation was to um

162
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:10,839
explore what i'm calling or what it's called a sense of verticality

163
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:16,320
so this sense of uh being connected

164
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:23,280
to the earth through your sit bones and your abdomen your heart center your head there's a

165
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:29,760
sense of sitting in verticality the sounds of uprightness as if there was a vertical pull

166
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:36,160
the energetic pole going through your hole this cylinder going through your whole body and connected

167
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:43,440
ah there's sense of spaciousness and there's a sense of well-rootedness and and feeling the breath feeling your body

168
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,280
around this upright vertical cylinder and

169
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:56,240
of course you can see what um impact that has for you and for many

170
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:02,880
for some or to say can and so so that you continue to become curious and see what impact it has for

171
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,240
you but it can have the sense of both grounding feeling grounded and also

172
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,560
feeling upright being awake and yet grounded at the same time there's just some

173
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,599
beautiful energetic feeling to it and the mind can actually be quiet

174
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,640
the thoughts thoughts can be quite um still quieted there's a sense of

175
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,680
spaciousness and grounding at the same time emphasizes verticality and sense of

176
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:36,880
uprightness which also sense of um maybe ethical uprightness it can come

177
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,359
with this sense of verticality it just it's a lovely way to sit a lovely way to go through the world and explore

178
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:49,040
both being grounded and and uplifted so that was the sense

179
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:55,119
of verticality but we uh that i invited you to explore

180
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,800
and then we switched to another way of exploring the body and that is and the

181
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:08,560
the energy body and the breath in the body and that was imagining that the breath

182
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:15,200
filling out the whole body first we start there and this sense of ordnance the sense of roundedness so the breath

183
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,800
filling out the whole body and then and then i invited you to

184
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:26,560
imagine that the border of your skin the border of your body was a few inches uh

185
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:33,359
further than your skin so the sense of expansiveness the sense of spaciousness of the breath bellowing and

186
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:39,200
then spaciousness and more spaciousness and more spaciousness and at some time

187
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:45,119
again through practice the sense of border can completely dissolve and there's just the sense of

188
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:52,640
complete spaciousness um in in the mind's body and the energy body

189
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,839
that the breath is moving through and and what this can bring for many is a sense

190
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:06,400
of peace and just expansive peacefulness that can arise and and um

191
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,480
[Music] and spaciousness a lot of spaciousness you know the space element part of the

192
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:18,079
four elements the space element can be quite present here sense of spaciousness and peace

193
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,920
and this also for some people who practice open awareness this can be

194
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:30,640
also a good support a good support for open awareness or actually open awareness can lead to

195
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:36,000
this sometimes and um and similarly as i invited you at

196
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,040
the very end to add some meta just not not to push it out but just

197
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:46,240
imagine that your this spaciousness of expansiveness of the breath

198
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:54,320
has some good will um some good will some kindness that's just like a light that's intertwined

199
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:00,800
with this expansiveness and and similarly this um just as it can be in the nice support for open awareness

200
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:07,520
practice can be a great support this way of seeing the body and perceiving

201
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:13,440
the mind's body great support for meta practice if you're doing um radiating

202
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,119
meta this can be really lovely support for that as well

203
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,640
just really getting to the practice in a very expansive way where also the self

204
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,079
can disappear so all these practices are connected so

205
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:36,880
and of course it can be very expensive and beautiful just in its own right to really settle especially if there's

206
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:44,319
a lot of anxiety or or fear present just giving it a lot of space a lot of

207
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:49,680
no boundaries it's often when we have anxiety it feels like

208
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,960
a um a wild horse or a wild ram running

209
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:02,240
around like in our chest so and if we try to contain it and really put up the barn doors like

210
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:08,160
it can can even it feels like it wants to kick against the barn doors and it's just

211
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:16,079
the sense of anxiety can become worse so in this way taking the doors down all the

212
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:21,599
all the boundaries down and just giving space giving space to the breath giving

213
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:27,200
space to the sensations to be expansive expansive expansive

214
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:34,640
ah a sense of relief and expansiveness can come from that

215
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:39,920
so these are two different ways you can explore the energy body and

216
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,920
delighted to to read for some of you this even in this short period

217
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,599
never felt so light before etc etc

218
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:57,359
yeah wonderful tingling wellness

219
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,519
yeah just very different ways of

220
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,160
yeah so so thank you all thank you for your

221
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:15,599
practice and and again i'm trusting there are many more comments here but that's uh

222
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:22,560
yeah it's it's hard to both teach and and and attend to to all the moving comments at the same time so

223
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:28,000
so thank you so much for your practice for your dedication for

224
