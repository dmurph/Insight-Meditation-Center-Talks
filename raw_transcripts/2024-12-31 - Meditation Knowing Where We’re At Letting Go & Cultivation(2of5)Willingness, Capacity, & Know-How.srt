1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:06,359
all right welcome everyone nice to see you

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,360
arriving let's go ahead and start with our sitting together this

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:21,960
morning finding a posture where you'll be able to sit for half an hour or

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,480
so and just have the sense of arriving you know we can sometimes get

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:35,719
doing other things on the computer or we had to rush a little bit

6
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:43,520
to get here and just acknowledging that now we're now we're

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:51,680
here maybe allowing the body to settle back a bit the computer can be a a leaning

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,079
forward kind of activity so just allowing yourself to settle

9
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,759
back allowing the body body to be naturally

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,479
aligned closing the eyes if that's comfortable for

11
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,520
you and just having the sense of being here being in the place where you're

12
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,520
sitting

13
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,759
and sensing first into that contact where you're sitting or lying

14
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:44,159
down so your seat against the cushion or the chair or the

15
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,799
bed and noticing if that's a simple kind of contact where you're just resting and

16
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,560
allowing yourself to be held

17
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:05,079
up softening any EX extra muscular effort so that you're mostly just held

18
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:13,160
up by the structure of the body the

19
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:24,000
bones releasing extra muscle tension and allowing yourself to be supported and

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:30,239
you may notice then that the body naturally aligns Sometimes I rock back and forth a

21
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:36,480
little bit or forward and back just to assure that I'm in that

22
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,800
middle place of most

23
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,400
balance it makes a difference in the

24
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,560
sit and then

25
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,879
softening the face the muscles of the

26
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:12,879
scalp down through the shoulders and

27
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:20,720
torso arms and legs just inviting ease

28
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:42,799
sensing the full three-dimensionality of the body can you feel the front the back and

29
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,920
the sides of your

30
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,799
body with most of the sense organs on the front sometimes that's all we

31
00:03:55,159 --> 00:04:00,239
feel but the body is quite three-dimensional

32
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,200
and we have senses toward the

33
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,720
back the idea of this initial part is to put the body in a position that is both

34
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,240
relaxed and and alert and that supports the

35
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,680
mind also to

36
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,960
maintain being relaxed and

37
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:58,240
alert I'm just inviting some ease in our connection to the

38
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:06,080
present there may may be places in the body that are painful there may be something present

39
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,159
in the mind that's not so much at ease

40
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:17,720
today and those things are fine as they

41
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:27,840
are and we can still have a stance of ease in relation to any unease or disease that's

42
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,560
present seeing if you can tune into to that

43
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,280
so I'll offer uh a few questions to drop

44
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:18,400
in to the sit and just see what the response is as

45
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:26,639
if we've dropped a stone down a well and we're listening for the

46
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:34,240
Splash and this is only if if you'd like you can also continue with your meditation if you would

47
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,360
like but it's kind of an invitation to tap in a little bit more

48
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:45,360
deeply with where we're at right

49
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:57,479
now so the first question is am I willing to meditate right

50
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:04,800
now and let there be any answer am I willing right now possibly

51
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,759
there will be more than one answer from different parts of the

52
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:24,719
Mind perhaps you've never asked that question at the beginning of a sit

53
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:38,479
and we don't need to do anything with the response except to

54
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:45,240
feel it what's the level of willingness right

55
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:05,599
now and then the next question there will be three the second one

56
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:12,960
is what is my current capacity to meet experience with

57
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,039
wisdom how much capacity do I have right now

58
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,800
this isn't a question about how much experience you

59
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,120
have necessarily even a very experienced

60
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:47,000
meditator could be having a tough day could be strained in various ways

61
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,440
such that there isn't much capacity or someone quite new to the

62
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,440
practice could be fully aligned have quite a lot of capacity at this

63
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,760
moment what is the capacity to meet experience with wisdom right

64
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,240
now what's

65
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:21,120
available and again we just feel what comes back from that question

66
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:45,360
and then the last question is do I know what to

67
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:54,320
do do I have instructions I'm intending to follow in order to meet experience

68
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,519
if I were silent for the rest of the sit would you know what to

69
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:33,320
do all right and then releasing this um question asking state of mind and

70
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,440
settling back into perhaps feeling the breath or the

71
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,880
body in the present moment and maybe

72
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:49,760
sense what kind of shift there's been from these questions for some it brings

73
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,880
in a sense of confidence or orientation at

74
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,079
least kind of knowing where we're at

75
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:10,279
and then open open again to the experience of the

76
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:16,160
body various energies Sensations the breath coming in

77
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,399
and

78
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:31,240
out open to how the mind feels their emotions or thoughts present

79
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,160
and the invitation for this sit is to have a fairly open kind of

80
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:58,880
awareness where we allow anything really to arise and pass

81
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:08,160
away and be felt but without getting sucked into it finding that

82
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
balance

83
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

84
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
for

85
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

86
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

87
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,040
e e

88
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:48,519
and when you find the Mind wandering losing connection with the

89
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:55,160
present moment flow of experience you could re-

90
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,920
evoke these questions of willingness

91
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,600
capacity and knowing what to do just reminding yourself where you're

92
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,079
at there just

93
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:23,279
briefly seeing if that helps realign or adjust somehow what the mind is

94
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,920
doing sometimes with an open type awareness

95
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,040
if it's too open the mind can wander off

96
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,720
easily and so we could bring it back touch to the breath a bit stay with one

97
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,199
thing a

98
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,279
bit starting to develop wisdom in working with the mind in relation to

99
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,279
experience

100
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:16,160
so that we're able to be with things feel them fully and yet not get drawn in

101
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,880
completely e

102
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

103
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

104
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,720
for e

105
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

106
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

107
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

108
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,520
e for

109
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:21,880
as you continue to sit one subtlety you may

110
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:29,440
notice is that these qualities we invoked change

111
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,520
throughout the course of a Sit the willingness to be

112
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:42,679
present may be strong at the beginning and then fade out as the mind gets

113
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:49,960
Restless or you may be a little reluctant to start but now that you've settled in

114
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,399
you're very willing to be

115
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:01,880
present capacity changes and sometimes we have more capacity to

116
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:09,760
be with certain experiences than others we may also know what to do in

117
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,919
some cases and have other situations in the

118
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:19,799
mind where we have no idea how to meet that

119
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:30,360
experience have you noticed changes throughout this sit in those three things we talked

120
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
about

121
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
for

122
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

123
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

124
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,240
e e

125
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:58,158
and as we approach the end of this time of meditation

126
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:07,000
I'd like to offer that one of these three is particularly

127
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,399
helpful in our daily life being

128
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:19,279
aware of in particular the second one our capacity to meet experience well

129
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:25,200
with wisdom and care that's something worth tuning

130
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,120
into as we go throughout our day

131
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,519
and we'll notice that as we're tired or stressed or busy in some

132
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:44,840
way then we have less ability to connect well with what's

133
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:52,440
going on and that's normal we don't have to control that too

134
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:59,919
much but if we know it then we have greater ability

135
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:06,360
to connect well in our relationships and we can also have the

136
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:12,120
compassion to realize that others May simply not have the capacity

137
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:18,679
at this moment to be as we want them to be or to be as good as we think they

138
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:24,000
should be something there's a lot of wisdom around

139
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,679
knowing where the mind is at in that

140
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:37,600
regard and having some gentleness around it it's not easy to live in this

141
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:45,840
world all the inputs and changes and things we have to do as

142
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:54,440
humans so just bringing in that simple bit of wisdom can greatly increase our

143
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,720
compassion and help our relationships to be more smooth with

144
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:08,518
others and with ourselves so may that guide you today

145
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:18,160
[Music]

146
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,240
okay so this week we are talking about

147
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:58,880
letting go and cultivation these qualities that people

148
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,120
these actions let's say that people think about around the Turning of the new

149
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:09,760
year and we're being Guided by the suta

150
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,440
from the dhap the verse that says I'm changing Gil's translation

151
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:23,240
slightly not doing what is unskillful engaging in what is skillful

152
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:29,200
and purifying or clarifying one's mind this is the teaching of the

153
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:35,519
Buddhas but the question is how do we do that wisely so we're talking about uh

154
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:41,880
different perspectives and aspects of this uh that are relevant in our wanting

155
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,039
to direct our intentions well in the world and for the new

156
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:53,679
year so today we're going to talk about three qualities that support being able

157
00:31:53,679 --> 00:32:00,039
to succeed at any spiritual aim um any one that results for example from the

158
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:07,000
three wise intentions that we talked about at the end of yesterday renunciation non-ill will and non

159
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:15,120
cruelty which effectively amount to letting go and non-harming so you know we can intend or

160
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:22,240
wish all we want but without these three qualities that we'll talk about today uh

161
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:30,480
it may not be able to come about so if there's something that you want to let go of or cultivate you might consider if

162
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,519
these three are in place and we've already previewed them in the meditation

163
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:45,080
but we'll go ahead and go through them in a little bit more uh detail now uh the first is uh

164
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:51,880
willingness right so um I see a link here to the foundational spiritual

165
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:57,840
faculty of Faith sat some people don't like the word faith but the five spirit

166
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,519
spiritual faculties underly our ability to develop anything and the first of

167
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:10,120
them is some kind of confidence or trust or faith or the word I'm using is

168
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:16,880
willingness the simplest form of faith is willingness are you willing and you

169
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:22,000
might think well of course I'm willing I'm you know I'm making an aspiration to

170
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,840
let go of something or cultivate something aren't I but actually probably

171
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:36,200
quite likely there are some parts of the mind that are not actually on board with that and that's the reason that many of

172
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,960
our resolutions Fade Away fairly quickly because something in US isn't actually

173
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:47,799
willing to do that so it's worth checking just how much internal

174
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:54,159
resistance there might be to whatever we are intending and it's fine if there is

175
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:59,559
some you know that's to be expected we're making a change

176
00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:04,840
going against maybe some kind of habit that we've developed um so what's

177
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:13,320
important really is to be aware if there's any internal resistance so that it can't kind of sneak in sideways and

178
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:21,200
um you know change whether or not we're able to fulfill that so as an example I remember a time

179
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:27,919
uh hearing a nun a Buddhist nun talking about uh wrestling with her desire for

180
00:34:27,919 --> 00:34:34,280
food so nominally she was on board with this wish because you know she' become a

181
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:39,358
nun that's a lot of that is about um living in living a life where you're not

182
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:47,118
acting on desires um but nonetheless she felt like um in the corner of her mind

183
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,960
even though you know in the front of her mind she was very willing not to be connect not to be attached to food and

184
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:59,720
worried about that uh there would be this continual Fascination coming in with what she would eat tomorrow you

185
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,920
know and and Buddhist nuns uh receive all of their food from others so you don't know what you're going to eat

186
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:11,920
tomorrow and there would be this interest in it and concern about it and so she started looking at her mind you

187
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,599
know what's going on with that and she described it as seeing a fire burning

188
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:24,800
before her and trying to put it out you know being very willing to put the water on it calm it down but then kind of

189
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:32,240
looking off to the side and noticing that there was a part of her mind that was throwing wood on the fire from the

190
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:39,240
side so I really liked that image that she gave and it's like that isn't it um

191
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,800
so check out you know is there something that's right in front of you and you're very willing to work with it let go of

192
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,800
it cultivate it but on the side there's something undermining it so sometimes it

193
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:58,440
helps to kind of expand our vision and just take in oh yeah there is a part of me that's really not very willing to do

194
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,920
this and to acknowledge that and to have compassion for that part so that we can

195
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:11,440
include it and you know have everybody eventually getting on

196
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,480
board that's kind of the top level of willingness but more deeply this quality

197
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:22,040
of willingness is also about willingness to meet the

198
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:27,720
unknown willingness to embrace this process of the Dharma that's unfolding

199
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:33,160
and changing Us in ways that we can't completely predict how willing are we to

200
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:39,560
undergo a transformational process this path is not so easy and certainly the

201
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:46,560
ego and other you know parts of us that are very concerned with safety and predictability are probably not fully on

202
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,000
board with with that idea so it's a process for us to work with these parts

203
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,599
and it's okay you know just just keep at it gently but the willingness is

204
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:04,200
important you to have some degree of willingness and then the second capacity

205
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:09,359
thing that we talked about is capacity right so even if we're willing to LEAP

206
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:16,760
across a Chasm if we don't have enough strength to get to the other side it's not going to work so we need the

207
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:23,680
capacity to actually do what we're intending to actually do the letting go or the cultivation that we're interested

208
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:31,319
in and this capacity is typically developed in meditation so that's one of the main functions of

209
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:37,560
meditation much of the capacity that we need is simply the ability to stay with

210
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:44,359
experience without getting sucked in or reacting to it that's it just being able

211
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:50,319
to stay with strong emotions with bodily pain with storms of thinking that's a

212
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:57,520
lot of what we develop on the cushion that kind of capacity basic mindfulness is enough to

213
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:03,880
start us off so we learn to be able to see experience know what's happening

214
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:09,119
without just getting immediately drawn into it and becoming it

215
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:16,160
essentially and then we also have various practices like um rain or at IMC

216
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:22,520
we talk about the acronym raft which stands for recognize allow feel and

217
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:28,680
tease apart these are techniques for working with strong emotions that come up

218
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:35,319
and then eventually um we want to develop the capacity to have open awareness where everything is allowed uh

219
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:41,720
everything can come and go and there's some way that we can develop our capacity to really be with anything that

220
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:47,280
really helps a lot when we can start to be willing have the willingness to be

221
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,640
open to anything and start to develop that capacity so you know the cushion is like

222
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:58,680
the spiritual gym it's the the place where we strength strengthen our ability

223
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:04,760
and of course all the time we fall off and um get lost or find that we can't be

224
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:10,119
with something that's fine um that's fine the idea is that we're kind of

225
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:16,800
working the edge without going over into the realm of overwhelm or stress or too

226
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:23,680
much so then you back off oh that was a little too much okay no problem but we want to keep kind of working that edge

227
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,960
in the way at the gym you keep trying to live a little bit more and if it's too

228
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,359
much then you go back but eventually you'll get stronger and so this is the

229
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:42,560
development of capacity and as the mind even as the mind gets calmer and more tranquil more

230
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:49,480
concentrated more able to be with a lot of things there is still the need to develop different kinds of

231
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:55,000
capacities such as the ability to be with experience that is very subtle or

232
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:01,240
that is unfamiliar that's also Al a capacity to develop you know can I stay with

233
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:06,960
experience when it gets very very fine and there's a tendency to want to know

234
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:15,880
what it is or do something with it and then we have to learn oh okay now I can also be with experience that's very

235
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:21,839
subtle one teacher uh said that we're eventually developing capacity in

236
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:28,440
non-conceptual knowing so trusting the knowing that doesn't involve the rational mind that's yet another

237
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:36,400
capacity to develop so there's all kinds of capacities we'll need to learn on and

238
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:41,440
off the cushion so practicing off the cushion also helps develop capacity you

239
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:48,160
know we can learn to sustain some level of mindfulness throughout our whole day or throughout our whole drive to work

240
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:54,240
for example can we refrain from unwise speech with a person who triggers us all

241
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,800
kinds of capacities so that's a lot of what practice is

242
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:05,280
about and then the the third though the third thing I mentioned is knowing what

243
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:11,280
to do or we could call it maybe knoow so even if we are willing and we have some

244
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:17,440
kind of potential capacity we do have to have instructions on how to do whatever it is

245
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:25,359
that we're wanting to do I suspect that many of you have the knowhow already here in the west we get

246
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:32,079
a lot of instruction and um the instructions are actually pretty simple the problem is that

247
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,599
they're hard to do right um and yet you know there are also times where we need

248
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:43,760
specific instructions for a particular thing that we're meeting and that's why it's important to have a teacher to talk

249
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:50,960
with a teacher um you know a basic principle of Dharma practice is to learn how to fully

250
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:58,000
experience something without either expressing it or repressing it there's kind of a middle way to walk and this is

251
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,640
not intuitive for most of us we like to go onto either of those extremes so we

252
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:10,079
might need to learn this way of practice and talk about it and U Get Specific Instructions from a

253
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:16,040
teacher and then you'll find that as you get more specific instructions we might

254
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:23,839
again have to deal with willingness you know if a teacher says to you you know Kim what you really need to do is X

255
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:31,559
because they've seen something in me that I haven't seen something in me might say no I'm not willing to do X I

256
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:39,720
don't want to do that wait a minute I didn't think this was going to involve letting go of that right we're back to willingness so

257
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:45,200
these three willingness capacity and knowhow are interrelated and we have to

258
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:52,000
keep checking where we are in each of those areas so you might check out in yourself

259
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,000
in regard to whatever feels important at this new year time

260
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,680
do you have all three of these in place are you actually willing to do you know

261
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,920
what it is that you're intending uh do you have the capacity and if you don't

262
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:14,400
what might need to be cultivated there and do you know how to do that uh do you

263
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:21,720
have instructions that will help you when you realize that you're going off course or not uh not being able to

264
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:28,599
achieve that so I think these three um are kind of an

265
00:43:28,599 --> 00:43:35,200
interesting reflection to do around any kinds of intentions in letting go or

266
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,960
cultivation that we would have do we have the willingness the capacity and

267
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,000
the knowhow and I wish you very well in that

268
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,680
reflection and consideration because it helps support you know being able to

269
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:59,880
move forward on the path with what we want to do so on this last day of

270
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:05,440
2024 may it be a day of joy and care and

271
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,160
consideration of your own heart and mind so that you can direct it well and we'll

272
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:16,960
continue for the next few days to talk about the unfolding of that remember that you don't have to have it all

273
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:26,200
worked out by midnight tonight so happy New Year be well
