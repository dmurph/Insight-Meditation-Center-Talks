1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,159
so hello

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,699
we're back our fifth day excuse me

3
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,500
if they considering the armies the Perfections what a what a wonderful week

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,920
of practice

5
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:39,239
yeah this um this path of the Perfections it's it's um it's remarkable and in a

6
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,399
very specific way um

7
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,100
and that is that there are an array of trajectories

8
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:56,280
you can develop any one of these 10 qualities and sort of move it move your practice or be moved by your practice in

9
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,860
a certain direction and this um this writing by them Apollo

10
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:08,580
that we're studying this week is is um pretty fascinating in its period of Buddhist history and the way that it

11
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,220
brings together actually um different currents of understanding

12
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,759
so it feels like it feels like a um a privilege and a real Joy to get to

13
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,140
spend a week in this territory

14
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:34,200
so let's um begin with gratitude and let's um move

15
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,380
into sitting

16
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:46,520
in the spirit of our theme for the day which is meta and OPEC

17
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,479
loving-kindness and equanimity

18
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,640
we'll do a simple practice that I'm going to call mindful meta

19
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:05,399
or mostly do our our familiar mindfulness practice for

20
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,160
the first long while and then at a certain point in the sitting switch to

21
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,239
loving kindness practice

22
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:23,959
so let's begin

23
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,920
beginning with a pause

24
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:12,120
is pausing our activities and involvements

25
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,260
inside and outside

26
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,159
finding ourselves here

27
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,860
seated reclining standing however it is for meditating

28
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:58,459
and finding ourselves here with this body in this body with this body

29
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:40,759
maybe a few deep breaths to strengthen the connection

30
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:46,699
between attention and embodiment

31
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,520
foreign ergy

32
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:46,080
to stay present to clearly know

33
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:51,860
this moment of experience now this

34
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:39,500
alert clearly knowing

35
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:43,399
as we breathe in

36
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,399
alert and clearly knowing

37
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:53,420
breathing out

38
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:59,120
against to know this moment

39
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,260
for now is enough

40
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:47,000
now making a gentle transition

41
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:58,410
with as little inner movement as possible [Music]

42
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,080
a transition to loving kindness practice

43
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:17,600
it can be as simple as

44
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,080
wishing well-being

45
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:34,460
for yourself or someone who is

46
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,059
dear to you

47
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:50,419
little shift in inner posture healing the wish for their well-being

48
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,860
foreign

49
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:22,760
Ty sitting comes to a close

50
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:32,000
that wish for well-being

51
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,880
conditioned by mindfulness

52
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,700
May that wish extend in all directions

53
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:56,539
may all beings be happy

54
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:02,460
may all beings be healthy

55
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:08,778
may all beings be safe

56
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:18,559
and may all beings everywhere know the ease of liberation

57
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:35,630
[Music]

58
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:06,320
foreign

59
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,640
welcome to our

60
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,760
fifth day on the parties the Perfections

61
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:44,640
as I mentioned we I'll I'll attempt to have a shorter

62
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:50,399
um talk about meta and opeca so that we have time for your

63
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:55,799
comments and questions I think as a Sangha we learn so much

64
00:30:55,799 --> 00:31:02,760
about uh about this practice by hearing about the ex or reading in this case

65
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:09,120
um about the experience of others doing similar practices so we'll get to that at the end along

66
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,260
with a couple of announcements

67
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,200
uh I have heard I have heard that the Buddha's physician

68
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:29,898
jifaka uh was asked what the Buddha was like

69
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:36,240
and jifaka this is a person who who knew the Buddha closely you know how well

70
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,179
does your doctor know you um and when asked what what is the

71
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:48,980
Buddha what is the Buddha like dear physician he described the buddhismetta

72
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:55,140
the Buddha's loving kindness and isn't that something it wasn't uh

73
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,720
jivica wasn't saying oh you know he is the wisest he gives the best advice

74
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:07,679
he's so calm or um he frowns a lot but no it was it was his meta

75
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:13,100
it was the Buddha's heartfulness that came through

76
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:21,059
and I I like to think of meta as an expression of everything that the Buddha had cultivated for years

77
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:27,860
so these last two paramis meta loving kindness and OPEC equanimity

78
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:34,140
here we're talking about loving kindness as a wish and it's a wish to provide for the

79
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:39,380
welfare and happiness of beings in the world

80
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:45,840
it can show up as benevolence peaceful action beneficial action

81
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,539
and Equanimity we're talking about the attitude of impartiality

82
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:57,740
toward what's desirable and undesirable both beings and thoughts

83
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:03,659
impartiality okay so let's start with meta and meta is a

84
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:10,460
wish it's an attitude uh doesn't it take some practice

85
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:17,220
and we have these inclinations toward the opposite and aren't those so ready

86
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:23,580
so regular practice the the causal basis the the the condition we can put in

87
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:29,760
place for the arising of meta traditionally is reflecting on the goodness of others

88
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,480
so we can do this deliberately we can um we can incline the mind to reflect on

89
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,559
the goodness oh wow this person did something so kind oh wow this person

90
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:45,720
said something that uh had such and such an effect inclining the mind to reflect

91
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,000
on goodness and then there are options for for regular practice of course at IMC here

92
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,460
we have happy hour um this wonderful Sangha with Nikki megafori

93
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:03,000
and then uh I know I know a couple of teachers who do meta at night before going to

94
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:11,220
sleep they lay down in their bed and rather than having the mind wander they direct it they direct it to may

95
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:19,138
this being be happy may this being be happy I meant to can really develop as a as a

96
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:25,740
concentration practice uh it can deeply unify the mind and how wholesome that is to unify the

97
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:29,960
mind around the wish for well-being for others

98
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:36,960
loving kindness is also it's one of these practices that I guess I guess most or all of our

99
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,419
practices are this way but they it's an internal practice that becomes external

100
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:50,099
we cultivate these inclinations and then they start showing up in our menu of actions where the the options we

101
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:56,280
have for response the things we get to select from start to have this little touch

102
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:02,359
this little touch of meta the mind inclines to benefit others

103
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,700
in this kind of way meta is known as an abiding

104
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:14,700
and abode a place where we can live a place we can live inside when we're

105
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:20,280
concentrated on the on the well-being of others in a place a place we can live

106
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:30,380
in this world of matter when we offer it said to soften and to moisten the heart

107
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:39,420
so in in very brief meta nourishes the heart it brightens and steadies the mind

108
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:46,800
and as such it supports the development of equanimity because when we're so fed we're so fed

109
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,800
by goodness that were less susceptible to the vicissitudes the ups and downs the

110
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,560
pleasures and pains the Praises and blames

111
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:04,880
if meta softens our heart to the world I'll say Equanimity stays intimate

112
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:11,339
without losing balance so a few words on equanimity

113
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:19,200
sometimes called equipoise it's this attitude of impartiality towards what's desirable and undesirable

114
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:25,460
again both people or other beings and our thoughts

115
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:32,640
I think it's the last of the Pyrenees for a good good reason sometimes it's called The Crown Jewel of

116
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:40,200
the emotions in Buddhist practice it was certainly Mastered by the Buddha who was so full of heart

117
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:46,280
um but it's infused with everything that we've practiced before

118
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:52,859
in my own thinking uh I I sometimes consider one who is

119
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:59,520
equanimous as someone who is self-possessed that um rather than being pulled and

120
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:06,839
pushed around by either circumstances on the outside or the impulses toward greed

121
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:12,599
and hatred and delusion on the inside instead of being pulled and pushed

122
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:19,020
around by those conditions were self-possessed we have this abiding

123
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:24,200
of loving kindness and Equanimity and balance

124
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:32,339
and an important note is this often comes up Equanimity does not mean heartlessness

125
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:38,040
it doesn't mean um cutting oneself off from connection with

126
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:44,099
the world right there can there can be this um understanding of equanimity

127
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:50,339
where we think we think it's like I'm I'm impartial to the world because I don't care

128
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:55,039
and I don't I don't experience it that way

129
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:01,380
um rather it's it's a sort of it's a sort of Freedom amidst

130
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:07,700
conditions that arises from Clear seeing one of the alternate words for

131
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:14,700
Equanimity in poly translates to standing in the middle of all this

132
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,680
peace in the midst of all this

133
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:25,859
and again I think I think Equanimity is last on the list um

134
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:31,859
in part in part maybe because we've already established

135
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:37,140
this number of Wholesome ways of being connected with beings and with thoughts

136
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:44,280
and with this world we've generated the connection of virtue and generosity and renunciation and

137
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,619
wisdom we're closer to other beings through our energy and patience our truthfulness and

138
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:55,440
resolve and then the intimacy of meta all of this goes into our Equanimity

139
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,200
it's not becoming a zero so

140
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:07,980
um this is also expressed in the fact that that the the condition that we cultivate

141
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:14,280
to to support the growth of equanimity it's not ignoring its wisdom

142
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,359
it's clear seeing

143
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,740
so in very brief meta and upeka

144
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:31,200
I'd like to say as we as we close maybe we have the sense that these uh

145
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:39,359
this part of me practice is a lot to remember the 10 qualities a lot of do's and don'ts I hope I took some good notes

146
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:45,140
um but really it can be quite simple

147
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:50,640
it can be three three things

148
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:59,040
this wish for the benefit the welfare and the liberation of ourselves and others

149
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:05,160
just a wish along with our Compassion or care for

150
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:10,980
others and then our commitment to skillfulness

151
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:19,460
skillful means in this situation right now what's the most skillful response

152
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:24,960
so our our aspiration our care and our skillfulness

153
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,240
just that simple all of the parmes

154
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:36,320
such beautiful qualities um

155
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:42,060
yeah I think maybe

156
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:49,440
we take up the practice of the parmies it could be it could be that all of our work is not evident to other people no

157
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,380
one no one we know out there is walking around with a checklist like oh yes their generosity and their patience and

158
00:40:55,380 --> 00:41:03,119
their energy um maybe all that other people will register is oh that person is kind

159
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,700
that person cares maybe they'll maybe they will just feel our meta

160
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:14,240
like jivakan and maybe that's enough

161
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:23,960
so the Perfections a path from right where we are

162
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:29,640
to right where we are with full freedom hmm

163
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:37,020
wondrous so for the welfare and the benefit of all beings may we endeavor

164
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:42,960
patiently persistently generously wholeheartedly

165
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,720
and with a heart full of love and a mind of clear wisdom

168
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:10,740
have a few minutes to stay after but during this little bit of YouTube lag I'll make these announcements

169
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:16,200
um first on Sunday May 21st it'll be something

170
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,420
the mindful parents class for parents and children of children of all ages

171
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:29,359

172
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:36,660
and then the second thing Sunday potluck at IMC uh first one since before the

173
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:43,380
pandemic that's pretty amazing May 28th at 11 A.M after Gill's Diamond talk

174
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:49,880
so please if you're available and interested Avail yourselves

175
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,180
so let's see oh a question

176
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:02,819
uh how to the quantum Economist with duka arising

177
00:43:02,819 --> 00:43:09,540
thank you very much that's right when Equanimity matters

178
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:17,240
doesn't it how to be equanimous with duka Rising

179
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:24,599
two doorways occur to me one is to trust awareness

180
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:33,180
our simple mindfulness practice one of the manifestations of equanimity can be just that when the duka arises we

181
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:39,540
don't grab on we don't grab on and um get pulled along

182
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:46,520
and then the other other manifestation is wisdom

183
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:52,020
and that is also through our mindfulness through our mindfulness practice to clearly

184
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:58,619
clearly know the duka itself it's a rising its conditions its effect

185
00:43:58,619 --> 00:44:05,400
on us in terms of body attitude

186
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:11,940
um and then pay careful attention to when the duka let's go

187
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:17,880
it won't last forever so keeping an eye on this process that's

188
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:24,680
one doorway that's a wisdom doorway thank you for the question

189
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:29,359
we'll see if anything else comes up

190
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:58,200
