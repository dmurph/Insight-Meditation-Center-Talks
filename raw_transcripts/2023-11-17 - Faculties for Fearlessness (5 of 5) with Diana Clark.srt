1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:06,480
good morning good morning welcome welcome good afternoon good evening and

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:13,160
for even if the future you is listening to this you know maybe you listen to it

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,520
again or maybe you don't listen to them in real time and just a warm welcome maybe

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:26,519
you're even out for a walk listening on a podcast sometimes I'm doing this imagine others do this as

5
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,160
well so today is the last day I'm talking about faculties for

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,559
fearlessness been going through the five faculties this is a you know standard list those of you who have been around

7
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:44,760
Buddhism for a while know the five faculties but I've been doing them a little bit differently in a different

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,199
order and I've been highlighting particular aspects of each faculty

9
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:56,920
rather than kind of like flushing out the fullness of each faculty I've been just highlighting a

10
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,519
particular I guess aspect a particular um way of looking and considering each

11
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:10,200
faculty and applying it to fearlessness like how can it support us for our fear

12
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:18,119
because fear is just a part of this Human Experience it's just all of us have it

13
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:25,920
whether it's obvious or subtle it's there in some way maybe not every moment

14
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,200
but uh it does have a impact on our lives and so part of finding freedom is

15
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:40,600
to meet fear to be with fear and not to be afraid of fear so with that let's start with a

16
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,880
little guided meditation

17
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,640
here maybe starting with some deep

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,880
breaths our physiology is such that with some extended

19
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:10,280
exhales help us to settle as you know with this practice we

20
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,480
are not manipulating the breath we're allowing the breath to be normal just

21
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:24,000
how it is however it can be helpful to do a few

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:32,800
breaths where we are intentionally extending the exhale just a tiny

23
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,959
bit low in the breath breath to return to normal trusting that the body knows how

24
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,000
to breathe we do not need to breathe in any particular

25
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:22,920
way maybe just opening the awareness recognizing that there are

26
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,680
sounds maybe quiet maybe not so

27
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:37,040
quiet and just receiving the sounds we don't have to go out and get

28
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,959
them for me I can hear little birds probably you can't hear

29
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,159
them through my microphone allowing myself to feel that

30
00:03:55,159 --> 00:04:01,680
little bit of uplift good morning little birds

31
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:25,040
and then bringing attention to the bodily experience feeling the contact of

32
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,320
whatever surface we're sitting on or lying on

33
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:37,960
laying on feeling the pressure against the

34
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,080
body the bcks against the cushion the

35
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,759
chair back of the

36
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,639
legs the

37
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:28,520
feet and the back maybe you're leaning against the

38
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:33,919
back bre maybe you're lying

39
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:43,520
down maybe you can feel the clothing on the back or the temperature of the air

40
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:49,520
on the back whatever it is that the back is in

41
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,160
contact

42
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
with

43
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,720
feeling connected grounded we're

44
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,638
here now with these

45
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
experiences

46
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:48,080
maybe you notice some areas of constriction tightness

47
00:06:50,919 --> 00:07:01,400
tension I often like to check around the eyes and the jaw places where I hold tension

48
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:10,319
allowing some softening

49
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
relaxing

50
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,939
[Music]

51
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,919
shoulders the front of the body the

52
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:03,919
chest maybe it can open just a tiny bit more very very small

53
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,120
movement moving the shoulders

54
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:17,000
back and the belly letting it relax and

55
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
soften

56
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:46,640
and can we let this softening opening relaxing

57
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:56,000
releasing be a support for a tone of warmth and

58
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,200
kindness towards our

59
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:09,000
ourselves towards whatever experiences are being

60
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:18,279
had and toward everything that isn't ourself

61
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:33,640
everybody just setting a intention a Direction a mood of warmth and

62
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:03,880
kindness and then resting the attention on the sensations of

63
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,320
breathing tuning into being sensitive

64
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,279
to the experience of

65
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,320
breathing not the idea of breathing the concept or the

66
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:35,040
notion but the experience what does it feel like from the

67
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
inside

68
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,560
what does an inhale feel

69
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,680
like that's and exhale feel

70
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,480
like what about the transitions between inhales and

71
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
exhales

72
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:08,199
it doesn't have to be a problem when the mind

73
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:17,680
wanders we just simply gently with warmth and Care Begin

74
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680

79
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:47,679
good morning welcome welcome everybody today is our last day talking

80
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:53,640
about faculties for fearlessness fine fabulous faculties for

81
00:29:53,640 --> 00:30:00,519
fun fearlessness forever for freedom I have many alliterations is that in a

82
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:08,880
row fine I didn't put the word fine in there probably there I could get that in there somewhere too I'm just playing around I like

83
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,279
alliterations but um maybe I'll just start with a quick review of what we've

84
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:19,600
talked about earlier in the week and as you know I've been looking at the five

85
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,679
faculties and you know not the conventional way not the usual order and

86
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:32,559
not necessarily the ual way that we think about the five faculties and I've been applying them like how can it help

87
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:41,679
us with fear how can it help us that with um this uh pervasive feeling that

88
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:48,159
we often have that oh I have to protect myself oh I'm feeling a little bit uh

89
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:55,000
threatened and this fear shows up some like really subtle as way as well as in

90
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,799
really obvious ways in which there's like some imminent danger as well as maybe just this low

91
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:08,360
grade kind of anxiety that it's not even clear what we're afraid of there's just

92
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:15,159
this sense of not feeling safe so fear shows up in so many

93
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:21,240
different ways in our lives and it has an impact on us it's

94
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:27,360
taxing and not only is it taxing it can uh kind of like diminish our life in

95
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:34,279
terms of we're always trying to avoid greater fear or things that we're not comfortable

96
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:40,399
with and not only is it texting but it also kind of like uh it robs us of some

97
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:48,399
Freedom we're getting pushed around by this trying to avoid things that are

98
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:54,600
fearful and then in these preceding days of this series on the faculties for

99
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:01,399
fearlessness I started off talking about SA and I um emphasize the element of

100
00:32:01,399 --> 00:32:07,320
noticing so part of Sati is noticing and it was a way if we're

101
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:12,960
experiencing fear or we have some anxiety it can be enormously helpful to

102
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,559
notice our environment like really mundane things like there's a computer

103
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:24,760
screen there's a corner of the desk there's a keyboard you know just really

104
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:33,000
mundane things and help us to get um collected and grounded here there's also

105
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:40,000
there's this a way that we also can notice this strong sense of no we have this way in which we're

106
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:48,240
resisting we're pushing back no I don't want this experience and to notice that how does

107
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:54,200
that feel in the body and in the mind and then that second day I went to

108
00:32:54,200 --> 00:33:02,639
collec in this this sense of getting Center Ed and gathered and collected and maybe this wholehearted or

109
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:09,080
wholeness around something so stopping the fragmentation and I emphasize

110
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:16,480
looking at the this sense of no this resistance it turns out this is so

111
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,639
powerful we often think that we have to deal with the fear directly we can do

112
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:28,760
that but it's not always available to us so part of Sade is to have this

113
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:34,360
collectedness around the resistance and we shouldn't underestimate how powerful and

114
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,639
transformative this can be and then on the third day we went to

115
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:46,519
Sada or S is confidence is is to have some confidence that this practice does

116
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:52,600
lead to Greater Freedom greater ease and well-being and also confidence in

117
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,360
ourselves that we can do this and we just need enough confidence to do the

118
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:04,039
next be present for the next breath go to the next sit listen to the next

119
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:09,079
Dharma talk whatever it might be and so confidence in ourselves and

120
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:14,118
confidence that other people have this capability as

121
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:20,919
well what the things unfold differently if we're assuming that they have this uh

122
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:30,960
this capacity to be with what's needed also and also this Sada or Sada as trust

123
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:39,679
trus in this inner process towards greater wisdom towards wholeness towards

124
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:47,560
Freedom towards healing there's something inside of us that we can trust we we don't have to

125
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:53,320
make everything happen there is also something that just naturally

126
00:34:53,320 --> 00:35:01,720
happens and I don't want to say that we have to be passive and not putting any effort because we do but it's not 100%

127
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:10,680
about us making effort part of uh s is trusting the

128
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:18,280
process even if it is uncomfortable and then yesterday I talked about Viria as

129
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:24,359
courage sometimes Viria we don't talk about this as much as the courage aspect

130
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:30,400
but this courage to meet whatever it is the courage to do the preceding steps

131
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:37,480
that I've talked about the courage to be curious about fear and the resistance to

132
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:44,320
fear some courage to stop avoiding stop distracting ourselves

133
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,359
which you know of course we do of course we don't want to feel fear or the

134
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:57,280
resistance to fear so yesterday was about Viria as courage and today i' like like to talk

135
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,400
about the fifth one the fifth uh faculty

136
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:09,079
for fearlessness and that is Pa and maybe I'll start before I give

137
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:16,640
the usual uh translation I'll talk about PA as both a distinguishing and

138
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:23,200
discernment is this ability that we all have this capacity that we all have to

139
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,680
make distinctions so I'm not talking about some sophisticated

140
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:33,839
philosophical thing you know about knowing some esoterica I'm talking about

141
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:39,240
this we can make this distinctions that starts to grow out of the clarity of

142
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,760
mind and this Clarity of Mind arises just through practice mindfulness in

143
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,839
general some if we some settledness but there's a way in which

144
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:56,359
we can distinguish fear and the resistance to

145
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:02,640
fear this can be such a great starting point as well as something that matures with

146
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:10,240
our practice to be able to recognize fear feels like this it's a lump in the

147
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:19,200
throat maybe some tightness in the chest and the resistance is maybe this

148
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,760
uh if for for me often it is kind of like maybe a little tension in the shoulders maybe some tension around the

149
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:32,079
jaw turns out the tension in the jaw in particular is really related to a sense

150
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,599
of resistance so part of this

151
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:43,200
PA is to know the difference between fear and the resistance to

152
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:50,200
fear and to know the physical Sensations away from the mental

153
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:56,319
events physical Sensations are the lump in the throat or the tightness in the

154
00:37:56,319 --> 00:38:03,480
jaw the mental events are the thoughts of like oh if only I were somebody else

155
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:09,640
then I wouldn't be having this fear or this anxiety or you know if only um I

156
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,720
had more time to practice if only I meditated for 28 hours a day then I

157
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:23,319
wouldn't be having this you know or oh only if H that thing over there that would if they would just stop doing that

158
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:30,359
then I would feel safe all the time and I wouldn't have this fear but there's a lot of stories that are

159
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:35,960
accompanying these feelings of fear anxiety this idea of like oh I

160
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:41,359
couldn't survive if this or that happened or somebody did this or they

161
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:47,280
didn't do that this you know without concerning

162
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,839
ourselves whether these things are true or not just Noti saying oh this is

163
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:58,760
thinking and this is a experience this lump in the throat I keep on pointing to

164
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:04,240
my throat because for me fear is often a lump in the throat all of us have our

165
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:11,079
own ways have our own signatures if you will of how these fear and resistance

166
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:18,400
show up in our body but PA this fifth faculty is this

167
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:24,440
distinguishing between fear and resistance physical and mental and

168
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:31,760
distinguishing or discerning between cusa and ausa these are poly

169
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,160
words we might um I translate them as

170
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:42,720
helpful unhelpful skillful

171
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:50,119
unskillful wholesome UNH wholesome more suffering less suffering so just being

172
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:57,720
able to like notice in our life like tease this apart oh yeah when I show up in this way me to more

173
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,839
suffering however when I show up in this other way which always involves some

174
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:09,720
openness and ease as best we can always leads to less

175
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:15,359
suffering this resistance really tightening it always leads to more

176
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,800
suffering and this opening and spaciousness leads to less suffering

177
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:25,880
it's easy for me to say this I know it's not easy to do this but this is just to

178
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:34,480
acknowledge that there are ways in which we show up in the world that bring some

179
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:43,280
greater I'm using this word ease or peace or freedom than others so PA as

180
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:49,520
distinguishing and discernment and then also I will say

181
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:55,640
that PA is Insight if I haven't said it already PA

182
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:02,240
is of translated as wisdom but P can we can might think of it as

183
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:10,040
Insight insight as this maybe a change of heart a opening a realization maybe

184
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:16,160
an expansion a vision a clear seeing seeing the world in a different way that

185
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:21,520
leads to less suffering so it has this insight has two

186
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,880
components it's uh seeing things differently and in a way that leads to

187
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,319
less suffering and sometimes we focus on how we see things differently but we can

188
00:41:33,319 --> 00:41:39,839
focus on how it leads to less suffering oh yeah since I had that realization now

189
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:44,920
there's a little bit less suffering now now that I see that

190
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:51,720
there's fear and fear uh resistance to fear together tangled up and I'm able to

191
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:57,480
tease them apart oh yeah and I can see how this resistance I tend to get angry angry and

192
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:03,280
blame and having that little bit of insight brings a little bit less

193
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:10,440
suffering so insights might be big bang ones or they might just be oh yeah a

194
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:16,720
little bit greater self- understanding I see now how my getting angry and and

195
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:23,160
lashing out is not the same thing as the fear but it's often it's my pattern of

196
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:31,359
reacting to fear for example and maybe I'll say that I want to also

197
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:37,160
highlight that this idea of insight right to we Insight we're the inside meditation center right we kind like

198
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:45,599
like this inside stuff but I want to highlight that we can learn from every

199
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:51,920
experience including fear sometimes we think that oh I just

200
00:42:51,920 --> 00:43:00,040
you know have to have meditative experiences and then I'll have insights then but but fear and our resistance to

201
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:05,880
fear are also great places to have Insight so we don't have to wait for the

202
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:16,040
perfect conditions Pleasant conditions in which we can have some really transformative and impactful

203
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:21,680
insights and then some of you know about these three characteristics things are

204
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:27,000
inconstant they're unsatisfactory and there isn't an inherent

205
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:33,960
core to the experiences an du

206
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,559
an I'm not going to say more about them I'll just point them that all these

207
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:45,839
there's insights that are smaller and some insights that are bigger but all of them involve a little bit of letting

208
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:51,119
go so that we can let go into greater and greater freedom and of course

209
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:57,880
freedom is fearlessness so thank you all for this

210
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:05,040
uh Journey being on this journey with me uh for this week before I sign off I want to mention

211
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:12,559
that there are um if you're interested in exploring fear some more there is

212
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:19,400
some classes that are um coming up about fear and if I can figure out how to put

213
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:28,000
them in the chat box I will

214
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:37,720
I'm not exactly sure how to do this I'm looking at this but while I'm doing this I'll describe it there's

215
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,359
um there something called fear dread and

216
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:52,000
freedom that um I'll be teaching with some of my friends in uh in

217
00:44:52,000 --> 00:45:00,880
December maybe if you just Google fear dread and freedom you'd find it I don't actually know and then um then there's also the

218
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:06,800
path of fearlessness that I'll be teaching oh here we go so now I can I

219
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:13,079
think I can chat now okay so I I think I put this in the

220
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:18,800
chat box just you know of course if just only

221
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:24,880
if you're interested and um oh I have too many words sorry about this

222
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:31,960
um I should have figured this out earlier

223
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:40,160
right so that's this one fear dread and freedom that's at the sa Center and then

224
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:47,920
um this other one is called path of fearlessness and it's

225
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:54,480
a it's uh with IMC and this is a more of

226
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:00,319
a a um um we'll be meeting once a month for I

227
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:08,760
think six or seven months these are all freely offered and this is only if you're interested in um exploring more

228
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:14,040
about fear I'll be talking about it in some different ways with some of my friends I'll be a co- teaching with some

229
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:19,240
of my friends and I'd love to see some of you there it'll be on Zoom both of

235
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:59,559
path of fearlessness is on the homepage of IMC and fear dread and freedom is on the

236
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:05,839
Sati Center sa.org sa a TI so I'm just

237
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:11,880
I'm just offering this in case it's helpful and you want to explore this whole idea of fearlessness more we won't

238
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:18,119
be covering any of the things that I covered here in these uh five days it'll be a little bit different uh each of

239
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:26,319
them will so what a pleasure it's been to spend

240
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:33,400
these days with you and to be exploring these faculties for fearlessness and

241
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:39,920
freedom find faculties for Fearless freedom

242
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:50,119
forever so I wish you all a wonderful rest of the day and may you find some

243
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:55,960
fearlessness and if fear shows up maybe you can tune into the resistance to that

244
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:04,559
fear rather than feeling like you have to dive right into the fear that's not always available for us thank

245
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,240
you
