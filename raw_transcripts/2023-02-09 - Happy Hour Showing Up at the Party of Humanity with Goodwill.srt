um that feels really sweet thanks for sharing yeah yeah beautiful

166
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:38,400
your experience is the sweetness inspired by the roomy poem translation and the uh

167
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,760
and meditation the pain thank you Abraham

168
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:50,160
be our last reflection oh sorry I don't know oh you didn't

169
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:56,520
intend to read it seven o'clock uh actually no that's fine I'm actually experimenting with with 15 minutes but

170
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:03,119
it's it's all good but please go ahead Abraham what's up I really liked your um

171
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,760
your direction to see our uniqueness in

172
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:16,020
a vast field of beings whether we knew them or didn't um as you know and a lot of people share

173
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:23,220
might not but you know as I've been losing my hearing and I used to be quite a musician and an

174
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:29,579
actor and very extroverted and involved with people and I've been uh struggling

175
00:37:29,579 --> 00:37:35,160
with um you know I should just retire to a room

176
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:42,180
and um I just I like what my friends are saying to me about the joy that I bring

177
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:47,700
and how the friendship I have and how friendly I am and it warms my heart and

178
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:54,720
frankly I would rather be a super friendly human being than a really great musician so um

179
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,359
I just really like that emphasis on seeing ourselves and taking in something

180
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:07,560
and having that offer to others so um I liked it thanks

181
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,660
ah thank you Abraham thank you so much for sharing that

182
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:20,700
I couldn't have said in any more beautifully than you just did and to paraphrase you I'd rather I think you

183
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:27,240
said something like I rather um gosh how did you say busy I'd rather have meta I'd rather be known for my

184
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:33,980
goodness and kindness and Good Will than be a great musician and just be known for that and beautiful

185
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:39,839
and I feel moved thank you so much for sharing that and also it reminds I see

186
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:47,040
people are giving thumbs up and hearts it's quite lovely um and and it reminds me of um I think a

187
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:53,099
quote by um who was it who said this uh I'll solve the quote and I'm sure one of you will

188
00:38:53,099 --> 00:39:00,540
remember who said it [Music] um African-American woman poet uh but

189
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:08,040
people won't remember what you say but how you make them feel so that's that's what's remembered and

190
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:13,740
it's the author of the even the case Bird Sings oh my God I

191
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:19,560
have these associations but I can't remember her name uh drawing a blank anybody anybody in chat

192
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:27,180
um Maya Angelou my Angela I actually went to see her um and uh yeah many many years ago when

193
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:33,540
she came to Berkeley it was it was quite powerful so yes people remember how you make them

194
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:38,880
feel and how we remember how we make others feel and vice versa beautiful so

195
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:45,000
