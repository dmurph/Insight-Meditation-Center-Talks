1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:07,360
warm greetings and welcome to this uh meditation

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:13,480
session and it's part of a series on an introduction to mindfulness

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:21,080
practice where the second week of the series we're focusing on mindfulness of the

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:29,240
body and so I want to begin today with a guided meditation on the body body mindfulness

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:35,840
it's a little bit of exercise to begin with but it's an exercise that um meant

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,320
to uh give you a insiders inside

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,440
uh experience of what mindfulness of the body can be

8
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,879
like that uh we want to be the Buddha talked about

9
00:00:52,879 --> 00:01:00,719
being aware of the body in the body to be aware to be mindful of the

10
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:08,000
body in terms of the body and what that means is that we're not adding a lot of

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,200
for any judgments or evaluations or

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,960
commentary uh [Music] or heavy handed use of Me Myself and

13
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:26,720
mine I the doer the uh with the mindfulness with just

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,320
being aware of the Simplicity of how the I how the body experiences itself

15
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:40,119
independent of the more complicated judgments and comments commentary we have about

16
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:48,119
it so uh it's meant to be phenomenally simple and some people find it's a huge

17
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:53,320
relief that we don't have to be judging you don't have to be figuring things out

18
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:58,920
we don't have to be thinking about we're allowed just to in a sense rest the

19
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:06,000
awareness in the body letting the body do the body

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
fullness let the body do the awareness fullness of what the experience

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,560
is so to begin assuming a meditation

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,200
posture that gives you some stability and you might move your body

23
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:32,280
around whatever way you have positioned your body kind of

24
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:39,440
wiggle it or rock it or to kind

25
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:47,120
of find a way to establish the

26
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:57,560
stability of being here on this spot nowhere else just

27
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,760
here

28
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,920
gently closing your

29
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:17,560
eyes and before we do the exercise to take a few long long slow

30
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:25,040
breaths in the way that's comfortable for you letting go as you

31
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:36,200
exhale releasing near the end of the exhale so the exhale continues a

32
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
bit

33
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:18,519
and then letting your breathing return to normal and feel see if you

34
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:25,360
can sense or feel whatever degree of stability you

35
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,919
have in your sitting bones in the place where the weight of

36
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,680
your body is received by some

37
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:56,199
surface maybe a sense of stability in your whole

38
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:06,639
torso and then to with your ordinary

39
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,919
breathing spend a minute or two relaxing more in the

40
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:19,960
body scanning your body as you inhale scanning for the tension and the

41
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,280
holding releasing as you

42
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
exhale

43
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
for

44
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:16,440
and now to begin the exercise bring your

45
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:26,479
attention to your nondominant hand and take a few moments to feel the

46
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,240
hand and if in feeling it you feel it you can

47
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:41,240
move your hand a little bit too so it's better positioned more

48
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,880
comfortable move your

49
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:01,400
hand and then become aware of the sensations in the hand

50
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:16,319
it might be pulsing or tingling warmth and

51
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,800
coolness there might be the pressure of the contact of your hand against some

52
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:31,319
part of your body

53
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,759
being aware of the hand in the hand meaning becoming aware of how the hand

54
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:49,280
experiences itself less up in the control tower

55
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,520
watching thinking about the hand and

56
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:01,319
more allowing the hand to reveal itself

57
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:09,879
reveal the Kaleidoscope of Sensations that appear in the

58
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,879
hand in the palm of the

59
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:31,240
hand the back of the hand

60
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,039
in the

61
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,600
fingers and your mind your thinking mind the control

62
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,560
tower might have thoughts judgments reactions to what we're

63
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:01,200
doing but those are distinct from how the hand is experiencing itself

64
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,600
for these few minutes put aside what goes on in the

65
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:14,880
mind in terms of thoughts and judgments and reactions let those be in the

66
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,640
background in the foreground become aware more intimately

67
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:27,880
more fully what the experience of hand

68
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,959
is as as if you've never gotten to know your neled

69
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:37,880
hand feel it for

70
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
itself

71
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:12,360
chances are with this kind of attention to the hand you're experiencing a lot more

72
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:19,800
Sensations in the hand than you would if we had just stayed with the breathing ignoring the

73
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:27,480
hand kind of but placing awareness in the

74
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:34,760
hand more of that hand the experience of

75
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,360
hand reveals

76
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:56,399
itself and then ending the focus on the non-dominant

77
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,040
hand taking a three breath joury

78
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:06,720
Journey returning to breathing for three

79
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,079
breaths relaxing letting

80
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:30,639
go and then bringing your calmly bringing your attention

81
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:37,600
in your dominant hand and with a calm

82
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:48,480
awareness feel let the hand feel the sensations that appear in the

83
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,079
dominant

84
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
hand

85
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,279
the hand feels the sensations and you make room in the

86
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:21,240
mind make room in Awareness for the sensations to appear

87
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,839
and show

88
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
themselves

89
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:48,480
and if you find yourself straining or Contracting in the eyes or in the

90
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:56,680
mind to do this exercise see if you can relax the

91
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:05,120
Mind relax around the eyes eyes to be

92
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,320
receptive to the hands experience of

93
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
itself

94
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,480
and now consider for a

95
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:09,000
moment where in your body you normally experience your

96
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,320
breathing and more in the belly more in the chest more in the

97
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,600
nostrils more than all three Al together wherever it might

98
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,160
be and without focusing on the

99
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:33,680
breathing become aware of that part of your body in the way that you're aware of

100
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,959
your

101
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:43,160
hand letting that part of your

102
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,720
body sense and

103
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,279
feel the sensations that

104
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,040
appear not

105
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,720
specifically aware of the

106
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:15,480
breathing but as it occurs those Sensations are also part of what appears

107
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,720
and

108
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
disappears

109
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:43,560
maybe with a rhythm of breathing allowing the sensations to be

110
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:50,480
there on the exhale and letting the that part of the

111
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:57,600
body receive the sensations on the

112
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
inhale

113
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
for

114
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:06,839
for letting the place where you experience

115
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:11,400
breathing be the home for your

116
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:20,640
awareness that you return to over and

117
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:30,320
over but if there's some any Sensations in the body elsewhere

118
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:37,399
that are more compelling more

119
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,720
predominant experiment with gently

120
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:50,200
calmly opening awareness in that location in your

121
00:17:50,640 --> 00:18:00,400
body and feeling that the sensations there as you felt the hand

122
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:08,200
and for a few moments now letting go of breathing and just feeling those predominant

123
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:19,640
Sensations letting commentary and judgment and concerns weed to the

124
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:26,280
background so there's space for the sensations

125
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:33,200
to show themselves whatever way they come and go and move and

126
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
shift

127
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

128
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:44,679
and after being aware of some other sensation for a

129
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:51,120
while then return again to the home base Begin Again with your

130
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,760
breathing or more accurately Begin Again in that location we're breathing is most

131
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:04,640
clearly known and be aware of whatever reveals

132
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:12,000
itself there whatever Sensations whether of the breathing or

133
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:31,919
not if there's something strong that arises again in the body let let there be a gentle rhythm

134
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:37,440
of Shifting awareness to that location for a

135
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:48,919
while and if it feels like you've acknowledged it enough gently calmly begin again

136
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:57,120
with the home base awareness of the Body

137
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,039
Sensations of

138
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
breathing

139
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

140
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

141
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

142
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:15,519
and in the last little period of actual meditation you could

143
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:25,039
experiment with not having a home base for your awareness but rather allow your

144
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:30,200
awareness to gently float through your

145
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:38,919
body to whatever Sensations in your body call your

146
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:46,480
awareness whatever Sensations are predominant or compelling without thinking about it or

147
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:52,919
analyzing it without concerns with being right or

148
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:58,720
wrong just let your awareness be relaxed and calm

149
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,880
not fixated on

150
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:10,240
anything and every time the awareness lands in a new

151
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,039
place take some moments to feel it like you felt the

152
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,799
hand and then open yourself up to let the

153
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:35,080
awareness move on to another part of your

154
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:43,080
body so breathing is not at the center breathing is just one of the

155
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,158
places one of the

156
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:56,760
sensations that a free flowing awareness takes in as the awareness is

157
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:00,640
centered in the

158
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
body

159
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
for

160
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
for

161
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
e

162
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
for

163
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,519
for

164
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
for

165
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:47,600
and then as we come to the end of the

166
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:58,360
sitting to feel the stability or openness calm that might be in the body

167
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:06,360
and if those things are not there maybe a tightened

168
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:17,278
awareness of your body and as you exhale to relax the body

169
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:29,320
more the healing power of awareness and relaxation

170
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:43,158
together and turning your awareness outwards to the world around

171
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:51,760

people who are trying to help

173
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:15,398

human-made there's so many pictures and videos of people

175

[Music]

182
00:31:25,399 --> 00:31:29,159
free thank you

183
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:38,919
so hello and welcome to this seventh talk on

184
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:44,120
mindfulness meditation introduction to mindfulness

185
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,600
meditation and uh this week the focus is

186
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,440
on mindfulness of the body and as I said yesterday this is one

187
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:02,679
of the central teachings of the the Buddha the foundation of his meditation practice is a deep stable connection to

188
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:11,039
the body to our and part of the reason for this is that we're trying to become free

189
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:18,559
of the hegemony of our thinking our judgments our biased our

190
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:24,559
stereotyping our preconceived ideas free of

191
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:31,279
our uh fixed agenda and opinions and stories of what is and

192
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:38,440
isn't not because these are necessarily wrong to have but because they interfere

193
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:46,320
with their ability for a deep Connection in the present moment it would be it's kind of like a

194
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,279
friend who cares for you a lot through some effort maybe the person is

195
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:57,320
challenged in some kind of way but overcame the challenge so that to make

196
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:02,399
you a really nice meal took a lot of care in the preparation of the food the

197
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:11,158
flavors the layout of the table and you sit down at the table and you

198
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:16,320
don't really notice what the person is done and you hardly taste the food

199
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,398
because uh you're caught up in judgments

200
00:34:21,399 --> 00:34:27,638
about worldly Affairs and who's right and who's wrong and and you're spinning

201
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:35,398
out opinions and and um ready to argue your case and and you're kind of like

202
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:44,000
kind of preoccupied that you don't even notice what the your friend has done for you so in the same way we don't even

203
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,040
notice what our body what our inner life what the world is doing for us in the moment

204
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,878
here and there is something really special whether we're suffering or

205
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:03,560
whether we're happy whe whether the body is in pain or whether it's comfortable there's something very profound that's

206
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:10,040
possible when we respect this body and respect it with

207
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:18,960
our attention careful attention to the body and um and the body is not just a

208
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,079
hunk of Flesh it's a there's a lot of wisdom that arises in the body a lot of

209
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:32,079
information that arises out of the body lot of guidance in how to live our life that comes from being connected to our

210
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:37,960
body for people who do meditation um focusing of the body is

211
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:43,640
one of the ways that we begin getting out of our head out of our

212
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:50,040
preoccupations and start finding a very different way of being here in this body

213
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:56,040
and the body is kind of like a door that you open and there's many dimensions of

214
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:01,280
other depths of connection to ourselves and to the world that can happen through

215
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,480
the doorway of the body so in the way that

216
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:14,400
um here at IMC mindfulness is usually kind of foundational kind of teaching of

217
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:22,680
mindfulness is to use breathing as the home base so we would rest there we

218
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:28,880
would ride the breath and the Brea brething is this Wonder for some people

219
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,720
a wonderful antidote to wondering off in thought for one thing it shows us when

220
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,480
we're wondering off and then we can be wise about that and see that clearly and

221
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,640
relax it also is a nice place to rest the mind for some people so that there's

222
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:52,760
some continuity over time and as we have continuity with the breathing whether it's three breaths whether it's five

223
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,240
breaths there's something during that period of time that helps the Mind begin

224
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:04,760
slowly to relax and relax because the energy of attention is going into

225
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:10,760
breathing which is a relaxing or a or a

226
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:16,520
opening kind of experience instead of the energy of

227
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:24,680
attention uh going into thinking into preoccupation and thereby fueling it

228
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:30,720
stirring it up and continuing it more and more more so we're kind of redirecting the food of the

229
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,119
Mind from what is not so helpful to something that's more helpful from

230
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:41,720
preoccupations and distracted thought to being present here and now with our

231
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:47,680
experience in this case with the breathing however some people like when

232
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:54,200
some meditation practices like in like when I practice Zen breathing was a primary focus and just come back to the

233
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:00,280
breath over and over again it's kind of a concentration practice practice uh in the pra way we teach here

234
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:07,040
at IMC where we're teaching mindfulness more than concentration um we do use the breathing

235
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,599
as a default uh when it works for people but then when something else becomes more

236
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,640
compelling something else becomes more pronounced some other sensation in the

237
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:25,720
body then um we happily contentedly um shift the focus of

238
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:31,200
attention from the breathing to this other thing in the body so it could be

239
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:38,040
discomfort it could be pleasure it could be any sensations of warmth cold

240
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:44,800
coolness any Sensations at all whatever it might be is equally valid as a place

241
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:52,240
to cultivate present moment attention we're just developing that present moment attention with that other

242
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,920
sensation it's possible that it's enough just to acknowledge it for a little while feel it and sense it and then we

243
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:04,800
begin again with the breathing or it's sometimes it's nice just to stay stay there something it's

244
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,000
very compelling very strong and then just uh enter into that world of that

245
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,440
part of the body like that we did in the exercise with a hand where you're not

246
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:22,560
necessarily focusing on the discomfort but you're focusing because that's a little bit of abstraction that's an idea

247
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:28,760
discomfort but underneath the idea they kind of kind of global kind of sense of

248
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,839
what's going on there's a the the details of the individual Sensations

249
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:41,560
that are at play in that area of discomfort or in that area that's very comfortable or Pleasant and IDE is to

250
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:48,960
just stay with it and feel it and let that be a place where the you're training yourself to notice the

251
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,079
distracted mind to notice the straining mind the demanding mind the expecting

252
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:59,720
mind the resisting mind and relax so you can kind of begin

253
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:05,359
finding a way of being present in a relaxed way non-reactive

254
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:12,920
way so that's kind of the basic idea is we stay with the breathing something else becomes compelling we let we let go

255
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:20,240
of the breathing and attend to that for a little while and then come back to the breathing some people as I've said last

256
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,680
week the breathing doesn't work very well for the focus of attention some

257
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,960
people what works much better is to just have the to be open more generally and

258
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:37,000
globally in the body without much particular focus on the breathing and

259
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:43,280
then allow the awareness to float or drift or move around the body to

260
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:49,119
whatever is compelling whatever appears whatever shows itself whatever is asking

261
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:56,359
for attention but as we bring the attention to the different parts of the body being careful not to fixate on it

262
00:40:56,359 --> 00:41:01,880
not to get stuck there but keep the attention soft and light so that when

263
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:09,000
something else occurs that's more compelling or calls on you the mind can just gently float to there and so it's

264
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,160
the present moment experiences of the body that are the grounding in the

265
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:22,960
present moment that are the way of uh of um an alternative than distracted

266
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:30,599
thinking so rather than the breathing being the primary home the whole body is the home for attention and that way

267
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:37,319
there's not this kind of uh zeroing in or preoccupation or concern or reactivity around breathing which some

268
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:46,160
people have that makes it difficult to be with the breathing and um so it even and so both

269
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,520
both ways of practicing are quite wonderful and and what's interesting is

270
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:58,760
whichever one we start with at some point we come to a point where we move into the other people who mostly focus

271
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:06,640
on the breathing as they get really stable and settled um there's a way in which their attention opens up and it's

272
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:13,200
what feels the best is this open awareness to whatever is happening in the body and uh letting it show itself

273
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,800
and let the awareness kind of just stay open to the different places people who start with a more open awareness to the

274
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,280
body at some point will find that things get simpler and simpler and uh more

275
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:31,880
relaxed and what's the biggest movements of the body then become their

276
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,400
primary subject of attention and those proba biggest movement is the breathing

277
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:44,559
but they come to that breathing then in a much more relaxed easygoing way where there's not any complications or less

278
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:52,240
complic there are less complications with the breathing and it can be kind of uh quite nice to just then kind of flow

279
00:42:52,240 --> 00:43:00,119
lightly with the breathing so this it shifts and changes this but for if if all all things are

280
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:06,160
equal uh I recommend the the foundational way here at IMC is to use

281
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:11,599
the breathing as the home base and be content to stay there and be with the

282
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:17,960
breath as much as you can um and um but if something else in the body becomes

283
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:23,119
predominant um shift your attention to the predominant thing and that might be

284
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:29,640
for 3 or 4 seconds just to feel it and acknowledge it that's enough and then it can recede to the background or you

285
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:35,720
might discover that you need to make it the primary focus of attention it might be for five minutes you're just

286
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:41,079
exploring and feeling and breathing with that

287
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:50,119
sensation and um so maybe that's enough for today so

288
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:57,800
breathing and body so as you go about your day today I

289
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:05,000
would very much encourage you to continue with mindfulness of your body and um and if those of you who set

290
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:11,599
a timer yesterday that went off periodically through the day or if you other ways of periodically checking in

291
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:18,400
with yourself um check in with yourself first to feel how you are in your

292
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,760
body and then take the three breath journey and after youve done the three

293
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:32,880
breath Journey feel what's happened what's shifted in your body and if you do that even just once

294
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:40,079
every hour through a day I think it could have a very profound uh impact on very helpful

295
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:47,720
impact on you and if nothing else it's very educational to discover more deeply what's going on

296
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:54,280
so stop and just notice what's happening in your body take time to feel it

297
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:59,520
breathe with it then do the three breath Journey just kind of Center yourself on

298
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:06,880
three breaths as if that's the only thing that you need to do in the world and then open to the body and see

299
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,000
what shifted and that whole process doesn't have to take more than a

300
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:17,119
minute and if it's enjoyable you could do it you can do it

301
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:24,880
more so um thank you very much

302
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:30,599
and I look forward to continuing this series

303
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,960
tomorrow
