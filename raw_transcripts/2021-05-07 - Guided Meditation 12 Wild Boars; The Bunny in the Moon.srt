1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:09,040
good morning welcome to the insight meditation center

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,839
hi i am flu schrader the guest teacher of your teacher gil frank style and my good friend

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,240
he and i and paul haller another zen center teacher have been incredibly enjoying a

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:27,359
three-week intensive called the harmony of zen and vipassana

5
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,600
and this is our last day so it's nice to have you all here um and

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,879
we'll start with some meditation and then i'll give a short talk

7
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:46,079
so i'm wondering how many of you remember a few years back a story about 12 wild wars

8
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,480
you know it was the name of a team of soccer players and their young coach who were rescued from a dark

9
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,600
water-filled cave in thailand you know a lot of attention was paid at the time under the long planning process

10
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:08,000
that resulted in their rescue including teaching them how to swim how to use scuba gear and all of that

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,240
the part that was deeply engaging for the world press was the technique and and the danger and that

12
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,320
was and you know the fear but at the same time very little attention was paid

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,680
that i could tell in the mainstream reporting to the fact that the coach of these boys

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,400
ekkapol chanthawong had spent most of his young life from the age of 12 until 22 as a thai

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,880
forest monk in a somewhat obscure article called how buddhist meditation kept the thai boys

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,079
column in a cave they reported that at the moment that the boys were found they were sitting

17
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:50,000
there calmly no one was crying or anything and it was astonishing

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,280
the article then explained that ekkapol their coach had taught the boys to meditate to keep

19
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,680
them calm and to preserve their energy through their nine days of pitch black isolation

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,239
on the day of their rescue each of the boys did an hour of meditation with their teacher before being brought out of the cave you

21
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:15,200
know one by one as i think we all remember the article included a cartoon that had

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,080
been circulated in thailand showing ekkapol with a lap full of tiny wild boars sitting peacefully in

23
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,680
upright meditation just like the buddha that he had been taught to be

24
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,200
so with that story in mind i'd like to offer all of us an opportunity to sit together for a few minutes

25
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,680
remembering those boys and their teacher and also remembering one of the rescuers who died in his effort to help save

26
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,040
those boys he too saman guna is honored and embraced

27
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,920
within this warmly human story think we all know that marketing a

28
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,599
product such as meditation is such a challenge for us you know as it was for the buddha with

29
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,720
so little to show for itself you know we put us not only just sit together a lot

30
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,200
we also talk about just sitting together a lot and we talk in order to encourage others

31
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,400
to give it a try you know as it says on this clever bumper sticker that i've seen in recent

32
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,440
years don't just do something sit there

33
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,799
so only by that something that we call nothing can we discover for ourselves how an

34
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,480
hour of silence sitting even in the darkest of times and the darkest of places

35
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,920
might literally save our lives or even if our lives are not in the end to be saved the quality of

36
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,720
the time we have left might be brighter sweeter and more dear

37
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,840
so please in the time we have left find a comfortable upright sitting posture for yourself

38
00:03:51,840 --> 00:04:00,239
you know lengthen your spine all the way up from the base drop your shoulder blades back and down

39
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:07,680
allowing the chest to open more fully align your ears with your shoulders and

40
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:16,560
your nose with your navel take a deep breath inhale

41
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:22,239
and exhale again and again

42
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,840
as you have your entire life

43
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:37,440
now rock your body right and left it should feel very good something i

44
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,520
really enjoy each morning is this small detail of kind of stretching

45
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,520
the ligaments around the spine and the neck

46
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,960
also helps to find upright you know sort of like a plumb line that comes eventually settles

47
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,479
into a steady and immovable sitting position

48
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,639
and allow yourselves to just sit you know like the upright wild boars that we

49
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:25,840
truly are

50
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,840
hey

51
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,840
okay

52
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,840
uh

53
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
hmm

54
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:41,840

58
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:16,559
teacher during this three-week intensive meditation intensive that gail myself and another

59
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:24,158
good friend paul heller have been offering called the harmony of zen and vipassana

60
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:31,200
so i can safely say that this has been a wonderful way to share the dharma with old friends who

61
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,960
for a long time now have been intent on following the path the buddha path together

62
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,399
you know with all of you so this is the last day of our intensive we

63
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:47,840
close tomorrow with the talk that gil and i are going to share on the zen center website and you're

64
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,200
very welcome to join us having spent these last four days of the

65
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,120
intensive talking about right conduct sheila and about the bodhisattva val

66
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,640
and the 16 bodhisattva precepts this morning i want to share with you a story

67
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:10,000
of an actual bodhisattva the ones the story that brought me closer into

68
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,200
practice and find by the decision to stay

69
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,320
so when i first came to zen center many decades ago now i was told there would be a full moon

70
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,799
ceremony on the roof of the beginner's mind temple in san francisco where i had been going to practice

71
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:33,360
meditation for about a year i thought the ceremony was pretty strange and

72
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:40,240
it was also very rigorous there are about 29 full vows full prostrations that take

73
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,480
place from the beginning of the ceremony to the end and a lot of chanting and

74
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:53,039
as it turned out the full moon ceremony is one of the oldest of rituals that has been continuously

75
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:58,799
practiced since the time of the buddha the monks who practiced off in science

76
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:04,080
in solitary meditation when the moon was full they could come together that was like their

77
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,000
clock so they could join together in a clearing and offer their confessions and repentance

78
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,440
and promise to do better so the monks and the nons and the laity

79
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,679
actually would gather four times in the old days uh each of the phases of the moon

80
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:27,200
but the full moon uh was the one that was most most common and we've recently done that

81
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,399
as well and it continues to this day in order for us also to reflect on our

82
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:37,600
practice and to recommit ourselves to the holy life and in particular to

83
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:43,679
the 16 bodhisattva precepts the three refuges the three pure precepts and the ten

84
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,720
grave or clear mind precepts so back to

85
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,559
years ago on that particular evening upon the roof of the zen center the person who was leading the ritual began

86
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:59,840
by telling us a story from a collection called the jataka tales in which the buddha's

87
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,200
former lives in both human and animal form are recounted

88
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,360
these stories are particularly popular with children and that humans and animals in the stories are

89
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,840
virtuous and brave and their leader often gives their own life to save the lives of others

90
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:24,480
just as salman guna had done in thailand about five years ago that leader

91
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:31,679
in a future life turns out to be none other than shakimuni buddha so often the jataka tales include an

92
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,840
extensive cast of characters who get into all kinds of trouble whereupon the bodhisattva intervenes to

93
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:43,360
resolve all the problems and bring about a happy ending this is the kind of stories i think we all like

94
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,440
best so here's the one that altered the course of my own life

95
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:56,320
once long long ago a monkey an otter a jackal and a rabbit resolved to

96
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:01,440
practice charity on the day of the full moon believing that a demonstration of great

97
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:07,120
virtue would earn them a great deal of merit when an old man entered

98
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,158
the forest begging for food the monkey gathered fruit from the trees and the otter

99
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:18,079
collected fish while the jackal pilfered a pot of milk curd from a nearby farmhouse

100
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:25,040
having called out in a not so very loud voice does this belong to anyone well the

101
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:31,839
rabbit on the other hand who knew only how to gather grass felt very sad and having nothing to offer the old man

102
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:36,878
until realizing that she could offer her own body by throwing herself onto

103
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:43,280
the fire that the old man had built to keep himself warm and just as the rabbit leapt into the

104
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,398
air the old man revealed himself to be shakra the lord of the gods

105
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:55,679
who then saves the rabbit friend by transforming the flames into lotus petals chakra being deeply

106
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:01,040
touched by the rabbit's virtue uses a nearby mountain to form the likeness of the rabbit

107
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,079
on the face of the moon for all to see it's said that the lunar image is still

108
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:11,920
draped in the smoke that arose when the rabbit cast herself into the flames

109
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,200
i don't know how many of you have looked at the moon to see the rabbit i think mostly in the west who are

110
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:22,320
taught to see an old man's face but the rabbit's there it's quite a wonderful full body

111
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,839
the ears the haunches and next time the moon is full take a look see if you can find the

112
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:34,960
rabbit this story of the bodhisattva giving her life for the welfare of another

113
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:41,920
had a big impact on me at the time and when my life it had really kind of worn out trying to

114
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,040
get something or somebody who would make me truly happy

115
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,400
so it was a remarkable idea to me that giving could be the true source of happiness for a human being

116
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,640
you know like me rather than getting so the next step was to try and

117
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,680
understand what it means to truly give alongside the bodhisattva vow and

118
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,520
precepts are a set of six practices for training a bodhisattva for a life devoted

119
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:16,800
to the welfare of others and among these practices is dhana paramita the perfection of giving

120
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,280
the first of what are called the six perfections so these six perfections can be thought

121
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,400
of as the kind of bodhisattva training program a program that was explained by the buddha in

122
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:35,440
very simple language so that almost anyone could understand and practice them so these six

123
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:43,200
giving the first morality or ethics right conduct the second patience

124
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:51,280
enthusiasm concentration and wisdom so they can also be thought

125
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:57,359
of as antidotes or antibodies to what the dalai lama has called our pathological emotions

126
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:03,920
greed hate and delusion so giving is what conquers greed

127
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:10,880
patience conquers hate and wisdom conquers delusion the other three

128
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:18,320
perfections involved in transforming our afflictive emotions are the perfection of ethics of morality the perfection of

129
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:24,480
enthusiasm we all need that and the reflection of concentration

130
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:31,280
so all six perfections are packaged together in a particular order so that each in turn supports the next

131
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:38,720
for example giving supports ethics as in giving your word or giving your fair share and ethics

132
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,320
supports patience as in for example waiting patiently for your turn

133
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:50,960
or waiting for negative feelings to subside before you speak or take action

134
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,119
the perfection of patience supports the perfection of enthusiasm by helping us to find a balanced response

135
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,480
to the arising of our human passions our likes and our dislikes

136
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,720
the perfection of enthusiasm in turn supports our ongoing commitment to a life dedicated to the well-being of

137
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,760
others a life concentrated on the practice of the six perfections

138
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,920
a life of becoming who we are truly meant to be bodhisattvas hard at work for the

139
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,560
well-being of the entire world so such a life is manifested in the story that i shared

140
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:33,200
with you of how the image of the bunny got onto the moon and although we can't really see a vow

141
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,680
or an intention to live by vowing such a vow informs everything that we do

142
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:44,800
in our life and in society it informs how we work

143
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:52,079
and the kind of work that we do and our collective effort to take care of it all so work as practice

144
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:58,400
which is easy to say but it's not so easy to do learning to engage in work as practice

145
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,079
is at times even harder than the work itself this is something we specialize in at

146
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:10,320
greengulch farm there's lots of work and yet as the buddha famously said

147
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:17,520
enlightenment is the path is what we do and the path is enlightenment in other

148
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,599
words awakening is a direct reflection of how we are living our life each and every day

149
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:28,640
the mind that is distracted lustful or hateful can't see the path of liberation

150
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,079
right before your eyes and yet the buddha hangs out with minds that are

151
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:40,720
distracted hateful and lustful in order to show us the way of kindness and generosity

152
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,160
selflessness and peace the very thing i think we are trying to do here as well

153
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:52,079
you know hang out with our minds and together show the way to peaceful abiding

154
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:57,280
together and for zen master dogen the founder of

155
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:05,359
my tradition called sotozen awakening is seated meditation is the bodhisattva

156
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:11,520
precepts is learning the backward step that turns your light inwardly

157
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:18,079
is the practice realization of totally culminated enlightenment

158
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:24,640
so thank you all so much for your kind attention i've really been enjoying coming to be at gill's place

159
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:33,280
for this week so i wish you all the best and please take care and please enjoy sitting as much as you

160
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:44,640
can kevin if there any questions i'd be happy to respond sure um we actually have one from uh

161
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,680
um eric on from youtube he was wondering about the differences

162
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:56,000
between vipassana such a great question as we've been

163
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,119
talking about for three weeks you know it's so wonderful um you know we share the root we're all

164
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,880
disciples of the buddha you know whatever happened under that tree the morning he woke up and he

165
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:15,440
didn't really tell us too much other than something like i and all beings are enlightened at the same

166
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:21,040
time there was a non-dual realization

167
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,240
between what he saw the star and himself it wasn't separate it wasn't

168
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:32,240
outside of himself and neither was anything else so that's the foundation for buddhism

169
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,240
buddhism means awake for being awake so you know awake-ism

170
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,599
and zen passing are both devoted to awakening you know to what the buddha

171
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:49,119
saw and how he behaved so that's the other side i think one of the things i've enjoyed

172
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,720
looking at between zen and vipassana is vipassana clearly you know it's as gil

173
00:41:54,720 --> 00:42:02,000
was saying it's retreat practice he teaches people who are on retreat so you can get really concentrated when

174
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,240
you're not doing anything else in the day we have sashings which are very similar i think those two

175
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:14,160
experiences for all of us are are pretty pretty close because you know human beings are

176
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,599
the same so sitting for a week uh paying attention to your mind is is

177
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:25,599
uh common ground uh maybe what's a little different and not different because of any reason

178
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,640
other than it's not the kind of teaching that of gil or

179
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:36,560
many of bakasana retreats don't actually you know take you outside and and do

180
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:43,680
some work together so zen is really focused on work practice a day of no work is a day of no food

181
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:49,119
what they said in china the monks couldn't just spend the day meditating they needed to feed

182
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:55,520
themselves it was a really different cultural climate so by the time buddhism got to china it

183
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:02,480
became very much ingrained in the activities of daily life and i think we spend a good deal of

184
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:08,720
our teaching time talking about how to work uh in a meditative you know with with the influence of your

185
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:15,599
meditation without falling into a kind of enchantment so that you can't actually cut the carrots you know some people

186
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:21,280
sometimes think cutting carrots in a meditative way is like really slow

187
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:26,800
you know we'd never get lunch out if that was so so we really oftentimes will put

188
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:32,079
somebody who's uh more you know seasoned cook on the opposite

189
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:38,640
side of the table from a new student who's going like this and then the person over there is you know is going like that so we're

190
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:43,680
trying to demonstrate that speed is not the issue it's focus

191
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:50,480
concentration like simone beals doing her routine you know she's concentrated and she's moving

192
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:57,200
so i think that combination of movement and meditation is what these two traditions emphasize

193
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:03,599
uh there's probably a lot more than that but that's what comes to mind

194
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,640
all right thank you yeah we've got a question

195
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:14,240
for you since you started practice did you ever leave the practice what precipitated leaving and what

196
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:20,800
brought you back oh that's good well i left because i adopted a baby

197
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:27,040
i didn't leave the practice i mean babysitting right uh i needed practice more than ever

198
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:33,520
having a little infant who was very tiny and kind of um you know she wasn't well she had

199
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:39,839
some issues at birth she's cerebral palsy and she's uh has other

200
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:47,040
issues that i don't need to go into but anyway she's fantastic she's going to be 28 next week and we'll be home she lives in

201
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:54,560
la she's great great human being so for a couple years i was home feeding

202
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:59,760
the baby doing things that you do when you have a young child um

203
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:06,640
and i don't think i stopped practicing i just wasn't going to the zendo for that time i was you know

204
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,839
work work practice and then what brought me back into the zendo i still lived in

205
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:18,640
the community i've been a resident there for 40 years so gratefully so um so i was able to go

206
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:25,359
back and take a a another leadership position when my daughter was old enough to sleep through

207
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:31,280
the night so anyway yeah i don't really think i've

208
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:38,079
taken a break i don't think there are breaks actually once you start to practice yeah and it's like what gill is taught

209
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:43,520
and i think is really brilliant entering the stream is you know entering the stream

210
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:49,280
or the current of a river and once you enter the current you're in a life of practice and that's

211
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:55,119
what stream mentoring really means i'm no longer driven by a life of karma

212
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:02,079
you know choice choosing whatever is my selfish view i'm actually streaming i'm in the

213
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:08,880
current of a life a vow of what i promised you know i made promises to live for the

214
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,000
benefit of others just like that story i told about the rabbit i liked that story i thought well i can do

215
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:21,760
that maybe i could give myself to something that i care about yeah so we never stop really

216
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:29,040
i do go on vacation

217
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:34,560
