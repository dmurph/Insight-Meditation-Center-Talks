1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,160
you're welcome through our meditation time and welcome

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:13,799
all of us together into this meditation community

3
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:22,140
thank you for being here and to offer thanks to for all of us

4
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,480
being here in a certain kind of way I'm thank myself for being here

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,059
can be uh could arise from a deep appreciation

6
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,700
of each other what we're here for our potential

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:46,140
our goodness it's a it can be a very profound thing to be

8
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,559
grateful and gratefulness at the heart in the heart at the heart of it

9
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,960
doesn't have to be something that is contrived or

10
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:05,338
something that's obligated or something that we plan and intend to have it's just a welling up that happens from

11
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:11,340
deep inside a deep appreciation and deep valuing and

12
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:17,540
and um and thankfulness and I say this because

13
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:24,900
uh desire in Buddhism has often had a negative reputation

14
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,540
and the most extreme version is that the desires the cause of suffering and we

15
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,579
need to let go of all desires and this is a misunderstanding of the

16
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:42,780
Buddhist teaching there are certain desires which are problematic certain desires which cause

17
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:50,220
a tremendous amount of suffering it tends to be the desires to have a lot of attachment clinging to him compulsion

18
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:57,299
with them so that's sometimes called craving clinging grasping

19
00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:03,240
there are other kinds of desires that well up from deep inside

20
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:11,420
that have nothing to do with clinging craving grasping nothing to do with obligation nothing to do with

21
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,500
you know logically kind of putting things together and constructing a

22
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:22,140
desire to have and one word for that that I like is

23
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,360
aspiration we can have and partly I like the word

24
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,599
aspiration because it's related to the English word respiration and so

25
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,760
um to aspiration Aspire aspiration kind of means to breathe out

26
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:46,019
when we eat when the breathing is most easy when we have an ease full breath

27
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:52,620
then what is the heart's deepest wish what's the deepest source of

28
00:02:52,620 --> 00:03:00,840
um desire what to be most what do we most want when we're most quiet we're most contented most satisfied

29
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:08,819
we're not afraid we're taken care of we're settled there's no biological needs

30
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:15,360
there's maybe no social needs at the moment and things are just settled and taken

31
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,540
care of in a certain way or been put aside what is the heart's deepest wish

32
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:27,540
the aspiration and it's from that place that the Dharma

33
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:33,060
practice the intention to practice Dharma can be it's that place where compassion can

34
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,959
arise from and that is to be respected and that is to be loved it can be loved it is love

35
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:47,000
that is delighted it's it's a comes from some kind of profundity and beauty

36
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,940
and that supports meditation practice that if you can sit quietly and calmly

37
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:00,480
enough to hear the quiet Voice or the quiet impulse

38
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,980
of the heart's deepest kind of aspiration free of clinging free of need free of

39
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:15,299
compensation and I feel the heart's desire for

40
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:21,239
Freedom the heart's desire for real presence the heart's desire to be awake to be

41
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:28,020
aware to be here and let that be the motivation for practice to let that

42
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:34,380
be kind of the support that kind of

43
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,620
Parts the Waters of distractions parts of the Waters of

44
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:45,360
preoccupation and fantasy and thoughts so we stay on course we stay right here

45
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:53,960
present so assuming a meditation posture

46
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:59,000
and gently closing your eyes

47
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:14,000
and then taking a few deeper breaths

48
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:22,500
and as you breathe in to prepare yourself in the inhale to let go on the exhale to release and

49
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,520
relax the body

50
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:52,020
and sometimes it's possible to relax more deeply if we hold our breath just for two three

51
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:58,979
seconds maybe first hold it at the top of the inhale top of the exhale and then the end of

52
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:06,000
the exhale hold the breath a little bit feel your body and then this like almost like a space

53
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,900
that's been created to let the body relax more

54
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:30,600
by holding your breath for two or three seconds you might also feel the gentle

55
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:37,500
wish of the body to breathe in to breathe out that you can

56
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:42,199
give into allow to happen

57
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:09,360
and then to let your breathing return to normal

58
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,960
continue for a few moments to relax deeply

59
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,600
the face the shoulders the belly

60
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:52,020
and almost as if with your awareness you can reach inside to touch

61
00:07:52,020 --> 00:08:01,319
the deepest place inside of you that you know to gently reach in touch that depth

62
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:09,138
and let it relax soften the deepest place within

63
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:25,860
and in whatever deepest place that's accessible to you can you find there

64
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:33,800
the aspiration the wish that motivates your meditation practice

65
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:52,140
maybe there's even a physical embodied Association sensation

66
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,420
with that wish that motivation

67
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:40,980
and then having the impulse to be present to be mindful

68
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:48,060
who did it settled in your aspiration

69
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:56,220
arising from your aspiration that keeps you steady the breathing with

70
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:03,839
the mindfulness as if you're gently parting the Waters

71
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:10,100
of Destruction and thought anything that takes you away

72
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:17,120
is gently gently Falls away

73
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:26,899
or evaporates away with the strength and warmth of your aspiration to practice

74
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:20,480
foreign

75
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:15,079
mindfulness supported by a deep aspiration

76
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:21,680
a deep sense of importance and purpose

77
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:10,820
where aspiration is the foundation

78
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:16,700
aspiration instead of Destruction

79
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,000
foreign

80
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,980
foreign

81
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,860
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

82
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:22,740
to relax deeply again a few rounds of breathing and relaxing

83
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:28,380
maybe there's a way of a deeper relaxation

84
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:31,880
at the heart of your being

85
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,840
relaxing anyway you're bracing yourself or

86
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,880
or leaning ahead of yourself

87
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:58,820
and letting the attention drop deep inside

88
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:07,380
what is your deepest Dharma wish what's your deepest wish

89
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:14,779
related to meditation to mindfulness to Buddhist practice

90
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:24,500
and there might not be a conceptual answer

91
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:30,620
it might be the answer might be more in a feeling or a sensation

92
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:42,360
something that brings along a yes yes this is right

93
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:45,320
this is good

94
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:56,120
and from whatever depth of aspiration that you know you can have

95
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:03,900
take in the suffering of the world but take it in not as your own

96
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:12,860
take it in as something that you will hold or care for or

97
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,700
not put it in the in your heart so that it hurts

98
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:27,419
but it put it in the softness of your hands of your awareness here let me hold the suffering of the

99
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:33,860
world for a little bit not taking it on

100
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:43,080
not having to do anything about it to just welcome it here into the softness of a

101
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:48,260
cupped hands or cupped hands of awareness

102
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,059
and gazing upon the suffering of the world

103
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:05,279
is there that the place of aspiration of care

104
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:11,279
kindness is or that is there kindness care

105
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:19,020
compassion a deep wish May the suffering of the world

106
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:25,440
be alleviated may this suffering that I witness and

107
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:34,278
know May beings be free of it

108
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:41,778
and may I and maybe my small way may I contribute to that

109
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:49,500
so that together as a community as a Global Community the whole world

110
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:55,919
may all of us contribute to the welfare and happiness of each other

111
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,000
may all of us

112
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,200
hold each other tenderly so their space for the heart's deepest

113
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,679
wish of care may all beings be happy

114
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:21,600
may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

115
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,559
and may all beings everywhere be free

116
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,480
[Music]

117
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:50,059
thank you

118
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:56,940
so today I'll talk about the fourth element of compassion

119
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:04,679
aspiration and this is kind of one of the kind of really core elements of compassion kind

120
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:10,380
of what really begins to have compassion take shape take form

121
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:16,799
then that is the wish for uh others to not suffer

122
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:22,080
the the aspiration that the suffering of the world

123
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:28,340
be be be remedied be fixed alleviated

124
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:35,279
and um and I use the word aspiration purposely because it's not a very

125
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:40,700
commonly used word I believe different than desire different than wish

126
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:46,620
has a lot of associations and and part of the associations is the associations

127
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:52,559
of obligation that we should there could be a sense of of with it

128
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:58,380
with a desire the desire to you know to help someone there can be a lot of self

129
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:04,919
self baggage around self and success and being seen being appreciated being a

130
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:11,580
good person showing that we're a good person all kinds of things come along with that

131
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:17,820
but aspiration has for me a sense of arising something deep inside

132
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:23,220
that we Aspire for something but it's held very lightly there's no attachment

133
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:31,019
or clinging it's uh but just the aspiration is very simple and because it has the word aspiration

134
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:39,240
is related to the word breathing it's related to the word like respiration has to do in Latin with to breathe

135
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:45,720
um and um I think of it I think I think Latin literally means something like to breathe out

136
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,360
and but to breathe easily to have a relaxed easy comfortable breathing where

137
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,820
there's no uh the breathing is not engaged you know tightened up and faster

138
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:02,760
and bigger in order to run or to fight or to get a job done or something or to

139
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:08,460
protect oneself everything is kind of soft and relaxed so there's in that easy

140
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:15,540
breathing there's room for this easy aspiration to arise

141
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:21,419
and to have this aspiration to alleviate to support people on their suffering to

142
00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:29,280
alleviate the suffering or to care for them in their suffering to have it come from such a place is precious

143
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:35,339
that's what makes karuna the compassion of Buddhism sweet kind of a pleasure to

144
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:42,179
it and um and uh and it just makes it kind of a source of Happiness just because

145
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:49,138
the feeling comes such a good deep place inside but we're I'm introducing this now on

146
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:56,040
the fourth day of these five elements because each of the previous three are

147
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:01,260
setting the stage for allowing the Simplicity of aspiration to come

148
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:07,200
in in often in in the world when people talk about compassion many people

149
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,900
recognize it as a wonderful and inspiring ideal but very few people have a really clear

150
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:18,119
sense of what it is in its simplicity there can be a lot of it's kind of a

151
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:23,339
general it's a vague idea and that can come with idea yes we want

152
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:32,280
to feel people suffering we want to uh you know have empathy for them feel

153
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:40,520
their self we don't feel their suffering and want to go out there and help them but with if that's not done carefully

154
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:47,220
the feeling other people's suffering could just make us miserable and if we're not doing carefully wanting

155
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:54,420
to support help someone can come along with a lot of complicated desires and attachments and confusion

156
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:01,079
so to begin this by being aware where we're present for the people in

157
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:06,320
the world but we're not entangled with our thoughts we're not like

158
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:13,339
proliferating thoughts and memories and Fantasies and expectations and and

159
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:21,300
selves and me and you there's something very grounded and simple in the awareness that is going to then begin to

160
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:27,060
take in another person others and then to um

161
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:35,220
when we're with someone who's suffering to find out how to be attuned to them how to be in harmony with them it's so

162
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:41,220
easy to lose Harmony if we have a headlong rush into caring for them fixing them and having the I need to

163
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:47,940
help I need to fix them I have to I one of the most complicated things is to feel responsible for the suffering of

164
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:54,300
others but to be attuned to the suffering to find a sense of Harmony that's very

165
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:59,640
contextually situated that takes oneself one's personal situation to account to

166
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:05,940
others so we don't lose ourselves we don't give ourselves up in the contact with others but we attune

167
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:12,320
ourselves to what's happening and then to appreciate and respect others respect ourselves

168
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:17,460
we don't respect people if we're trying to fix them we don't respect their

169
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:22,800
autonomy if we take responsibility for their suffering we don't respect and appreciate other

170
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:30,599
people if we take too much the notion of being I'm the helper I'm I'm like

171
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:37,079
a little bit Superior I'm the person who kind of knows it all or I'm capable to do it and I'm going to take care of you

172
00:37:37,079 --> 00:37:42,660
who doesn't know what to do and can't know what to do and and so it's a little bit condescending even that you have

173
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:47,820
helping sometimes so to have this respect and appreciation

174
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:53,820
of others then when we encounter suffering then

175
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:59,280
maybe we allow for this deeper aspiration to arise it's one of the most beautiful things

176
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,339
that a human being love care kindness that is an aspiration

177
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:10,619
that arises from the depth of Who We Are that has no pressure in it

178
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:15,980
it has no assertiveness in it no hurry in it

179
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:21,119
no requirement in it and no obligation

180
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:28,020
but it's the it's the it's the warmth it's the glow it's the it's the calling

181
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:33,599
it's the maybe yearning or deep kind of deep

182
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:39,619
desire that we have and this is one of the beautiful things to be able to discover

183
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:44,660
this deeper deeper desire we are human

184
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:49,859
desirlings desire is an intimate and integral part of Who We Are

185
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:57,359
and to discover how these desires benefit us fill us with goodness fill us

186
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:02,460
with a sense of wonderful vitality and animation

187
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:08,400
um that is a wonderful thing and we're not supposed to give up all

188
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,760
desire and be deflated and but this deeper deeper place it's almost comes from a place or does come

189
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,420
from a place where there's no ego no conceit no

190
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:25,500
locking into an identity this is who I am this is who I have to be no fixed

191
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:32,099
identity that we hold on to it's it's deeper than any identity we can have

192
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:41,040
um this deeper place this Wellspring and um and so there's compassionate wish

193
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:47,220
that others not suffer and uh I've been the recipient of that

194
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:53,460
this is where someone didn't actually help me but I felt their wish their their

195
00:39:53,460 --> 00:40:00,240
compassionate kind of care and recognition of my suffering and they're um and they're kind of a

196
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,780
good feel that they there they wanted it to be different for me and that was their wish but

197
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:13,020
um there was this kind of beautiful love that just feeling that from that person changed my life this is when I was quite

198
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:19,740
young and being with a Buddhist teacher a young teacher Rebecca Zen priest and

199
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:25,619
uh in my suffering feeling this beautiful clear simple thin field uh put

200
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:31,560
on put put upon I didn't feel like I feel the person who maybe would have helped if it was appropriate

201
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:37,140
but it was just this this um this simple beautiful aspiration this

202
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:42,839
wish that kind of resonated with me or it um there was an Attunement that

203
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:50,220
really kind of um I felt touched by that Attunement

204
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:57,359
so to so this is the kind of in since the beginning or the heart of of compassion

205
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:03,240
is a desire and to become wise about desire and to know the difference between desire which

206
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:08,520
is neurotic desire which is obligation desire which is forced with assertive

207
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:15,300
desire that comes along with fear desire that comes along with desperation all

208
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:20,660
those fall fall away the The

209
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:27,420
Parting of the water and this beautiful deeper place of aspiration

210
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:32,700
and um and uh and then one other part of the

211
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:39,599
art of this whole kind of karuna deeper as compassion is learning to trust

212
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,640
that that's okay to learning to trust that yes

213
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:51,060
it's okay to have a deep desire for the welfare of others

214
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:57,839
that doesn't come with anger doesn't come with desperation doesn't come with force and obligation doesn't come with

215
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:04,859
the kind of an of a uh kind of the clinging or the drive the compulsion I

216
00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:10,260
have to fix it I have to do it it's up to me

217
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:16,380
it comes from a very different place comes from some place that feels yes

218
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,720
yes if I can if it's in front of me if it's possible

219
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:27,079
from this place of freedom from this place of deep

220
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:33,660
heartfeltness I will now consider acting and doing

221
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:40,980
something if I can or what can I do and that's a topic for tomorrow action

222
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:46,680
and how can action also have these qualities of this depth that I'm talking

223
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:53,280
about today where aspiration comes from how can action have some of these qualities of non-attachment and

224
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:00,240
non-assertiveness and non-clinging so

225
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:08,040
awareness Attunement appreciation aspiration and then tomorrow we'll do

226
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:15,720
action that which completes kind of the the five different aspects or elements that

227
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:22,859
make this karuna in Buddhism so thank you and um

228
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:25,880
forward to tomorrow
