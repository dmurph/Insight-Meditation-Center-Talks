1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,639
so good morning good day

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:19,439
and here we are here you are in your place

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,840
and the idea is to kind of be definitively clearly

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:33,840
in the here that you are meditation is to rest here

5
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,960
established here now

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,520
and in that this week has been the week of touching into the role of imagination

7
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:53,760
and meditation one of the similes the buddha uses for

8
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,440
the state of clarity that

9
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,640
gives rise to awakening or that it kind of represents maybe

10
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,680
awakening is that of a clear

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,159
very clear lake here in the mountains in california there are some very clear alpine lakes

12
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,240
where you can look down into the water quite far and see clearly what's on the bottom

13
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,920
and uh so a very clear lake and a person who stands on the edge of

14
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,680
that lake the buddha says can look into that lake and see the fish swimming around can see

15
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,399
the pebbles the little shellfish that might be there and

16
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,600
each thing stands out distinctly but these things each thing is kind of swimming or

17
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,280
existing in this a context of domain

18
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,759
this space of clear water

19
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:09,840
and the water is often a symbol for awakening or the awakening but the mind for awareness

20
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,120
and and so the awareness that becomes clear

21
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,280
and so clear like this clear mountain lake in which all things can be seen but the

22
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,800
idea of standing on the the edge of the lake looking in the fish and the little rocks

23
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,599
the person who's looking is not interfering with anything it's not being foreign against anything

24
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:41,680
particularly just kind of just letting each thing be independent and free

25
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:50,080
and i love this idea because there's such a strong emphasis or strong tendency for people to look at

26
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,160
buddhist practice their own experience in meditation through the lens of me myself and mine

27
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:04,560
in my experience what i have to do and all this and and uh and so then you know the

28
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,840
ideas and the liberation means i will become liberated uh

29
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,080
look at me i'm liberated i'm free another way of understanding it which is just as valid

30
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,400
is that as we become free we are liberating everything else

31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:28,000
from us and that way liberation awakening is a gift we give to

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:35,280
everything where everything has become free of our attachment our clinging our expectations our

33
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,000
judgments all the stuff that we put on top of it and uh and so they're standing on the

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,640
lake edge of the lake and looking in the clear water the fish the rocks the shell shellfish

35
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:57,120
whatever's there is allowed to be theirs free of our entanglement or trying to grab it or

36
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,239
do something with it so that kind of clarity of mind that allows

37
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,319
each thing gives each thing its freedom its independence every experience in meditation

38
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:18,560
has this permission to be there provided it's seen in clarity

39
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,600
and so that's the kind of the key thing

40
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,919
recognized clearly so it's possible to be very foggy in one's mind

41
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:39,440
confused but that can be known clearly i'm foggy this is fogginess fogginess is

42
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,879
known this is chaos confusion chaos is known

43
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:57,840
confusion is recognized oh so um

44
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,479
so the um and so that's kind of the vision the

45
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,560
imaginational vision that the buddha is giving of where we're going with mindfulness practice

46
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,400
and it's not so much an experience of bliss and joy and happiness which is the subject right now in the

47
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,800
series of anapanasati but rather it's clarity

48
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,479
so with that as a background image for this meditation

49
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:39,840
to assume a meditation posture and to

50
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:53,840
gently close your eyes

51
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:12,560
and taking a deep breath in in a long exhale

52
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,400
and exhale that you relax your body

53
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,240
as if relax as if

54
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:35,680
you're draining out all the mud in the lake

55
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,080
as if there's a little outlet to the edge of the lake where the

56
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,639
mud can just drain away so as you relax your shoulders

57
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,400
let the tension drain away

58
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:04,160
as you soften your belly on the exhale the tensions of your belly

59
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,960
drain away

60
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,160
whatever attention you can easily let go of or relax let it drain away so you have

61
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:29,520
room within for clarity for seeing

62
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,039
as if you're making your body a receptacle

63
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:42,720
for clear kind of an empty receptacle empty of tension

64
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,160
so it can be the

65
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:59,840
the abode of clarity

66
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,840
letting your breathing return to normal

67
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:20,639
and taking a few moments as you exhale

68
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:41,839
to drain away the tensions or pressures in your mind the area of your brain

69
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,839
any tension in the forehead or in the temples

70
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,640
even any any little bit of contraction

71
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,360
that has a location for awareness

72
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:19,680
it's okay to have a location but the contraction associated with is not necessary

73
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:37,839
as you exhale let it drain away

74
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,800
and then to settle in here more fully in the body

75
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,839
entering into your body

76
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,600
regardless of how much comfort or discomfort you have in

77
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,640
your body from the inside out

78
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,839
that you your body is the buddha's body

79
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,480
certainly you're having a lot of experiences that he had when he meditated

80
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,600
certainly not all of them but the basic physical experience of the body

81
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:57,279
from the inside out your buddha body

82
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,680
to settle in be present here

83
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:17,760
and within this body to become aware of your breathing

84
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:27,120
regardless how you're breathing the buddha certainly breathed like you

85
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,519
at some point or other some of the same sensations you're experiencing

86
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,040
the buddha felt from within

87
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:57,839
here you are your buddha body breathing in and breathing out

88
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:11,839
and then

89
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,880
searching around in your mind or in your awareness

90
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:28,079
to find where and how can your awareness your mindfulness of

91
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:35,040
breathing have some degree of clarity

92
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,760
the clarity of standing on the edge of a lake looking in

93
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,519
without interfering with anything allowing things to be as they are

94
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,680
each things in its simplicity

95
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,200
nothing to do nothing to change

96
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,360
except have clear seeing

97
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,839
of the body breathing

98
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,760
and whatever else arises that's compelling

99
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,560
clear seeing clear knowing this is happening

100
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:49,839
this is what is recognized

101
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,839
reach it with each in-breath and each out-breath

102
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:20,399
the mud and the lake settle and gradually

103
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,760
there's more clarity

104
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:41,839
about what's happening in the moment here and now breathing

105
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:55,839
breathing in a vast expanse of awareness

106
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
so

107
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,868
[Music]

108
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,840
so

109
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,159
when we can let go of our preoccupations

110
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:47,440
it's kind of like emptying the lake of

111
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,120
debris and bud

112
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,600
and it makes us a vesicle for clarity kind of like it helps us become

113
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:07,120
gloriously empty spacious open

114
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:21,760
and then where there's space and openness for there to be well-being

115
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:31,039
is in room for gladness joy delight happiness

116
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:40,400
when the mind is crowded and claustrophobic with anxiety and thoughts and concerns

117
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:46,720
there's no room for well-being and joy

118
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:56,480
letting your tensions and preoccupations drain away

119
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:03,919
and give room for whatever well-being is here for you now

120
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,880
and with whatever embodiment that's available for you

121
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,279
feel the embodiment of well-being in whatever way it is for you however

122
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:26,640
small the embodiment of contentment

123
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,840
stillness calm

124
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,840
and breathe with the well-being

125
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,480
as if the well-being

126
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:56,399
shows the mind that it's okay to relax and dwell in clarity

127
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:07,840
clearly recognizing here

128
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

129
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,840
to open and extend your well-being

130
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:06,159
in your consideration contemplation of the world around you

131
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:12,399
the people you know people you know about and the many

132
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,360
people you don't

133
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:26,159
and to sit here for a little few seconds as if you can share your well-being

134
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:34,799
with them whatever however small it might be

135
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:42,640
as if you're a little bit like a heater that's spreading its heat outwards to

136
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:49,760
the world around it so if you can sit content in your well-being

137
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:59,120
and open it to the world imagine that you're warming up the world

138
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,080
with well-being

139
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:13,520
and consider how wonderful it would be if in fact your well-being one way or

140
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:20,320
other known or unknown could reach and touch all the beings of

141
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,840
this world

142
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:37,840
may it be that the practice of meditation this this day

143
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:46,480
is a condition for bringing welfare and happiness

144
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:53,520
to beings everywhere may the goodness and merit of this

145
00:30:53,520 --> 00:31:00,559
practice be dedicated to the happiness well-being

146
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:11,360
joy peace and freedom of all beings may all beings be happy

147
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:18,559
may all beings be safe

148
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:22,240
may all beings

149
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,480
be peaceful

150
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,840
may all beings be free

151
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:56,480
you
