5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,460
so so we've been exploring we've been exploring the theme of Dharma of improv

6
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:42,059
The Improv of Dharma for the past week and

7
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:48,239
um and today and and as I was planning on

8
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:56,699
uh for today there are a few more themes dharmic improv themes uh

9
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:04,500
so I I had a hard time I have to admit choosing one to conclude our our week so

10
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,200
so here we go this is this is the winner but just so you know that there are of

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,600
course there's always more it's always good to know there is more to to

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:21,740
and more to grow and and learn so so this theme

13
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:30,299
is the theme of um we are a character in our story we

14
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:36,540
are a character in the story we're a protagonist in this story given all the

15
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:45,360
causes and conditions we have become this protagonist this character in the story and in uh this particular way

16
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:53,759
these thoughts emotions Etc and it's not as fixed as we take it to be it's really

17
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:01,100
not as fixed as we take it to be it it changes all the time have you noticed

18
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:09,539
impermanence I've heard that somewhere Anita um so this this not not taking ourselves

19
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:15,840
to be a fixed entity and and also it relates to this another

20
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,260
Mark of existence not just in permanence but also anata in personality that

21
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:29,640
there's so much flexibility you wake up feeling one way having particular thoughts body feeling a particular way

22
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:35,640
two hours later different thoughts with a relationship to someone else as if

23
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,819
it's a different person relationally so so there's it's we all co-create we are

24
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:47,879
being co-created by the environment and we keep co-creating ourselves in the

25
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:53,099
environment so so now to take ourselves at this fixed fixed person in a playful

26
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:58,760
way in a playful way not in a judgmental way but in a very playful way

27
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:07,319
acknowledging that yeah this person knows me there's a lot of range there's a lot of flexibility not feeling stuck

28
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,900
um as we sometimes do when our vision gets tight in our lives like this is the

29
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:19,140
only way I'm in pain this is difficult um there's so many possibilities even in

30
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:25,860
the midst of pain and challenges always so many possibilities so

31
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:31,680
so with that in mind I will invite us for some um

32
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:39,000
with some invitations during our meditation and um and then more on this when we

33
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,519
practice when uh when I offer uh reflection so

34
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,220
so with that let's let's arrive let's arrive in this

35
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:57,659
body and The Way We Know It In This Moment In

36
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:04,980
Time arriving with the body

37
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,120
greeting the body

38
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,180
greeting the moment

39
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:28,919

41
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,880

42
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:50,580

43
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:57,620

46
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:30,740
releasing feeling itself from the inside

47
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,918

50
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:21,199
of the lightness of changing nature of this moment

51
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,560

52
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,319
can be delightful

53
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,599

54
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,759

55
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:43,099

reflections blissful creative

148
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:50,039
yes yeah we can have a lot of creativity in our

149
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:56,700
in our practice there are so many doorways to the temple so many doorways

150
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:02,880
and sense of humor is one of them and sometimes we when we enter the

151
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,540
the path of practice we think okay it's got to be serious actually humor can be a great

152
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:15,320
support great support this lightness of heart

153
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:21,060
Awakening is just too serious is yeah too serious for for us to have no humor

154
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:27,599
about it ah beautiful thank you so much

155
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:36,060
so so as I mentioned briefly many themes but the one for today is

156
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:41,878
is this idea of of um again from the dharmic sense from the

157
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:50,040
dharmic perspective as I mentioned there is [Music] um a sense of likeness of impermanence the

158
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,320
shifting changing nature of ourselves our thoughts our bodies our

159
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,839
personalities our reaction reactions the co-creation in a particular environment

160
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:08,580
with particular people we show up differently and and that impermanence leads to one

161
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:15,300
perspective one way to experience anata in personality it's it's co-created there's this such lightness about it can

162
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:20,820
be co-created in a different way this this person we are the sense of self is

163
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:26,339
is created is Created from so many cause and conditions so many cause and

164
00:35:26,339 --> 00:35:34,579
conditions which is actually one way to to understand emptiness everything is

165
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:40,320
codependently arising our personality how we are reacting

166
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:47,400
um if I say personality feels a little fixed but but um the way we are showing up in the

167
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:53,040
particular moment are reactions are such co-creations of the environment and

168
00:35:53,040 --> 00:36:00,359
previous experience and and so many different factors and our thoughts are our perspective of

169
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:07,519
course our review this is fixed this is who I am this is the way I am this is how I relate

170
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,200
and and the Buddha has invited us to really see

171
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,339
these characteristics of existence these marks of existence that yes it is it is

172
00:36:19,339 --> 00:36:28,380
co-created nothing is our personality our self is co-created is codependently

173
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:37,020
arising in each and every moment so why don't we support a a more kind a

174
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:45,140
more wise co-creation we can support it of course we can we're part of one of these causes and conditions

175
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:52,859
so so from the perspective improv actually the perspective of improv you

176
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:58,440
are taking on these characters when you're playing a scene when you're

177
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:04,560
playing uh with with other players you're taking on a character

178
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:12,060
um and the character keeps shifting and changing and moving and and you'd take a character in one one scene and one game

179
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:17,700
and another character another and this and what I've discovered and actually

180
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:23,099
many people have discovered this as you take on a different character different

181
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:30,180
aspects of your personality different aspects of your perception different aspects of your behavior

182
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:37,700
um all of these become Unleashed you're not as fixed as you realize there's so much more degrees of freedom

183
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:44,280
and in fact simply taking the physicality of another being another

184
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:51,660
person can shift your um State of Mind I hide a um I

185
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:58,900
practitioner Yogi some years ago on a retreat on a silent Retreat and

186
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:04,920
[Music] um and what they shared with me was uh so

187
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:12,180
interesting and insightful they said that at first for maybe for some time they had felt annoyed by people they had

188
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:17,760
felt annoyed by oh this person who's walking so slowly or that person who's

189
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,460
like this and that person just kind of their mind this judgmental mind was was

190
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:28,859
just uh frustrated with people and then what they decided they made a decision

191
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:37,320
okay what what if actually they had an observation what if what if um they

192
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:43,200
there's something about their physicality that's actually making them be in a world in a particular way so

193
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,680
what they did the decision they made was to take on the physicality of different people that at first they were annoyed

194
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:55,880
by so perhaps there was an older person this was a younger person um

195
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:02,040
um the um the uh

196
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:08,579
um you know the older person maybe the fact that they're actually you know they're

197
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:16,140
um they're they're maybe hunched over a little bit you know walking slowly and this younger person

198
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:22,260
tried that they tried walking more slowly with perhaps less certainty in

199
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:27,440
their steps or um and and what they shared was that

200
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,839
every diff every body posture that they took every character they entered there

201
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:41,040
are different ways that they saw the world they're different ways that they became and their heart opened to to

202
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:47,640
compassion for the the beings at whom they were annoyed at first because they

203
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:53,339
they entered their character their world through their their their body through

204
00:39:53,339 --> 00:40:00,480
their the uh the physicality and in fact as an improv performer as an improv

205
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:05,940
player one of the exercises that you take on different physicalities to enter

206
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:13,079
um different characters through their physicality but of course you can enter them in so many different ways

207
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:20,480
um both to open our hearts to compassion to kindness to to Insight

208
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,520
as well as what we tried for example what we tried with the guided meditation

209
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:34,560
was was a different version of a practice that's called Buddha nusrati Buddha nusati is reflection on the

210
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,260
beautiful qualities of the Buddha reflection on the Buddha recollecting the Buddha nusrati recollecting

211
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:47,579
remembering Buddha remembering the Buddha so so there are ways that this practice can traditionally be practiced

212
00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:53,900
when you think about you conjure up the beautiful qualities of the Buddha

213
00:40:53,900 --> 00:41:00,380
ah wise gosh yes Wise Wise or or or

214
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:08,099
generous generous generous generous peaceful yes yes all-knowing knowing of

215
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:14,040
all worlds so sorry collecting your minds and then it and and then when you

216
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:20,540
practice it actually I've practiced the Recollections of the Buddha a lot and I love this practice so if you're feeling

217
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:26,220
upset or unhappy or or depressed oh my goodness do Recollections of the Buddha

218
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:31,560
it just Inspire it just infuses your heart with light and Bliss and your

219
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:39,740
inner Buddha uh becomes alive and that's what I was inviting you to to basically doing this practice of of Recollections

220
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:45,000
Recollections of the qualities of the Buddha in in this creative way in this

221
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,119
creative way of the Buddha entering and actually all infusing this quality oh yes

222
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:55,140
oh yes how would they be right now how they said how would they pay attention

223
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:00,900
oh yes the Buddha so um and as I and I was practicing along with you and there

224
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:06,440
was just such a sense of really uh shining shining this this this this

225
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:13,380
light this This brilliant light of of goodness of the Buddha that oh yes it's

226
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:20,880
here too it's here too trust that it's here too we all have it of course we have it of course

227
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,220
sometimes it might feel more more covered or or we have to listen more

228
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:31,440
closely to uncover it but it's always here it's always here

229
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,020
foreign so so there are a lot of different ideas

230
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:44,780
and concepts are brought in but but basically it the um

231
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:52,980
as the theme for today our personality the way we are the way

232
00:42:52,980 --> 00:43:00,900
we take ourselves to be is so flexible it's co-created it's it is impersonal it

233
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:08,940
is co-created it's an aspect of emptiness um codependently erosion and we can play

234
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:16,680
around with skillful means skillful means of recollecting the qualities of

235
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:22,800
the Buddha beautiful qualities of the Buddha letting it nourish us Infuse us so

236
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,380
basically we're playing the Buddha character right in improv terms we would be we're playing the Buddha as as

237
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:35,160
someone said we're um faking it until we become it of course please let's all fake it until we

238
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:40,740
become it because it that's how it happens um what would they put that to you know

239
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:46,079
if you have decisions today the rest of them what would they put to do what would this person do what would you know

240
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:52,460
this favorite uh teacher I saw someone mention Brahm in in the chat who actually losing

241
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:59,460
there's a lot of humor in his teachings very very funny uh funny person funny

242
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:06,660
guy um so yeah what would I jump prop do in this case it's so so bringing this this

243
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:14,099
creativity that we have it's we have so many tools and skills on the path to Awakening so many tools and and another

244
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:20,819
one as I mentioned you can enter other people's worlds other physics reality see the world from their perspective

245
00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:25,980
it's really empathy it's empathy and compassion so so this improv this

246
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:33,780
playfulness of taking on different characters maybe you decide after this this Sid you go around maybe your day or

247
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:40,200
part of your day as some character some you know as the Buddha is one of your favorite teachers

248
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:47,520
whoever you or or so be creative be creative today play

249
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:53,579
around with or maybe I'm going to go around as a happy person as the Happy Buddha I'm just going to go around and

250
00:44:53,579 --> 00:45:00,240
make my breakfast or or make my lunch or interact with my friends or

251
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:06,240
that's the Happy Buddha or as the wise but as the compassionate but as the generous Buddha
