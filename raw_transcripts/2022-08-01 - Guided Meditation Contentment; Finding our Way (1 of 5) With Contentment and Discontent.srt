00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,440
hello everyone and welcome to our monday beginning of the

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,240
week meditation and um i'm very happy to be back here

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,840
and sitting here in my very familiar meditation posture which

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,199
i've done so often enough that it is a kind of homecoming

5
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,280
to sit here to sit in this posture and immediately when i take this posture

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:40,160
usually i feel very content this deep sense of contentment

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,800
and so i'd like to suggest that a theme that you keep for this

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:51,760
meditation is contentment

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,399
and there's many ways of feeling contentment many reasons for feeling contentment

10
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:05,040
and and maybe there doesn't have to be many reasons just it's okay to just be

11
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,479
content with the moment content with being alive right now

12
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:16,960
even though there might be all kinds of things elsewhere outside of this posture outside of your meditation which

13
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,320
there's good cause to be discontent but maybe they don't have to be imported

14
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,439
maybe they don't have to be evoked maybe we can just let go of it for a few

15
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:34,079
minutes and experience contentment for no reason just to be here

16
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,280
or one of the great kind of pieces of

17
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,799
um i don't know spiritual spiritual wisdom or maybe pop

18
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,360
spirituality wisdom that i'm fond of is um

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,960
the idea of being content with what you have

20
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,439
rather than focusing on what you don't have sometimes the contentment can come with what you do have

21
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,679
and so in meditation um

22
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,879
uh you might want to uh think that what you have

23
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,239
that allows you to have actually a very deep contentment not to be troubled

24
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,640
not to be

25
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,000
overwhelmed by life and what's happening no need to be critical of the situation

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,959
and that is to be content that you have a practice content that you have a meditation practice a mindfulness

27
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,280
practice a kindness practice content

28
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,319
this is good and even if this practice we do is so valuable

29
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,640
it's even valuable when we do it imperfectly when we do it

30
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,239
you know a little bit so to be content that you have this

31
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,720
practice and maybe this contentment can uh save you from

32
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,239
the discontent that takes your mind away spins off in thoughts and desires and

33
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,080
aversions that can be for later but for now

34
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,400
here content just to be here practicing

35
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,840
so to begin with

36
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,640
sitting upright in an alert relaxed posture

37
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,319
and lower your gaze

38
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,560
and gently close your eyes

39
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,319
and regardless of how you're feeling in your body sitting meditating

40
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:18,079
whether it's comfortable or uncomfortable take a few long slow deep breaths

41
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,120
that somehow feels like it moves through the comfort of discomfort

42
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,880
to something larger sense of presence larger sense of body here

43
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:36,720
as you breathe in and fill your lungs with air and as you exhale

44
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,759
a fuller experience of just letting go of everything

45
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,880
including concern with comfort and discomfort

46
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,000
breathing in deeply and letting yourself become larger than anything

47
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,639
that's troubling you

48
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,680
exhaling and letting go maybe deeper inside than anything that

49
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,080
troubles you

50
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,759
and then letting your breathing return to normal

51
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:44,560
and letting yourself be content with whatever way your body is breathing

52
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:53,280
there's no right way to breathe in doing mindfulness let it be what it is

53
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:01,560
content that you get to breathe however imperfectly

54
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,960
and as you exhale to

55
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,240
relax and let go of the places in your body that hold

56
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,840
discontent maybe there's

57
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,680
some of the tensions of your face could be interpreted as a discontent

58
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:39,479
with how things are and as you exhale relax the face

59
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,599
and the exhale relaxing the shoulders

60
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,918
maybe there's a resistance resistance or holding back

61
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:12,000
in the shoulders that you can relax into a deeper contentment

62
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,319
less resistance

63
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,000
softening in the chest

64
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:44,360
softening discontent in the heart area

65
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,599
letting it soft soften melt

66
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,199
fade away on the exhale

67
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,280
and then softening in the belly

68
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:34,959
perhaps the belly can be content in some deep place within

69
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,159
in the depths of the belly

70
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,440
hmm

71
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:08,839
and then sitting here not with the idea that something has to be done or accomplished

72
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:16,640
that you need to succeed anything but sitting here close to

73
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,920
whatever feeling of contentment

74
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:28,560
just content with being alive just being alive is enough

75
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,399
and out of that contentment

76
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:45,920
let there be present moment awareness awareness of breathing

77
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:57,360
and out of present moment awareness let there arise contentment

78
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,560
that these two come hand in hand oh mindfulness and contentment content

79
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:11,120
to be mindful mindful to be content

80
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,399
one breath at a time

81
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:29,440
content you have a practice no matter how imperfect it might seem

82
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:40,040
one inhale at a time one exhale at a time

83
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,839
so

84
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,040
so

85
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,880
so

86
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,320
so

87
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,279
um

88
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
so

89
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,079
um

90
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,880
so

91
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,480
so

92
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,120
um

93
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,280
um

94
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,280
then

95
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,679
then

96
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,280
so

97
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,160
so

98
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,120
so

99
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,640
so

100
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,480
so

101
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,799
so

102
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:21,000
so

103
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:51,120
whatever is happening for you maybe you can be content

104
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,080
to breathe with it breathe through it

105
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:02,480
content that you can keep the breathing at the center

106
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,039
of your attention

107
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,919
instead of your concerns at the center of your attention

108
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,840
me

109
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,279
so

110
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,760
so

111
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,360
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

112
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:13,440
to consider how contentment being content

113
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,559
might make you available for the world

114
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:26,799
discontent is a barrier to being connected to others to the world

115
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:33,919
to listening deeply and contentment is not a walling off or

116
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:39,279
a barrier contentment can be a state of being

117
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:44,320
available being available for what the needs are

118
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:53,279
of others being available for the sufferings of the world the joys of the world

119
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:58,399
to cry with others to laugh with them

120
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:06,799
may it be that this practice that we do makes us available for others

121
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,159
available to care for others

122
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,158
to be attuned to others

123
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:26,760
to be friends to others may

124
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,799
this practice that we do our availability to the world

125
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:37,600
be for the welfare and happiness of everyone

126
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,679
may this practice spread happiness into the world

127
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:52,240
may it spread safety where there is no safety

128
00:29:52,399 --> 00:30:00,799
may it spread peace where there is no peace and may it spread freedom

129
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:08,760
where there is no freedom may all beings be happy

130
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:26,289
[Music]

131
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,158
thank you

132
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,640
yep

133
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,880
so monday morning and we start a new series

134
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,640
of in this general topic of emotions that covering the last weeks

135
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,720
and uh now it's uh this week it's going to be states that we have emotional states

136
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:31,919
perhaps that are kind of the opposites of each other

137
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:38,240
but that live in relationship to each other sometimes a pendulum swings one side to the other

138
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,960
and sometimes we react to one and the other arises and vice versa

139
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,480
uh or that they uh both sides of this of this range

140
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,919
um have a place in our lives and so to appreciate that there's these two sides

141
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:02,880
that live in dynamic relationship to each other and and to appreciate understand them deeper

142
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:09,120
and so for today i want to talk about contentment and discontent

143
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,559
there is healthy contentment healthy discontent

144
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:19,840
and there is unhealthy contentment and unhealthy um

145
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:26,159
discontent and so to really look and see more deeply what is this world of contentment

146
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,760
discontent that we live in the um

147
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:43,840
to live in a world of discontent is often a world of suffering

148
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:51,600
to continue living a world of stress of greed of hatred is stressful

149
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,880
and it can arise out of our discontent with how things are

150
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:02,880
is to pile more discontent on top of it we can out of the discontent the

151
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,960
difficulties of our life we can get caught up in greed and hatred and fear

152
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,000
and there's a healthy discontent

153
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,360
with suffering buddhist practice that does involve a discontentment and intolerance even

154
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:27,519
in a certain particular way to our suffering not intolerance where tolerance

155
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:34,000
associated with hostility and bias and prejudice but rather intolerance and say you know

156
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,919
i'm not going to be content with a life of suffering i'm not going to be content with a life that i'm

157
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,960
miserable and live in constant fear or constant

158
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:52,640
um discouragement or stress and so that inspires practice a certain

159
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,799
discontent that inspires practice but then at some point there is

160
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:05,919
um so that to be content with things as they are sometimes means being content with

161
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,800
things which you know are to our detriment

162
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,799
so but to be content

163
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:23,118
with is a very important valuable state

164
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:29,440
for people who are doing buddhist practice and doing mindfulness to learn to be content with

165
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,839
through having few wishes when we want all the time we want and

166
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:42,480
what we want then um you know there can be a strong discontent

167
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,200
and and but to have fewness of wishes and just be happy and content with what we

168
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,320
have can provide a very satisfying state of

169
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,000
being it also can provide a very positive state to be available for the wonderful

170
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,880
things in our life if we're discontented and always wanting more and more different things we might

171
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:13,359
not be available to really appreciate what we do have and what is good here

172
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,920
the um um there's this wonderful story that i

173
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,359
that's told many different ways recently i read the version by pablo uh

174
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:31,200
kohilo and um so it goes something like this that uh

175
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:37,760
there was a fisherman who would go out to sea every morning get up early in the morning go out to fish and

176
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:43,680
and catch enough fish for the day to take to bring back for the family to

177
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,680
eat and sell a few of them for some of the things they needed and would come back in the you know in

178
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:56,880
mid morning and then would play with his children on the beach and a delightful time playing

179
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:05,280
and then he would go home and spend a good part of the afternoon with his wife and maybe siesta hang with her

180
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,760
and then uh would go into the evening and spend a good number of hours

181
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:18,400
in the village square with his friends and talking and chatting and having a nice time

182
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,760
and he would do this he did this for a long time and then one day a um

183
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:30,800
a very successful businessman came by and noticed how he was living his life

184
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:37,440
and he said you know it'd be pretty easy for you to take out a loan and get a boat and

185
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:42,560
there's a lot more fish out there for you to fish you can spend a few more hours of the day fishing and

186
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:49,200
you'd be able to pay back the loan quickly and then buy a bigger boat and um and why should i do that says a

187
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:55,359
fisherman well then you would have more money you can actually then buy a fleet of boats

188
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:01,200
and hire people to work and pretty soon you'd have enough money to

189
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:07,040
start a whole company and you could have the international headquarters near your village and

190
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,240
and run this huge conglomerate of of

191
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:19,119
fishing and selling fish and and um and then when you're uh

192
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:25,359
you know after many years of doing this you'll be able to retire and then you can

193
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:30,880
just get it then when you're retired you can enjoy yourself you can just get up in the morning and go into the sea go

194
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,560
fish for a few fish and come back and enough for the day and then play with your children at the

195
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:42,000
beach and and um hang out with your wife in the afternoon and your friends in the

196
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,400
evening and the fisherman said well that's what i'm doing now already

197
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:56,000
why should i wait until you know i retire and so uh to be content with what we

198
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,760
have is partly the story of that this i think the theme of that story

199
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:09,040
and um and when do we do that in such a way that um

200
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:14,400
it allows for something uh profound to happen for us

201
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,480
when we when do we when does contentment open the doors to the practice

202
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:27,839
to see ourselves deeply and to move through layers and deeper and deeper contentment and joy and peace

203
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:32,880
and happiness move through layers of letting go

204
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:40,240
of this layers of discontent layers of suffering of greed and desires

205
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,400
um you know one of the advantages of meditation one of the really important aspects of it

206
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:53,359
is that as we settle and get quieter and more concentrated we start seeing aspects of our inner

207
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:58,560
life that are not available running around everyday life running around discontent

208
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:05,920
taking care of things doing things and so we start seeing the deeper levels

209
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:13,359
of healthy and unhealthy discontent the deeper layers of places of holding of clinging of fear

210
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:18,560
that we're living by and and then we let go

211
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:25,040
and so then as we do so we start feeling deeper and deeper layers of of

212
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:30,800
freedom of happiness of contentment of peace

213
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:37,200
so um so this whole world of contentment

214
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:43,920
and discontent has a lot to do with the world of desires and the classic language in

215
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,440
buddhism is that people who practice should have few

216
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:55,280
should be content by having few desires some desires desires for practice ours

217
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,760
to be free desire just to help the world but maybe not it desires for

218
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:09,440
expensive cars and expensive homes and expensive you know all kinds of things it's possible so many desires

219
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:15,599
and this modern world for some of us it's uh there's so many

220
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:20,720
things to do and to acquire it's astounding and it can be

221
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,560
stressful to live in a world of so much temptation

222
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:33,119
and so fewness of wishes desires but then there's a whole other layer

223
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,800
and um and the this world of contentment and discontent as it gets settled and

224
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:46,160
more and more settled and peaceful and quiet it all comes like a funnel down through the spout of the funnel to

225
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:53,040
a whole other world of being available being available to what the world is

226
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:59,599
about being available to the uh the you know the

227
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:05,839
cool breeze against our cheek being available to notice the colors of green in the trees

228
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:13,280
around the property around the town being available to sip tea and enjoy oneself being

229
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,400
available for meditation being available for honesty about what's really happening here for us as we

230
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,440
become more mindful being available to truth-telling oh this

231
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:31,280
is what's happening to have enough contentment to be quiet enough to be subtle enough

232
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,880
to start being more and more honest about what is here being available for the truth

233
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,400
being available to see what is not true so

234
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,520
as we navigate and find our way in this world of contentment and discontent

235
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,200
as we begin seeing where this where there's possibilities of healthy contentment

236
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,480
and where we might get caught in unhealthy contentment

237
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:05,200
when we start seeing where healthy discontent is and where unhealthy discontent is and we

238
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:11,520
start maneuvering and finding our way and finding some freedom from the incessant desires that can keep us

239
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,720
discontented in unuseful ways then there can be a settling and a

240
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:24,400
quieting a contentment with just things as content with how things are

241
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:31,119
imagine standing in a long line at a government agency to get something like

242
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:37,280
your driver's license and there's nowhere to go because you have to stand in the line

243
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:44,560
imagine being content because being discontented there is just

244
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:50,078
a waste of time it serves no purpose

245
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,720
it doesn't make things go faster it doesn't help you feel more healthy and happy

246
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:02,240
to be available for contentment with what is

247
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:09,200
when that's the best alternative to know how to let go of desires

248
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,760
wanting things to be different when that's not really what's possible

249
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:23,520
to learn how to be content with what is when what is is actually quite wonderful

250
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:29,359
maybe what is is more wonderful than what you're striving for if you're striving for

251
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:35,359
wealth and fame and all kinds of things

252
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:40,400
so i'd encourage you to spend the day

253
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:47,200
looking at your relationship to contentment and discontent

254
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:53,599
and and perhaps you can begin to appreciate the greater range of ways that

255
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,880
contentment can be healthy and also the healthy ways of being

256
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,319
discontent and

257
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:09,599
and in the process of doing that find yourself more settled and available

258
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,640
for this world available for your practice

259
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:20,319
available for yourself so thank you

260
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:27,119
and so this will be kind of the theme for this this week these i'll do this pairing of two different kind of states

261
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:32,720
and just uh explore them a little bit with you

262
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:41,640
and tomorrow will be gladness and sadness so thank you
