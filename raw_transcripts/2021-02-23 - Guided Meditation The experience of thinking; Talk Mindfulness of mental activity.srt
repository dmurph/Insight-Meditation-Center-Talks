1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,879
good evening and i always feel like i want to say

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,240
good morning good afternoon whoops whenever it might be that you're

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,880
listening to this so

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,560
it's nice to practice with others so welcome welcome

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,000
as you know we start with a guided meditation

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:43,120
so just taking an alert upright posture

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,680
settling into a posture that supports your intention

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,920
to

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840
meditate

10
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:13,360
that includes some balance as well as some ease

11
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,520
feeling centered grounded

12
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,640
i like this saying to sit and know that you're sitting

13
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,439
feeling the pressure of whatever you're sitting on perhaps against the back with the back

14
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:55,840
side putting the pressure against the legs

15
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:09,840
whatever the feet are touching

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,200
and to help support the arriving

17
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:31,760
and a sense of ease we can also check in with

18
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,640
other areas of the body the face

19
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:51,840
and the eyes the jaw the mouth

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,480
the shoulders allowing the shoulder blades to slide

21
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,040
down the back have the shoulders be away from the ears

22
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:17,040
maybe tucking the chin just a tiny bit just a really small movement that

23
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,519
opens up the back of the neck

24
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:37,440
relaxing the chest maybe another really small movement

25
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:46,720
of opening the chest maybe the shoulders go back

26
00:03:46,720 --> 00:04:01,840
and relaxing the belly

27
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,120
and relaxing or bringing awareness to the hands

28
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:18,079
what are they touching is it smooth or rough

29
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:29,840
is it warm or cool

30
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,840
and bringing that same attention

31
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,840
to the sensations of breathing

32
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,560
feeling the movement of the chest or the belly

33
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:25,840
abdomen or the feeling of air going in and out of the nose

34
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:53,840
noticing the in-breaths and out breaths

35
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:43,199
or when the mind wanders we just very simply gently

36
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,840
begin again with those sensations of breathing

37
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:45,840
feeling into the experience of breathing the expansion

38
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:59,840
stretching pulling

39
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:10,640
when the mind and body are settled a little bit

40
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:20,240
it can be helpful to turn towards our thinking

41
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:27,200
rather than believing that we have to get rid of our thoughts

42
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,560
we just turn them into objects of

43
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:41,040
meditation and we can turn towards them

44
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:51,839
with an inquiry about the process the experience of thinking

45
00:09:52,959 --> 00:10:01,839
not the content of the thoughts but are the thoughts pictures

46
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:08,720
little videos or are they more like sounds word

47
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,360
sentences

48
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:21,360
are they colorful are they loud so the

49
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,480
quality of thinking the process of thinking the experience

50
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:47,839
of thinking not the content

51
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,720
having the intention to notice this can disrupt some of the momentum

52
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:15,839
of thinking

53
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,880
it can be really helpful to notice

54
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,839
oh yeah this is a little movie

55
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,120
planning what i'm going to do or remembering something

56
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,360
or maybe it's a voice

57
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,040
maybe it's your own voice

58
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:59,279
you can also inquire is there a location

59
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:07,440
in which this movie is playing that is is there a movie screen

60
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:21,839
as their location for the movie screen is their location for the loudspeaker

61
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:32,560
the point is to be curious and have an inquiry

62
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:39,040
which can interrupt the thinking the purpose is not so much that we have

63
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:49,839
to find and dig for the answer

64
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:27,839
we don't have to get rid of our thoughts we just fold them in into our practice

65
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:25,679
it's worthwhile to notice thinking or

66
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:34,000
thoughts without getting lost in them

67
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:42,880
have such a big influence on us whether we are aware of them or not

68
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:54,240
and being more aware of our thinking disrupting it

69
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,320
not getting lost in it all the time

70
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:04,720
there's a way that helps us to be here

71
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,720
and attentive to what's here and now

72
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:19,760
in such a way that can support others

73
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,520
be available for others

74
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,880
so that we can create the conditions in which they can

75
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,039
be the best versions of themselves

76
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:44,000
just like we're practicing to create the conditions so that we can be the best versions of

77
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,720
ourselves

78
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:57,360
so may all beings be safe and may all beings be free

79
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:04,000
from suffering and may our practice in perhaps some

80
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,200
really small way but may our practice contribute

81
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,840
to the ending of suffering

82
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:25,920
[Music]

83
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,759
good evening

84
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:10,559
i i want to say it's nice to be here with you all because in my mind i'm meditating with other people even

85
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:17,919
though i am alone in this room but i feel the sense i can see the chats

86
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:25,120
that um there's others with us here others with me here

87
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:32,640
so tonight i'd wanna i would like to talk a little bit about

88
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,960
how we can bring our mindfulness practice even to thinking or thoughts or mental activity

89
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:45,919
or often with mindfulness there's an emphasis on being with breathing

90
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:53,120
being with the body but of course we can also be with the mind

91
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:02,000
and that our mental activity has such an impact on our lives it's worthwhile to become more aware of

92
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:09,360
it and and to interrupt some of the momentum it might have some of the compulsive

93
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:16,480
quality it might have some of the feeling of getting stuck going round and round

94
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:26,240
and because it's so easy to just to get lost into story and mental activity

95
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:34,000
it's abundantly easy to do that we often don't fold in mindfulness of

96
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,360
mental activity mental states until there's a certain amount of

97
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,840
stability and steadiness so it might be for a lot of our

98
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:51,919
meditation that we are just settling and calming down and

99
00:31:51,919 --> 00:32:00,080
so it's primarily spent with a mindfulness of breathing and mindfulness of bodily sensations

100
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:06,000
but when we feel like there's a certain amount of stability and this might not happen until we're on

101
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,840
retreat or some other extended opportunity an opportunity for extended meditation

102
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,799
periods but whenever we do feel like there is some stability

103
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:25,679
then we can turn towards the thinking and the thoughts

104
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:32,720
without getting completely swept away in them because of course

105
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:39,200
this um in order to be mindful of thinking we need to

106
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:46,559
not be lost in thought maybe that goes without saying but we see both in the satipatana suta

107
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:52,720
and the anapanasati suta so these two discourses some of the primary discourses

108
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,559
that talk about mindfulness both of them include mindfulness of breathing and the

109
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:03,278
body before the mind

110
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:12,080
so with this quality of stepping back being able to see the thoughts without

111
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,159
getting lost into them or to see anything really the bodily

112
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:23,600
sensations or emotions or is this so being able to step back

113
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:30,720
in some kind of ways just a characteristic in general of how we can go a little bit deeper

114
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,919
with our meditation and how we can a little bit more steadiness

115
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:42,799
or solidity or something like this so this idea of knowing what is taking

116
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:49,440
place rather than just being immersed in it sometimes in guided meditation i talk

117
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:55,440
about to sit and know you're sitting there's a certain pulling back when we know that we're

118
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:03,760
sitting so there's a few ways that we can

119
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:10,800
look at i'm using this word mental activity mental state and i like to maybe like tease apart three

120
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:18,240
different aspects of this and the first one is not so common and

121
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,520
maybe it's a little bit debatable but i'll offer it and that is in the

122
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:31,118
satipatana suta that is the discourse on the establishments of mindfulness

123
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:37,200
there's some qualities of the mind that it says is good to notice helpful

124
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:43,040
to notice and one is whether the mind is surpassable

125
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,599
or not surpassable so the presence or absence of

126
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:55,839
surpassability if that's a word what does this mean so

127
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:00,880
there's some hints we might get if we look at the parallels that are preserved

128
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:08,560
in chinese for the satipatana suta and there the word gets translated as cultivated

129
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,960
or not cultivated so one way we might understand this are

130
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:22,960
probably a few ways but one way we might understand this is whether this is our usual state of mind

131
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:29,520
or a more mindful state of mind sometimes i think about this or refer to

132
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:35,200
this as it's more like street consciousness i'm just making up this term what i use

133
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:41,599
is kind of walking around not being mindful versus being mindful

134
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:48,800
we i don't know how to describe this but i think you know what i mean like we know when we're being mindful

135
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:54,160
when we're not being mindful we don't know of course we don't know

136
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,599
so not only that to know whether we're being mindful but to also know

137
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:06,000
is there a general feeling like oh yeah okay i recognize this mental state this is

138
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,599
what it feels like to be more settled

139
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:17,839
or this is what it feels like at the beginning of a meditation period and after i've been sitting for a little

140
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:24,720
while i believe it'll be different so is it surpassable or not surpassable

141
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,400
that is is this the edge of our meditation practice

142
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:41,599
or is it the beginning or is it ways we're in still in the process of getting settled

143
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:49,440
so is this familiar territory or new territory and this not so much that we have to

144
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,640
always be inquiring um do i have some attainment am i in

145
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,800
in some new place all the time but so it's not an obsession with our

146
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:08,800
progress or our development or how far we've gotten but it's just this recognizing where we

147
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,839
are so that we can

148
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:22,000
know what what to expect maybe what comes next or how we might if we know that there's

149
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,000
some it's possible to get deeper more settled i'm using these

150
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,520
words more settled deeper then we might know that oh yeah there's

151
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:40,560
can be a little bit more letting go that can happen there can be a little bit more quieting

152
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:46,079
that can happen so that we can walk this middle way

153
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,680
between not having this excessive expectations like but it's supposed to be a

154
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,359
particular way but also we don't want to have any disdain

155
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:04,720
for using reference points that we have with our practice or maybe even some aspirations

156
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:11,920
we might have for our practice so that might be the first aspect

157
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,640
of our mental activity or mental state is just this very gentle maybe

158
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:24,400
it's not even worth them highlighting but to acknowledge there's a gentle acknowledgement

159
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,760
of where we are in the territory in the landscape of

160
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,720
meditation so to speak a second way that we might notice

161
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:43,839
the interior experience the mental state is to

162
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:50,079
be aware of this state of mind or we could use the expression mental state

163
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:55,200
so not the content of the mind so much but the

164
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:04,160
quality of the mind the mood of the mind the state of the mind maybe the attitude

165
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,160
i know sometimes um i have this just general even even when not meditating i have

166
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:17,760
this state of mind like oh yeah i just can't quite think i think for whatever reason i don't know

167
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:24,320
why exactly maybe i'm tired or um feeling frazzled or something like this

168
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:31,440
and the mental acuity isn't quite there but just the general kind of state of the mind

169
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:38,480
and so to step back from the details and to notice the greater context or the

170
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:44,400
mellow in which our mental experiences happening

171
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:51,119
so mental states are subtle and diffuse they're not we can't

172
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:57,680
pinpoint them necessarily and say it's here exactly this it's more of a

173
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,680
vague kind of idea or experience

174
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:11,119
so this again in some ways can be an interesting exploration because we might

175
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:16,480
have this assumption that to be mindful of something means

176
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,319
that there's some precision there's some delineation

177
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:27,520
i'm mindful of this and it has edges and it's clear and it looks exactly like

178
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:34,800
this again this is implicit probably we don't have that explicit

179
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:42,000
but i'd like to suggest that we can also be mindful of things that are diffuse and vague

180
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,040
maybe foggy maybe they're just known in the periphery of our awareness not in

181
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:56,240
the center of our awareness a certain a different type of knowing if you will

182
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:04,000
and maybe we could use as an example that when you're looking at a window

183
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,920
and you realize that the window is reflecting back so you can see whatever is being

184
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,680
reflected in the window and you just shift your gaze or a little bit and you can also see

185
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:23,440
out the window so there's two different views that are possible and

186
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:31,040
to notice that it's light inside and dark outside for example

187
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,599
and that's why the window is reflecting so it's the noticing that it's light

188
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:44,000
often when you notice that it's not so much that you are pointing to one particular

189
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,200
experience or object but there's a knowing of light

190
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:55,680
i'm not sure if this is a good example but it's something like to explore

191
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,680
that there's can be a general feeling or mood or attitude

192
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:09,920
the classical teachings use words like the mind is constricted or expanded

193
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,040
that is scattered or concentrated

194
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:21,520
or colored with greed hatred or delusion or not colored with greed hatred and

195
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,680
delusion or fettered or unfettered

196
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:36,000
so maybe we might use language like appreciative or wanting more

197
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:45,520
or calm versus tense or light-hearted versus critical

198
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:52,160
or maybe i um an example i gave earlier feeling like i can't quite think

199
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:58,319
clearly i can't feel like i'm maybe there's just a feeling of not

200
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:04,160
a lot of mental acuity and sometimes there is some mental acuity and then even that whole

201
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:11,839
idea well what exactly is mental acuity so just pointing to the general feeling

202
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:19,200
of the mind and to recognize that these states of mind have a more pervasive and enduring quality

203
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:27,359
than just particular thoughts that is we might um have angry thoughts

204
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:34,319
that appear but they the angry thoughts might just arise and then pass away but there isn't a general mood of anger

205
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:42,319
there might just be a flicker of irritation in contrast when we're when we are in in

206
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:48,319
an angry mood they're just everything we feel just a little bit

207
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:56,160
cranky and irritated with everything this just general sense but we're not

208
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,520
really angry with everything because in the midst of that we might be having thoughts of

209
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:09,520
oh gee i wonder what's uh for lunch where are my glasses is it time for

210
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:15,839
me to get onto that zoom call you know we're having all kinds of completely neutral thoughts

211
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:21,760
even though there might be this general mood of anger that

212
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:29,520
might be colored by anger so it's possible to completely ignore

213
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:36,640
the mind state we don't have to pay attention to it of course but i think we all notice when we wake up on

214
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,160
the wrong side of the bed kind of gives us a general mood that it does have an

215
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:50,720
impact on us and often the more aware that we are of what's influencing our thinking

216
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,839
our behavior the more we can make decisions

217
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:02,240
about how authoritative we're going to take to be

218
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:08,640
our thoughts are we going to believe everything or are we just going to notice yeah i'm cranky right now

219
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:15,680
maybe if you're that half of the human population that hormone cycle and monthly

220
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,880
it might be noticing yeah okay having these types of thoughts right now they don't have to be

221
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:28,000
so authoritative i don't have to believe them or give them as much weight as i might at other times

222
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:33,839
when my hormones are in a different state

223
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:41,839
so that's the second way it's just this kind of vague mood or color of the mind

224
00:45:41,839 --> 00:45:48,400
state that tends to be a little bit uh maybe um

225
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,720
not obvious and enduring and then a

226
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,079
third aspect of the of what's in the mind we might call

227
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:06,960
generally mental activity or maybe more specifically thoughts but there's a

228
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:13,200
whole range of things that we fall under the word uh mental activity

229
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,720
or maybe even thoughts kind of lump them together but

230
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:24,960
there's a range in terms of how compelling they are how

231
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:31,599
lost we are in them and maybe the energy or the movement that's behind

232
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:40,079
them that we might get really might be a pressure really to think about them there's also a whole

233
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:46,720
range into terms of the wholesome or unwholesomeness

234
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:53,680
some things that are clearly if we're having a lot of thoughts of wanting to cause harm

235
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:00,079
there's it's very different of wishing to end the suffering of somebody thoughts

236
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:05,200
of how you might help them find greater peace and freedom

237
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:11,280
and then there's a whole range in the middle

238
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:18,560
so mental activities yet one more way that we can pay attention and this these are

239
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:25,040
associated with the best of the human experience and the worst of the human experience

240
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:32,559
and when unattended just like our mental state our mental activity can

241
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:38,319
have such a big impact on us

242
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:43,760
so i'm making this distinction between mental state and mental activity some could argue that

243
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:51,200
maybe we don't need to but i find it helpful in meditation practice to make this

244
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:58,319
distinction but notice that often the instruction is

245
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:05,040
to settle or let go or calm mental activity there isn't the instruction that we have

246
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:10,400
to get rid of eliminate mental activity

247
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:16,960
because meditation doesn't always require that we have this thought free mind a thought-free mind is

248
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:23,760
possible but that happens but usually in a retreat setting when the mind is

249
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:28,079
really settled really quiet

250
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:35,760
so it doesn't have to make the fact that there are thoughts doesn't have to be a problem we

251
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:41,359
can let go of this idea that somehow we have to be getting rid of our thoughts

252
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:49,520
and instead just how can we work with them if they're arising how can we disrupt some of their momentum how can

253
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,960
we disrupt some of the unwholesomeness if if they are there

254
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:03,680
and sometimes just simply paying attention to the experience of thinking

255
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:10,880
that is as i did in the guided meditation are these thoughts are they images or

256
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,400
are they sounds and just having that gentle inquiry

257
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,760
can be a way that takes some of the momentum away from the thoughts and that might be

258
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:31,838
sufficient to allow the thoughts to just arise and pass away like thoughts do

259
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:37,599
another way is to bring awareness to the sensations of the

260
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:44,079
body and when and or

261
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:53,200
any sensations that are pleasant there might be a feeling of ease or openness or

262
00:49:53,359 --> 00:50:02,000
some sense of well-being or okayness that's anchored in the body

263
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:08,960
so i'm talking about okayness and ease and one could argue that there those also

264
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:14,000
can be mental states and if one can rest in them by all means

265
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:19,559
we can do that but often it's easier to rest in physical

266
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:26,880
experiences of ease and well-being and certainly in the as i

267
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:32,079
mentioned in the anapanasati suta as well as the satipatanas mindfulness

268
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:37,119
of breathing or foundations of mindfulness

269
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:42,720
they is this instructions on mindfulness of the body and mindfulness

270
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:48,640
of breathing before the mind so we can always just go back to

271
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:54,079
mindfulness of the body or mindfulness of breathing

272
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:00,480
if we find that our thoughts have a lot of energy behind them or find that they're

273
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:06,160
unwholesome maybe we can disrupt them or undermine some of the

274
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:13,200
energy underneath them by just being with sensations of the body

275
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:23,838
especially if there's any some sensations that are associated with well-being or happiness or some contentment

276
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:32,880
so maybe just an emphasis um on rather than having to get rid of our thoughts we can just have a focus

277
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:39,599
on what's helpful and what's unhelpful what's wholesome and what's unwholesome

278
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:44,720
what's skillful and unskillful and maybe to steer the

279
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:50,079
thoughts steer some of the mental energy towards what might be more wholesome

280
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:57,680
more helpful so in order to do this there might be a

281
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:03,119
few tools we can use and the buddhahi uses a simile

282
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:10,318
which i appreciate that there might be a peg that is in some wood

283
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:16,880
but we might imagine that it's and the buddha says you might want to remove this peg

284
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,079
and in my mind i'm thinking those dowels like when you're using ikea furniture

285
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:29,599
that you're using to um join different uh pieces together so something like that

286
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:37,839
and this buddha simile says that if you want to replace a peg that is in wood that you use a

287
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:47,040
smaller peg and you can tap it out so if you if the dowel of the peg is

288
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:53,200
rotting and you want to replace it if you want to not have rotting peg

289
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:59,599
anymore you can replace it with one that is fresher and the word in the

290
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:05,680
similar uses to replace a coarse one use a finer one so if you were doing the

291
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:10,720
dowels with ikea furniture of course you would use a little bit of a smaller dough to

292
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:17,359
tap out using a hammer tap out the the coarser one maybe that was a

293
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:23,760
complicated explanation of what was obvious and didn't need that explanation but the point here

294
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:31,040
is to replace thoughts replace unwholesome

295
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:35,760
thoughts with more wholesome ones

296
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:43,839
so one might be to

297
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,440
chant the refuges and precepts if you find that your thoughts just feel like they

298
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:55,040
have this a lot of energy and there's a

299
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:01,440
you're feeling stuck with this compulsive going round and around not really going anywhere

300
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:08,800
let me change the refuges and precepts that can be uplifting and gives the mind something to do and

301
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:14,400
really can support a sense of openness and ease of course don't do it if it doesn't

302
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:18,558
support a sense of openness and ease

303
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:27,200
if you find that there are some thoughts of ill will revenge or wanting to

304
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:33,440
give somebody a piece of your mind or something like this something that i've done is chanting the

305
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,880
meta suit in my mind i memorized it and it was a great

306
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:46,079
support to use it as a tool to to be chanting the metasuta

307
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:52,880
and just the practice of memorizing it was really helpful so

308
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:58,559
i offer this as something that can be helpful to kind of replace some unwholesome thoughts

309
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:04,960
or if not chanting the mata suta then to just do some loving kindness

310
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:12,319
practice bring to mind the phrases of loving-kindness and to do them in a way that is um

311
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:16,799
easy and available and accessible

312
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:24,319
that is not towards the person for whom you're having some ill will but towards a

313
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:31,920
lovable being send some good will some benevolence to a lovable being

314
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:38,640
so those are some thoughts of some ways in which you might replace some

315
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:44,640
unwholesome thoughts associated with um ill will if you're finding that you're stuck with

316
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:49,839
some lustful thoughts some sensual desire that is

317
00:55:49,839 --> 00:55:58,000
just not helpful we can do meditation on body parts this is what

318
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:03,040
the buddha recommends for the monastics right to have a life of celibacy

319
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:10,240
and i can imagine it's not always easy to be celibate so help them and to help all of us if we're

320
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:19,440
having some thoughts that are unhelpful and unwise of sensual thoughts to think about body

321
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:25,280
parts so usually when we think about people's appearances we think about that as a whole

322
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:32,880
this person's attractive this person is attractive but be they become

323
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:40,319
less attractive if we consider their body parts for example

324
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:45,680
from somebody who's a model for

325
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:52,319
shampoo for example and has beautiful lustrous hair it becomes

326
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:57,839
less attractive if you imagine that it's chopped off and on your dining room

327
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:03,440
table it's the same hair but just to consider

328
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:11,440
it by itself kind of shifts our relationship to it so many of you may know that this is

329
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:18,559
practice of doing the 32 parts of the body it starts with head hairs body hairs

330
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:26,559
nails teeth skin flesh spleen phlegm spittle snot and urine and it continues

331
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:32,559
so right when you start considering all these things of a person then that really can shift your

332
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:41,520
relationship to them so this is another practice somebody might want to consider

333
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:47,680
something else that we might do rather than to replace our thoughts is just to say

334
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:55,040
you know i'm going to think about this later right now i'm meditating

335
00:57:55,040 --> 00:58:02,640
and it might need to have some energy behind it no i'm not going to do this right now

336
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:10,000
right now i'm going to meditate i'm going to bring my attention to the breath for example and just to say

337
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,119
later later not that we're never going to think about it

338
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:19,359
but just now is not the time

339
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:26,240
so now that's a the third way we can think about mental

340
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:32,880
activity and mental states is to notice our thoughts and then not so much that we have to get

341
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:39,520
rid of them but can we encourage thoughts that are wholesome and supportive

342
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:46,319
and one way to do that is to replace thoughts to use a tool and of course if it's

343
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:52,960
not helpful we don't use tools not to use it so these are things just to if we

344
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:58,559
find that we're stuck and we need something other than just returning to the breath

345
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:04,400
we need something other than just being with the body

346
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:11,520
so i just offer this as some ways to work with our interior

347
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:19,119
experience or mental experience to notice the mind state as well as to

348
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:27,920
notice where we are in our settling process in our meditation process as supports

349
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:34,480
that supports for more ease more freedom so that

350
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:40,640
can support our being present not only for ourselves but for others

351
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:47,680
so that our practice can be for the benefit of perhaps in one small way

352
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:58,640
for the benefit of all beings everywhere thank you
