1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:11,059
okay so let's go ahead and start nice to see everyone

2
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:19,619
so we have probably heard at some point that the Buddhist path is about letting

3
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:26,760
go and this is true but there is a lot packed into that little phrase

4
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:33,440
what are we letting go of what is the act of letting go so letting go is actually quite

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:40,160
multi-dimensional it's sometimes volitional and sometimes not

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:46,680
sometimes we need to go toward or into what we're aiming to let go of and

7
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,899
sometimes we need to pull back from it sometimes we actively engage and

8
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,180
sometimes we just watch so in the series this week

9
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,460
we're going to be exploring seven methods for letting go that are useful

10
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:09,420
on the path and all of these message methods hinge in some way on discernment you know what

11
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,860
is the best way to let go of this whatever's happening so that's just a brief taste and we'll

12
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,439
get into that more but for now let's go ahead and and start

13
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,840
sitting together so finding uh

14
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,119
a spot that's comfortable where you'll be able to sit for a half hour or so

15
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,840
just allowing yourself to settle in to your spot

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,079
if it's comfortable to do so you can close your eyes

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,439
and really allow your attention to come inward

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,380
just sensing the body sitting

19
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,300
maybe consciously settling back a little bit sometimes looking at a screen we can

20
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,700
lean forward so just settling back so that the

21
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,739
posture feels very upright if you're sitting

22
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:29,340
and relaxed allowing your spine to be

23
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,300
straight

24
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:43,440
maybe Beginning by sensing the place where you're sitting your seat

25
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,760
against the cushion or the chair or if you're lying down you're

26
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,540
a place where you're lying against the bed or couch

27
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,080
just allowing that to support you feeling the support of what's what

28
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,420
you're sitting on building you're in and ultimately the

29
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,360
Earth just holding us up

30
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,379
and then softening softening into the body so softening the

31
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:48,140
muscles of the face around the eyes around the mouth

32
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:57,560
the eyes themselves in the eye sockets letting those be soft

33
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,060
the jaw

34
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:16,129
the place where the spine meets the skull letting that open [Music]

35
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:20,120
so the neck can release

36
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:35,520
and down through the shoulders letting those naturally drop maybe the

37
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,620
shoulder blades slide down the back

38
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:49,639
sensing the openness of the chest

39
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,180
down into the belly area letting that be soft

40
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:21,660
maybe feeling the spine in the middle and letting both the belly and the

41
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:27,860
muscles of the low back fall away from the spine

42
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:41,719
softening through the hips down into the legs

43
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:50,599
and sensing that the hands and feet are relaxed and open

44
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:00,660
and all of this is an invitation to the body but of course if the body still has

45
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:10,940
tension or if there's some pain today that's fine let's find the body justice as it is

46
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:20,960
so just inviting some ease also in the mind

47
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:42,000
bringing the mind also into the present moment the sense of releasing

48
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,220
ideas about the past or concerns about what we need to do

49
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:54,720
after this or what might happen and being willing just to be here for

50
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,620
this time

51
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,740
to establishing mindfulness

52
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:35,060
and allowing the attention to naturally move to the sensations of breathing

53
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:42,960
often when the body is softened and the mind has been brought to the

54
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:51,500
present moment the clearest Sensations are in the breath coming in going out

55
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,319
just allowing that simple awareness

56
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,900
to come into the Forefront of attention

57
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:50,820
so the invitation in this sitting if you'd like is to do a very simple

58
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:57,720
practice that many of you will know that's called noting

59
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,800
so that means applying a simple gentle label to experience in the present

60
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:12,500
moment like breathing in or hearing

61
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,800
or if there are thoughts thinking or planning

62
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,360
and it's not anything that we think about we just go with the first label

63
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:31,459
and if a word doesn't come then you just skip that one and label the next one

64
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:40,140
and the practice is really to help the mind know what it's doing and what what's

65
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,880
going on and experience

66
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,060
foreign

67
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,800
and if the mind has wandered away into thinking

68
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:42,000
that's fine we just gently and note thinking

69
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,920
and then continue with what is whatever happens next after that

70
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:58,380
just gently be in touch with the normal flow of different experiences that we

71
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:00,560
have

72
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,839
can be helpful to keep the breath in mind as an anchor or

73
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:16,160
a stable presence

74
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:24,060
place to return to but with the noting practice we

75
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:30,899
acknowledge that there are other things sounds and Body Sensations and thoughts and such

76
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:38,880
and that's all part of the meditation foreign

77
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,880
just seeing what's in the mind and the body

78
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,700
will tend to have a stabilizing effect

79
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:59,179
we continue to note something that's difficult

80
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,740
it tends to ease that

81
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:10,160
may still be there but we're able to be with it

82
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:19,640
if we continue to note something that's already peaceful or happy

83
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:28,580
tends to stabilize it and increase the sense of nourishment that comes from

84
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:37,980
you this is the effect of gentle present moment seeing

85
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,820
foreign

86
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,640
foreign

87
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,020
foreign

88
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,919
foreign

89
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:13,039
as to what's going on in the general flow of experience

90
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:20,659
has there been any shift in the course of this it

91
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,620
perhaps an increase in wholesome qualities

92
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:40,380
sometimes people think oh no not what I've been seeing in my mind

93
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:46,919
but sometimes we forget that mindfulness is a wholesome quality

94
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:52,860
so to the degree that we've had that and noticed that the mind is

95
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:57,380
becoming more wholesome over this time

96
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:03,539
I'm just sensing how you feel now as we near the end of

97
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:09,440
the sit in the mind in the body

98
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:31,919
we may get the sense of the protectiveness protective quality of

99
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:39,120
mindfulness the way if we know what's happening

100
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:45,179
in our experience men were less likely to get caught up or

101
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:51,120
go down a rabbit hole or move in a Direction that's going to be

102
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,340
harmful for ourselves or others

103
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,919
how powerful it is just to know

104
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:09,659
and what a gift it is to the world to have some degree of awareness and

105
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:14,880
some ability to direct our attention [Music]

106
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,400
so simple and so powerful

107
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:29,179
so being happy with this blessing that we can offer through our attention

108
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,140
foreign

109
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,180
[Music]

110
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,919
so it's it's very common for people to

111
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:29,399
ask how they can let go of something Troublesome or when wholesome that they

112
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:34,620
have noticed how can I let go of anger how can I let

113
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:42,360
go of obsessive thinking and sometimes people seem to think that

114
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:48,840
the the teacher is going to just tell them you know turn the red knob a couple of

115
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:56,520
times counterclockwise and and that should do it but as we think as we know from doing

116
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:04,820
this practice it's not quite like that not only is there no exact formula

117
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:11,520
but having someone tell you is actually less effective than discovering it for

118
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:19,140
yourself but the practices were engaged in do lead to letting go

119
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:26,940
we might in fact we might distinguish between the practices that lead to letting go and the Letting Go itself

120
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:34,380
so it's more like our job is to do those practices without to the degree we can manage it

121
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:42,059
without so much expectation or attachment to results and then the Letting Go will take care of itself

122
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:49,919
and we also have to be a little bit careful about the language so letting go is not the same as getting rid of

123
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,799
you know our practice does lead to the ending or yes getting rid of Duca

124
00:31:55,799 --> 00:32:02,820
suffering or stress or struggle or discontent but letting go is not quite the same you

125
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:08,760
know in order to end dukha we might need to let go of a lot of things along the way

126
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:16,320
and it's not only what we let go of but what we let go into new things tend to open when we let go

127
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,360
of something so this week we'll be talking about

128
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:28,679
various actions we can do that lead to letting go and so the series is called

129
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:36,120
The Art of Letting Go the Buddha said that certain things are

130
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:42,840
to be let go in certain ways so imagine that you're trying to get a

131
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:49,020
container open the openness is the aim but you're going to have to do something for that to come

132
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:56,100
about if it's a glass jar then it's to be opened by twisting the cap

133
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:02,640
if it's an aluminum can twisting won't help but you can use a can opener

134
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:09,059
and if the container is made of fabric sewn together like a pillow then cutting

135
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:14,580
it will work or unzipping it if it has a zipper but you can't use a can opener on a

136
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:19,620
pillow so this is an analogy for the way that

137
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:25,159
certain unwholesome qualities of mind can be best released by certain methods

138
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:32,220
or you know certain instances of experiences can be let go of or the

139
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:39,179
attachment to them can let go let me Let Go by certain methods so in one teaching the Buddha talked

140
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:44,399
about seven ways to let go seven methods to open the mind and heart

141
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:50,519
and release various kinds of dukkha so we only have five days so we'll talk

142
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:58,080
about uh one or two of these seven per day and today we're starting with what's

143
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,960
called abandoning by seeing so the discourse actually uses the word

144
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:09,480
abandon sometimes that has a negative connotation for people because it's not

145
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:15,839
usually a positive word in English so we'll mostly say letting go but this word it's nice to know that this word

146
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:22,858
abandon is positive in Buddhist teaching it means and releasing the stickiness or the

147
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:30,540
attachment around something and when you abandon that then you feel Freer and lighter you can move more easily in a

148
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:38,280
sense so Letting Go by seeing has to do with

149
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:44,700
the directing of our attention there are some ways that we suffer that

150
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:52,020
can be eased by changing how we attend in some sense actually the the basis of

151
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:57,180
Dharma practice is our ability to at least to some degree direct our

152
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:04,140
attention if you couldn't do that you couldn't practice so for example you know right now you

153
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:09,380
can just try directing attention to your right hand

154
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:16,220
and now direct attention to your left ear

155
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:23,820
I think that's pretty effortless usually and somewhat possible to do deliberately

156
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,920
on the other hand when I started speaking again your attention naturally

157
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:34,079
went to my voice probably and you also know that if some part of

158
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:39,540
the body is painful it can capture our attention non-volitionally

159
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:47,220
so we don't have complete control but we have some ability to direct the attention and using that ability in a

160
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:53,040
way that helps our spiritual practice has partly to do with what we pay

161
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,260
attention to and partly to do with how we pay attention

162
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:04,440
so it's not actually that there are specific things that we should and should not attend to like a list I could

163
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:11,240
give you or do's and don'ts um instead the teachings are a little more subtle and they say that we should

164
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:17,160
wisely attend to things such that wholesome States increase in unwholesome

165
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:22,980
States decrease and similarly we should not attend to things such that unwholesome states

166
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:29,880
increase in wholesome States decrease right so unwholesome would mean that

167
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:37,560
there's an increase in greed hatred and delusion or various emotions and mind states that are associated with those

168
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:44,460
and wholesome is about the opposite mind states that are about non-green non-non-hatred non-delusion so things

169
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:51,300
like generosity love compassion wisdom patience integrity and if we're mindful

170
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:57,839
we can notice which of those sets is increasing or decreasing

171
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:02,880
so sometimes there are things that we just shouldn't put our attention on

172
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,280
because we're at this moment at least we're not able to find a way to be with

173
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,380
them without our mind going off track maybe every time you read an article

174
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:20,520
about a certain topic you become angry and then all you do is sit there and stew with the computer screen or you

175
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:26,880
start complaining to your partner across the room which probably affects their state of peace

176
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,980
so maybe it's better for you not to read articles like that you know just don't

177
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:39,119
put your attention there a more extreme case maybe would be someone who's in recovery from alcohol

178
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,820
addiction and such a person probably should not go into a bar it's better

179
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:50,400
just not to go there in our world there are many forces out

180
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,980
there that are trying to capture your attention it's not at all trivial to be

181
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:02,040
actively concerned about where your attention is going there's a whole science behind getting

182
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,640
you to look at things on an internet page for example and getting you to click on things

183
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,579
so we need to know about about this in our own mind and it's not something

184
00:38:14,579 --> 00:38:19,859
exactly that someone else can tell you precisely or abstractly you know here's

185
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:25,920
a list of what not to direct your attention to or what to direct your attention to because it might be

186
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:33,000
particular to your mix of conditions so far more important is to develop that discernment about whether wholesome or

187
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:39,300
unwholesome is increasing as we pay attention to something and then of course things are going to

188
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:44,640
shift as we practice mindfulness and get more aware of our own Tendencies it's

189
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:50,339
not like we're going to have a don't go there list forever eventually we would want to find a way to be with anything

190
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:56,720
such that our mind doesn't tend toward unwholesome States and may even increase the wholesome

191
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:02,339
and the teaching the teachings that we have suggest a lot of ways that we can

192
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:09,060
be with things in a skillful way and in the interest of time I won't go into lots and lots of those that's the

193
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:14,280
that's the whole of Dharma practice but we could just name one to be concrete

194
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:20,280
which is that we might bring in the wisdom of understanding and permanence

195
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,500
so whatever we're being with with attention we can remember also this is

196
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:31,020
temporary and in that case then the lion might not be so reactive it might not allow the

197
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:39,000
unwholesome states to increase and we might not grasp at something pleasant quite so vigorously if we

198
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,480
remember that it too will Decay and break

199
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,980
or similarly uh maybe something painful can be endured more easily without

200
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:57,180
sliding into grumbling or self-pity for me if we remember that it won't last

201
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:02,520
or we could use the understanding that all people have difficulties pain or

202
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:08,180
difficulty is actually something that unites us all as humans and so

203
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:13,740
compassion might come forth so there's a way even that wholesome states can increase

204
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:21,320
as we're behaving something difficult so one thing that this practice of

205
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:27,720
abandoning by seeing encourages I think is simplifying our relationship to

206
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:33,060
experience if we launch into a long story about what we're paying attention

207
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:38,180
to and especially a story about me or about what other people should be doing

208
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:43,560
or why they should be not doing something and we're very likely allowing

209
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:51,180
on wholesome states to increase all that mental proliferation especially when we have thoughts about ourself right

210
00:40:51,180 --> 00:41:00,780
so suppose you know suppose we hear a sound outside it's just a sound and we hear it but then we recognize it as our

211
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:07,560
neighbor's leaf blower and we remember a conversation that we had with them just last week where we pointed out that it's

212
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:13,740
disturbing when they use the leaf blower before 8 A.M and here it is it's only 7

213
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:19,980
42 a.m and they should not be doing that don't they know that I'm meditating is

214
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:25,920
their clock set wrong I'm gonna go tell them how terrible this is

215
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:32,420
or whatever the mind is doing and maybe you know maybe it will make sense to go say something to them later I don't know

216
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:38,880
but for sure In This Moment there's duka being generated in our own mind and can

217
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,320
we recognize that and you know maybe hear the sound in a different way

218
00:41:46,619 --> 00:41:52,380
or in contrast you know when we see something in a way that increases wholesome States it doesn't tend to

219
00:41:52,380 --> 00:42:00,000
spiral into a story about me you know we might be taking a walk and simply enjoying the scenery or silently Wishing

220
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,520
Well to the people and animals that we see or practicing with noticing the four

221
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:12,300
elements you know whatever it is that we're doing on our walk but this way of being it's just kind of simple and in

222
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:18,720
the present moment doesn't tend to generate those stories and anxieties about me

223
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:26,220
so abandoning by seeing means discernment about where a situation or experience is going is it going toward

224
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:33,180
or away from suffering and if we seem to be going toward more suffering then could we shift how we're

225
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:38,660
attending to that experience the suitors say that if we're very

226
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:44,400
diligent and conscientious about paying attention to things such that the Mind

227
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,460
avoids an unwholesome relationship and encourages a wholesome relationship

228
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:56,400
what will be let go is pretty amazing if we do that we will let go of

229
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:04,920
self-centeredness so that's worth doing so we're talking remember about the

230
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:10,619
practices that lead to letting go and seeing in a skillful way is one

231
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:16,079
thing that leads to letting go so letting go is an art form we don't we

232
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:22,920
don't exactly do the Letting Go part per se usually but we do have to be actively involved

233
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:28,440
in practicing if we want letting go to happen it's kind of like the way you can't

234
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,599
really set out to make a great painting instead you practice a lot and you just

235
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:41,339
keep doing it and then eventually something great might happen so with Dharma practice maybe the heart

236
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:47,940
will open maybe the line will be freed now just keep seeing in a skillful way

237
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:53,099
and something will happen so we're going to unfold all of this

238
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:59,040
more in the coming days this was kind of a general overview with a method that's

239
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:05,460
always useful it will be relevant in all the other methods and then we'll we'll talk in the coming days about some more

240
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:12,260
specific situations okay so take care
