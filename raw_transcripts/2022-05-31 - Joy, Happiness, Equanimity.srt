1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:08,399
welcome welcome again it's nice to see you all here

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:19,680
so tonight i'd like to start with a little story so just a brief little story that's in the vasudi manga

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,519
this is the a little bit later than the polycanon

4
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,840
and i'm embellishing this story so this isn't it uh verbatim

5
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,800
but it goes like this so imagine that you're in the desert and you don't

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:50,160
have any water and you have some distance to travel and it's pretty precarious

7
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,520
and then as you're traveling you come over a little rise into the distance you see like oh that looks like that might

8
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,000
be palm trees but you're not sure it might be a mirage

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,520
so you head that direction and you notice yeah okay it seems pretty

10
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,200
steady those palm trees are still there as you start walking you start

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,960
encountering people and they have wet hair and they're carrying bundles of wet

12
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,680
clothes so this gives you some encouragement like okay this is an oasis

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,400
that's just right over there and you get really excited having been in the desert and then

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:42,320
saying okay here's an oasis so you keep on walking you arrive

15
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,439
and it's beautiful there's this big

16
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,159
lake of this cool water

17
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,479
you feel so happy like oh it's here

18
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,560
plenty of water nice and cool here there's shade under the trees

19
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,840
then you drink the water you jump in the lake you get cleaned up

20
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,879
you get refreshed you get out

21
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:23,080
feeling really contented happy

22
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:32,080
and then you lie down in the shade of a tree and have a rest if you're not asleep

23
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,640
maybe you're just resting against the tree maybe you're not lying down but a certain amount of contentment that

24
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:46,239
arises this certain feeling of okay

25
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,200
not a lot of troubles but just happy to be there

26
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,159
so this desert crossing the desert without

27
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:07,120
water might sometimes feel like our practice our life

28
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:15,920
that there's this uh burdensome and difficult and not feeling nourished not feeling

29
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,480
like we have enough in this sense that we have to go

30
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:29,040
somewhere we have to go across this uh sandy

31
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,640
desert that's not so easy to walk on sand sometimes

32
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:42,159
there's this relentless heat and maybe you're even feeling a little bit lost not sure where you're going

33
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,640
and then this idea of glimpsing an oasis glimpsing oh there might be something

34
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,439
here that can be a support

35
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:05,360
that can be something that's nourishing and find some respite from the heat and from

36
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,720
this thirst maybe in our practice maybe this was

37
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,920
early in our practice recognizing that maybe mindfulness is a place that can

38
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,160
provide some benefit or provide some

39
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,919
nourishment in some kind of way but in the beginning we often just have this

40
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,638
glimpse of it and we don't necessarily trust it

41
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,160
but we have a glimpse enough that we're willing to keep on going

42
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,360
and then when we have seen others who are coming with the wet hair or with

43
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,919
bundles of wet clothes or something that's kind of like being inspired by maybe coming to a meditation center

44
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:55,919
maybe meditating with others and seeing oh there's others who

45
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:04,320
practice this way they seem happy you're relaxed or however or satisfied or

46
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,800
they have wet hair and at that moment that's what you're looking for is wet hair

47
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,000
when you're in the desert hot feeling like you're thirsty

48
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,160
so we see clues that aren't just that are just a bit more than these little glimpses that we might have with

49
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:29,120
mindfulness and there's a certain delight there's can be a certain uprising of

50
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,960
maybe this is for me too

51
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,639
and then when we arrive at the oasis i realize there's plenty of water plenty

52
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,479
of water there's this feeling of happiness like okay

53
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:53,280
okay here's i can stay here for a while and drink some of this water and feel

54
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,479
like i like supported and nourished by it

55
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:07,600
and then we also dive in the water we feel refreshed and there's something inside of us that starts to settle like oh okay

56
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,319
there's something here that's can be helpful for me

57
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,280
then we have this certain amount of contentment

58
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:24,560
often we think about this contentment arises because we got what we wanted we

59
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,039
wanted some water but i'd like to encourage us to think about

60
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,160
another way to interpret this is the contentment arises is because we are no

61
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,880
longer have this strong desire for water it's the ending

62
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,479
of the desire that wish for something different than what we're having

63
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:55,199
that allows us some contentment rather than just getting what we want

64
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:01,199
so often in our lives we do actually get what we want but have you noticed how it doesn't

65
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:08,080
really the satisfaction for that doesn't last very long we do get to sleep in sometimes we do

66
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,800
have good meals sometimes the weather is beautiful sometimes right we we do get these things that we want

67
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,919
but it never seems quite enough so the contentment is

68
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,919
not just because we got what we want but because there's the desire has been

69
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,840
abated the desire has been rested and there's more than one way

70
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:38,800
to let the desire quiet to let it soften

71
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:47,759
i'm going to talk a little bit more about this but still i want to kind of say something about this uh this story

72
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:56,800
after drinking the water diving in the water then this idea of like maybe leaning against one of these palm trees

73
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:04,080
and taking a rest maybe we're not sleeping but now just viewing and seeing what

74
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,800
else is happening at this oasis this recognition that nothing else needs

75
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:17,039
to be done right now we got here we have some water

76
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:24,319
presumably there's some food too or maybe we already had food with us and so there's no sense of urgency if

77
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,919
things have to be different no pushing or pulling kind of you know like pushing trying to

78
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:39,039
shove our experiences away or pulling trying to keep our experiences with us but just relaxed under the tree

79
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,600
and so from this place of relaxing underneath the tree we can see things differently

80
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,160
than if when we were feeling lost uh in the desert so literally we see things differently we

81
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,839
in the case of the story we see the water we see the palm trees

82
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,839
but we all have this experience too that when we're hungry and tired or

83
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,720
didn't sleep well or got bad news or whatever it might be then we see things a particular way

84
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,720
compared to when we feel content relaxed happy we see things a different

85
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,560
way in the case when we're a little bit grumpy

86
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,760
and because we haven't eaten or retired or whatever it might be

87
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,000
then maybe we tend to kind of like look at the negative side or have a little bit more contracted view

88
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,600
but when we're relaxed and feel content a certain amount of contentment

89
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,040
then this can be a little bit more open our view what we see

90
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:51,040
but we're noticing and not only that there can be a little bit more steadiness

91
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,480
this feeling like things are okay yeah okay the kids are really loud when

92
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,760
they're playing in the water over there but it's okay whereas you know if we were

93
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,639
in a little bit of a bad mood we might get really irritated about the kids playing in the water for example

94
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:17,519
so we could say that buddhist practice is about just this being able to see

95
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:24,160
things differently to create the conditions in which there can be this being able to see the bigger

96
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,360
picture and to have a certain amount of steadiness

97
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,399
to not feel like we're being buffeted or pushed around by our experiences but to

98
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:42,320
have a little bit more relaxed and open perspective and to see

99
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,480
what's arising and what's really happening as opposed to just being caught and consumed with the

100
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:55,200
difficulties and to no longer be have this enchantment of

101
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,880
or lost in stories about how things are or how we wish they

102
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,040
were but to actually see how they are

103
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,720
so in this story there's a certain amount of joy and happiness

104
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,640
that supports theorizing of this contentment that supports the arising of being able

105
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:28,320
to see clearly so joy and happiness are an integral part of practice but

106
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:33,760
they're not the point of practice we need them we need them for our life

107
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,959
but they're also a support for practice partly because they help create the

108
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:46,480
conditions in which there can be a certain amount of relaxation a certain amount of openness

109
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:53,040
so that we can see a little bit bigger so our spiritual path isn't only about

110
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:59,120
having great experiences our meditation practice isn't only about having [Applause]

111
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:06,880
wonderful meditative experiences we all know that these experiences

112
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,399
cannot be sources of lasting happiness they can bring pleasure and there can be

113
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,680
happiness but they're not sources of lasting happiness

114
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:25,440
in contrast being able to see things clearly can be a source of lasting happiness

115
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:33,120
when we start to see how things really are and to put down the

116
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,800
stories we have or the busyness in the mind that we have that

117
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,240
prevents us from seeing

118
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,519
so this seeing the bigger picture with a certain amount of steadiness

119
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:56,240
we could call this equanimity and the poly word is upeka

120
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:03,440
and etymologically we could say that upeka means to

121
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,360
be look upon and one way uh one reason why i kind of

122
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,839
like this way of understanding is look upon is to highlight that it's

123
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,760
different than look away it's look upon

124
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:29,360
because sometimes equanimity people think like well it's a certain amount of indifference or detachment or

125
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,800
coolness or indifference or something like that and

126
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:41,040
i would say no that's more about looking away but equanimity

127
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,320
is born out of this joy and happiness and contentment is not the only way to

128
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:52,959
get to equanimity it's one way and it's about to look upon

129
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:59,600
to seeing the big picture not just our uh what we're concerned with at that

130
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,720
moment but to be able to see what other people are doing what's

131
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:11,600
happening with them to see that not only is maybe the children are

132
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,120
really loud that are plain but also it's comfortable underneath this tree

133
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:22,240
and maybe i feel a little bit hot but i'm not thirsty

134
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,760
so we don't get stuck on the things that are unpleasant or stuck on the things that are pleasant

135
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,920
but be able to see the whole range there's perfectly neutral things happening unpleasant things happening and pleasant

136
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,160
things happening so in some ways

137
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:47,040
we might imagine i talked about it uh this contentment is kind of like leaning against the tree but

138
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:54,880
maybe it's more about being at the top of a hill and then you can see you know further you can see a little bit wider

139
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:01,920
maybe that's a better way to imagine kind of this idea of lupaka

140
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,959
and so upeka has this awareness of whatever is happening it's connected to what's happening

141
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:16,079
seeing what's happening but it also has this inner balance

142
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,519
this steadiness this um

143
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,360
being connected to the foundation in some ways we can think of it like how uh

144
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,519
sailboats have achieved i'm not a sailor i know that uh

145
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:40,079
jim is a sailor here but a keel my understanding is this you know this blade i'll call it a

146
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:47,279
blade that's underneath the boat that helps it to not tip over when the winds are pushing on it

147
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:54,639
so equanimity in some ways is like having this keel that allows us to experience the winds

148
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,839
the winds are still there but we're not going to tip over with them helps keep the

149
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,600
boat upright so it's this steadiness of mind and

150
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,880
steadiness of heart in the face of still being connected

151
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,519
with whatever's happening all of our inner and our

152
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,360
outer experiences so not only what we see

153
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:29,839
out there is the way i was describing it but also what we see in here

154
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:35,199
our experiences maybe

155
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:42,160
we notice that uh some impatience with equine you're like okay it's just

156
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,680
impatience we don't have to add a story on i'm a bad person i've been practicing all these years i

157
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:52,399
shouldn't be impatient or something like that

158
00:16:53,279 --> 00:17:00,639
and so with equanimity it makes our lives easier of course it does

159
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,319
not being pushed around so much by our experiences

160
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,319
whether our experiences include the news cycle or difficulties with finances or

161
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,678
partners or or our inner life feelings of

162
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,600
confusion or despair or racing thoughts troubling thoughts

163
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:32,000
whatever it might be but equanimity allows us to

164
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:38,799
not stumble around or be pushed around by these

165
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:47,039
recently i had to take some medication that um for a little while that i knew

166
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:53,280
was going to make me feel a little bit off i'll just use this vague word off

167
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:59,919
because that's what it felt like and and somehow just like having this

168
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,760
knowledge like okay i don't feel so great but it's just because i'm taking this

169
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,120
medication just that kind of a knowledge allowed me to like okay that's just how

170
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,480
it is right now so sometimes just being able to see the

171
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,160
bigger picture seeing that oh things there's conditions for what's arising

172
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,840
there are reasons for what's arising and sometimes having that

173
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:34,240
can help us to have this steadiness of equanimity so in this ways equanimity helps us to

174
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:40,559
see bigger but seeing bigger also helps us to understand the conditionality

175
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:46,400
maybe right no guarantees but we can see like oh okay

176
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:53,120
of course i feel this way i didn't sleep well last night i'm taking this medication whatever it might

177
00:18:53,120 --> 00:19:02,320
be so equanimity also helps us to see more

178
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:07,600
deeply into our experience with this steadiness

179
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,720
of heart the steadiness of mind in some way can

180
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:19,440
equanimity can be like a tripod that allows a telescope or

181
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,160
it could be like a microscope that allows us to see more deeply something that we wouldn't be able to see just

182
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:32,240
with our regular busyness or regular

183
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,559
ways of interacting with our environment

184
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,760
and so what do we see when we see things more deeply

185
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:53,840
we see that they're changing there's so many different ways we can talk about changing there's can be the

186
00:19:53,919 --> 00:20:01,440
all these different time scales right things that have the nature to arise have the nature to pass away

187
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:07,480
things that have the nature to be born have the nature to die

188
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,559
but also there can be when the mind is really quiet and really settled we can start to

189
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,760
see that there's a little bit even a flickering of our experiences

190
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,880
the things aren't as steady and solid as we

191
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,960
might imagine them to be so economically helps us to see this

192
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,240
quality of our experiences

193
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:42,640
unlike this sense of like something being stuck and

194
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:50,159
impenetrable or um unable to really

195
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,399
have a way in which there's any flexibility

196
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:02,360
instead of that we can see oh yeah okay this isn't as

197
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,280
as i thought it was this uncomfortable experience in my knee

198
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:16,159
when i'm sitting maybe that's not just this pain but with equinemen we

199
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:22,320
can see we have the patience we have the capacity to just be with the experience

200
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:28,080
a little bit longer and to see the flickering quality of it

201
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:36,200
we also can see that our experiences are not inherently satisfying

202
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:43,039
to be sure there are pleasant experiences and there are unpleasant experiences but

203
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:50,400
we still haven't quite found you know that experience that's going to be a source of lasting happiness

204
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,799
and with seeing more deeply we start to see even those things that we were pretty sure were going to make

205
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:03,600
our life better make things happy or satisfying in some way

206
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:11,320
we start to see oh yeah even those aren't as satisfying

207
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,600
and we find that even though we might be chasing after things thinking that this this is going

208
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,520
to be the thing that's going to make me happy

209
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:28,400
with some steadiness we can see oh yeah actually it doesn't make sense to

210
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,440
hold on to this thing this that promise of this

211
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:38,158
experience promise of this object

212
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,519
because it's not as steady as i thought it was

213
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:55,440
then naturally our relationship to those objects or those experiences shift it's just

214
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:02,240
natural we don't have to make it happen and we just are not holding on so tightly

215
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,799
and then when we're not holding on so tightly there can be more ease

216
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,799
more freedom more spaciousness

217
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:25,520
and as we do this and as we kind of explore our experiences with a mind and a heart that has some equanimity we

218
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,200
start to understand our experiences more fully and we start to see that

219
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,679
every time there's a liking of something that means there's a disliking of

220
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:44,320
something else it's just impossible to not have one without the other

221
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,679
and so we start to see like oh yeah chasing after our preferences

222
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:55,840
just really highlights everything that isn't our preference instead of just having a little bit more

223
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:02,480
open and relaxed view about things and not having to be so

224
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,760
much spending our energy and our time trying to just surround ourselves exclusively

225
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,799
with our preferences

226
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,880
so this not chasing after our preferences seeing

227
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,799
things aren't quite as satisfying seeing that there are changes as i said creates this

228
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:31,760
um conditions in which there can't be just letting go this kind of little bit more spaciousness

229
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:38,200
that that alone allows the mind to be even more unagitated

230
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:45,360
and liberation freedom is an unagitated state

231
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:52,080
so in this way spending some time with equanimity cultivating equanimity

232
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,080
recognizing equanimity is a way in which we are

233
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,720
kind of like the goals and the means get uh similar

234
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:12,880
if freedom is unagitated an equanimity isn't type of unagitation

235
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:19,360
we can see where equanimity is uh helps support the type of letting go

236
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:25,600
that supports liberation as well as itself being an experience

237
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:30,640
that's similar to a liberation in the same family

238
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:40,480
so sometimes we might think as a concept equanimity just might seem unappealing

239
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:46,960
some people say that they don't really want equanimity it sounds boring

240
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:56,320
it sounds flat instead they might want this juiciness this gusto this of the joy and we want

241
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:04,480
the excitement of experience or we might this passionate involvement with life

242
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,919
and it might sound like sometimes when we hear this word equanimity it might feel

243
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:17,360
like there's a sort of disconnection or not caring

244
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:23,520
and to be sure indifference sometimes masquerades

245
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:30,000
as equanimity and there will be times in our practice

246
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,679
when we slide into indifference when we kind of disconnect from our

247
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:41,760
experience and we're feeling a little bit shut down and maybe we're feeling a little bit

248
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:47,679
cold and removed that's natural this happens but that's

249
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,360
not equanimity that's more indifference and in some ways i might

250
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,279
say that it's important for us to have that experience to have this indifference arise

251
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:05,279
to recognize oh this is what it feels like to be disconnected

252
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:10,480
this is what it feels like when there's might be

253
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:16,799
some less agitation but there's also a sense of

254
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,919
disconnection or not caring or

255
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:28,080
um this is arises when there's a little bit of aversion has arisen

256
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:35,039
so sometimes we might even call this a version but it can feel we might have this idea that that's what equanimity is

257
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:42,399
but instead equanimity has this sense of aliveness the sense of vitality

258
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:50,880
the sense of connection that's with some openness and spaciousness and warmth

259
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:58,159
but another reason why equanimity might not sound like it's something

260
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:06,000
we're so interested in is because we might come to believe that

261
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,399
this there might be this uh underlying belief that

262
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:20,640
we're not so sure why would our life be like if we didn't have lots of drama

263
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,080
in some way or other the drama of getting rid of some

264
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,279
difficulty or the drama of defending the one sense of

265
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:37,679
self or the drama of bolstering one sense of self make sure we look good to everybody

266
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:44,880
i'm using this word drama sometimes it is dramatic sometimes it's really subtle also

267
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:51,679
these types of things but maybe we're a little bit unsure what would be there

268
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:56,720
if we didn't have this maybe i could use the word busyness this

269
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,919
busyness of trying to get rid of the difficulty solve some problem

270
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,360
trying to bolster this self make make ourselves look good

271
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:13,360
so that might be another reason why there might be some hesitation or

272
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:20,320
maybe this idea that i don't know equanimity just doesn't sound so interesting

273
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:29,120
but i would like to say that what we all really want

274
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,480
is some stable sense of well-being

275
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,840
that can't be shaken by circumstances

276
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:51,120
and this arises when we have some equanimity

277
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:59,120
in some ways like the mind with equanimity is like a mountain that it's remains there even when there's

278
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,720
tornadoes or hurricanes or these types of things

279
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:11,200
we we might have this idea we want to be happy and certainly we do

280
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,200
but what were um

281
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:25,360
there's this way in which always like searching for happiness because things that we think are going to be happy turn

282
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:31,039
out make us happy turn out not to make us happy so then there's this relentless search

283
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:36,880
which might be subtle but can you imagine what it might be

284
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:43,440
like to have like this really radical contentment

285
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,440
it's okay everything's okay i don't have to go

286
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:56,960
fix that it's not perfect i don't have to fix it i don't have to hold on to this it's enjoyable but i'll be okay if

287
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:03,039
it goes i think this is so much what human beings are really looking for maybe a

288
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:09,519
place to rest a place to feel safe

289
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:18,480
and a place that in order to have that it can't be susceptible to whatever is happening in

290
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:25,120
our the world or whatever is happening in our inner life

291
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:34,720
and i like this uh this there's these few lines from

292
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,399
um the awakening poem from cebutti tsubuti was a monk at the time of the

293
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:46,399
buddha and it was the tradition sometimes to

294
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:53,000
capture these uh poems about when people had awakening experiences

295
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:01,639
and the way that he describes this reminds me of this idea of equanimity

296
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,960
so that's part of his awakening versus go like it goes like this

297
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,200
my little hut is roofed and pleasant

298
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,840
sheltered from the wind so rain sky

299
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:27,279
as you please i don't know i there's something very

300
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:34,640
sweet about this i kind of like this that he's roofed that he has his refuge he

301
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,880
has this shelter and sheltered from the wind

302
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:47,600
i think many of us have heard about these eight worldly winds these things that push us around

303
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,200
praise and blame fame and disrepute gain in laws

304
00:32:53,200 --> 00:33:00,080
and pleasure and pain and of course we only want one half of all of those

305
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,840
dyads but every life gets both

306
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:12,880
both halves of those we get all eight there's nobody that's immune to this

307
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:20,399
but sabuti talks about in his hat that's roofed and pleasant sheltered from the wind

308
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:28,080
so rain sky or sky rain as you please so he's not trying to

309
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:35,679
make things be a particular way he's maybe it'll be sunny maybe it'll be

310
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:44,559
rainy it's okay but having the confidence that we can meet whatever might arise

311
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:54,640
so equanimity i talked about the way that in this little story that i started with

312
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:00,799
is you know feeling like you're in the desert and then having the happiness and or the joy of seeing the oasis the

313
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:07,919
happiness of having actually drunk from the the oasis so that's one way

314
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:14,878
in which we can have some equanimity is to keep practicing

315
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:20,480
when we encounter joy and happiness there are moments that may not be large

316
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,679
giant moments but there are some moments of joy and happiness that do arise in

317
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,919
our life yay the the weather's going to be great

318
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:38,079
yay the newspaper arrived on time in the morning so if you

319
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,919
for those of us who still read newspapers i have them delivered

320
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:49,520
i was just visiting my mom recently and she does i have to say i just love this to go out

321
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:56,960
in the morning and get the paper i myself don't but i just love this at my mom's house

322
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:05,200
so to keep practicing when we encounter joy and happiness often we kind of like stop practicing

323
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:11,280
there's a way we might like stop being mindful or we might i feel like we don't need to practice

324
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,520
anymore because maybe in some ways we feel like oh we arrived we got what we wanted we have this joy we have this

325
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,640
happiness and that's the purpose of practice so i'm gonna stop

326
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:28,560
but there's an encouragement can we stay mindful can we still be with the

327
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:35,680
experience not abandon ourselves with it experience it fully

328
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:44,240
but not forget practice in a relaxed easy gentle way

329
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:51,040
and this is a natural progression to go from joy which tends to have a little more energetic feeling

330
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:57,760
happiness which has a little more subtle contented feeling and then to equanimity

331
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:04,240
doesn't always happen but that's one way in so just an encouragement to continue

332
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,599
practicing when you are experiencing joy and happiness

333
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,079
another way is to actually really cultivate this i might

334
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:23,040
say this inner reservoir of well-being this well this reservoir that can be a

335
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:27,838
resource no matter what the circumstances are

336
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:36,640
so to spend time really noticing when there is any sense of well-being

337
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:43,920
that feeling that we get when we are generous to others that feeling when we are

338
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,280
letting those people close to us know how much we care about them

339
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:55,839
when we're doing loving-kindness practice maybe there's a way in which the heart opens

340
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,240
so really tuning into these experiences

341
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:07,920
when they do arise maybe they're not that often maybe they're very often whatever it is for

342
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,440
you tuning in it's just so that the

343
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:21,119
heart and the mind remember that there is this capacity for this

344
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,359
feeling of well-being and so there's less fear about loss for

345
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:35,720
example if there's a part of us that understands where deep happiness arises

346
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,119
deep happiness arises from this letting go from this opening from this

347
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:48,560
relaxing sometimes it arises from

348
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:55,599
an external experience that brings pleasure but pleasure is not the same as happiness

349
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:02,000
and it's really would behoove us to kind of like explore that how are they related but distinct

350
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:08,960
not all happiness comes out of pleasure but the more we are able to dip into

351
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:16,880
this sense of well-being the less likely we are to be thrown off by balance thrown off balance by

352
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:23,280
these eight worldly winds play praise and blame

353
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:30,280
gain and loss pleasure and pain fame and disrepute

354
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,880
and so one more way that there's a number of ways we can work with equanimity

355
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,480
another way is to just practice with some of the wisdom

356
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:53,119
practices and to remind ourselves

357
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,200
yeah things do change

358
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:06,240
the nature of things to not be inherently satisfying

359
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:14,320
partly because they change and so to borrow some of this wisdom

360
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:21,359
that we know from other experiences that allows us to maybe relax and soften

361
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:27,280
a little bit and to open so that then we can sit on the hill

362
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:34,160
and to see a little bit bigger have a bigger vista bigger view

363
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:46,400
maybe you can imagine that you don't know how to swim

364
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,440
and you fall in the water and

365
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:57,680
and then you thrash around right if you don't know how to swim of course you do you feel like okay i gotta get out to

366
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,400
you but if you have a life jacket on

367
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:11,838
then you can paddle around and find your way you don't have this fear of you know drowning

368
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:20,560
so cultivating well-being or borrowing some wisdom

369
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:27,040
can be a way which can be some life jackets that can help us to have some equanimity

370
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:34,839
and no matter whether the water is cold or hot or or just right

371
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:45,440
so joy happiness well-being help create the conditions for equanimity to arise

372
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,640
equanimity is sometimes said to be a higher happiness

373
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:57,200
because it allows for this steadiness and the face of whatever is happening

374
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:05,119
and then equanimity creates the conditions for letting go which is said to be the highest

375
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,838
happiness

376
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,800
so without this idea that this oppressive idea that we have to be happy all the time and

377
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,640
that we have to have joy in all these things just in this talk i wanted to connect

378
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,079
this idea of happiness and equanimity

379
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,880
and then equanimity to liberation so this idea that happiness is an

380
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,000
integral part of our path we can cultivate we can

381
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:46,480
roll around in it there's no reason not to allow ourselves to be nourished by it

382
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:53,520
and then stick with it with the practice and allow it to turn into a certain contentment which

383
00:41:53,520 --> 00:42:00,800
can be a support for equanimity that equanimity can be a support for letting go

384
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:07,440
which is support for greater and greater freedom which of course is happiness

385
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,280
so here we go kind of like this circle so

386
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,520
with that i'd like to wish you all a wonderful memorial day

387
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:25,200
i didn't connect this necessarily to memorial day but it occurred to me that oh today is

388
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,720
memorial day so wishing you all a wonderful evening

389
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,960
thank you
