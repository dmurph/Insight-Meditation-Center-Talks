1
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:09,040
so warm greetings on this Monday morning

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,839
and welcome and

3
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,960
to introduce the

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,320
meditation if uh there were Anthropologist from Mars who came to

5
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:36,600
this earth of ours to study the people here and the question was what are they

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:44,520
committed to what is it they really like to do and there are times that and places

7
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,600
where they would say people are committed to

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:57,879
anger hostility they really like to be hostile and some of them are hostile

9
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:03,320
towards others some some of them are hostile to

10
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,400
themselves but then they would find that there are some people who are committed

11
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,040
to being not hostile

12
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,840
nonharming and that there's a remarkable difference between the

13
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:30,759
two one seems to be always tense the other seems to be calm

14
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,680
the others first doesn't seem to be oriented towards helping

15
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,920
others except for those maybe who are closest to them and the other seems to be oriented

16
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,079
towards helping others when they meditate the one

17
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:55,320
dedicated towards hostility uh finds that sometimes even

18
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,399
the meditation strengthens the hostility

19
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:08,160
the one dedicated to nonhostility to non-harming seems to be able to be

20
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:15,360
resilient to be to manage to be calm in the midst of the storms of

21
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,560
life so in Dharma practice Dharma in meditation and

22
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,560
Buddhism the reliable commitment that uh or

23
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,560
love that uh the basis of doing medit ation practice maybe the basis of Buddhism in

24
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:40,680
general is non-harming nonhostility and this is considered to be universally

25
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,239
applicable if you want to have a commitment that's deeper than just a commitment to mindfulness deeper than

26
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:54,120
commitment to meditation it's a commitment to non-harming to nonhostility

27
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,440
and um and so to meditate with that kind of commitment to have that be the

28
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:06,319
foundation for meditation the foundation that's maybe

29
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,799
more provides much more benefit to us than having mindfulness or awareness be

30
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:18,480
the foundation unless the two are considered

31
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:26,080
Inseparable and um so in this meditation that we do

32
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,840
today if you would like see if you can have it be a

33
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,799
commitment to nonhostility to non-harming and some of that will be

34
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,239
towards anybody you think about where you meditate and some of it will be towards

35
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:50,080
yourself to What's Happening Here you might still have impulses to hostility

36
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,040
to anger to criticism to

37
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,360
irritation to aversion to what's happening those things might still

38
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,640
happen but don't be committed to them don't believe in their value during the

39
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,760
for the purpose of meditation instead believe in the value of meeting it with awareness that's

40
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:23,000
non-hostile meeting it with non-harming it doesn't condone it it's

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,880
not an acceptance of it it's a peaceful nonparticipation in it letting it be

42
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:39,240
letting it the Flames of anger the Flames of hostility um blow themselves out because

43
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,560
they're not being fed so a constant coming back to

44
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:51,800
nonhostility non-harming and uh maybe with every

45
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:57,319
breath so to assume a meditation

46
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,759
posture and perhaps if it's possible a posture

47
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:15,120
that manifests a degree of confidence kind of a confident

48
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:30,000
presence lowering the Gaze if it's comfortable to to close

49
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,240
your

50
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,479
eyes and as if you're holding a little wounded bird

51
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:46,960
that you don't want to harm in any kind of way very gently holding it CED in your

52
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,520
hands kind of a gentleness than which you would maybe hold the

53
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:01,479
baby gently take a few long slow deep breaths

54
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,400
maybe 2/3

55
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,440
full and gently relax on the

56
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
exhale

57
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:54,639
and letting your breathing return to normal and continue with a very light

58
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,080
touch nonassertive touch as you

59
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,720
exhale relax different parts of your

60
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
body

61
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:44,919
the attitude of nonhostility non-harming has no

62
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:52,240
weight has no force in it it's gentle

63
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,319
light but like the air it pervades can pervade

64
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
everything

65
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:13,680
each Act of relaxing in the body is a

66
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,759
fusion of

67
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
nonharming

68
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,039
and then settling into the experience of the body

69
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
breathing

70
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,880
with every breath

71
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:18,000
remembering the possibility of nonharming non

72
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,920
aversion towards whatever

73
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:34,959
arises a non aversion which is a nonp

74
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,639
participation with whatever is harmful or hostile or

75
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
aversive

76
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
for

77
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
for

78
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
for

79
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
e

80
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
for

81
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
for

82
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
e

83
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

84
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
e

85
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
for

86
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
for

87
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
e

88
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
for

89
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:09,798
whatever is [Music] known through

90
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:14,000
mindfulness let it be known

91
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,279
peacefully let it be known with an attitude of non-harming

92
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:34,760
anything with the care and the gentleness with which you

93
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:43,039
might hold a newborn baby softly

94
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:53,320
lightly everything that you know let it be known with non

95
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
aversion

96
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
for

97
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
for

98
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

99
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

100
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
for

101
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
for

102
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

103
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
e

104
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:08,279
to meditate with an attitude of nonharming

105
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:13,960
non aversion means that whatever we

106
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:21,039
know whatever is known Here and Now is

107
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,960
safe safe from our hostility our

108
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
aversion

109
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:41,278
and perhaps whatever is known in feeling

110
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,159
safe it can

111
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
relax

112
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
e

113
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
e

114
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
e

115
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

116
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
for

117
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
e

118
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:09,039
and then as we come to the end of the

119
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:17,759
sitting to consider whether this emphasis on

120
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:25,120
non-harming touched anything important inside of

121
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:34,278
you is there a value in you

122
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:46,840
within a feeling a knowing a

123
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:51,398
wisdom regarding

124
00:26:53,919 --> 00:27:00,320
non-harming and to now to imagine that that wisdom that

125
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:07,679
knowing that attitude can radiate from you spread

126
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:15,240
from you out into the world as a

127
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:21,760
gentle suffusion of Peace of

128
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:30,320
kindness of nonharming so that others might get a

129
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:39,200
taste of the power of non aversion

130
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,518
nonviolence of

131
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:54,279
Peace may all beings live without experiencing

132
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:02,240
hostility may all beings be free of

133
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:10,559
harm may all beings live in

134
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:20,159
peace may all beings be freed from all

135
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:26,440
forces of harm and suffering may they be

136
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
free

137
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:43,000
and may our commitment to this peace help support peace wide far and

138
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:53,979
[Music]

139
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
wide

140
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,000
thank

141
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
you

142
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:15,120
so good day on this Monday and the topic for this week is to

143
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:22,519
continue with um what's usually called the 10 protectors the 10 supports

144
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:29,960
supporting things that the 10 helps helping help 10

145
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:38,480
helpers and um today's uh protector is love of the Dharma Dharma

146
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,960
love and um but then uh Dharma what does that

147
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:49,880
mean here and I'd like to propose that the essential meaning of Dharma more

148
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:56,158
than the teachings of the Buddha more than anything else is

149
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,720
nonharming and so a love of non-harming that's the

150
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,799
protector and um and it seems uh

151
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:12,960
wonderful coincidence that uh to emphasize this on

152
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:21,519
the day that the United States we celebrated it as indigenous people day and uh people who have suffered

153
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:28,159
hundreds of years of harm by the European colonialists who came and

154
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:34,559
settlers who came and uh sometimes uh committed tremendous genocide even right

155
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:42,240
here in California and um the uh and also uh the

156
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:49,600
Monday after this weekend were the horrendous violence in um Palestine and

157
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:56,159
Israel and the Gaza Strip the and

158
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:03,480
um and we have so much experience as human beings with the endless cycles of

159
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:10,080
violence and the endless cycles of hate when two people hate each

160
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,600
other uh then the only solution is to kill each

161
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,639
other the cycles of hate just escalate and then it just continues on

162
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:27,720
and on the cycles of this going on and I think the 60 years of more now 70 years

163
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:34,519
800 years of violence in Palestine uh has shown the cycles that

164
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:41,399
violence doesn't provide a solution and the horrendous damage here

165
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:47,760
in the to the Native Americans in United States and

166
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:55,159
Canada much of uh Latin America um has also showed how much harm

167
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:00,720
can be done that gets Contin for Generations after the big harm has been

168
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:08,240
caused there has to be another way and the way that the Buddha taught

169
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:15,720
is non-harming a radical commitment to non-harming so the love of the Dharma is

170
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:22,080
not a love of the teachings that that's possible it's not a love of the practice

171
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:27,440
but love of the very Foundation of what the teachings and the practice is about

172
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:34,000
and that is a life of non-harming and um the four noble truths

173
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:41,200
are all about not harming uh where the word for harm is Dua or usually

174
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,399
translated into English as suffering and in the for Noble Truth it usually applied to

175
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:52,840
oneself that uh we're looking at suffering within ourselves the causes of

176
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:59,679
suffering that we have within ourselves and the ending of that we could say the harm we experience from

177
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:07,039
ourselves and the ending of causing that harm and um U but also the four noble

178
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:12,440
truths can be equally there's no pronouns in the way the four noble truths are taught so they apply equally

179
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:19,720
to the world around us uh to uh understand the suffering the causes and

180
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:25,878
to meet it with an attitude a way a way of life which is non-harm a life of

181
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:32,919
non-harming that's you know primarily represented by living the eighth full path and

182
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:38,878
non-harming is embedded in the whole eful path uh

183
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:48,158
Enterprise and so the love of the Dharma and a k dama Kama and uh in the

184
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:54,398
description of it it's talks about um one of the protectors is loving the

185
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:01,640
Dharma um having um uh uh having affect

186
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:08,040
affectionate conversations I love this idea affectionate conversations with others

187
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:17,640
right after loving loving the Dharma and being inspired by the practice and the way of

188
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:26,000
life here the word for practice is Abid uh dma Dharma and the and the um

189
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,720
way of life is via which for the monastics is the life of

190
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:38,160
restraint but for the non- monastics the life of restraining from uh

191
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:44,480
harming and so this um and if we want to have a

192
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,119
love uh which is um reliable Universal

193
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:55,800
profound the love of non-harming it doesn't mean naive

194
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:03,240
nonviolence it means that uh that it doesn't mean that we are being hostile to our own

195
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:11,400
Tendencies to hostility and hate but we're not we're not committing ourselves to the impulses of hate and hostility

196
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:19,800
we're not imp committing ourselves to the impulse of violence but rather um we allow those to

197
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:25,960
surface we see them clearly and we see them with non-harming we see them with

198
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:33,119
non particip ation we see them uh without believing them or without

199
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:39,720
believing we have to act on them it's a hard belief to come by because uh

200
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:45,480
sometimes um uh you know it seems like we have to harm others in order to protect

201
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:51,200
ourselves the Buddha said something similar for monastics he said that a

202
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:59,160
monastic um is allowed to strike out against an attacker for the purposes of

203
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:06,480
escaping provided that the monastic has um has Good Will has

204
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,400
meta so it's not just only have you know just just sit there quietly and have

205
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:18,800
non-harming uh there is a time and place to act but how that act is done is

206
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,480
mostly not to harm other people but for the for the purposes of avoiding getting

207
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,640
hurt exactly how that applies in all kinds of situations in life is as you

208
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:38,240
know that's the the um the huge question but um uh non-harming is not naive it's

209
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:45,960
not just allowing other people to roll over us but uh it's profound to uh to

210
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:52,800
live a life of non-harming there are many people in this world who have never experience

211
00:37:52,800 --> 00:38:00,280
safety and to feel that someone is really safe for them and this part of the value of monastic life is that it's

212
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:06,640
a public life that kind of gives the impression to people who see monastics that this is someone who's not going to

213
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:12,480
harm and um is not going to live with aggression and anger and hostility and

214
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,800
so there's tends to be a relaxing around monastics uh that uh they can walk in

215
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:23,680
all kinds of circumstances in life and people receive them because uh they

216
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:29,440
clearly represent a very radically different way of living than many people have

217
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:37,400
experienced but uh um but what I want to emphasize today is the love part that uh

218
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:44,760
there can be a delight and inspiration an affection for uh the

219
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:50,920
Dharma for practice that um that uh um can be a

220
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:57,400
great love the um it can be for some people who like to an morphies these

221
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:05,040
things can be our beloved can be something that we really take up and one of the interesting ideas

222
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:11,400
about uh the Beloved the the loving the Dharma some people will love the Dharma

223
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:17,960
more than anyone else and uh and then our partners might get upset like what I'm second best to

224
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:26,160
the Dharma the um the then you might explain to them it works this way that uh with a

225
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:32,480
with having the Dharma at the center there's uh love of the

226
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:40,200
Dharma um our ability to love others increases so yes they're kind of second

227
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:46,680
maybe to uh to your commitment to the Dharma to practice to

228
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:55,119
non-harming but um but if you didn't have the Dharma your love for them would not be as clear or Pure or open or rich

229
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:02,440
or forgiving or something and uh so they get more

230
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:08,800
love if you they allow you to love the Dharma even more and so everyone

231
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:15,040
benefits and uh in the end I don't think that it makes that you know there's no

232
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:22,839
conflict and um but this ability to have this heartfelt warmth and and uh and

233
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:28,040
affection uh for something that's really profound and have it be the most

234
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:34,000
reliable form of love and affection because it's as I keep saying

235
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,200
maybe it's a universal nonharming that's the essence that's what the Dharma is and everything

236
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:48,839
else about the Dharma the the all the different teachings are attempts to kind of expand on that basic premise or to

237
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:54,560
find uh to really study how this applies or how this is supported in all kinds of

238
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:00,280
different ways not hard harming ourselves not not harming others and to

239
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:06,359
be a liberated person to be an enlightened person means uh it's an

240
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:14,960
ethical transformation it means becoming a person who is incapable of intentionally

241
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:21,520
wanting to harm anybody else a someone who's fully awakened is incapable of

242
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:26,880
killing incapable of stealing and so

243
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,760
the incapable of wanting to cause harm so if you're committed to feel like you

244
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:38,520
need to be committed to the possibility of harming others then maybe the Dharma

245
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:45,119
is not going to be so good for you because if you really take it all the way um you're going to be incapable of

246
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:52,000
doing that but on the way there there is a love of the Dharma the love of

247
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,880
non-harming and even if um it's even if you decide that it's necessary to engage

248
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:03,200
in in something that's harmful and violence as a form of self- protection

249
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:09,839
or something um uh don't let that um

250
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:17,319
diminish the possibility of really loving non-harming and in this teaching uh the

251
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:22,920
love of the Dharma is a protector so it protects you from the

252
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:28,760
forces of harm from within yourself and from others living a life of Peace

253
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:35,480
living a peaceful life of not harming people tend and the operating word is tend tend to relate to us very

254
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:41,040
differently than if we walk around angry and I've known people who are very

255
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,280
aversive who just feel that everyone else is just mean all the time without

256
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:52,319
them realizing that people are kind of challenged and maybe aversive to them

257
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:59,800
because of the aversive way in which they show up and so it's a self fulfilling uh kind of prediction people

258
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:08,880
are mean so I show up being mean and then of course they're mean back if we show up non-harming loving

259
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,599
caring attentive to others um they respond in a different way to

260
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:21,960
us so um so to uh love the our um as a way of

261
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:27,200
being safe making ourselves safe and as a way of protecting others

262
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:33,200
from ourselves and as a way of protecting our

263
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:39,720
Dharma practice it's difficult to remember to practice it's difficult to be in to stay

264
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:45,760
inspired in the Dharma and this way of life but to to keep coming back to that

265
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,760
inspiration maybe from these affectionate conversations we can have about the Dharma this is a way of

266
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:59,000
keeping the momentum the inspiration the motivation here to really uh

267
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,720
refine uh the tremendous value

268
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:13,119
and wisdom of living a life a sophisticated life of non-harming not a naive

269
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:20,319
life nonharming loving that so

270
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:27,000
um so it makes me very happy

271
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:34,040
to to consider this wonderful idea of loving the Dharma of living a life of

272
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:40,720
love and a love that I hope is contagious and that spreads uh peaceful

273
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:47,920
away throughout this world that needs it desperately because

274
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:54,960
violence I hope the violence soon enough is going to be seen as a

275
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:01,079
completely counterproductive to the welfare and happiness of

276
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:07,920
everyone thank you
