1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,279
so hello hello and welcome everyone to happy hour lovely to be with you

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:13,840
so many different time zones of joining us in this moment in time

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,960
so so for today's practice i'd like to invite us to um to consider

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:28,080
this quote that i heard um earlier um and i don't know who's attributed to

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,079
actually i didn't get the chance to search but uh um here it is

6
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,680
comparison is the enemy of contentment

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,920
comparison is the enemy of contentment

8
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:53,120
so it's such a profound statement and i want to unpack it a little bit

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,840
and and also maybe add some more to it

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,280
there's so many different ways that perhaps comparison shows up can show up

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,840
in our lives and um and

12
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:17,040
i just as i said that i just i remembered um gail has this um teaching

13
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,320
where where he comes with artificial flower or something holds it up and says

14
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,520
you know there's a flower and then um oh yes here's here's a similar one

15
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,040
that just came through um theodore roosevelt comparison is the enemy of joy

16
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,479
i like that too that's a good one comparison is the enemy of joy yeah joy

17
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:47,119
and contentment both so i'll talk about both how's that this is great thanks for sending that to me uh steve great

18
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,159
so so gail has this teaching where he shows up with an um

19
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,399
or the flower sometimes and and uh and the sense of oh yeah the flower the

20
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,920
flower is perfect in and of itself the flower is perfect enough itself and then

21
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,080
brings up another one like a taller one or you know and then a shorter one then then there's a sense of like the mind

22
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:17,440
wants to compare or this is bigger smaller not good enough whereas in and of itself it's perfectness of itself

23
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,200
given the causes and conditions of of this flower so so

24
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:30,640
comparison can show up in different ways sometimes we compare experiences like oh this

25
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,879
soup i'm having right now no the soup this this restaurant you know this route i'm having at this restaurant this other

26
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:45,120
soup was better and you're always seeking in your mind the perfect soup the best tasting soup so you're never

27
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,440
satisfied because oh yeah the one that you had which actually you're misremembering the taste of it maybe

28
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:58,959
you're remembering to be better than it actually was because i don't know you were hungry or you were with the i don't

29
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:05,599
know with the group of friends so the soup tasted really good but that's what's the best

30
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,200
soup this just not good enough the one i'm having right now or at the restaurant or making

31
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:18,720
it at home like oh it's just like not good enough not good enough so there's a sense of depletion there's a

32
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,200
sense of lack of contentment or lack of joy lack of appreciation instead of

33
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,239
appreciating what is appreciating what is here what is right now all the

34
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:36,159
possibilities in this soup in this moment in this amazing

35
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:43,920
soup that this is showing up just as it is um and sometimes that soup is us

36
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,080
in terms of comparison we compare ourselves oh that other person who is

37
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:57,040
i don't know taller and more famous or more successful or has more friends or more

38
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:04,720
likes on facebook i don't know just i'm being silly but but use your own uh imagination you know has published

39
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,319
more or written more i don't know is more this xx

40
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,400
comparing ourselves to some other hypothetical person so some other person

41
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,400
whereas um each and one of each one of us

42
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,919
has um unique occasions and unique opportunities

43
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:37,040
unique obstacles unique challenges i mean buddhism unique causes and conditions we

44
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,560
all have unique causes and conditions so to say oh

45
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,440
well i wasn't born as this other person i mean they are who they are and i am what i am so how can i

46
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,840
how can i be inspired so instead of comparison i want to

47
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,039
bring in the concept of inspiration how can i be inspired

48
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:08,960
to be the most ethical most kind most giving

49
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,520
person i can be to to fulfill my potential and to remember that life

50
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,320
isn't about getting we think it's about getting life really is it isn't about getting

51
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,800
it's about giving it's about giving to others our life

52
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:34,720
the best way we can live and satisfy to to the best way we can um

53
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,560
fulfill our potential is to become a gift it become a gift

54
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,360
not just to ourselves but to become a gift unto the world so let that be

55
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,120
your measure of of contentment measure of joy or measure

56
00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:01,039
of aspiration is what i want to bring in tonight so comparison is the enemy of joy as

57
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,800
theodore roosevelt roosevelt said or as i misremembered it comparison is

58
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:14,479
the enemy of contentment and again so many different dimensions of this both in our experiences and also

59
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:21,120
with with things with events with friends with just experiences in life if we're

60
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:29,600
comparing always and the other dimension is whether we're comparing ourselves this person who is me to some idealized

61
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,800
version the wrong way of really framing it

62
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,680
if we are bringing comparison maybe it's a way of aspiration oh how can i be how can i be the the best

63
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,960
the kindest i don't know just the sense of values really thinking of the values

64
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,720
not in the way of again getting but giving so that's the frame

65
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,960
i want to set up tonight for our practice and um

66
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,880
with the guided meditation um as always we'll start by setting

67
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:11,039
settling in the body with the breath and then i'll bring some invitations

68
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,400
some invitations and settling in the moment and just a set of can settle

69
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,840
settling into contentment and joy in the present moment um some gentle invitations so that's the

70
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:31,800
plan for tonight all right let's let's sit together friends

71
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:40,080
so so arriving arriving in our seat

72
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,280
arriving here in this moment in time

73
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:57,120
in this moment that has never been and will never be like this experienced

74
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:04,319
through this mind through this heart of ours unique mind and heart

75
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:15,759
ah landing landing embracing as if we're opening our arms wide

76
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:24,160
wide wide opening the arms of our hearts wide wide

77
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,160
wide

78
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:36,320
to embrace fully embrace the world as it shows up right now in this body in

79
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:43,719
this moment this justice

80
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,720
not comparing just relishing even if there is discomfort

81
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,240
present and the body or mind can we

82
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,480
open up to this evanescent

83
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,080
impermanent

84
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,760
moment in time

85
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:29,279
and then letting the body relax letting the body land

86
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,440
knees release here

87
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:24,800
releasing thoughts that arise it's okay thoughts will arise

88
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,309
smilingly releasing them in this moment just returning [Music]

89
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:38,959
to the awareness of the breath the body this moment in time expansively

90
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:44,720
letting the body feet to feel

91
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:51,320
to appreciate being connected to the ground to the earth

92
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,880
just this breath not comparing this breath to the previous one

93
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,839
or vying for the next one just this breath this perfection of this breath right here

94
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:39,760
this moment fresh amazing miraculous never left before

95
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:45,600
such an odd to even have awareness to be alive

96
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:52,639
so amazing just to be alive have consciousness

97
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,800
of this breath these sensations

98
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,040
uh

99
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:39,760
do just this breath the amazing miracle of

100
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:47,639
this breath in this moment the entirety of the breath

101
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,680
breathed in breathed out

102
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,720
the miracle of this breath reverberating through the whole body

103
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,839
softening relaxing very outbreath every in-breath

104
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,440
enlightening enlivening enlivening

105
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:41,320
bringing more energy and more lightness

106
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:48,240
now is it possible as we're sitting being breathed

107
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:57,559
to open up the gentle appreciation gentle appreciation

108
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,919
for whatever is arising in the sphere of experience right now

109
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,799
most prominently the breath sensations

110
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,960
of the body

111
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,799
sense of aliveness

112
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,960
maybe any pleasantness in the body

113
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,720
maybe there's pleasantness associated with the breath being breathed

114
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,840
gently swaying

115
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:57,840
maybe the mind realizes wow this moment is actually pretty good

116
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:21,280
maybe there's more contentment available in this moment more joy than i realized

117
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:27,039
if i just open up ever so gently not pushing

118
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:34,400
just opening up to the possibility appreciating

119
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,559
the joys the delights pleasantness

120
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:47,679
comforts even if coexisting with discomfort

121
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,840
there's an overall spaciousness that's here

122
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:04,720
the mind here not in the past or future just here

123
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,280
just gently enjoying the breath

124
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,519
and if there's a part of your mind your heart

125
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:45,919
that's negating that's fighting against this moment it's okay include that part

126
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:52,480
include that part don't throw it away shut it out exile it that part is

127
00:21:52,480 --> 00:22:01,120
included also if there is any no part left out

128
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,600
no part left out

129
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:58,240
and as we expand opening up to appreciation in this moment whatever is arising

130
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:07,960
pleasant or unpleasant included appreciating it just as it is

131
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,919
can we open up also

132
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,640
expanding from this moment in time

133
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,640
expanding temporarily

134
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:33,520
not with our thoughts not thinking but the possibility of all the causes and

135
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,799
conditions that have brought us to this moment

136
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:46,000
in our lives so many of them gifts

137
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:51,600
good fortune we consider

138
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,039
in our earthly terms some of them challenges

139
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:09,679
all of which uniquely all these occasions so many that perhaps are neutral just

140
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:19,840
the zeitgeist we're born in paris upbringing culture

141
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:27,520
random coincidences just all these causes and conditions so

142
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:34,799
many events that have made this a unique being that

143
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,880
is me possible in this moment

144
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,679
product of so many causes and conditions

145
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:58,840
not independent of them how unlikely how

146
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:05,039
unlikely was it is it that we're even born

147
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:14,760
that this being was us should even be here

148
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,799
we appreciate the

149
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,080
mystery the intertwined the inter-being

150
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:53,720
interconnected mystery of our existence

151
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:06,320
and let there not be a comparison with other amazing mysteries of existence as

152
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,159
other beings with their causes and conditions

153
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:20,720
appreciating them wow all these miracles all these points of light

154
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:29,440
and this is mine this light this line of mine

155
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,158
how can i be the brightest i can be

156
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:44,400
not comparing to others but aspiring [Music] to shine brightly for the sake of myself

157
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,919
and the sake of others to give to give my light

158
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:56,480
my warmth my goodness

159
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,840
and this brief flash of lightning that is

160
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,840
my life and the cosmic scale

161
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:19,039
to aspire aspire not compare but aspire

162
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:26,960
to shine brightly according to whatever [Music] my values

163
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:36,399
the goodness of my values my north star is

164
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,039
let that be the measure

165
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:49,840
of the brightness of my light my goodness

166
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,360
shining in the world

167
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,559
just being embodied not thinking just being embodied letting yourself be

168
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:43,600
breathed letting these reflections be breathed in

169
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:51,360
and out without so much thought but dropped into the body

170
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,360
resonating

171
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:06,760
maybe only a residue remains just being breathed

172
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,120
the buddha said be a light unto yourself

173
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:30,440
can we be a light can we be a light unto ourselves and others

174
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,399
making measure of giving

175
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:04,080
making giving the measure of our success not getting

176
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,720
shining our light shining our light of goodness

177
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,079
maybe meta gladness good will for others

178
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,320
generosity

179
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,480
kindness

180
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,839
compassion

181
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:58,480
gladness joy letting our joy shine brightly

182
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,480
for the sake of ourselves and the world what a beautiful gift to give to

183
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:10,320
ourselves and others our joy

184
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,240
our contentment

185
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,240
and for the last moments of this practice period

186
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,720
honoring appreciating ourselves for having showed up

187
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,160
if any judgments are arising for what happened or did not happen

188
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,520
can we be kind can we be generous to ourselves or having done our best

189
00:35:53,520 --> 00:36:00,079
given all the causes and conditions it's like this it had to be like this

190
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:07,440
or it would have been different appreciating ourselves

191
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:14,800
and the gift of causes and conditions for being here now together practicing

192
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,720
in sangha and offering the light of our goodness

193
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:26,320
to all beings everywhere may all beings everywhere including

194
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:33,040
ourselves be safe be happy

195
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:40,440
have health and ease may all beings

196
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,040
be free

197
00:36:53,359 --> 00:37:00,719
thank you everyone thank you for your practice [Music]

198
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:09,200
so we have some time for any reflections that might have come up any questions

199
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:15,680
comments aha moments complaints it's all welcome

200
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:22,560
what did you notice this this practice tonight and around the

201
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:29,680
theme of comparison is the enemy of joy slash contentment

202
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:38,640
both internally and externally radha please

203
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:49,599
hi hi um so i'm outside and i was um

204
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:55,839
there's a lot of wildlife where i am um there's a lot of bad life

205
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:03,599
um and i was kind of feeling into um like i could hear the bees and the birds

206
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,839
and um yeah just kind of feeling how like

207
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:15,520
they each have their own kind of unique song and call when they don't

208
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:20,960
you know it's like the bee knows what it needs to do it knows what its work is and it doesn't

209
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:27,520
you know i saw a meme once where that was like um it was like a bunch of animals and it

210
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,920
was like you know an elephant doesn't try to be a dolphin or something like that

211
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,960
um yeah so like there's kind of the sense of relief that

212
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,839
comes with that kind of self-acceptance is what i was

213
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:51,119
feeling lovely beautiful thank you so much for sharing that it's it's oh it

214
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,640
touches me so deeply your experience and and the metaphors that have come to you

215
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:03,280
why did you say an elephant doesn't try to be a i forget the animal's ears but one animal doesn't try to be another an

216
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:10,000
elephant doesn't try to be a bird it's just that radical self-acceptance absolutely and

217
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,359
appreciating the the bird you are or the frog you are or

218
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:22,400
whatever lovely or the puppy you just it's so that the radical sex self-acceptance of yeah beautiful thank

219
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:29,040
you radha lovely lovely thank you lovely yeah claire

220
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,240
please thank you

221
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:40,000
i think they're two things claire there's a lot of noise in the background

222
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,640
that's strange um

223
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:53,520
i'm not hearing it because i've got a headset on maybe if i if i take the headset off does that help

224
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,880
yeah there's a lot of echo

225
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:04,140
[Laughter]

226
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:16,000
i haven't loved uh like a lot of church music

227
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:22,880
are you hearing something another voice yeah i don't have anything else going on here

228
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,269
so [Music]

229
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:45,119
okay all right thanks claire yeah so any other reflections any other

230
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,480
before we go to groups and practice together

231
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:56,800
you can also type in chat if you type only to me i won't read your name so it

232
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:03,440
will be private just read your reflection if you type it to everyone i'll read your name and your reflection

233
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:09,760
yeah such beautiful reflection so far love that

234
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:18,560
yeah beautiful here's another one after a particularly mindless incident

235
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:25,280
yesterday mortifying and very upsetting the idea that given causes and conditions it

236
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,920
could not have been otherwise is soothing it's difficult to accept such a self if

237
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,680
one doesn't feel deserving of it but i'm working on that as well yeah

238
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:44,079
thank you for that reflection yeah yeah

239
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:51,520
yeah so many causes and conditions and it's such a combination right we

240
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:57,599
it's um and this is the i think the beauty of of

241
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,200
this the dependent origination which is one way to see the causes and conditions

242
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:09,040
actually causing conditions is is the superset of dependent origination teaching

243
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:14,720
which is so many cause and conditions coming together giving rise

244
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:22,160
um and and accepting that if things could have been different they would have been just brings freedom and of course one of

245
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:29,760
those and then usually actually people ask at this time well well so how about volition well yes volition is one of

246
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,880
those causes and conditions that we put in place and we make it more likely that

247
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,960
we behave more mindfully or more kindly you know

248
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:47,040
it's all of those are set into place it's not like everything is on on our shoulders i will behave this way it's

249
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:52,079
all causes and conditions another reflection may we all have

250
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:59,599
people in our lives to acknowledge and celebrate our special gifts and skills along with us yes may it be so

251
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:05,040
so i'd like to invite us now to turn to practice together and and

252
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,680
started to give more invitation more instructions as to how to be in small groups as people have said

253
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:18,240
it brings more of a sense of safety so so let me just say a couple of words

254
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:23,440
about groups before i set them up so so you'll be in about in groups of

255
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:30,240
roughly size three depending on where the chips fall could be two to four and the invitation is

256
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:36,079
that what you have practiced now silently with your eyes closed

257
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:42,319
here are these wayfarers like you these travelers now you get to

258
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:49,119
connect if you wish it's a very sacred beautiful opportunity to connect it's

259
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,400
not just oh go talk amongst yourselves peoples oh yes honoring honoring

260
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:00,480
yourself honoring each other just for a few minutes and sharing as little or as much as you

261
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:08,319
wish about your practice and holding witness that's a big part of it it's about giving it's not about impressing

262
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:14,880
not about educating it's about offering if you wish um what has come up for you

263
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:21,520
as to support you and others as a gift and to hold present to hold presents

264
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,920
for them also witness them see their beauty just as one reflections that see

265
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,839
their special gifts special cause and conditions to see that so this is really the opportunity

266
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:42,079
of the groups and please speak from your own experience not comment or manage or

267
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:47,440
other people's experience asking questions

268
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,839
but yeah and not serving as a facilitator either just staying with your own

269
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:59,440
experience and honoring others maybe they offer their silence maybe that's what they need to offer

270
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:06,480
tonight and that's okay too and um you can start with alphabetically if

271
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:13,680
you wish um and uh maybe we'll do spiral so each

272
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:20,480
person will say in nugget instead of doing a long monologue which is sometimes we do just share one nugget

273
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:27,200
one thought of what came up if you have like five nuggets just share one the other person next person in the alphabet

274
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:33,839
first name will share another nugget if they wish or they say pass and then the next person and they will come to you

275
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:38,880
i'm just gonna go around a few times this way just call creating going around

276
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,000
to see what happens so so i will create the breakout rooms

277
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:51,359
now with um here we go

278
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:57,680
okay so in aim here we go okay i'm going to open them take care of yourselves

279
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:04,720
and each other in kindness okay welcome back everyone

280
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:11,280
uh the rooms are closed everybody's back we've got just a couple of minutes for any

281
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:17,760
reflections like see two hands just shut up okay richard what's up

282
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:24,160
i i understand what you say by comparison and sense of like i used to

283
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:29,760
be better or other people have more than me that kind of thing but there's also the kind of reframing

284
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:36,079
of there are a lot people have a lot of people have it a lot worse than me

285
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:43,040
and and uh or there are a lot of people in my both right now which is a really

286
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:49,440
powerful there's a lot of people in my what right now in my boat i mean who who share the

287
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:57,839
same whatever that service is you know that really sort of like depersonalizes things right right

288
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:03,599
yeah yeah so so your question is what about that yeah yeah

289
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:10,480
so it really depends it depends how the spirit in which that is taken because sometimes if we just get

290
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:17,599
into the um comparison game it if you go like oh gosh

291
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:23,119
like wow lucky me i'm not i'm not them right

292
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:28,720
sometimes it can be pity sometimes it can be like not very helpful you just

293
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:35,040
just don't go there but what you're saying is slightly different the sense of common humanity oh it's kind of

294
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:42,079
opening the heart so i'm not quite sure if that's comparison it's just a little bit of appreciating

295
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:47,599
the challenges that other people have so maybe that's how i would put it a little bit

296
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:53,599
yeah thanks richard excellent question neil please

297
00:47:53,599 --> 00:48:00,240
so how do you like enjoy physical pain right which yeah

298
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:09,200
right i mean you know be grateful for the current moment if it is dominated by physical pain yeah yeah yeah yeah

299
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:15,119
that's a very good question so i think the crux of it is this it's the

300
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:20,880
domin dominated or perceiving it to be dominated i think

301
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:28,240
pain can sometimes limit our minds and having had plenty of pain can limit our mind to think that that's

302
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:35,520
the only thing there is that the experience is dominated by pain so what i'm inviting you and i

303
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:41,520
was inviting you gently um to open up to and a little bit here

304
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:49,200
this again this meditation isn't quite focused on it primarily but that there is so much more present the pain can be

305
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,960
here also but there could be so much more presence so appreciating the panoply of

306
00:48:54,960 --> 00:49:01,440
everything there is so that's what i'm going to invite you when there is pain present in the body back pain like

307
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,680
intense pain see if there's more there's more spaciousness around it that can hold it

308
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:14,160
all so that the mind doesn't get tight around just just that that's my invitation for you to explore neil

309
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:20,079
thank you thank you and this is our last oh i think we're out of time okay quick

310
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,200
if you can make this quick

311
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:30,960
just just curious about how to work things out with comparison

312
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:37,599
lines because i think that i i'm just like so many comparison mind

313
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:44,400
about instead of appreciating the process where i am at my in this time

314
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:50,240
and i'm just comparing the other person oh he will be here and here and here it just

315
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:56,640
makes me suffer yeah so i so it's good that you see that comparison is making you suffer and your

316
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:04,079
the question is like how do i work with it i think part of what i've shared all evening or if not all any but this hour

317
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:09,280
is about ways to just not not go there bring the mind back bring the mind back

318
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:15,520
and if your mind is really used to comparison getting into that game it's going to be like mindfulness like come

319
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:21,680
back sweetie come back mind just don't go there sweetie consider the perspective cause of condition so it

320
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:29,359
just has to be reoriented reoriented reoriented until it becomes the the proclivity of your mind so not even

321
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:35,280
in the meditation just in real life in real life exactly but yeah exactly
