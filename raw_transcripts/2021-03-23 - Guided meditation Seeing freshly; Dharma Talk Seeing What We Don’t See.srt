1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,200
okay so why don't we go ahead and get started welcome

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,679
to the monday evening sid and dharma talk with the insight meditation center i'm

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,920
kim allen and i'm delighted to be here with you this evening

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,439
so why don't we go ahead and get started with the sit so finding a posture that's

5
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,879
upright also relaxed

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,719
sitting in position sitting posture so you can feel your seat against the

7
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:57,680
chair or the cushion or the bench and your legs or your feet against the

8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,680
floor so there's a sense of the stable foundation

9
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,840
on which you're resting really feeling the stability of where

10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,560
you're sitting and if you're comfortable doing so you

11
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:25,360
can close your eyes just gently allowing the eyes to close

12
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:39,920
so that the attention comes inward you're feeling the body from the inside

13
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:47,119
perhaps on the next out breath softening any

14
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,640
obvious areas of tension you can also shift your body

15
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,680
back and forth a little bit or forward and back to find

16
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:08,319
a central point where you feel like you're balanced

17
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:14,800
on the place where you're sitting so there's not very much effort to hold

18
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:23,840
yourself vertical if you're sitting vertically

19
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,760
and then it can be helpful at the beginning of a sit to just consciously

20
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,879
go through the body and inviting ease and softening

21
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:48,959
what can be softened especially at the end of the day when we may be carrying some tensions

22
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:56,400
from our activities of the day from what we needed to do to to get here

23
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:04,879
to the sit so softening the muscles of the face

24
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,400
the forehead around the eyes the jaw

25
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:19,840
just letting the expression on the face be soft and easeful

26
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:30,159
softening the eyes and the eye sockets they tend to get a little tight when

27
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,690
we've been looking at the computer screen [Music]

28
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,519
even releasing any tension from inside the head

29
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:57,200
maybe right behind the eyes from focusing the mind thinking

30
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,439
just allowing that to release if it will just inviting that

31
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,439
down the neck into the shoulder area

32
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:29,280
softening the shoulder joints letting the shoulders naturally drop

33
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,840
so the shoulder blades slide down the

34
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
back

35
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:56,880
relaxing down the arms and hands

36
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:04,000
and down into the chest area the heart lungs front back

37
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,039
sides of the ribcage

38
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,699
releasing the diaphragm [Music]

39
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,650
and then all down through the belly area just letting go of any obvious tension

40
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,770
[Music]

41
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:45,120
there and i like to simultaneously invite some ease in the muscles of the low back

42
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:52,160
so it's if what's on both sides of the spine is falling away to the front and to the

43
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,479
back

44
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:10,560
down into the hip joints softening a little further into the seat

45
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,400
and down into the legs releasing any bracing

46
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:26,000
softening the knee joints ankle joints all the way to the feet

47
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:40,479
so we've invited ease throughout the whole body i'm just returning attention to the

48
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:49,840
sense of sitting the whole body sitting

49
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:08,469
and orienting our mind toward meditation [Music]

50
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:17,840
intending to stay present

51
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:28,000
not with the idea that it will be 100 mindfulness

52
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:45,840
or just carrying the interest the intention of being with our experience

53
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:59,840
allowing the mind to gently rest on the sensations of breathing

54
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,599
it may be that we've done breath meditation a lot or

55
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:17,280
feel like we must by now know everything about our breath

56
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:31,599
but i'd like to encourage a sense of freshness newness

57
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,760
every breath is unique what would it be like to sit with the

58
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:45,360
breath and not know already what the breath is like

59
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:55,839
bringing some curiosity and openness

60
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,040
as we settle in further it can be helpful to notice

61
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,079
something about how the mind is now

62
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,760
is it generally a little dull tired

63
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:10,320
the end of the day is a bit restless and agitated

64
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:18,160
is there a dominant mood or emotion [Music] going on in the mind or the heart right

65
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:29,839
now just to know what that is

66
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,600
i'm bringing that same sense of freshness

67
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,240
to our mind and heart we may have felt tired many times or we

68
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,800
may have felt sadness

69
00:11:51,760 --> 00:12:00,240
or even joy many times but what about this time

70
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:09,200
i'm going to sing again [Music] noticing afresh how the mind is

71
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:25,839
curious if it might be slightly different than we felt before

72
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
now

73
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:16,160
as you keep sitting if you begin to feel any sense of

74
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:25,760
ease or peace stillness even just a little bit

75
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:34,960
it's fine to turn toward that with even some curiosity

76
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:42,159
what is this stillness like this ease

77
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:50,480
opening to it gently so as not to disturb it

78
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:58,840
but that too can be seen [Music] with fresh eyes as if we haven't felt it

79
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,840
before

80
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:25,760
when we sit with the body and mind in this way with a sense of

81
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:34,720
seeing what is new or treating it as something open and fresh

82
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:44,640
there's a remarkable feeling of friendliness that can come a sense that we are

83
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,600
making friends with the body and the mind

84
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:56,960
more so than if we just treated it as the same old thing

85
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,840
that we've sat and meditated with for a long time

86
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,720
somehow that freshness and openness

87
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:17,919
creates a kind of intimacy it feels like having a good friend

88
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:29,840
in the zen tradition it said not knowing is most intimate

89
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:48,159
so if it feels right you can smile a bit at your friend body and mind as they are

90
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:57,840
at this moment i'm just resting for a few more minutes

91
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:02,480
and as we come into the last minutes of this sit

92
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:10,840
perhaps reflecting if there's anything new that you saw in your

93
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:16,480
experience that you hadn't really been aware of before

94
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:25,039
just by having this idea of freshness or newness did you see anything that

95
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:32,399
you hadn't seen before doesn't have to be major just any little

96
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,840
thing

97
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,919
you

98
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:44,158
so good evening or night or morning

99
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,720
i think many of us know that the essence of mindfulness practice

100
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:55,919
is to notice things in our experience

101
00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:01,760
and when we first start paying attention to our body and our emotions and our

102
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:08,960
thoughts we discover all kinds of things that were there anyway about that we weren't

103
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:15,279
noticing before sometimes people tell me

104
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:20,880
that they wish they hadn't started mindfulness practice because as soon as they started looking

105
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:28,399
they saw some things that they didn't want to see or you know weren't so excited about seeing

106
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:33,600
various speech or actions going on that maybe they didn't want to know that they

107
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:40,240
were doing but i tend to take this with a a bit of a grain of salt a bit lightly

108
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:47,840
because i think people really really do want to see these things about themselves

109
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:54,480
and as we as we practice further we may start to notice that we have

110
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:02,159
a favorite set of storylines and ways of thinking

111
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:08,000
and habits of speech that we use in our life for

112
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:15,840
example we could call all of these things patterns you know we have various patterns that

113
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,600
come frequently in our experience it's quite common that we see that and

114
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,760
often there's a sense that these kind of are going on their own

115
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:33,679
you know because they were there before we were noticing them so they have they run on their own under

116
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:42,480
certain conditions okay and often what they're about is rehearsing

117
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:49,200
and refining and reinforcing the story of our life or the story of me

118
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:55,039
if you will so this aspect of our experience

119
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:02,480
is what could be called samsara in buddhism there's this term samsara

120
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,880
that means these habitual karmic kinds of patterns that are going on in the

121
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:15,360
background pretty much by themselves many of them are a form of dukkha

122
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,639
because effectively they're just reactive they

123
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:28,480
they're just going on in the background they tend to deviate from what's actually unfolding in experience and and

124
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,760
kind of take on a life of their own like when something happens and we start

125
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:40,080
it reminds us of a challenge that we're having and suddenly we're no longer paying attention to what's happening

126
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:47,200
we've moved into our thoughts about oh that's like that difficulty and then we go off on that and we've deviated from

127
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:53,200
the present moment that's how we often discover these things in meditation is there the ways that we

128
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:59,440
fall away from present moment mindfulness so that's essentially a kind of dukkha of being

129
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:06,080
disconnected from the ongoing flow of experience and these have um

130
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:13,440
they're said to have a deadening effect on the mind tamapada verse 21 says

131
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:20,158
the heedless or those who are not paying attention the heblets are as if already dead

132
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,280
wow so we're starting out on kind of a you know

133
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:32,240
the part of mindfulness that isn't as attractive but i want to then say oh the other thing that we'll notice as

134
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,839
we start practicing and we'll notice it more and more because it's enabled through mindfulness

135
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:44,398
practice is that we aren't only reacting there are actions that are more in the

136
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:50,079
realm of freedom they're unique in-the-moment responses

137
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:56,480
to what's happening that come from paying attention so we start to see more and more also as

138
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,000
we practice mindfulness that there is a freshness and an aliveness to the way we

139
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,320
meet the moment the mind can be vibrant alive connected to what's going

140
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:15,839
on sometimes we surprise ourselves that we say something quite wise simply because we were paying

141
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:21,119
attention more carefully than we had been up till now

142
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,560
so it's quite um kind of exciting to see those things to know that the mind has

143
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:33,839
this capacity to really meet experience some of the time so it's important in our practice to

144
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:39,359
start being able to discern the difference between what we could call pattern behavior and free

145
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:45,839
behavior so we start to learn what it feels like when the mind is just doing its habitual

146
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:53,200
thing and what it feels like when it's attentive and responsive and doing things that are appropriate to

147
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,880
the to the situation so then we start seeing that there's that contrast

148
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:06,320
those are the sort of two main ways that we could operate then we might start to get curious what

149
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:13,040
am i not seeing so you know what what i'm not seeing could hold me back

150
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:18,640
you know what i'm not paying attention to these patterns that run and i don't notice when they slip

151
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:26,000
in so i can start to wonder what am i missing here or how can i see what i don't see that's

152
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,000
the question i want to address tonight how can we learn to see what it is that we're not seeing about

153
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,520
our speech actions thoughts the very things that mindfulness tended to see we weren't seeing certain

154
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:45,440
things before we started what else might we not be seeing at this point so it's an interesting question

155
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:52,160
in spiritual practice how could we see what we're not seeing so this is the realm of ignorance

156
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:59,280
ignorance isn't some kind of stupidity or something or we didn't read enough or learn enough about it uh

157
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,560
ignorance is what we're ignoring it's what we're habitually not seeing

158
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,560
and so um it's difficult to let go of things that we don't even know are there

159
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,240
we can sometimes but often it's helpful if we're able to have some way

160
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,440
of directing our mind toward being able to see the things that we're not seeing of

161
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:27,520
course there are plenty of times when what we're not seeing will come and find us you don't have to worry it will that

162
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:35,839
will happen but it can be interesting to have some techniques for looking into what it is

163
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:44,079
that we may not be seeing so i want to offer three places tonight that we can look for

164
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,440
what we're not seeing to see what we don't see

165
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,560
okay so the first one is to take the direct approach and

166
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,680
literally try to notice things that we have not been noticing so

167
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,880
we can try to identify areas that we're not paying attention to

168
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,800
sometimes it's possible to literally ask about this to spiritual friends there's there's a

169
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,480
wonderful story in the sutures that's a conversation between two monks

170
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:22,320
between aniruddha and sorry puta who were friends they've been practicing

171
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:28,000
together for a long time and anuruddha comments to sarikuta

172
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,320
that he knows that he has attained clairvoyant and he has excellent energy and

173
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:41,200
concentration and yet he is not awakened so this may not be the realm that we're

174
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,400
practicing in but this is where anuruda was so even when you're close to awakening you may

175
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,000
still know that you don't know things and so he's kind of puzzled you know he comes to sariputta and he says i know

176
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:57,200
i'm not seeing something i've got all this good stuff happening in my practice

177
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:04,640
and yet i'm not awakened you know what is it that's going on and so sorry puta is a good

178
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:10,160
spiritual friend and he deftly points out that anuruda's

179
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,920
attitude toward his accomplishments is revealing certain things about his mind

180
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,599
so for example he's revealing that his mind still contains some conceit and some restlessness and

181
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:27,520
some remorse and so it would be good if he would abandon these things

182
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:32,560
and so anuruda is grateful that his friend pointed out what he was not seeing and he

183
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:39,839
practices in line with that and becomes an arahant becomes awakened as these stories go but it's it's it's

184
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:46,000
kind of a sweet suit up because it demonstrates that one of the things that our spiritual friends can do

185
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,480
for us is that they might be able to see what we haven't yet let go of and find

186
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:58,160
the right way to encourage us so it can be useful at the right time of

187
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,599
course to reveal to our spiritual friends where we think we're stuck

188
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,599
and actually ask for some advice about that you can do this with teachers also so

189
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:15,040
that's kind of the direct approach it may also be that we sometimes have to

190
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:20,800
try to discern what we're not noticing in a more indirect way and we can do

191
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:27,359
that by just observing what other people are noticing like our teacher our

192
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:34,720
friends our partner our colleagues i'll give an example there was a time very early in my

193
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:41,760
practice when i was at a buddhist gathering and there was a cart being passed around the group

194
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,880
for a sangha member who was ill and the group wanted to support her by

195
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:54,720
sending her a card so i didn't i was pretty new to the group i didn't really know all the people but i remember thinking

196
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:00,800
that uh noticing that this was nice you know and thinking oh this is the

197
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:06,480
kind of group that sends cards to people and i thought about the person a little bit that i knew her

198
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:12,319
and so i was kind of on a pragmatic practical level like that that was what i noticed about the

199
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:19,680
situation and then as the card was passed around one of the people in the group um

200
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:25,680
looked at the card and exclaimed with um put her her hand to her heart and said

201
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:31,520
this is such a beautiful buddha on this card it was like she was really touched by the beautiful

202
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:37,839
buddha image that was on the card and i realized at that moment card had already gone by me that i

203
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:43,760
hadn't even really noticed the picture on the card now i just i didn't even look at that

204
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:51,680
aspect of it and so i was intrigued that she had seen this and maybe at that time i was pretty new

205
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,040
to practice i don't know that i would have called a buddha image beautiful you know it was a buddha but i would

206
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:02,079
recognize it but but to sort of put my hand to my heart and say it was beautiful

207
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,280
i don't know that i would have done that and so that kind of that little incident was one of

208
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:13,359
the triggers for an investigation in my own practice into the quality of faith

209
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:20,160
which is something that i had not been paying really any attention to it sort of wasn't my style but because of

210
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,520
that i wondered you know what am i missing here and so i looked into that and i

211
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,359
i learned quite a bit about faith by trying to open to it and now i have this buddha which i think

212
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:38,960
is very beautiful so things change over time when we notice new things

213
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:45,599
so this is um important to be intrigued by what other people notice that we don't notice

214
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:51,119
so that's one area where we can look is you know what is it that i'm not

215
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,400
noticing so then the second area that we might

216
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:05,040
look at is what we don't question okay well we don't question so this has

217
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,680
two different aspects to it the first is there might be areas

218
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:17,839
where we simply don't think to question more deeply you know it's like we just don't think

219
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:23,040
to ask any questions and again there's a story in the suttas

220
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:30,720
there's a story about an elderly man whose name was nakula pita

221
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:37,520
and he comes to see the buddha and he points out to the buddha when he

222
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:43,520
arrives that it's quite a rare event for him to be able to come and see the

223
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,040
buddha so he says i am old venerable sir

224
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:56,640
aged burdened with years advanced in life come to the last stage afflicted in body

225
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:02,400
often ill i rarely get to see the blessed one and the big goose worthy

226
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:08,640
of esteem the monks worthy of esteem let the blessed one exhort me

227
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,839
venerable sir let him instruct me since that would lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time

228
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:22,079
so it's special for him to get to see the buddha and because he's kind of old and often

229
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:28,480
sick and it's probably hard for him to get there so the buddha first of all agrees with

230
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,560
him that this is indeed a rare event and he gives him a teaching so the buddha says

231
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,640
so it is householder so it is this body of yours is afflicted weighed

232
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:47,760
down encumbered if anyone carrying around this body were to claim to be healthy even for a

233
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:55,280
moment what is that due to other than foolishness oh it's quite straightforward so then he

234
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:02,720
says therefore householder you should train yourself thus even though i am afflicted in body my

235
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:08,000
mind will be unafflicted thus you should train yourself so he

236
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,920
gives a pretty concise teaching even though i'm afflicted in body my mind will be unafflicted

237
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:22,079
it's a great teaching by the way one that can be unfolded for a long time and so nakula pita it is said delighted

238
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:28,160
in the teaching of the buddha he was very happy and he departs and then later as he's

239
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:33,599
leaving he comes across sorry putta the same monk who was

240
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:40,160
giving anuruda advice in the last example he comes upon sorry putta

241
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:46,240
who comments how he looks very serene and you know wow householder your

242
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:51,839
faculties are serene he says and says oh yes and he repeats his whole

243
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:57,440
conversation with the buddha and sorry puta admonishes him

244
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:04,480
actually and he says didn't it occur to you householder to question the blessed one further as

245
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:11,760
to how one is afflicted in body and mind and how one is afflicted in body but not

246
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:17,200
afflicted in mind didn't you think to ask what it means to be

247
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:25,520
afflicted or unafflicted in mind when your body is afflicted and nakula peter says well um

248
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:31,119
no i didn't think to ask that actually and so then he asks for further

249
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:36,319
instruction from sorry putta so in which sorry putta then

250
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:44,640
gives a whole discourse on unfolding the the meaning of this very concise teaching that the buddha gave so

251
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:49,680
it may be that there are areas of the teachings where we're just sort of

252
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:56,319
passively taking them in but we are actually meant to engage with the teachings and

253
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:01,760
either by literally asking questions or by at least investigating in our practice and trying

254
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:07,200
them out and hoping and prodding and seeing if they work and how they work for us

255
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:13,839
so we're not really meant to let's say swallow things whole

256
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:20,880
and that doesn't mean that we need to be asking questions all the time you know things do unfold at their own pace

257
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:26,319
but it's you know there might be areas where we have some some question you know we never really

258
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:32,000
understood that teaching about dependent origination or not really sure

259
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,839
what not-self is about you know instead of continuing to just

260
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:44,400
hear these teachings we could uh ask some questions about them dig a little deeper sometimes

261
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:50,640
so sometimes what we don't question can reveal areas that we uh have not been paying

262
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:56,000
very much attention to in our practice then there's a deeper

263
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:03,599
or a second aspect of what we don't question and that points toward the assumptions

264
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:09,520
that we're living by which can be serious blocks in our practice and

265
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:15,200
they're very hard to see it's actually quite hard to see the assumptions that we're living by

266
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:22,400
you know the kind of the lenses that we have over our eyes over our practice over our way of being in the world there

267
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:28,160
are certain things that we're just not questioning about that so

268
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:33,599
assumptions lurk in generally in our thinking and in our interpretation

269
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:40,640
of events and one way that we can reveal them is to ask questions so i'm going to give

270
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:47,920
i'll give a specific example suppose that we are angry about

271
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:53,839
something and we could you know it's fairly common that we get

272
00:48:53,839 --> 00:49:00,480
irritated at least or sometimes we actually get angry about something and we know that you know that's something that's really

273
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:06,559
bothering us and so we could just say mindfulness of anger anger

274
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:11,920
feel it in the body anger and then wait for it to go away eventually

275
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:17,920
but we could also do some some investigation of that and we might you know we might look a little bit more

276
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:24,000
carefully or of course what we might do is just justify the anger and say well i don't have to look into that anger

277
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:30,480
that's obviously justified that person is clearly in the wrong that social situation is clearly unjust

278
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:37,359
no need to question further however if you're interested here's a

279
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:45,520
a train of thinking and asking that can be quite revealing so if we're angry we are typically in

280
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:52,640
opposition to something that's kind of what the state of anger is about it's an opposition so we may not even

281
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:58,079
know what or we may or why we assume that that's useful

282
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:03,200
so when we're feeling angry or oppositional it can be interesting to ask

283
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:10,559
a set of three questions so the first one is what am i opposing

284
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:16,240
and it might be that we think sort of casually think that we know what we're opposing i'm opposing my sister

285
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:22,319
or something but it's not exactly your whole sister that you're opposing what precisely is it that you're

286
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:28,480
opposing and look a little bit more carefully and then

287
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:35,839
you know check into that and then the second question is do i need to oppose it

288
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:41,599
so i need to oppose that so then that calls into a question this

289
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:46,800
stance of opposition it doesn't say that you're not going to do anything or that you should approve

290
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:54,559
of it instead it only says do i need to oppose it which then just automatically opens up

291
00:50:54,559 --> 00:51:01,760
oh might there be other responses or might there be other avenues to bring about

292
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:08,559
what i would like to see changed as opposed to as opposed to opposition

293
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:15,280
um so you know might there be other possibilities for this situation we hadn't ever

294
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:21,839
questioned that we might not have ever thought there was any option besides simply opposing this thing that i don't like or

295
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:27,440
that is unpleasant so then the third question

296
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:32,880
is opposing even called for here you might still think that you need to

297
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:38,400
oppose it is opposing even called for here so then we're sort of calling into

298
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:45,680
question whether opposing could have positive results

299
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:52,640
usually opposing creates more conflict actually that tends to be its nature

300
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:58,800
so these questions can help to you know they're not meant to say that you're wrong or that the other

301
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:05,440
person is actually good or that you know the whole there doesn't need to be anything done

302
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:11,920
it's just a way of teasing into what we might not be questioning about our way of being in the world we

303
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:18,640
could do this in all kinds of i picked out anger but all kinds of dukkha so cases of desire

304
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:25,760
what am i desiring do i need to desire it is desiring even called for here

305
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:31,440
or cases of confusion or other such things any kind of dukkha really so

306
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:38,160
don't be satisfied with surface answers to these questions and kind of see if you can go deeper

307
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:45,200
so another approach that people have to discovering about their thinking

308
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:53,520
is a set of repeating questions so you can ask why is that important

309
00:52:53,520 --> 00:53:00,559
if you think something is important it's up you're obsessing about it thinking about it i can ask why is that important and you

310
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:06,880
get an answer and it's probably true but then you ask and why is that important

311
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:14,319
and you'll get another answer and you ask and why is that important and it draws the mind down

312
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:19,599
toward the values that we have and what it is that is really important

313
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:26,160
to us in that situation and that can help a lot in understanding first of all how we're thinking about

314
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,680
situation and what it is that's really um driving that obsessive thinking we can

315
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:38,400
learn a lot about our practice and our mind some things that we weren't noticing before

316
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,920
so we have what we don't notice but we don't question

317
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:49,599
and then the third way of approaching seeing what we don't see is what we

318
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:55,440
don't laugh about so what we don't find funny tends to

319
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:01,520
reveal where our identity is invested it is not that everything should be humorous

320
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:08,079
but if we can't find any lightness in some area it's worth investigating

321
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:14,000
to see if there's some kind of sticking point there for us it's likely a place where we're

322
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:21,359
identified the buddha points out in um similarly the snake suta majima 22

323
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:28,160
that any form of identification is dukkha it will eventually

324
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:34,960
bring dukkha that may or may not be clear to us but it's worth investigating these areas

325
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:41,440
that we can't find anything light or humorous in so it's very worthwhile to develop a

326
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:49,200
sense of humor in our practice many things in the mind are actually kind of funny including many of our patterns we can

327
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:54,799
have a little lightness and say uh there's that one again yes

328
00:54:54,799 --> 00:55:01,040
that can be very helpful sylvia borstein says that we need three things in practice

329
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:06,079
gentleness precision and humor and i think she's on

330
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:14,240
to something you know we need to be so gentle with this habituated stressed mind but also precise

331
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:20,240
about questioning its assumptions and in the end we have to find it

332
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:25,920
somewhat humorous about how recalcitrant it is to be changed and

333
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:33,119
how tricky it is about reasserting its graspings and identity we don't have a

334
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:40,400
sense of humor we may not have the patience to uh continue to work with the mind

335
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:47,839
there's a wonderful there was a wonderful 20th century thai forest teacher named ajahn buratasa

336
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:52,880
was a boxer before he became a monk so that was his first profession is that

337
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:58,079
he was a professional boxer and then he ordained and he practiced

338
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:04,720
for a while and eventually he became a well-known teacher and had his own monastery and trained a lot of people including some

339
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:09,760
of the western teachers that we now have in our tradition here

340
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:15,920
and but because he was a boxer earlier he retained a somewhat belliger

341
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,960
belligerent heir let's say about him so he could sometimes come across as

342
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:28,240
rough or blunt he didn't really oppose in the way that i was just talking about in the previous example

343
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:35,040
but still he had that kind of gruffness about him and sometimes um sometimes people would

344
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:41,359
take offense at it in certain ways and think that a spiritual teacher should only be kind and gentle and warm

345
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:49,359
and so forth and if somebody challenged his demeanor sometimes autumn budadasa would just

346
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:55,760
roar with laughter and he would say oh that's just my personality

347
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:01,200
so he had learned in his own heart to make peace with just the way

348
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:07,280
his mind was still kind of a boxer in certain ways now he was of course quite free inside and

349
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:13,200
wasn't caught up in that identity but he recognized that his personality still had that and he had a certain

350
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:20,079
amount of lightness about just how he was that that air and that helped other people to lighten up then

351
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:26,880
you know if they were concerned about that and he just laughed and was was gentle about it then they would

352
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:33,599
say oh okay it's just his personality so i teach from the suttas fairly

353
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:40,160
frequently and one thing that i look for in people as they develop in their practice and

354
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:45,680
in their study is sometimes or often there will be a point where people

355
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:51,680
realize that the sutas are hilarious some of them some of the suitors are hilarious

356
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:57,119
you get to the point where you can imagine the scene going on and there's somebody asking

357
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:03,119
this question or questioning the buddha in a certain way or misunderstanding what he's saying in a certain way

358
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:08,880
you just you can just imagine the scene you think ah wow you know it must have been funny to

359
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:14,720
be there so i thought about trying to give an example of this but then i decided that it's something that we really have to

360
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:20,000
come to on our own but if you've never thought of the polycanon as funny

361
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,400
i recommend trying it and and just seeing some of the lightness in the exchanges that the buddha has

362
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:32,480
with people so it's clear to me at least that the people who compiled the discourses

363
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:39,760
had some sense of humor and how it got presented so we've talked tonight about

364
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:46,480
trying to have some way of seeing what we don't see of opening up our practice so that we

365
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:53,359
can notice more which is what mindfulness is about it's about noticing more things noticing

366
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:58,400
different things seeing the mind in different ways so that we can continue to

367
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:04,480
untangle the knots that com that bind our heart in various ways so

368
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:11,119
looking into what we don't notice looking into what we don't question and looking into what we don't

369
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:18,559
laugh about can be wonderful ways of broadening and also deepening

370
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:24,640
our practice and also keeping it fresh and alive so this is talk is especially if you're

371
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:30,640
feeling a little stale in your practice or like it's always the same or you're a little stuck or dry

372
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:37,599
we go through periods like that it's normal but it's good to have some ways of finding

373
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:44,720
new areas of the mind to uh to look into so i hope this is giving you some some

374
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:50,000
sense of that i wish you a very good evening and

375
00:59:50,000 --> 01:00:00,480
ongoing practice well everyone
