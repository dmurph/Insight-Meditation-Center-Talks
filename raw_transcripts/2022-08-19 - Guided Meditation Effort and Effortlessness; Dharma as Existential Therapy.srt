1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:11,840
okay so welcome uh welcome folks um

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,640
yeah that's uh that's it

3
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,400
just landing in your posture

4
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,120
and supported by all the practice you've done

5
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:50,720
but not using all the practice you've done to predict exactly

6
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,840
what happens today

7
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:44,960
so if you're feeling a certain kind of pressure to think particular thoughts just think i'm think i'm hard

8
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,759
for this first minute

9
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,919
and then recognize

10
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:36,680
that thought offers no refuge

11
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:26,520
so directing directing the spotlight of attention

12
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,560
to some anchor

13
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,899
some object that [Music]

14
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,479
acts as a kind of feedback loop reminding you to stay

15
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,880
here

16
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,840
maybe the breath maybe something else

17
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:36,560
and the spotlight operator can be relaxed their arms

18
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,400
on that spotlight relaxed

19
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:06,479
we're not trying to make anything else disappear the rest of the stage

20
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,879
cast the characters but we're just spotlighting

21
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:10,800
the effortful quality of

22
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,160
the tension

23
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,440
attention training

24
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:29,360
supports the seemingly effortless quality

25
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,240
of awareness

26
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:49,839
i told you to stop being aware you couldn't do it

27
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:08,399
whatever can't be stopped is it possible

28
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,760
to rest there

29
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:56,360
there is space for all experiences to arise

30
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:04,200
but who can say where our life is

31
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,320
keep relaxing back

32
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:42,160
no effortful attempt to control the spotlight of

33
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,160
attention

34
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:21,280
as we become less mesmerized the attention becomes less glued

35
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,640
to discursive thinking auditory thinking

36
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:41,039
the awareness tastes less and less

37
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,440
like me

38
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:23,799
as the teacher pandan says let your face fall off

39
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,840
element of relaxation of course

40
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:55,240
the non-identification you are not your face

41
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,640
just another part of your body

42
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,799
like a foot or a knee

43
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:34,039
taking its place in the openness of awareness

44
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,399
so

45
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:29,099
[Music]

46
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:11,679
so uh

47
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:21,240
yeah welcome good to uh good to sit with you

48
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,480
is uh bertrand russell

49
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:33,360
all the laborers of the ages all the devotions all the inspiration

50
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:41,679
all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction in the vast

51
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:47,840
death of the solar system and the whole temple of humanity's achievement

52
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:53,200
must inevitably be buried beneath the debris of the universe

53
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:58,480
of ruins or from

54
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,399
the um the zen tradition may

55
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:12,000
i respectfully remind you great is the matter of life and death

56
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,200
life slips quickly by

57
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,960
time waits for no one wake up wake up

58
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,240
don't waste a moment

59
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:36,399
maybe maybe it's just our grandiosity

60
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:42,158
that makes life seem like it's no big deal you know

61
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,240
like it's not the freakiest of freak accidents

62
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,720
that were even alive

63
00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:01,120
so this week i've been been making the case that there are there are many mechanisms

64
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,960
of action in the dharma many ways we're

65
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,840
healed and nudged towards awakening and started with attention training and

66
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,360
then said the dharm is also a cognitive therapy and exposure therapy yesterday

67
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:26,480
and today dharma as existential therapy

68
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,960
so how how can we how can we be

69
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,880
adults about our our existential situation

70
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,799
yeah great is this matter of life and death

71
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:52,720
now existential psychotherapy uh suggests that the failure to deal

72
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,720
with four core existential challenges is linked to

73
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:04,080
a lack of fulfillment or psychological symptoms

74
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,880
is for challenges of death and meaning and freedom not in the buddhist sense but

75
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:17,600
freedom to make of our life something and

76
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:25,559
lastly isolation and um

77
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:32,480
these are themes for all of us in one way or another and maybe sometimes

78
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,399
turning away from them or even something like denial can be adaptive for for

79
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:43,840
a time but in the end uh the chickens come home

80
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,200
to roost yeah and um

81
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,158
we want to prepare our heart before it's too late

82
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:05,279
dharma is not i feel not necessarily a perfect cure for all

83
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:10,480
of them but at the least it's a very deep

84
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,158
consolation [Music] it really does

85
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,839
help our heart acclimatize to a nietzsche

86
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:28,560
impermanence to groundlessness to the radical openness of all things

87
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,599
our heart needs a lot of time to acclimatize to that

88
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:39,440
and some of what we're doing as we practice is

89
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,280
giving our heart bearable doses of

90
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,280
groundlessness

91
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:57,680
so death death that all that is precious and dear to me is of the nature to change

92
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,960
um i i think i

93
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:09,040
some subconscious level got into dharma practice because some part of me knew

94
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:18,720
that i was utterly unprepared for the task for that task

95
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,359
yeah and

96
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:33,839
there are you know there are only those of us who have grieved and those who

97
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,640
who will grieve and um

98
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:45,119
and so in our practice we practice being softened rather than hardened by

99
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:51,039
anisha and

100
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:58,400
in some ways every moment of purification the heart is actually adapting in its

101
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,160
own way to loss

102
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:11,280
the antidote to a bad death is living a valued life

103
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:19,200
and that's part of what the dharma a dharma life feels like to me is like

104
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,240
valued i value it

105
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,560
uh yelum kind of linked to existential

106
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:42,320
psychotherapy says an existential position holds that the world is contingent that is

107
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:50,240
everything that is could as well have been otherwise that human beings constitute themselves

108
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:57,599
their world and their situation within that world that there exists no meaning no grand

109
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,960
design in the universe no guidelines for living

110
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:09,839
other than those the the person creates

111
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:17,839
whatever meaning we make we're going to have to make it

112
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:25,200
the the buddha said that the world trembles in all directions and that's

113
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,560
that skills translation trembles in all directions

114
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:37,520
groundless no ultimate foundation

115
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,960
for anything we build yeah

116
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:50,640
anything we build a life a democracy a species

117
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,119
even a civilization nothing nothing is guaranteed an existence

118
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,839
nothing exists on its own everything owes its

119
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:08,960
existence many other things but we must

120
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,400
build we must still build and build well

121
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:22,480
poet philip applemen um face to face with death we realize the

122
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,640
meaning of life is inside our lives not outside them

123
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:36,000
we cannot impose on our experience meaningfulness that we have not ourselves built into it

124
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,200
our true philosophy of life is whatever we choose to do from moment to moment the sum total of

125
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:50,960
our actions at a given time constitutes our philosophy of life

126
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,800
we're gonna have to spend our freedom spend our life what

127
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,640
will we make of our lives

128
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,520
i saw this documentary about uh leonard leonard cohen so organized

129
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,480
around this song hallelujah and and he spent some years in

130
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,079
zen rinzai monastery and um

131
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:31,760
and uh just one line caught me said something like um sitting in a meditation hall for

132
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:38,160
four or five hours a day you kind of get straight with yourself

133
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,160
we get straight with ourselves and um

134
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,520
cut through the pettiness and the idealism and the

135
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:57,599
naive fantasies what will constitute our philosophy of

136
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:04,400
life and we come to appreciate our aloneness

137
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:12,160
yeah no matter how deeply we sense interconnection or

138
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:19,440
abide in non-duality we are in an important sense alone

139
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,800
but how lonely does it feel to be alone

140
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,599
and the dharma trains us to get very

141
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,200
comfortable being alone

142
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:43,520
and being alone reminds us of everything else

143
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:54,400
so in all these tasks the dharma is uh is relevant and um

144
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:06,880
might add you know one more existential issue to death and meaning and

145
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,318
freedom and isolation

146
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:20,680
that would be what what do we owe others

147
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,079
what do we owe others what do we owe each other

148
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:34,480
what do the divisions across space and time mean

149
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,720
someone on the other side of the globe someone

150
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:47,079
yet to be born what do we owe to them

151
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:55,760
a lot we

152
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,960
learn that too

153
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,720
do the best you can until you know better than

154
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:16,000
when you know better do better

155
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,599
