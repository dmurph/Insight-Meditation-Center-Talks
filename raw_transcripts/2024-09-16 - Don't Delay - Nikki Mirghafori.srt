8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,440
come together to be able to come together I don't take it for granted as

9
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,360
I was walking up here this morning just I don't take it for granted here we are

10
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:11,600
as a community being able to be together in physical form and practicing together

11
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:19,479
what a gift it is a community

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:27,000
so the triple Jewel really the triple Jewel the third of the triple Jewels is

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,119
community is community not to take it for granted so before I begin my remarks I want to

14
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:39,320
to ask us um to

15
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:47,920
uh say hi to a few people around us and as if and I'm going to uh link it to the

16
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:55,719
theme of my Dharma talk which is say hi to a few people around you as

17
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:02,000
if it's the first and last time you'll ever say hi to these people first and

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,360
last time it's so impermanent right and

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:13,080
the invitation is say your name say hi say your name if you want to say where

20
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:19,200
you came from pronouns if you wish and give him a Goodwill message a little bit

21
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,720
of meta may you be well or may you have a good day or may you just something

22
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,760
like give each person a gift and when they give you a little gift receive it receive it wholeheartedly oh oh may I

23
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:39,599
have a good day how nice is that this person is wishing me a good day all right let's enjoy each other's commun in

24
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,480
each other's presence the jewel of community all right

25
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,920

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,320

39
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:31,240
receive their wish for me to have a good day and wishing them and they received it I'm like oh so s sweet to connect

40
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:40,280
with another human being and really wish them well so it's it's really remarkable

41
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,000
right this power of community this power of community this power of connecting

42
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,840
with people and um the power of what's called weak ties

43
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:02,639
in Psychology so special since the pandemic as many

44
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:09,400
people have moved to working remotely working the is the sound still okay kind

45
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:16,680
of seems variable still comes out awesome thank you as many people might have switched

46
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:23,120
still to working remotely and working um not not not being as connected as we

47
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,400
were before so there's studies showing that weak ties or these connections

48
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:35,840
these just saying hello and greetings to the people we don't know um say at the

49
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,600
grocery store our neighbors just these weak ties of course

50
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:48,199
the strong ties people whom we're connected with or friends family Etc the

51
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:54,440
the relationship we have with them the connection and spending time is important for

52
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:00,960
our well-being but also the weak ties just saying hello and and sharing our

53
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:10,280
Good Will receiving Good Will some studies show that actually that's even more important um for our well-being but

54
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:20,319
I take well-being as a way of thriving thriving and and um really showing up as

55
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:28,479
best as we're able to fulfilling our potential as a human being being the best we can be through these weak ties

56
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:34,120
as well not taking weak ties for granted not coming to IMC and just sitting and

57
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:40,720
and then going home but actually connecting with a couple of other people in the community and and sharing our

58
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:47,800
Goodwill our meta and not waiting not really waiting

59
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:55,280
not not not waiting for any of this so so just to say

60
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,479
um that this part that we just did and my remarks are are EXT

61
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:10,280
extemp I can't say it they're extemporaneous thank you came came through my first language is farsy so

62
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:16,039
sometimes the the accent still gets me and all that extemporaneous yes so the

63
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:23,440
title of my talk actually is don't delay don't DeLay So the theme that I brought

64
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,919
in as if you were speaking to the people around you for the first first and last

65
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:36,520
time because we really don't know how much time we have we assume we're going

66
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:42,800
to have a lot of time this keeps moving so I'm going to adjust it until it gets

67
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,960
right it's all good hold on I there I

68
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:56,360
think I just have to twist the top part oh that's much better now it's standing in place ah there see great all he had

69
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:03,360
to do I know that's right all he had to do is wish me well and give his Good Will and may this stay in place and

70
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:10,199
things just happened

71
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:17,479
so so it might for some people it might seem perhaps like a morbid recollection

72
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:24,879
but it's actually it's um it's not morbid at all and it's it's it helps us

73
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:32,080
align with our life with our true value values with how we want to show up in

74
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,440
this limited time that we each have um as human beings in in this life In This

75
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,399
Very life and it's it's a brief flash of

76
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:50,839
lightening so this this reflection um there's a

77
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:57,959
reflection that I loved when um I was a beginning practitioner and I remember

78
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:07,079
hearing it in the Dharma talk and it really stopped me in my tracks and I um wrote it in on a piece

79
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:13,600
of paper and I had it you know in the mirror in the bathroom mirror and the reflection was and it it's it's been

80
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,839
alive for me for years and years for decades actually this

81
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,120
reflection and the reflection was the days and nights and this is from autta

82
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:33,279
the Buddha said reflect thus then the days and nights are relentlessly passing

83
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:39,600
how well am I spending my time the days and nights are relentlessly

84
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:47,399
passing how well am I spending my time I want to invite you to drop that

85
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:53,480
reflection in for yourself the days and nights are relentlessly

86
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,560
passing how well am I spending my time

87
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:07,760
am I living according to my values am I delaying some things that I

88
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,800
know I need to let go of or or do in

89
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,680
life especially gratitude and forgiveness Etc I'll say a little more about

90
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,680
those how well am I spending my time the days and nights are relentlessly passing

91
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,200
we're aging no matter how old you are sitting here in this moment in this room

92
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,079
you are aging I am aging we're all aging conditions are shifting and

93
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:43,079
changing and how well am I spending my time how well in some ways hopefully

94
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:50,000
well and maybe in some ways it could be better anyone getting sucked into social

95
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:58,200
media anyone anyone right or any anything else that um you know you're

96
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:07,639
about to do something and you actually were joking with with some friends recently and uh and um and one of them

97
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:13,000
was saying you know I I pick up my phone to you know look up a word or synonym or

98
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,839
something and then there is a notification then I'm gone I'm gone and 30 minutes later I'm like oh what was I

99
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:24,360
doing and another one saying yeah me too you know I write this um I create this

100
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,000
document and you know uh offline and and and then I come to email and send it and then are all these other emails that I

101
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,480
respond and I forget to send the document and sometimes it never gets sent so anybody else and then I have a

102
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,560
stories like this too I'm about to do something that but something else comes in and it's the end of it and I still haven't done that thing that I wanted to

103
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,920
do so anyone else yeah this I This Is Us in the information age if you're not

104
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,320
raising your hand I'm I'm wondering um but this is us

105
00:11:55,320 --> 00:12:02,440
so so bringing so there's so many dimensions to this talk and I probably

106
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:11,440
won't get through all the various points that I want to make which is fine it's okay to go off script and also I um

107
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,639
appre I'm going to leave time at the end for questions and reflection so that this becomes more of an

108
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:26,440
interactive exploration so so back to um don't delay

109
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,000
really appreciating bringing to the Forefront of our Minds that life is

110
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,959
impermanent it is fragile it is it is an aspect of being alive it just is that we

111
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:45,519
don't know how much time we have we might have less time than we realize um and in fact in the

112
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,760
maranasati angut nikaya 619

113
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:58,839
um the the Buddha says that that I will die and I'm not exempt from dying and

114
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:06,399
it's impossible for for um someone with a body not to die and one must reflect

115
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:14,920
on this that life is uncertain and death is uncertain I never know how much time I have um and that that brings a sense

116
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:22,399
of spiritual urgency that brings a sense of spiritual urgency how am I spending my limited

117
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:29,160
time and the Buddha also said as if a person

118
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,560
person's head were on fire so one would

119
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,959
act with such spiritual urgency and one should Le live

120
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:46,199
heedfully um when the fires of birth aging and death burn so this sense of

121
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:52,360
urgency to have the sense of urgency not not delaying like oh yeah I'll have time

122
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:57,279
I'll have time because we don't know if we're going to have

123
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:04,120
time so if with with that if we don't know how

124
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:12,240
much time we have and and also to say maybe I'll bring this in now instead of later there's also a balance for us to

125
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,720
strike it's so important to strike this balance of our hair being on fire this

126
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:23,600
sense of spiritual urgency in the way we we live our lives both for the sake of

127
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:30,000
ourselves for the sake of those whose lives we connect with our family friends

128
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,199
loved ones and all beings everywhere to balance that sense of

129
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:42,240
urgency with the sense of of peace and calm and equinity right because we don't

130
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,839
want to get so overwhelmed ah what do I do is a sense of anxiety that can

131
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:53,360
completely be unhelpful and some of you might wonder well wait I'm doing this

132
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,759
meditation to become calmer and more still and and um

133
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:07,240
yes absolutely so what is what is that that balance for us to um to keep in

134
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:16,040
mind so so really reconciling this Paradox of

135
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:24,199
urgency with with peace ease and equinity so how do we go about thinking

136
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:29,639
about this well if you don't have a sense of if you

137
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:35,360
don't cultivate a sense of peace and ease and

138
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,880
equinity Stillness of the Mind Stillness of the

139
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:48,160
heart then there isn't there won't be the

140
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:54,680
wisdom to make wise decisions about what to do or what to let go

141
00:15:54,680 --> 00:16:02,079
of so that sense of peace is needed that sense of stability in the

142
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:10,079
heart and mind are needed to have access to one's values to know how to live and

143
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:16,480
how to again how to what to let go of if they're UNH wholesome habits to let go

144
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,399
of or wholesome actions that need to be cultivated there needs to be that access

145
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:29,480
to wisdom and what gives us access to that wisdom is cultivating stability is

146
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:36,720
cultivating peace and peace and ease and stability don't necessarily mean

147
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:44,240
slow that's another mistake that some people make that you have to some

148
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,800
sometimes they are they go together sometimes you have to slow down physically in order for the mind to slow

149
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,480
down but not necessarily the mind and the body and the Heart can be at peace

150
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:04,079
and Stillness and yet there could be spe in the actions but there's a sense of Stillness

151
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,438
within and there are many practices as we were practicing together

152
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:15,558
this morning meditative practices to bring the sense of stability and

153
00:17:15,559 --> 00:17:24,000
connection to to to peace to um a sense

154
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,520
of yeah the the peace within one of the practice is that we

155
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,640
practice U mindfulness of the breath for example how many of you are practicing

156
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,679
mindfulness of the breath this morning as we're sitting silently together most of you many of you um how many were

157
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,799
practicing mindfulness of the body this body sense yeah great this is wonderful

158
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:53,760

159
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,760

160
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,720

161
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:13,080
other practices anybody practicing mindfulness of death this morning yes couple of people yeah awesome yeah yeah

162
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:20,840
yeah sweet again they're many practices to bring us to our I left many many pra

163
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:26,240
I mean for example the Buddha teaches just you know there the practice

164
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:33,280
of vasana insight and then there's the practice of U Insight or vasana or

165
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:40,480
mindfulness we tend to call one basket of practices that we do then there's another basket of practices which is

166
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:45,919
concentration practices or samadi or shamata practices which they go together

167
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:52,440
but say for the basket of shamata samadi practices there are 40 different objects

168
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:59,240
that the Buddha teach us so there many many different practices that's what I mean so many different practices

169
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:06,760
mindfulness being a primary practice that we do mindfulness of the body mindfulness of of the breath mindful

170
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,520
that but the breath is part of the body also it's part of the Sati patana

171
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:21,039
mindfulness of a mindfulness of the foundations of mindfulness mindfulness of Mind mindfulness of uh various

172
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:28,520
mindfulness of death cultivating meta Etc so so many different pra and and the

173
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:34,200
bu taught different practices for different people so and it's important

174
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:41,360
to stick to one practice for for a while instead of shopping oh wow she

175
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:47,760
said there 40 different practices for shamata like oh my God I'm going to go shopping and and look them all up and

176
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,559
stick to one for a while stick to one for a while so that you can cultivate a

177
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:59,039
sense of stability remember stability and peace

178
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:05,400
so that you can cultivate a sense of stability and peace so there can be a

179
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:12,440
connection to values there can be a connection to why am I doing this what's

180
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:19,039
my goal what are my values how do I want to live how do I want to have lived this

181
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:25,600
this short life of mine I want to touch into a couple of

182
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:31,440
other things one is not delaying because I'm mentioned earlier not

183
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,720
delaying um abandoning what's UNH wholesome and

184
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:43,640
not delaying cultivating what is wholesome those the Buddha always talks

185
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,480
about those two

186
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,080
aspects

187
00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:04,960
so the um abandoning of what is UNH wholesome what is not helpful what um

188
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,600
gets in the way and the primary I would say that the

189
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:17,840
primary um Foundation of our practice is ethical

190
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:25,919
conduct so abandoning any actions that are not ethically sound are not aligned

191
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:33,720
are not um they do not lead to What's called the Bliss of

192
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,960
blamelessness it's such a beautiful phrase so so the Buddha teaches that

193
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:47,240
when we live according to ethical conduct and and there are five basic

194
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:54,799
precepts in in Buddhism there many more for the monks and nuns but five basic

195
00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:00,240
precepts not killing not killing another living being

196
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:07,640
not stealing or actually the Buddha sets the bar even higher not taking what has not been

197
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:14,279
offered which is even different which is even higher bar right you see the difference still not taking what has not

198
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:22,679
been offered um someone has to specifically offer something for us to take it even if um I'll just leave it at

199
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:31,320
that so not killing not stealing not engaging in in sexual misconduct in ways

200
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:38,279
that hurts ourselves and hurts others and again that's a um Buddhism in the

201
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:45,919
teachings is not a Puritan um um philosophy it's just a way

202
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:52,880
that that considering what might be harmful to us and to others um with the

203
00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:02,120
use of our Sexual Energy and that might be different for different people different conditions but basically bringing our own wisdom to abstain from

204
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:10,520
from sexual harm to ourselves and others the fourth one abstaining from

205
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:16,440
speech that is harmful speech that is untrue lying for

206
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:24,679
example again there's research in how lying erodes are um trust in ourselves

207
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:29,799
and our ethical Compass our ethical Compass starts to

208
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:34,880
get messed up if we lie if we lie more and more then it becomes slippery slope

209
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,840
really interesting research showing how people are put in situations where oh they just said you know told a little

210
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:47,039
white lie and then they were they're measured in fmri so at first when they

211
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:54,000
told that little lie their their um brains would kind of feel uncomfortable

212
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,440
you know they would show up you know there would be lighting up in areas that would would indicate lack of comfort

213
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:07,400
like oh that awkward that didn't feel right that I said that little lie and then they as they contined to be in

214
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:15,960
situations and and they did say more and bigger and bigger lies than the um the

215
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:24,559
activation of brain areas that uh showed discomfort silenced it went down which

216
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:32,159
is pretty wild right so if we continue to to um say

217
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,279
untruths to lie our ethical Compass which is our bodies really telling us

218
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:45,360
ooh don't do that we shut that off that's scary to me right and in other

219
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:53,919
areas too stealing Etc other ethical um um transgressions we we we

220
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:59,480
mune our um our ethical Compass does that make sense is is that clear enough

221
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:06,000
if it's not giving me a a no okay it's clear enough that is quite profound so

222
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:14,919
and that is oh and then just to go through all all the five so the fourth one abstaining from unwise UNH wholesome

223
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:22,120
speech including uh speech that is untrue it's that's harsh um it's ill

224
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:30,080
meaning it's it's um not time so um uh basically unwise speech and then the

225
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,200
fifth one and there many more teachings on on every one of these and the fifth one being

226
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:43,320
abstaining uh from intoxicating the mind because in in Buddhism again it's not um

227
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:49,960
supposed to be uh puritanical but in in this philosophy Clarity of mind is so

228
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:56,480
important Clarity of mind is so important that we don't want to intoxicate the mind so that it's not

229
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:03,320
clear it doesn't have that clarity so the very first um you abandoning if

230
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,480
there's any way that ethically we're not aligned ethically we're undermining

231
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:16,120
ourselves according to these five ethical um precepts to abandon those to

232
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:23,440
really make a decision do not delay not delaying don't delay abandoning any of

233
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:31,600
the um any way that we may not be living according to to ethical

234
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:37,840
integrity and then not delaying any expressions of

235
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:46,960
Love gratitude forgiveness the the ways that we can actually um you

236
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,399
know again part of it is the the interactions with others and part of it

237
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:59,240
is how we want to show up as this person who is me not delaying

238
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,720
um expressions of gratitude for example um the Buddha

239
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:11,679
says this is said gratitude practitioners is rare in this world one

240
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:18,799
who is grateful is and thankful is a rare I say is that us is he talking

241
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:25,720
about us how grateful are we for all the blessings that we have in our lives do

242
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:32,440
we focus on on what's lacking what's not there what what the what the

243
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,840
problems are instead of balancing it with gratitude for

244
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,919
everything that is there and the list is infinite

245
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:50,440
and yes that is us because as humans we tend to focus on what's

246
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:56,559
negative we just tend to that's our evolutionary gift because the the

247
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:02,240
ancestors who survive D and passed down their genes were the ones who were tuned

248
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,080
into the negative stimulus there were Nega they were tuned to the to the

249
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:14,840
woolly mammoth they were tuned into the Tigers they were tuned into all the negative stimuli in the environment

250
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:21,640
those are the ones who survived and passed down their genes those who were tuned to positive stimulus oh the

251
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:28,120
berries the birds the nice things they didn't make it they were eaten by the

252
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:34,799
Tigers they didn't pass down their genes so whose genes do we have people

253
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:41,279
cousins we we're tuned for everything that is NE it's not our fault it's not

254
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:49,480
our fault and yet it's good to know when you know what is h What You're Made Of

255
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,200
then you can do things then you can be be aware

256
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:01,960
of ways to um to counter it so when the Mind goes and becomes a velcro like

257
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:09,120
connects with what is wrong this is wrong I'm wrong I'm not doing this right they're not doing this right not to say

258
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:15,440
we don't want to to make changes in the world of course um there is wholesome

259
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,880
action of course but do we want to balance our heart State and mind state

260
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:28,679
with a sense of balance about ourselves about other people so balancing with gratitude and actually I

261
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,679
I found I don't know about you but um when when I go through tough times

262
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:40,880
challenging times for me gratitude is my lifeline is what brings me back to

263
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:47,960
balance when things are challenging then I start to think okay in this moment right here as I'm sitting or lying or

264
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:53,679
Walking In This Moment okay what am I great like I bring it to not he here and

265
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,799
there but right here right now what am I grateful for

266
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:05,720
and often something very simple comes up well I'm grateful for this air I'm

267
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:11,320
breathing it's clean clean enough air right it's not the orange Sky day in

268
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:16,880
California it's clean air like wow I'm grateful for this breath and then it starts there and then another thing

269
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:22,840
comes up okay I'm oh I'm grateful for for my feet that I'm walking or sitting

270
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:28,840
or the sensations that wow I I can feel I'm grateful for that and then it just

271
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:34,240
becomes a snowball it becomes a wholesome snowball that then my mind

272
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,640
becomes more balanced through gratitude that is my lifeline what is your

273
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:45,880
lifeline what is your lifeline what are the ways that you you practice

274
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,679
wholesome um actions that you bring your mind into

275
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:59,279
balance is it through gratitude is it through love giving love giving meta to others

276
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,679
that's another Lifeline receiving meta from

277
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:11,440
others know other there people who care about me or I care about other

278
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:19,480

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:20,880
um I had panic and anxiety um until you got to the point of

288

let's work on our equinity and those types of things so um I've got a lot CH

289
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:34,440
changes in my personal and business lives right now and I was noticing this

290
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:40,840
week as some deadlines are coming up that my mind because I've been attuned

291
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:47,600
to be such a doer my mind was spinning through the days in terms of what else

292
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,159
can I do what else can I do I can do more I can get more done yeah and I had

293
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:59,080
to remind myself that doing isn't n the

294
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:06,840
ultimate goal but it's hard and I'm wonder if you can talk about ways you

295
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:12,919
must recognize it some in yourself that you were saying we need to balance

296
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:17,960
absolutely and thanks for bringing that in absolutely especially in our lives

297
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:24,320
right now in Silicon Valley but where we are physically and and hello whoever is joining us online from different places

298
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:31,679
in the world um in in this time in this Zeitgeist there is so much priority

299
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,480
given to doing doing doing accomplishing accomplishing to-do list and that is how

300
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,760
we are um we yeah we oriented

301
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:48,919
so so we need to carve time to to be to

302
00:33:48,919 --> 00:33:57,159
absolutely be and cultivate that stability that St I'm assuming that stability is there which is a big

303
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:03,880
assumption but or we're making time for that stability because we are here meditating together this and and

304
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:09,240
cultivating that sense of stability and then not delaying and and delaying

305
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:15,398
wholesome action delaying letting go of but that that stability needs to be there otherwise we're going to run

306
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:21,079
around like a headless chicken and right and and the Headless Chicken

307
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:28,480
state is not a a productive state in any way it's not productive morally it's not

308
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:37,358
because we make decisions that maybe we regret later we're not our best it just it's uh maybe we get a lot done but

309
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:44,480
maybe we would have been better off getting less done but doing it more wholeheartedly and more from from a

310
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:50,358
balanced and loving place so when I say don't delay it's it's

311
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:57,200
not yeah it's it's also don't delay um yeah maybe expanding that in

312
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:04,040
our mind or in your mind that don't delay um establishing a calm and

313
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:10,880
equanimous place inside don't delay that because that's what this means too right

314
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,599
because that's what the Buddha is teaching otherwise we wouldn't be sitting here this morning meditating in

315
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:22,839
silence or seemingly doing nothing right so don't delay doing that don't delay

316
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:29,960
making times and space for deep reflection for still for calm

317
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:39,160
for the goodness for touching into into the goodness yeah thanks for bringing that

318
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,079
up

319
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:53,839
please thank you very much you know as as I was sitting here before your Dharma talk um a lot of the same themes were

320
00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:00,560
sort sort of resonating and uh so so we have um an elderly dog that has stopped

321
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,079
going upstairs so he sits downstairs and he's kind of Grouchy and he barks for

322
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:14,119
his food and you know it takes some patience to deal with our elderly LG but you know everything with a body and so I

323
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:20,160
said you know well he won't be here we don't know how long he's got he's 10 and he's been there with us and he's been

324
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:27,319
there with our kids and so you know we're kind of going through that and uh made me think about my dad who's about

325
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:35,319
in human year is about the same age as my dog and my dad barks and I go to dinner with him and you know I sit there

326
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:42,760
and you know Dad you know but you know what I'm not going to have my dad forever right and so and then I got a

327
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:49,520
son who's in college and he calls and he barks you know and he's a dad I got this and but he calls and so I'm not going to

328
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:55,319
be there forever right so those themes kept resonating for me and and your point about compassion was really core

329
00:36:55,319 --> 00:37:02,640
so he just you know breathe in breathe out and and let that kind of compassion fill me with time to be there with them

330
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,800
because we're not going to have them forever so you know so thank you very much it really resonated with me this

331
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:16,839
morning yeah thank you so much thanks for your Reflections yeah beautiful and I I so appreciated you sharing both um

332
00:37:16,839 --> 00:37:23,240
this sense of compassion and care for these loved ones uh brought in with a

333
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:29,640
sense of gratitude that sense of urgency brings in s I'm not going to they're not

334
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:35,000
going to be my life I'm not going to have the privilege of the of them barking at me one day I'm going to miss

335
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,560
this part so it brings this sense of gratitude oh okay it's and it lights it

336
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:49,079
up in a different way so beautiful thank you for sharing that with with all of us yeah thank you for this talk it's a

337
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:54,400
wonderful reminder to me and I need reminders from time to time I find

338
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:02,319
periods in my life where I feel more um uh stagnant if you will uh or resistant

339
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:09,599
to change and maybe that's uh protection or something like that because

340
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,960
continuous change is difficult uh but this is a great opportunity in our life

341
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:23,440
to um evolve and grow and

342
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,160
um uh so you know letting go of the things that are are you know maybe in

343
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:36,960
our way and then uh drawing our way towards things that

344
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:44,560
are helpful um yeah it's a great reminder thank you yeah thank you thank

353
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:46,800
you what is your dot dot dot don't delay dot dot dot thank you other

354
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:52,920
Reflections I I was actually um thinking about uh along the lines of don't delay

355
00:39:52,920 --> 00:40:00,000
that how do I want to choose how do I want to spend my last few years or

356
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:07,000
months who knows what as I um have the great gift of old age um and what came

357
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,680
to mind was this heroic um hearing reading years ago about this uh elderly

358
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:20,079
people in Japan around Fukushima and how they said to the young people we're old we've had our life

359
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,240
we'll go and clean up that nuclear plant

360
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:31,760
and uh I thought well I don't think I'm up for anything that heroic but I I I'm

361
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:39,160
inspired yeah thank you so much for your talk thank you thank you Martha yeah

362
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:44,480
yeah Gifts of service don't delay service however that might look for you

363
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:51,040
in your life don't delay service to others because when we serve

364
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:58,359
others the more we give the more we receive so it that that particular story you

365
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:04,560
mentioned it seems incredibly sounds incredibly heroic and yet Perhaps the

366
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:09,760
gift that they felt it didn't seem like a great it is a sacrifice from the

367
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:18,440
outside but for them maybe it's a big gift of ah I'm giving to these future Generations such a gift of Life of My

368
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:25,400
Flesh and body it's yeah don't don't delay underestimating your own Humanity

369
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:33,760
right and en joyful yeah that's right exactly it's not a grim Duty yeah it's not a grim

370
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,960
Duty so we have come to the end of our time

371
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:45,400
