1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,460
welcome everyone to this

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,360
edition of happy hour so for today's practice I want to invite

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:19,800
us to to befriend our mind befriend our mind

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,900
befriend our might befriend our mind sometimes

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,939
it seems like our we're not so friendly with our minds our

6
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:35,280
minds run around thinking about past and future and

7
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,700
causing trouble and and then we are not so friendly with our mind we're in

8
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,660
in a little battle with our mind so what if we were actually befriended our mind

9
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:57,059
and I went offer a couple of metaphors one is one that I've used before is idea

10
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:03,840
of a puppy a little puppy that Runners runs around and just

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,900
being a puppy it's being being a puppy being a puppy is is you know the nature

12
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:16,320
of mine to think about the past future Etc another metaphor actually is uh the two

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,659
are similar and uh like little little kittens you know little kittens are cute

14
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:27,420
and they get into trouble you know they can make a mess they can make noise it's

15
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,659
not that you know it's their nature and also there's so many causes and conditions about being a kitten being

16
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:40,320
curious being interested being uh playful and and

17
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,820
um the cause and conditions of of kitten nests the suction is the being a a kitty

18
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,240
or being a a little puppy dog and our minds we take

19
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,540
them so personally we take them we take everything we take every thought

20
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:08,039
we take every yeah every thought every emotion everything so personally what if the

21
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:14,760
same way that we had the sense of kindness friendliness it's just we laugh

22
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:21,540
maybe you know the little kittens are making a mess you know in the kitchen but we kind of laugh like they're cute

23
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:27,599
and and it's just this is the this is the way to be a kitten and we don't take

24
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,379
it so personally right this what if we had the same

25
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:39,840
perspective we took the same perspective with our minds befriended our minds a

26
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,099
sense of meta a sense of kindness with our minds maybe our minds are grumpy

27
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:51,860
okay grumpy mind okay grumpy mind instead of okay I'm grumpy

28
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,599
or whatever else is all right can we have just a little bit of ease can we

29
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,459
let there be a little bit of ease of not taking it so seriously so so personally

30
00:03:04,459 --> 00:03:10,200
not taking it so per not taking our minds so personally and those of you who

31
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:16,080
are familiar with the teachings of in personality or not self or I might have

32
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:24,120
heard of them in Buddhism that it's not everything isn't so personal there's so many causes and conditions to this being

33
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,540
to the thoughts that are arising to the emotions that are rising not everything is is

34
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:35,940
um and in fact not a lot of it is is controlled or governed by us we think

35
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,980
like we have control over our thoughts and our mind but actually if you spend

36
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,860
just a little bit of time in meditation paying attention to your mind you

37
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:53,159
realize that yeah it's you know we have some of course we have responsibility and we have we can

38
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:59,519
condition our minds to be settled and and condition them to be kind Etc but

39
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,680
they're not as governable as we like them to be so and the best way actually

40
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:11,879
to have to have a relationship with our minds is to befriend them that's the start because if we are don't befriend

41
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:17,760
them if we if we beat them up if we take them personally if we

42
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:25,259
Badger ourselves with blame um it's a non-starter it's a non-starter

43
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:31,680
we can't quite cultivate um our minds and hearts so let's start

44
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,680
by befriending our minds so that's the uh invitation for today's practice so

45
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:45,900
with that let's sit let's sit if you need to move and shift to be comfortable

46
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:52,460
in your sitting posture that there be ease

47
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:02,780
and let ease guide you let there be ease in your body and your mind

48
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,880
there are no shoulds no hafters

49
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,080
let there be ease

50
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:44,240
guarding with this dance of friendliness towards our mind

51
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,900
or it's our body

52
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,919
there might be challenging thoughts arising challenging

53
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:09,000
Sensations in the body can we soften not take everything personally or

54
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,139
believe everything that comes up and be friendly

55
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:24,740
friendly kind as we would be with a puppy or kittens making a mess in the kitchen

56
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:47,520
letting awareness connect with the breath the entirety of being breath the entirety of the out breath

57
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:53,160
help the puppy the kitten settled a little bit

58
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,500
when you notice that they're running around not a problem don't make

59
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,100
it into a problem it's their nature it's all right

60
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,419
simply notice with kindness

61
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,900
with their settling on what they're doing and then ever so

62
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,840
gently invite them to come rest on your lap

63
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:29,220
with the breath celebrate that they're resting on your lap with the breath for

64
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,319
a moment celebrate that celebrate this

65
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,660
moment of being present as if you celebrate it you take Delight

66
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,340
more and more of them will happen

67
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:32,600
and we befriend our mind

68
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,140
be a good friend

69
00:11:52,200 --> 00:12:00,019
it is said that in order to have a good friend you need to have a lot of forgiveness

70
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:09,140
and we have a lot of forgiveness for this mind a lot of friendliness

71
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:05,120
befriending the mind befriending the heart

72
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:38,280
when we befriend the puppy of the Mind heart

73
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:48,380
kittens that run around not take them so personally but have kindness compassion

74
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,569
[Music]

75
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:02,600
patience forgiveness presence

76
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:56,419
how can I be a good friend to myself in this month

77
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:02,960
how can I befriend this mind This Heart

78
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:15,620
befriending the mind

79
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,778
knowing with friendliness befriending this mind

80
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:30,000
and as we bring this create a practice to close together

81
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,640
can we befriend befriend this mind befriend this heart

82
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,400
for whatever arose or did not arise

83
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:44,600
during this practice period

84
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:59,360
just as forgiving as we would be to a good friend

85
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:05,179
understanding that they're doing their best

86
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:11,600
they've done their best interesting that

87
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,940
by showing up by showing up and even planting

88
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:23,100
one seed of friendliness towards our mind towards our heart

89
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:30,539
trusting that it will come to fruition in its own time not our

90
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:37,820
time not our demands our our impatience but its own time

91

101
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,980

questions in chat either to everyone or to me privately and if it's sent to me

103
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:10,140

104
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:15,960
this practice befriending your mind what was there a moment that something

105
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:23,940
shifted a little bit or just maybe shifted throughout became just a little calmer a little Kinder

106
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:30,440
maybe you've noticed something in the group when you talked with one another

107
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,940
God I see your hand

108
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:52,740
yeah um for me it was uh suspending judgment was a kind act I can be very

109
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:57,840
critical and um and the meditation was

110
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:05,760
um yeah it's a very nice and you know I appreciated the prompt of being kind and

111
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:14,340
yeah for me for this sort of letting the the Judgment go was a kind act over

112
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:19,980
nice thank you for sharing that Don and that is so significant and so profound

113
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:28,440
when we can just suspend the judgment and be more kind it can be the seed for so much transformation to happen thank

114
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:34,500
you thanks for sharing that um bill says thank you Nikki my mind

115
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:41,700
wondered but I didn't seem to care too much I enjoyed it not sure if that's good or not yeah yeah so that's a good

116
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:47,720
question bill so so it's um

117
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:54,240
you know it's not helpful to to be judgmental when the mind wanders

118
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:02,399
that's we know that's not helpful because we're just seeding more judgment And yet when the mind wanders and we

119
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:07,559
enjoy the wandering then we're also seeding we're also

120
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:14,220
encouraging the Mind especially during meditation if you've decided that this is a time to sit if you were enjoying

121
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:19,559
the minute the the wandering then we are encouraging or encouraging the puppy to

122
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:25,380
have bad habits so we want to actually you know we want to have a a wise we

123
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:30,600
want to be friendly but we want to give encouraging and

124
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:36,059
helpful instructions to the puppy so if you notice that your mind is wandering

125
00:33:36,059 --> 00:33:41,880
like okay puppy it's okay you can be kind and yet instead of just letting it

126
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:48,240
wander around give it helpful instructions bringing it back to the breath or bringing it back

127
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:54,659
to the body or or um or to the practice of meta so so not

128
00:33:54,659 --> 00:34:00,059
helpful to just let it roam around and enjoy the wandering bill as I'll give

129
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:05,100
you that note to pay attention to you are welcome

130
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:11,220
Jamie says my puppy was very cute and comforting at a difficult time I just

131
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:18,960
hope I can resist calling it in insistently when my mind is less settled in future sets yeah

132
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:26,339
um yeah that's sweet thanks for sharing that Jamie May mayor puppy may you be

133
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:34,378
kind to your puppy may your puppy learn to be kind and and gentle and learn from

134
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:40,858
the gentle instructions any other observations before we

135
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:44,700
clothes Marianne

136
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:54,720
I I just noticed that since I went on Retreat a couple of weeks ago that

137
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,540
um I'm not sure I'm getting less distracted I don't think that's really

138
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:07,980
really changed too much in terms of like quantity or percentage of the time but when I am not distracted it has a

139
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:17,220
different quality to it it seems like I'm going back to how it was after a few days at in Retreat kind of fast like

140
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:24,480
connect to the Mothership or some kind of feeling yeah what to make of that yeah so so

141
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,480
wait so so let me make sure I understand what you're saying so so uh seems like

142
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:37,020
your mind maybe has quieted down a little bit or there's more distraction say that again Marion I don't think I I

143
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:42,240
grasp it it hasn't really quieted down that much maybe a little but when it

144
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:49,820
does quiet down it goes deeper faster ah got it okay yeah right interesting

145
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:55,740
it's interesting yeah you're great yeah you know that is the impact of going on

146
00:35:55,740 --> 00:36:01,200
Retreat it changes our minds it changes our minds so yes because we come back to

147
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:09,180
the world under a lot of things to to um uh to to attend to uh and yet as you're

148
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:14,579
noticing when the mind when it settles it it has learned something the puppy

149
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:22,560
has learned something some new tricks and it's or if we talk about in terms of uh psychological or Neuroscience terms

150
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,200
there's some Pathways that now have have become more accessible and and more

151
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:35,640
learned so when the Mind settles like oh yes it goes back into what you cultivated on Retreat yay hooray it's

152
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:43,740
lovely Miriam delighted for you yeah um so one question is coming about uh

153
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:50,099
