1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:07,560
so hello everyone hello and welcome to uh the happy hour so for today's

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:14,879
practice given given what's happening in the world geopolitically and so much

3
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:21,600
suffering I thought might be appropriate for us to do some um tonglen practice

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:28,720
specifically tonglen practice it's a compassion practice in in from the

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:38,920
Tibetan tradition and [Music] um it's um maybe I'll say something last

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:46,079
time on Monday um a reflection came in that how how can our practice here be of

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,640
benefit how is it I hope it's being of benefit may it be of benefit given that

8
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:58,120
many challenging things happening in the world and let's consider that as long as

9
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:05,080
we are not number one adding to the hatred that's already happening in the

10
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,840
world um as long as we're not adding we're not fueling adding fuel to the

11
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:18,080
fire of hatred um no matter what side we're on what side of the argument Etc

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:25,159
as long as we're not adding hatred um then our practice is of benefit because

13
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,840
we're not making it worse by getting riled up and getting others riled up

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:38,320
and if we can have compassion for the human beings who are suffering the human

15
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,479
beings who are suffering um 360 Degrees

16
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:48,960
people who are at this time they're running to go into shelters or they

17
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:56,320
don't have shelters and running and living in lack of safety no matter what

18
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:02,759
their background their their religion their belief their color their history

19
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,039
doesn't matter they're human beings just like us and they're going through living

20
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:15,800
through a very very difficult time so that perspective that that with

21
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:22,599
compassion 360 Degrees that way we can have a healthier stance to actually have

22
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:28,480
an appropriate response in the world instead of adding more hatred to what's

23
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,280
already there's there plenty of in the world so so and through compassion practice we

24
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:44,040
can have a again more stable ground more stable ground for

25
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,599
compassionate action for compassionate action for altruistic action for

26
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:57,280
offering support but first we need to stable stabilize ourselves so the

27
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,640

55
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:43,840

57
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,120
it's it's bringing [Music] about

58
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,520
disc connection with a sense of a connection with a sense of

59
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,400
care for yourself for others for the world and with this each out breath

60
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,520
you're offering that care to the

61
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
world

62
00:08:52,760 --> 00:09:01,200
and now imagine that in your heart center the center of your chest the proverbial Heart Center

63
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:12,560
often associated with the sense with the center of kind and caring emotions meta

64
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:19,720
radiating out imagine there is an orb orb of

65
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:24,920

beings and this bright orb of light is shining

70
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:06,680
bright but each breath in breath and out breath it gets

71
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:23,560
brighter and this bright orb of

72
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:30,120
light in the center of your chest it is yours and it's also not yours

73
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:37,120
it's Universal care and compassion that's being

74
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:46,680
held by this living being who's you but it's Universal it doesn't belong to

75
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:51,120
you it's larger than

76
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040

134
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:15,080
ding [Music] ding

135
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:25,720
ding thank you all for your practice I don't have my bell with

136
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:32,399
me so so I want to share this teaching from the

137
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:37,159
dapada and many of you might have heard it

138
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:44,240
before and it goes like this this is a this is

139
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:52,720
one version of the translation hatred never ceases through

140
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:59,200
hatred by Love Alone does it end

141
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,639
this is an ancient and eternal

142
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:12,880
law hatred never ends through

143
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:24,880
hatred through love alone does it see this is an ancient and eternal

144
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:34,440
love when I came across this teaching decades ago now this is before

145
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:42,159
I had practiced any Buddhist Meditation or was familiar with any other Buddhist

146
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:48,880
teaching and I saw this actually in Japan it was on a

147
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,919
plaque and it

148
00:27:53,919 --> 00:28:02,240
um I forget the exact details but basically was a plaque a small town in

149
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,880
Japan and told the story of how after World War

150
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:13,840
II there are many it was um it was a meeting of the United

151
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:21,720
Nations and and the victors wanted to they were quite angry and wanted to um

152
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:29,960
to exert punitive damages on those who had lost the war including

153
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:37,440
Japan and I forget who but the prime minister of another country a Buddhist country

154
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,519
got up and shared this quote that hatred never ceases through

155
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:51,279
hatred and it is said that it completely shifted the energy of the the meeting

156
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:58,519
and the victors decided not to exert punitive damages and in fact support

157
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:04,480
um I believe it was Japan so that it could restore and it could rebuild

158
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,880
itself I was so touched by the wisdom of this teaching hatred never ceases

159
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:17,799
through hatred we know this from our own lives not just from Nations but from our

160
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:25,799
own lives if we keep ha ha hating and hating it never ends it's only

161
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:33,080
through love love through care and Gandhi and Dr Marth Luther King knew

162
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:41,880
this too well and taught this especially the teaching of Martin Dr Martin Luther

163
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:53,039
King [Music] so with this I'd like to invite us all

164
00:29:53,039 --> 00:30:01,000
if you would to engage with reflecting out loud for your own sake

165
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,240
but in small groups about how this practice was for you this evening or

166
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:13,559
this teaching how it impacts you and again you're speaking in the group for

167
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:19,279
your own benefit you're not trying to educate edify impress you're not

168
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:24,720
speaking for anybody's benefit you're only exploring for your own as if you're

169
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,440
journaling but out loud and the other two people are only holding you witness

170
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:37,360
and if you're holding someone witness and you didn't even understand what they said don't ask them a question just let

171
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,919
it be just holding kind presence for them to explore their own understanding

172
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:49,480
okay it's a very different way of being in community in small groups it's and

173
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:57,960
it's not a support group it's not vexing or Etc it's a it's a

174
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:04,360
special way it's really a reflective way of exploring and teaching out loud while

175
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:10,799
being held withness it's rare and it's it's powerful so please do take

176
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:17,159
advantage of it so offer one reflection exploration the next person will do the

177
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:24,320
same the next person will do the same and your turn will come and you can also say pass no problem you can definitely

178
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:31,639
say pass and don't make it a long monologue so that everybody has the chance to speak and in small groups

179
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:38,519
please turn on your camera um if at all possible to respect one another okay and

180

such a challenging time of tro

203
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:25,158
Neil I got tense and stiff and panicky right at the word tonglen I hadn't even

204
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:32,520
start it and I'm like Oh my gosh I'm overwhelmed and I remembered and I will

205
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:39,040
share right sort of like what got me out of it was I remembered maybe a year ago we were

206
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,638
talking about Quan in a breakout room and someone said you know the typical

207
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:53,720
story is that Quan's job is to go around with a magical vase of soothing water

208
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:59,440
and pour it on the suffering of the world but some people say she has two

209
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,560
jobs one is to pour the soothing water on the world and the other one is to

210
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:12,000
keep the vase filled with soothing water and that just so struck me this

211
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:19,760
must be a year ago um and you know when I panicked I'm like I need to fill the

212
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,520
vase not pour right

213
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:34,240
now it was a lovely prce thank you lovely thank you Neil beautiful need

214
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:42,200
to F of us yeah and it's so interesting that um I so appreciate you sharing all

215
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:48,040
of that and of course it it it takes I just want to acknowledge that it does take courage to say you said that word

216
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:53,680
and I was panicking so thank you also for the courage to and model that yeah

217
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:59,079
we can stay we can stay with what seems difficult or challenging or or we want

218
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:05,839
to just bold um so thanks for modeling that that that courage and and stability

219
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:13,240
that actually compassion can support and and um and also couple of a couple of

220
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:18,680
things here one is the um beautiful

221
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:24,480
image of keeping refilling refilling because it's it's both it's not just

222
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,920
pouring out it's not just giving and that aspect of tongland I there many things about tongland that could could

223
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:37,079
be um uh scary perhaps as as a practice

224
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:43,560
um but but this uh thought of I need to give I need to give I need to give and

225
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:50,280
I'm going to be diminished I'm going to be left empty whereas actually the practice of Tongan is this resourcing

226
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:56,480
practice it resources us while we're practicing it and in fact we whenever I

227
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:02,359
prac practiced tonglin I feel good I feel um calm I feel it I remember the

228
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:10,160
first time actually I practiced it there was just the sense of joy and delight and the feeling that came over me was

229
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:17,920
wow I'm breathing in a way that every breath matters every breath is is bringing

230
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:24,920
sucker to this turmoil to this world of turmoil wow my breath breathing has

231
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:31,560
never felt so precious anymore important so that's feeling of resourcing so thank

232
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:37,319
you for sharing these both as these both aspects that then supported to have a

233
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:43,240
beautiful lovely practice and also maybe the next time I introduce it I said we're going to do a practice together

234
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:50,160
maybe I won't mention tonglin because tonglin unfortunately gets a bad rap with practitioners as this

235
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:55,599
challenging practice which isn't anyway thank

236
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,599
you

237
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,720
Jerry says I struggled with how religions are often the cause of much suffering in the world like Buddhism in

238
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:22,040
Southeast Asia so I found it soothing to focus on compassion for everyone yes we're all confused human beings

239
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:27,240
trying to find our way causing harm

240
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:32,000
ah yeah thank you

241
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,720
Jerry I see Claire's

242
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:51,960
hand very quickly M Nikki I just wanted to share because of what you just said

243
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:58,960
about we're all confused and I may have told you this before but I went to a very very very famous therapist who

244
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,040
founded the school of cognitive therapy and he used to sit in with his groups

245
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:09,200
and when people brought up problems he often would say and he was world famous

246
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,599
he would often say yes we're all up Val human beings and he meant he was

247
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:19,760
referring to himself as and he truly meant it he was just as screwy as the

248
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,960
rest of us you know and uh it was delightful it was just

249
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,680
wonderful thanks what you said reminds me of um this line

250
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:40,000
I forget whose poem it is maybe one of you will will pull it in chat if you know it's um love your love your crooked

251
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
neighbor with your crooked heart love your crooked neighbor with your crooked

252
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,839
heart so I just love that yeah thanks Claire and I

253
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:58,119
see I thought I saw one more hand or maybe not maybe that's

254
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:06,839
it I see Diana I was saying in my group um you

255
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:12,079
know this is not when I heard the word tongland it seems

256
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,960
unfamiliar but it isn't because I think just through this practice in this metag

257
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:24,240
group at least for myself a lot of us have it already halfway there just just

258
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:30,960
in our compassion practice we do here in our other loving kindness practice and

259
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:38,079
so it's to me I was I was happy tonight to do more and I felt oh that's not so

260
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:43,520
it it can seem like it's come some sort of scary exotic thing it really is not

261
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:51,800
wasn't all that exotic it just flowed and I felt um warmth afterwards and so

262
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:56,880
um with that I I really wish that we

263
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,040
could maybe do it once a month maybe you would spring it on us or

264
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,560
someone once so we don't have to you know know and advance

265
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,800
and and then we do it so we just get a little bit more used

266
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:19,680
to it's not that different it's just apprciate yeah

267
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:26,000
yeah thank you iate yeah yeah thank you Diana so so so

268
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,280
couple things one is that um it and as you were saying that it

269
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:37,839
didn't seem so unfamiliar it was it was pretty uh you know it was familiar to me

270
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:44,160
you were saying and and yes exactly because here in this group we have done

271
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,760
a lot of I usually bring in the breath and I have done a lot of practicing of

272
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:57,400
meta connecting in with the breath breathing in kindness breathing out kindness breathing out love breathing

273
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:04,720
so we've done that a lot yes it's that's um the part that sometimes feels

274
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,680
challenging for some people's breathing in suffering because some people think oh I'm taking it on whereas you're not

275
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:16,520
taking it on it's just this sense of compassion compassion in in in your

276
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:22,800
heart center that's just transforming it so that's the part that sometimes people have trouble with so so I need to set

277
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:30,960
that up as I did tonight like it's not yours this is universal compassion it's just doing its own thing so so I've been

278
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,480
bringing it in Diana yeah yeah just one small point but we're also used to all

279
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:42,240
the imagery that's used so when the imagery of the taking in whatever it was

280
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,920
put as a fog or that or whatever it was put as it we're used to imagery in

281
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:54,040
meditation and and we work with that and it's helpful so never that was just an

282
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:59,880
add additional thought so thank you thank you Diana thank you so

283
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:09,599
much so and yes thank you Neil uh the quote from the poem is by wh Ain says

284
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:15,400
Neil our great resource finder thank you you shall love your crooked neighbor

285

286
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:27,240
heart and um and H I did see your uh question you sent to me directly but

287
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:32,920

288
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:39,000
do know it seems outside a perview of the conversation we're having so I'm
