1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,480
good morning everyone and have a good day

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:13,559
welcome here to the start of our week start of a new theme and

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:19,080
and uh feels nice to be here with you all

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,720
sitting here at IMC so um

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,640
and also uh I kind of feel like it's a special Monday because I Mark today as the

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,760
kind of the end of three years of these YouTube

7
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,840
meetings and beginning of the fourth year it seems quite significant

8
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:51,539
so thank you for being here as an introduction to this meditation

9
00:00:51,539 --> 00:01:00,059
I would like to make some distinctions so and the distinctions are progression

10
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:06,780
kind of deeper and deeper into the source of ourselves so if we begin

11
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,960
with what we're doing whatever it might be if we're doing something

12
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,340
a little bit deeper inside was a decision to do it

13
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:27,140
if we go a little bit deeper inside there's no wish to do it

14
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,920
the desire to do it so the decision there's a desire there's a decision

15
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:42,420
and there is the doing of it if we go a little bit deeper down

16
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,240
below the desire the wish to do something for that wish to really be something to

17
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,600
work you know to really arise well

18
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,939
there is a place deeper down where there's space for it to rise there's a room

19
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:06,180
for it to appear there is a source deeper in from which

20
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,900
that desire arises and that can be one of two sources

21
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:20,280
it can come from our reactivity or we can come from something deeper

22
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:25,860
something that is the the seat

23
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:33,260
of our kindness a very very simple tenderness or

24
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:39,360
gentleness or kind of feeling of nurturing or

25
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,879
nourishing or tending both exist within us there is the

26
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,120
reactive place and there's the nurturing tending place

27
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:57,300
and you know within minutes we can go from one to the other we could be

28
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:02,580
nurturing and tending a little kitten

29
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:10,140
and we could be yelling at the you know someone who has driven their

30
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:17,400
car over our lawn and it's a very different kind of response a very different Source within

31
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,560
us when we're sitting in meditation

32
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:29,940
it's possible to step back into these layers of where

33
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:36,980
things come from it's possible to and especially it's possible to do so

34
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:42,599
when we're doing loving kindness meditation Goodwill meditation

35
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:49,500
when we're bringing kindness or friendliness to the Forefront and we're kind of centering ourselves with a

36
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,959
friendly attitude as the kind of the organizing principle

37
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,379
all right excuse me the organizing principle of

38
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:10,080
of the mind of the heart while we're meditating so it's there's possible to do loving

39
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:17,459
kindness meditation and doing it might be awkward might be difficult it might be easy the doing is

40
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,100
can be complicated but before the doing there's a decision

41
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:29,580
to be kind to a decision to practice being friendly to practice Goodwill met

42
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:37,680
them before that there's a desire to do so the wish to do

43
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,400
so before her decisions okay let's get let's get to work here and I'd like to propose that the

44
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:53,520
decision to do so is independent of how well we can do it

45
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,919
sometimes doing loving-kindness practices people so difficult they say they can't do it

46
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:05,400
for whatever reason however the wish to do so is the

47
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:13,199
beginning of Love beginning of kindness simply the wish to do so

48
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,139
and independent of whether we can

49
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,940
and to step back into that beginning place just to wish to do so the desire

50
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:31,320
to do so and appreciate that maybe is the beginning of a kind of Goodwill or well wishing to

51
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,460
ourselves or caring for ourselves caring for others caring for the world

52
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:46,259
and then also it's possible to a step further back to the maybe to the place where there's

53
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:52,259
Space Room for that desire to arise

54
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:57,360
if we're claustrophobic and with our experience thinking a lot or

55
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:04,400
cut up or pushing or wanting or something too much there's no room

56
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:12,120
and stepping back before or even the desire to have loving kindness

57
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:19,380
to making a room for our experience that is precious

58
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,560
that's a place also of a kind of a love a kind of a care a kind of a valuing

59
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,400
respecting what's here and in that making that room

60
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:36,900
there's a better chance for the desire to be

61
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:43,620
kind to be part of the nurturing attending

62
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,720
caring loving apparatus that's within us rather than

63
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:56,460
the reactive so we'll do so let me kindness practice but with this as a background

64
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:03,259
so to sit upright in a meditation posture

65
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:10,940
that is a posture that you assume to care for yourself

66
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,199
as if the posture itself

67
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:29,000
is a healthy posture for a year to you to meditate in

68
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,240
and to gently close your eyes

69
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:56,699
and it takes some long slow deep breaths pausing at the end of the exhale

70
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:04,560
just for a moment or two to make room and space and silence

71
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,639
for the inner life

72
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:30,680
deep breath in Long release with the exhale

73
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,760
pausing at the end of the exhale

74
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:47,159
make room for things to get quiet and peaceful settled

75
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:53,480
and to feel the natural urge to breathe in

76
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:58,279
and allow for that

77
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,580
and then to let your breathing return to normal

78
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,760
and then to gently

79
00:09:55,620 --> 00:10:03,500
see if you can find a place within you that has the wish

80
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:11,040
for kindness to yourself or kindness for others whichever is

81
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,940
easiest for you

82
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:24,180
that wish is not dependent on being able to do it

83
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:29,519
not depending on having active kindness

84
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,220
but it's just a wish simple ordinary wish what a good idea it would be nice

85
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,180
if only

86
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,779
and in your own way

87
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:04,620
see if you can give thought words to that desire

88
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:10,700
gently quietly almost meditatively

89
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,399
give a voice to that desire

90
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,000
or let there be an attitude

91
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:31,399
or maybe an emotion

92
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:40,819
to appear that maybe is part of that desire

93
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:12,720
deep down inside where the desire to be kind arises

94
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:20,120
it's very private no one needs to know

95
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,420
that kindness can be their independent

96
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:34,880
of justification irrational reason

97
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:49,800
whoever you have kindness want to have kindness for that desire can be independent of

98
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:58,079
whether you or anyone deserves it it's just a good place to be it's a good

99
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:06,079
very simple healthy Source Within

100
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:13,820
you sit there quietly breathing with it giving space for it

101
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:22,760
becoming quiet around the simple

102
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,540
manifestation of kindness

103
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:33,980
which is the desire to be kind the wish

104
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:10,579
and if you have no desire whatsoever For Love or kindness good will

105
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:17,120
go deeper into the source

106
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:30,620
to where there is space room lots of room

107
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:38,899
to feel the depth within us

108
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:54,259
the space and the room that doesn't judge or doesn't

109
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:03,500
pile on beliefs attitudes and reactions

110
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:18,959
simple spacious awareness that has room for everything just as it

111
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,079
is

112
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:46,459
and is there a place in that spaciousness or space

113
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:54,480
for a simple tender nurturing feeling

114
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,600
caring for yourself

115
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:16,579
simple now a simple desire for your own welfare

116
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,339
it doesn't require you to act or do anything or

117
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:34,039
decide anything it's just a nice

118
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:40,500
simple glow of Goodwill

119
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:44,720
kind regard

120
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:59,059
a wishing to be kind a wishing to be loving

121
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:18,059
that plays deep inside where there's a desire to be kind desire to be

122
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:24,539
loving before judgments before decisions

123
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:32,960
before action before right and wrong

124
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,779
good and bad capable or incapable

125
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:49,100
deep in the privacy of your own heart

126
00:20:52,980 --> 00:21:00,559
the most basic kind of kindness who wish to be kind

127
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:08,900
gently say words they give expression to this

128
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:16,220
or half words or silent words

129
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:26,600
attitude to this simplest form of kindness

130
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,379
the wish to be kind

131
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,260
foreign

132
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:25,140
and then to turn your attention out into the people around you and

133
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:33,080
your home or your neighborhood or your Province Wherever You Are

134
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:41,220
and perhaps you can have the wish that from this day

135
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:48,500
that you have good will meta for them

136
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:57,140
and stay connected to the wish before actually

137
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:02,580
practicing meta for them just simply stay with a wish

138
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,960
a private wish

139
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:19,278
where it's good for you to have that wish it's a satisfying feeling

140
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:25,220
ordinary wish for other people's welfare

141
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,200
and in a way that feels nice for you

142
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:39,019
expressing some words in your mind

143
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:43,100
the wish for others welfare

144
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,480
who are more deeply still not their wish for the welfares of

145
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:27,200
others but the wish that you had that wish

146
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:36,320
wouldn't it be nice if you could wish for the welfare and happiness of everyone

147
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:44,580
and wishing for that wish May that come out of you from someplace deep inside that

148
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,200
satisfying simple

149
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:53,360
maybe cozy

150
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,899
may it be as we come out of this meditation

151
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:23,000
that we we have more often we wish well for others

152
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:35,000
may they wish for wishing be a fuel and a support

153
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,559
for wanting to act

154
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,898
for the welfare and happiness of others

155
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:56,059
May our wishes lead to decisions to act and may the decisions lead to action

156
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:00,799
may we in some way

157
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:08,640
give expression to this great idea

158
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:16,500
the idea that others might be happy may all beings be happy

159
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:21,960
may all beings be safe

160
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:31,820
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere be free

161
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,249

166
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:32,039
on for three years and how much we've I think we've connected and supported each other

167
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:37,620
and been able to explore the Dharma this way and I'm very happy that we're able to

168
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:45,480
continue now the pandemic is over more or less somewhat enough

169
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,820
that um I won't be here as much as I was during

170
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:57,899
the pandemic when I was here every day so I'll be here still quite a bit but we'll have now for the next year I think

171
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:03,480
we'll have a fair fair number of guest teachers coming as well to teach and

172
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:09,179
these guest teachers at many of them you know are very happy to come and be part

173
00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:16,080
of this and I think it's a wonderful large happy Sangha we have with uh with

174
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:23,059
you all with us teachers being here and I'm happy we're continuing

175
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:29,580
so for this week we still want to continue with the theme

176
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:34,740
of how to practice with the challenges that we have

177
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:42,120
and but this week the topic is meeting challenges with love

178
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:48,120
and the kind of the question that I'd like to offer today

179
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,820
is uh when four challenges is when we're in challenges to ask ourselves the

180
00:33:53,820 --> 00:34:00,059
question where's the love or what's the loving thing to do or where's the kindness

181
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:06,360
what's the kind thing to do the the nature of a challenge I think

182
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:12,179
often is that we get preoccupied it we get narrow and our Focus gets concerned

183
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:19,440
with what the challenge is and sometimes there's not that too much room processing room or thinking room or

184
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:25,800
reflective room reflection room to reflect on things when we're kind of involved with a challenge

185
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,200
the more intense the involvement were the challenges the more our focus our

186
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,300
narrow are becomes narrow and our world becomes smaller and smaller to we're

187
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:42,599
just with that the concern that is up and some of these challenges of course

188
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:48,960
are huge and tragic and um but still they kind of will kind

189
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:57,060
of take all the kind of attention out of like air out of the air

190
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:06,000
out of the room attention out of the space so that we're really kind of navigating this small little world over

191
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,760
the challenge itself and to ask the question where's the love or what's the kind thing to do here

192
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:22,560
begins to open it up again why leave love out why why leave out the

193
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:28,980
question what's the kind thing to do what's kind here in this situation

194
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:34,260
sometimes of course the challenge doesn't give us time it's not appropriate to take the time for that

195
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:41,040
but when a challenge is not you know immediate like immediately has to be addressed

196
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,560
um it might be invaluable to take the time to ask where is the love what would

197
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:53,780
be the kind thing to do here and um and this kindness this

198
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:59,820
uh especially when there's a challenge there might be a lot of protests you

199
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:06,060
know that's not what's needed now that's not appropriate now or the situation doesn't call for it no one deserves it

200
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:11,160
if someone else is involved I certainly don't want to be kind to them I mean I'm

201
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:19,380
angry with them and I just want them to suffer but if we take the time to step back

202
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:26,880
back back into ourselves and appreciate there are layers that of

203
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,520
of responses that exist within us and begin appreciating that rather than

204
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:39,540
being at the surface response to go deep down reactivity is always on the surface I

205
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:46,740
mean it might have Deep Roots inside but the reactivity is always kind of surface response

206
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:52,260
and one of the reasons we are to meditate to be mindful is to drop below

207
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:57,480
the reactive mind to relax the tensions in the body relax the tensions in the

208
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:02,940
mind so we begin having access to something else besides reactivity

209
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:09,599
and the strong Authority that sometimes reactivity can have over us

210
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:16,440
and so to um to drop ask a question you know where's the love what's the kind

211
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,720
thing here um it creates a pause creates a kind of

212
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:28,200
a questioning an inquiry that helps us maybe get below the reactive state of

213
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:35,040
mind and beginning to look more deeply what's going on here it might not be possible to love

214
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:42,720
where's the love I don't know it's not not available you might think what's the kind thing to do here and

215
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,780
that might be too hard to really have an answer but simply asking the question if

216
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:55,619
it allows space to for other information to come in then we can have maybe a different

217
00:37:55,619 --> 00:38:00,780
approach to the challenge where we're we're having to address

218
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:10,980
so as we ask this question take the pause the inquiry then we can go down the layers so uh if the kind of top

219
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:17,119
layer is what we do below that is a decision

220
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:25,380
for what we do if there's a decision and below the decision there's the wish for something

221
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:33,960
we can wish without deciding to pursue it and so with kindness with good will

222
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:40,260
um there we might not have good will to act on we might not have made the decision that

223
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:47,400
we want to have good will but maybe deep down inside we could find a place where yes

224
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:52,500
kind of it would be nice if there was good will be nice if there was friendliness here

225
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:58,640
it'd be nice if it was in this system and the approach what's going on here and

226
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:04,280
what would that look like who are we being kind for

227
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:11,820
so if you're having technology of problems with your computer then I don't know if it makes sense to

228
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:18,660
have kindness for your computer but how about kindness for yourself what is it there's overriding what's the

229
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:25,020
sense of urgency what's a sense of frustration that gets in the way of the value of

230
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:30,660
love of kindness of wishing that we have we have love for ourselves

231
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:36,780
wishing we can be kind just that begins changing the Ecology of

232
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:44,599
it all if it challenges with someone else the person than our people

233
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,640
do we have nowhere deep down inside any desire for their welfare and their

234
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:56,099
happiness could we imagine that a context where

235
00:39:56,099 --> 00:40:04,440
you would have that for that for those people or their you know beyond the pale no way nothing is possible

236
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,480
um or is there is there is it really all the time

237
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,960
or is the challenge with them contextual is there a different context where you

238
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:21,599
might feel some basic ordinary human Goodwill for them and care for them

239
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:27,000
and maybe there's the desire to be able to do it

240
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,480
even if you can't do it the desire to do it is a form of

241
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:39,000
kindness is a form of love and to appreciate

242
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:45,420
the desire to do a desire to have love the desire to be kind appreciate that as

243
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:50,520
a form of kindness I know it's hard to be kind all the time

244
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:57,900
it's hard to have it it's hard to want to be to uh to you know want welfare for others sometimes

245
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:03,420
but can you at least want to be able to do it

246
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:10,700
this is valuable for yourself it's medicine for us to be able to come back and find that place of basic goodness

247
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:16,920
basic care because if we're not connected to that we're estranged from ourselves change

248
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,880
the chances are we're living a little bit too much in the reactive world and and um and the projected world and the

249
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:31,200
fantasy world of ideas and Concepts and hurts

250
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:37,859
and do we we don't want to sacrifice we don't want to lose touch with this deep

251
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:44,000
place that can't be hurt the Deep place that can't be does not

252
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,359
transactional that's not dependent on anyone being anything even you being

253
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:57,540
anything that but rather is something before all that

254
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:03,060
the simplest rudimentary wish

255
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:09,240
desire to want to love

256
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:14,119
to want to be kind to want to care

257
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:22,320
take the time to find that maybe if you find that it's easier to

258
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:28,560
breathe maybe you find that you find there's a little more space in the challenge

259
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:35,099
maybe if you find that the challenge is still the same challenge but it's a

260
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:42,720
little bit more space for you to address it to be with it to not be battered around by it as much

261
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,660
where's the love what's that kind thing to do

262
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:53,940
and then to back up back up inside as deep

263
00:42:53,940 --> 00:43:00,420
as you can go where you find something a little some

264
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:08,520
inkling some little impulse words love

265
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:16,640
even if it's not love it's towards love that's not dependent

266
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,060
on any condition in the world being one way or the other

267
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:28,460
it's just what the heart does

268
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:36,300
so this week I'd like us to reflect on this topic of love and kindness and good

269
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:41,700
will in times of challenge and um

270
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:48,540
and learn to bring that into the picture

271
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:54,240
rather than have blinders on with that often happen with the challenge that we

272
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:00,359
see it from a very narrow perspective and how do we include the perspective of

273
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:09,119
love of kindness of Goodwill so thank you very much and I hope that

274
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:16,319
as you go about your day today that um you can have that find that space within

275
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:23,420
that pause that quiet that you can recognize

276
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:33,300
an impulse to want to be kind to want to be loving

277
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:41,160
and maybe you can't take it any further than that and there's no need to feel guilty or feel like you're not loving

278
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:47,760
just the impulse towards love the desire to love

279
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,920
is plenty beneficial appreciate that

280
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,260
and appreciate it in the privacy of your heart so it doesn't get complicated with

281
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:04,680
all the issues of Life of people who should you or shouldn't you or

282
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:12,680
of course you should when no one needs to know so thank you very much
