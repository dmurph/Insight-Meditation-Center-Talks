1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:08,040
good evening can we have the volume up just a tiny bit here just so that uh I don't

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:15,279
have to project my voice as much um maybe a tiny tiny tiny bit

3
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,119
more so funny There we go thank

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,199
you so I wanted to talk a little bit about

5
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,239
uh this little encounter that the Buddha

6
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:38,239
describes about before he was awakened when he was just an ordinary person like

7
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:45,680
us and he encountered some people quarreling just in case you see anything

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,719
in the news about quarreling or something

9
00:00:50,719 --> 00:01:00,359
so oh the scene is that um it's between the sakian people and the kelan people

10
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:05,400
and they had um these irrigation channels that were from the river that

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,680
uh formed the boundary between their two regions and one year there was very

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,840
little rain so they were quarreling about okay uh what are we going to do

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,200
that uh we want all the water no we want the water what are we going to do this is maybe not so

14
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,960
unfamiliar something like this and apparently they were insulting each other and it got so bad that the

15
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:37,479
different armies were on the two different sides of the river about ready to go to war and the person who was to

16
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:44,119
become the Buddha he's not the Buddha yet uh shows up and he wants to talk to

17
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:50,159
them and then uh he describes the impact that it had on them I'm just going to

18
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:58,200
share with you a little excerpt here it's not the complete um it's inv verse I should say

19
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:06,200
this is a short little passage that in verse and it goes uh like this just look

20
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,319
at people and their quarrels I will speak of my

21
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:17,040
dismay and the way that I was shaken seeing people thrashing about like fish

22
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,760
in little water seeing them in conflict with each other I became

23
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,959
afraid I felt discontent at seeing only conflict to the very end

24
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,200
then I saw an arrow here hard to see

25
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:43,040
embedded in the heart pierced by this Arrow people Dash

26
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:50,080
about in all directions but when the arrows pulled out they don't run and

27
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:57,280
they don't sink so what is this about this whole

28
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,120
idea I've shared this verse a few times so teaching I I just love this it's very

29
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:10,159
um it's there's a there's a richness here there's lots of themes that I could pull out but I'm going to pull out this

30
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,840
one particular theme here just going to read these few lines again where the

31
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,080
person who's about to become the Buddha he's not the Buddha yet he says I felt

32
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:27,239
discontent at seeing only conflict to the very end so this idea of like wow I

33
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:33,360
don't see how this is going to end seems like there's just always going to be like there's no way forward I just can't

34
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,640
imagine how it's going to be and then um he continues then I saw

35
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,840
an arrow here hard to see embedded in the

36
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,680
heart so he's looking at them seeing nothing but

37
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,680
quarreling and then looks back at himself and sees that he has this arrow

38
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,959
in his heart pierced by this Arrow people Dash about in all

39
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,239
directions so whereas before he was thinking like okay you guys got to get it together and figure it out and

40
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:16,519
whatever this problem is here maybe I can help you like you know really kind uh this emphasis on what's happening

41
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,160
there but then when he saw this Arrow recognizing that people when they

42
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,720
have this Arrow Dash about in all directions that is maybe I like the word maybe thrash about in all directions

43
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,639
throwing blame throwing judgment throwing insults or you know all kinds

44
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:44,000
of things that happen with this arrow in the heart and so what is this arrow in the

45
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,120
heart we might say it's the married ways in which we say

46
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:57,440
no no no to this moment no to this experience I'm having no

47
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,199
to anything and everything in this kind of way this way that the small and

48
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:11,840
countless ways in which we are cultivating this discontent in which we are

49
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,280
resisting what's already here in our

50
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:23,479
experience I'm not talking about conceptual big things that are happening out there or experiences that aren't

51
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:30,440
immediate I'm only talking about this moment this moment this moment

52
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:36,080
in which we're saying No this is a little theme I've been talking about lately I've just

53
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:43,039
been this maybe just the climate these days and also noticing in myself the way

54
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,000
that I'm often saying no to things like no I don't want it to be this way and

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:59,440
then just seeing the impact that it has on me these subtle ways so resistance this way of saying no

56
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,319
no no I don't want it make it go away it should be different this like shows up

57
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:12,680
in so many different ways I'll talk about it this evening but uh it's just this natural response to

58
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,720
discomfort I mean right this is just a a normal thing that our predecessors our

59
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,440
ancestors of course they had this uh discomfort maybe was you know in

60
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,919
response to a threat and so they had to pay attention

61
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,000
or had to behave in a particular way but it's this way that this uh

62
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,039
response to discomfort is it's conditioned it's something that we

63
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:47,080
learned like if we didn't respond then we had a lot of discomfort a lot of pain and we didn't that's painful so we try

64
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,400
to you know uh create a way in which we can avoid it or maybe we just saw you

65
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,039
know our communities our families the way that okay there's certain uh

66
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,680
discomfort comts that are tolerable exercising restricting what we eat or

67
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,720
something like this but there's other ones that aren't tolerable emotional discomfort and we're not ever going to

68
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:18,000
talk about uh this uncomfortable thing for example or something so it's conditioned we learn it it's a natural

69
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,280
thing it's all of us have them I certainly have them I'm guessing that

70
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,960
you guys have them too so it's this whe when we encounter

71
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,720
something Pleasant whether it's a difficult emotion uncomfortable emotion or maybe

72
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:41,680
it's a challenging situation which then gives an uncomfortable emotion I might say or

73
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,960
maybe if it's just a minor inconvenience which then gives rise to an uncomfortable emotion of irritation or

74
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,560
impatience or discontent or something like that so it's this natural human

75
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,240
tendency to push it away or to avoid it or try to control it might it be

76
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,919
different and it takes many forms so what are some of these ways that uh that

77
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:14,039
I'm talking about here there's this way in which uh this

78
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:20,960
resistance this way subtly or maybe not so subtle sometimes saying no shows up

79
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:27,319
we might call this like mental resistance things are happening in the mind there's this where we creating

80
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:35,880
stories or narratives to to help us not feel the discomfort itself or to avoid

81
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,560
feeling whatever the emotion is so we can create these complicated stories or

82
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,560
narratives I'll give an example in a moment or we might try to

83
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:54,000
rationalize or minimize or intellectualize the

84
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,800
situation and uh this is one of my favorites I didn't recognize it so much

85
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:05,040
but uh it's not a mistake right that I spent years of my life uh training to be

86
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,120
a scientist and then being a scientist right scientists are ones that like to just go up into their head and uh

87
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,399
rationalize things intellectualize it and I did my fair share of that I come

88
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:24,680
from a family of scientists so you know it's not a mistake that I do that it's not a mistake that I became a scientist

89
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:29,880
myself or there might be this way in which we get caught in this Lo Loops of

90
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:36,920
judgment and blame and we're just kind of stuck going around and around and around and not feeling like there's any

91
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:42,480
way forward but there's this way just being in this Loop also helps us you

92
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,640
know not actually feel the emotion feel the difficulty instead we're just in

93
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,440
this loop again and again just with this stuckness I'll give it a example of this

94
00:09:54,440 --> 00:10:02,200
or we might distract ourselves with busyness or planning lot of planning or

95
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,440
just being busy yeah I I like to do this too oh I

96
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,200
need to prepare for this and get ready for that and design this and I don't know it's seems like I can always cook

97
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:21,360
up things to do to be busy with so what are some of these

98
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:28,440
examples what if uh you imagine like you experienc a significant loss and but you

99
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,760
tell yourself you tell others oh no I'm fine I'm fine and actually I'm moving on

100
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:42,800
really quickly and there's this way in which it's it's not quite true and instead

101
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,399
it's this denial of your act what you're actually experiencing and it's a way that it's

102
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:57,200
preventing you from fully grieving from this loss you're telling yourself and everybody oh no I'm fine I'm

103
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:03,560
fine and then with not not being not fully grieving and processing this pain

104
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:13,560
of this loss whatever the loss might be right our lives are filled with so many loss of uh loved ones relationships

105
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:18,600
jobs uh capacities capabilities this is

106
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:29,360
this is The Human Experience so there's one way which we might be um um resisting feeling that by

107
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,880
saying to ourselves and to others I'm fine I got this it's going

108
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,480
well or maybe you have a disagreement with a friend and instead of

109
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:47,680
acknowledging the hurt feelings you spend hours just replaying the conversation in your mind and focusing

110
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:55,240
like oh I should have said this shoot why didn't I say this or maybe you're um

111
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,760
rehearsing in your mind all the reasons why your friend was wrong and they shouldn't have said that or they

112
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:07,800
shouldn't have said this or but there's this way in which kind of like going over and over what happened and what you

113
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:16,079
should have said or what they should have or should not have said just keeps you stuck in the story just going around

114
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:22,800
and around another form of resistance you're not feeling actual the

115
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:29,600
pain from this disagreement with a friend you know this like Schism that uh

116
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,440
God created and not feeling the hurt instead you're just stuck in the story

117
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:41,959
and in some kind of way you're perpetuating a certain type of hurt

118
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:50,240
maybe or maybe you're perpetuating this idea of like well the next time I see them I'm going to you know X Y and Z and

119
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,279
kind of like uh nurturing this sense of resentment and what I'm going to do next

120
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:01,480
or something like this but there's this way that this old also prevents you from

121
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:09,320
feeling and processing your underlying emotions keeps you stuck in the story or

122
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,120
maybe you just find yourself caught in a loop of just intrusive thoughts about a past

123
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:22,600
mistake like oh I can't believe I did that regret remorse or maybe you're this

124
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,240
future worry oh I hope this doesn't happen and saying this over and over

125
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,480
again and you try to suppress the thoughts but they just keep on returning with a

126
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,800
greater and greater intensity and there's this way in which

127
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:46,600
we're trying to control the thoughts which is actually just another form of resistance so we're using resistance to

128
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,199
deal with the resistance which of course is just

129
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:59,720
resistance and so there's this way that kind of like strengthens these thoughts right they uh just

130
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,639
get perpetuated because there isn't a way in which we can allow them to maybe

131
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:11,639
shift and change and Bloom into something else so those are different ways in

132
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:19,759
which the mind can um have some resistance against feeling uncomfortable

133
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:25,880
emotions whatever that emotion might be sadness

134
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,880
anger blame

135
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:38,880
regret but there's also a way in which we just might suppress or deny or numb

136
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:48,199
our feelings or maybe we're like projecting our emotions onto others or maybe we lash out in ways that

137
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:54,160
we have an inappropriate response to something and I was thinking about this

138
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:00,199
that um I just I spent some time trying with this like every time time that I

139
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:08,959
was um projecting like oh wow that person is angry or that person is sad I

140
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:15,480
found I just made it a practice like am I angry am I sad why am I projecting

141
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:23,040
this onto them and it's quite something to do this to discover oh yeah there's there was a

142
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,120
little bit of anger there this is more in my personal life I'm talking about

143
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:34,480
when I'm in the role of a Dharma teacher I meet people in a different way than

144
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,800
I'm just meeting them with uh like my friends and family and just uh in my

145
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:46,959
daily life and that's something for me to think about too like why is it why is it a little bit different when I'm in the

146
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,880
role of a teacher and when I'm just with my friends and family but just this idea

147
00:15:52,880 --> 00:16:00,759
that sometimes we are just so concerned or we're like wow they're so angry

148
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:07,279
they should really work with their anger and not recognize that in fact we are the angry one but we don't want to

149
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:15,560
feel our anger so we're just projecting it all onto somebody else I mean this shows up maybe or

150
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,120
having this like inappropriate responses also could be maybe as

151
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:28,319
we um lash out at our partner over just a minor issue you know and our anger is

152
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:34,839
disproportion to the situation and maybe there's this way that this is masking a

153
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:41,399
a hurt or a resentment that we don't want to feel this is another way that

154
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:47,240
resistance shows up is just uh making a lashing out or

155
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:54,759
something like this or maybe we feel overwhelmed by a loss and so we find

156
00:16:54,759 --> 00:17:02,399
ourselves watching way too many YouTube videos or or Doom scrolling

157
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,798
or so there's so many things that we can do right to numb the pain another form

158
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:13,918
of resistance and then lastly I'll talk about there's physical resistance where

159
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,160
we might try to excape through using substances addictive behaviors or

160
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:26,319
unhealthy relationships there's all these ways in which we are trying to you know just not feel the Heartbreak that

161
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:32,799
we might have not feel the discomfort of minor emotions or even the

162
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:38,720
big major ones and this can show up also just in

163
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:45,559
um carrying chronic tension in our shoulders our neck or our

164
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:52,160
jaw which is this expression of this uh

165
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,240
unexpressed anxiety or stress or

166
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:04,640
something so why do we have this resistance I said that it's because we don't want to feel discomfort

167
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:13,840
but there's this way that our brains are wired and to protect

168
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:20,679
us from perceived threats and this works when there are actual threats doesn't work so well when

169
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:27,240
the threats are just discomfort of emotions or something like

170
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:35,360
this so we resist we have this fear of discomfort but we also have this desire

171
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:42,919
for control we want to control things of course we do we want to feel like things

172
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:50,159
will be the way that we want them to be we want to feel like that we have the agency to make our life go in the

173
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:55,440
direction that we want and we have this idea well okay well I can just figure it

174
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,640
out and I can fix it and uh then everything is going to be fine and then

175
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:09,039
or I'll figure out a way to make this go away or something this sense of wanting to

176
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:16,640
control to feel like that uh we can just make everything be okay instead of

177
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,760
feeling oh it's not okay it's not okay

178
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:28,480
so we are busy trying to fix whatever we can whether it's a major

179
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:34,640
thing thing or a small thing fix ourselves fix other people fix objects

180
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,840
wri a nusty letters to whomever like it really shouldn't be this way it should

181
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:46,640
be however it should be you know or maybe there's a way in which um

182
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:53,320
we resist because we have attachment to our stories we have this stories that we

183
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:59,280
tell about ourselves or about them those people over there

184
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,320
and we are resisting what's actually happening because what's actually

185
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,960
happening doesn't go with the stories that we

186
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:17,080
have for example maybe you've been hurt by someone in the

187
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:23,000
past and you replay this event over in your mind or you

188
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,799
have there's this way that this uh has been built up into your mind and your

189
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:36,640
reliving the pain and the anger and all the associated emotions and then part of

190
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:43,120
this is you're telling your the story of how you were wronged this may be true you may be

191
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,440
wrong have been wronged but then there's this way in which you're holding on to the

192
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,320
resentment as a way to protect yourself from being hurt again and it's this

193
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,440
resentment that prevents you from forgiving or prevents you from letting

194
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:09,360
go and instead you're stuck and you're not moving forward instead you there's

195
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:15,679
this the resentment is a form of resistance of feeling actually the

196
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:22,880
Betrayal feeling the hurt feeling the pain of whatever or the anger of

197
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,200
whatever happened or maybe this idea of control

198
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,880
you have a family member or a loved one somebody you care about and they have the unhealthy habits and you're always

199
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:40,039
giving them advice you know you really should do this and uh you shouldn't do that and I don't know why you keep on

200
00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:47,120
doing this and you try to persuade them to change and then you feel frustrated when they don't comply whatever this is

201
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:56,080
kids or Partners or parents this is kind of uh your desire

202
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:04,320
to control their behavior is just your resistance to feeling the discomfort of

203
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:10,400
actually you have anxiety about your well their well-being it's going to feel

204
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:17,120
terrible if their health really declines or there's some accident due to the

205
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:24,480
things that they're doing and so we're resisting accepting that we

206
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,880
can't force someone to change and and instead we're just going

207
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:36,720
to stay in there this so we're doing this because we

208
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,960
think it's going to make us feel better but this

209
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,480
resistance actually amplifies and prolongs the

210
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:55,159
discomfort we don't know this of course because we're so busy resisting we don't know what it's like to be when we're not

211
00:22:55,159 --> 00:23:00,840
resisting but It ultimately really it definitely creates more

212
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:06,919
discomfort there's this way that um you know what we resist persists turns out

213
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:16,440
to be true there's this way in which when we're tangled up with something it's the whole activity of being Tangled

214
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:22,320
that uh keeps the difficulty present instead of allowing it to arise and to

215
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:29,679
be experienced and to pass away which is the nature of all experiences

216
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:36,360
but not only does it kind maybe amplify or prolong our uh discomfort but it

217
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,880
really limits our growth but getting stuck in

218
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:47,840
resistance means we're not uh learning like how to be with the discomfort in

219
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:55,600
other ways and and it kind of maybe it's uh we were missing some insights about

220
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,480
our some of the way that we are showing up in the world world and why people are responding to us the way they do perhaps

221
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,600
or something like this or maybe there's this way of resistance also is uh

222
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,960
creates some disconnection when we're having to resist we're no longer present

223
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:22,880
with what's actually happening this the anger the sadness the grief the

224
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:30,039
rage whatever it might be so how can we we work with us how can

225
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:35,320
we work with resistance how can we not resist the

226
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,760
resistance just notice it start by just

227
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:48,399
noticing notice all the ways in which the mind and the

228
00:24:48,399 --> 00:24:53,919
body are how they react when you anticipate

229
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:59,559
you're going to experience discomfort or you are experiencing

230
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:05,320
discomfort do you tense up do you start thinking negative

231
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:11,000
thoughts oh this is going to be terrible I can't handle this this is

232
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,600
uh I this I don't I there's so many different thoughts here I'm not so good

233
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:22,960
at extemporaneously coming up with them or do you reach for distractions

234
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:29,880
this is what the I do a lot I reach for distractions and sometimes I don't even realize it's such a habit like oh yeah

235
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:36,399
I've already distracted myself and and might we've created

236
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:41,919
a society that's filled with nothing but distractions right we all carry around

237
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:49,640
these little gizmos in our pockets that are designed to be able to distract ourselves so one is just notice some of

238
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:56,640
the ways in which we are resisting any some anything that's

239
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:03,559
uncomfortable and just are will have a whole Myriad of ways but there might be some that are more common than others

240
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:08,919
for us and then once we've noticed it can we

241
00:26:08,919 --> 00:26:16,600
just acknowledge their presence say oh I'm feeling resistance right

242
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:22,679
now resistance feels like this and then it might be right into

243
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:30,960
distraction again or it might be into the body being tense again just simply acknowledging it

244
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:38,720
might not be enough to disrupt this uh momentum but this is where it starts this is where it starts just acknowledge

245
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:45,679
it don't no need to judge yourself or push it away like Yep this is resistance

246
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,799
this is a natural thing humans don't like to feel discomfort and we do

247
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:57,240
different things to prevent us from feeling discomfort but these things that we're doing are kind of causing us to be

248
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:03,200
stuck and it's the opposite of having Freedom it's the opposite of having

249
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:10,200
peace and then acknowledge the resistance as best you can and then

250
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:17,720
shift from storyline to Sensations that is shift your attention

251
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:24,799
to the sensations in the body what's actually here tangible moving much

252
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:30,960
slower than the thoughts and something that it's easier to rest your attention

253
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:37,320
on than thoughts or something kind of like diffuse about this uh concept of a

254
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:45,200
resistance feeling uh tension in the shoulders is much more tangible and

255
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,559
palpable and then can you acknowledge the discomfort of the resistance the

256
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:57,480
tension in the shoulders and can you acknowledge the discomfort of whatever it is you're

257
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:03,279
resisting you don't have to necessarily jump right

258
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:10,120
into the grief jump right into the rage just be with a resistance to the

259
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:16,000
grief and the rage as best you

260
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,440
can as best you can this makes a huge difference so often like we don't even

261
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:28,720
know that with the grief and rage I'm just using these two as examples we don't even know that that we have

262
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:35,720
resistance to them but if we can be with the resistance then the grief may show

263
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:41,760
up the rage may show up it may not but it'll show up in a different way it'll

264
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:48,200
unfold in a more natural manner instead of being

265
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:54,799
Amplified and prolonged by resistance so it will rise and pass

266
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:00,919
away I can't tell you exactly this time frame but I promise it will arise and

267
00:29:00,919 --> 00:29:07,360
pass away the more resistance we have maybe the higher it is and the longer

268
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:14,840
the duration so notice the signs of resistance just

269
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:22,480
get curious about yourself what what are the ways in which what do you do when you don't want to feel anything

270
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:29,519
uncomfortable two when you notice that oh yeah that's happening right now just acknowledge it maybe it can be helpful

271
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:36,919
just to say okay I'm feeling resistance right now three to bring attention to the

272
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:44,799
bodily experience this is so much easier to be with and so much more real actually it's

273
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:50,679
what's actually happening in the moment you might be having an uncomfortable emotion you might be having resistance

274
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:57,039
and you're having bodily Sensations so you're being here with the experience and then

275
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:04,080
four be kind and patient with yourself this is not something that gets untied

276
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,360
really quickly but this is the way to Peace and

277
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:16,840
Freedom it might seem like oh this is just some minor little thing we're supposed to do but it turns out freedom

278
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:24,640
is all about not having to resist anything not having to avoid things or

279
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,000
um not having to

280
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:38,720
not having to um pretend like things are different than they are freedom is to be able to

281
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:46,600
just meet whatever is arising so if we want freedom in our lives if we want peace in our lives if

282
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:53,960
we want to not have this arrow in our heart that the Buddha to be was talking

283
00:30:53,960 --> 00:31:00,880
about then we look at our resistance patterns and then we have peace with whatever is

284
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:08,480
arising and then we can show up in a world bringing this peace and we can see

285
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,919
things differently feel things differently than others can then we can be a force that helps create peace in

286
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,919
the world instead of insisting that those people over there should uh behave

287
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:29,919
better instead we are the ones that have the peace like why not start here

288
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:42,039
so I mean resistance is a natural part of the human experience but it doesn't have to be something that

289
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:50,000
um we can learn how to use it to be a way that supports greater peace and ease

290
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:56,360
and freedom in our lives and by learning to recognize and

291
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,799
work with resistance there's this way in which it just will happen there'll just

292
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:08,519
be more ease in our lives and here's a poem I'd like to

293
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:13,279
close with this is by Dorothy

294
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:23,559
hunt and it's called peace is this moment without judgment peace is this moment without

295
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:28,320
judgment by Dorothy hunt

296
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:36,360
do you think peace requires an end to war or tigers eating only

297
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:45,200
vegetables does peace require an absence from your boss your spouse or yourself

298
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,919
do you think peace will come some other place than

299
00:32:50,919 --> 00:32:56,559
here some other time than now in some

300
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:04,639
other heart than yours peace is this moment without

301
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:10,039
judgment that is all this moment in the heart space where

302
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:17,519
everything that is is welcome peace is this moment without

303
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,919
thinking that it should be some other way that you should feel some other

304
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:28,919
thing that your life should unfold according to your plans

305
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:35,039
peace is this moment without judgment this moment in the heart space

306
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:40,158
where everything that is is

307
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:49,279
welcome so resistance as the path working with resistance as the pathway

308
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:56,480
to peace thank you and I'll open it up for

309
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,398
some comments and questions thank

310
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:19,679
you sometimes to be a healthy adult don't we have to listen to our resistance I mean I remember when I was

311
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:26,280
19 I had this 21y old girlfriend who was really manipulative and I wish I would have listened to Mar sooner and said

312
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:33,760
okay I don't I think we we should not see each other anymore you I stay with her too long probably so don't we some

313
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,800
have to listen to our resistance from the heart I guess I wouldn't I'm using

314
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,158
resistance as a different uh way than you're using you're you're talking like maybe where the body in the heart is

315
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:50,560
saying no this isn't helpful for me that's different resistance is resistance would be um completely

316
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,320
denying your experience for example but you were you were hearing the no and

317
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,040
choosing not to follow it for some reason so I'm using resistance a little bit different I'm using

318
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:07,160
resistance as this uh present moment

319
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:12,200
experience as and to not uh want to be

320
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:19,119
with that experience does this make sense or yeah I'm just wondering if if to be a healthy

321
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:25,960
adult we have to listen to our no we have to be say no you know you know just is an important part of being healthy

322
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,320
you know saying no right yes yes yes yes but what I think what you're pointing to

323
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:38,838
of course right we have to have boundaries and we have to say no yes of course we do um

324
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:47,078
you're maybe I'll just leave it with there yes we have to have boundaries and be able to say no yes

325
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,280
yes thanks for the uh the talk it really resonated and I think just want to share

326
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:03,359
maybe a couple of comments or observations uh that I thought were

327
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:09,200
interesting um I think um One using the analogy or the

328
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,079
metaphor of like The Arrow it was interesting that recognizing the Arrow

329
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:21,160
by doing that you're you're basically pulling it out like in recognizing it you're pulling it out I was originally

330
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:28,599
thinking of it as like oh there's going to be steps but you know so I thought that was that was interesting

331
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:34,680
um and then the other thing that came to me during the talk was I was reminded of

332
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:41,079
one of the there's the five hindrances and one of them being doubt

333
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:46,400
and as I was thinking we we it's easy enough to talk about the

334
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,520
arrow right and in in one point of time like one Arrow at a time but then I sort

335
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,599
of started to have doubts when I was like well here's to a lifetime of arrows

336
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:03,319
or many at the same time and how do you know when you've pulled them all out and those types of

337
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:12,240
questions um but I think having faith in the process is part of removing them you

338
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,319
know you you're not going to find a discret point in time where they're all out but um I don't know that that was an

339
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:26,640
interesting one this kind of tests the the faith yeah yeah thank you this idea of

340
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,560
like oh my gosh how many how many arrows are there going to be non-stop arrows for the rest of my life that's just an

341
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:39,359
idea right and you use this word doubt right that's just an idea it turns out that once we start to get sensitive to

342
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:46,560
this it uh resistance just uh shows up so much less less and less and less yeah

343
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:52,040
yeah so thank you for highlighting this and when you talked about the five entrances I thought you were going to

344
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:59,240
talk about aversion because uh aversion is maybe in there too but uh yeah thank

345
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:04,599
you anybody else have a comment or

346
00:38:16,319 --> 00:38:22,000
question okay so I'm wishing you well now with the time change am I the only

347
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,760
one that's like feeling like oh it's something's not quite right

348
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,359
so I'm wishing you uh I don't know what to say a happy healthy time change I

349
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:39,040
don't know I'm wishing you a wonderful evening thank you
