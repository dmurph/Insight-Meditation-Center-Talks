1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,240
so good day and welcome to the arising of this

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,280
meditation session together and it'll now that it's in the process of

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:19,920
appearing it will persist for some minutes and

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,439
then it'll come to an end and this insight this appreciation

5
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:33,600
deep appreciation for the inconstancy of experience

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,559
is one of the specialties of insight meditation and to really begin to appreciate and

7
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,680
value and be attuned to how things are

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:53,120
how experiences how we experience things is a transient phenomenon

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,559
that the particularities of what we are aware of in the moment come and they go and

10
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,799
so some of the thoughts that you're already having now listening to what i'm saying but didn't

11
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,320
exist 10 minutes ago and then a few minutes ago then that they have appeared

12
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:20,080
and i'm sure someday they'll disappear as a current active thoughts that you have

13
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:26,080
and and there's something about observing or recognizing this transient

14
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,759
of experience that supports

15
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,759
a movement towards freedom freedom from being entangled in the transient

16
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:44,000
experiences freedom from the searching and looking and wanting to hold on to something

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:53,119
just letting go and and so there's many ways to experience

18
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,840
constancy you can be aware of how things arise that something new appears it was

19
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:07,200
unexpected unplanned and there's a sound there's a thought there's a feeling we could be aware that

20
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,599
things have passed things that were there now are gone and sometimes it can be a surprise where did

21
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,879
it go i've had physical pain in meditation

22
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:25,200
and then i don't know some point i was aware it was no longer there and i didn't see it pass away but i

23
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,840
certainly know now it's passed away and wow where did it go and

24
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,239
the and uh and it's not just uh you know the

25
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,319
experience that's you know things that we experience that arise in past but it's also the way in which we

26
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,080
experience them the fickle way in which attention and thoughts kind of focus on things

27
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,599
that we might be focused on the breathing and hang stay there pretty well but then there's

28
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:03,120
a loud sound and we say what's that and the sound has just arisen the thought what's that has just arisen

29
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:10,879
the thought i better find a quieter place to meditate has just arisen and then we're aware that that's passed

30
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:18,000
for a moment it's just a thought and because we don't lean into it and hold on to it we don't add another thought i should

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,159
find a better place to meditate i wonder what's a better place to meditate we take the time to recognize the first

32
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:31,120
thought it arose it was there a little bit and then it passed and

33
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:39,760
and if what i'm talking about you don't understand that you have the thought that doesn't understand that thought arose and then

34
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,239
maybe persists and then it passes and so it doesn't say that all things

35
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,879
are supposed to be quickly transient and constant the buddha talked about things arise

36
00:03:52,879 --> 00:04:01,040
they persist and they pass away but there's something about being attuned to how they arise

37
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:09,360
when they arise that they arise and that they pass is really the art of this and

38
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:16,160
and and part of it what's also interesting is that maybe we're not there to notice when

39
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,519
something has arisen but maybe we notice that our awareness of it

40
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,680
has now arisen we weren't exactly aware of it but oh i'm aware of it now and that

41
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,520
awareness has arisen and then at some point we it hasn't

42
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,199
passed away it persists but we've been focusing on something else we've gotten involved in a fantasy

43
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:46,800
and then we're aware that oh the awareness of that has ceased for a while and so there's

44
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,000
all these ways in which we see we're not supposed to search for seeing

45
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,600
arising and passing a phenomena as much as settle back and observe it

46
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:03,919
appreciate it be attuned to it in the way that it helps us to keep letting go keep

47
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,600
relaxing keep not getting involved with things and searching and wanting and making

48
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,759
things happen just settle back and the arising and passing of phenomena in all the ways

49
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:22,400
that can be experienced happens without our involvement without our making it so

50
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,759
and so to settle back and just observe and watch and watch

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,360
so taking a uh i would say maybe say differently

52
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:42,400
beginning with a new beginning of bringing attention to your posture

53
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,120
and adjusting your posture and be aware that as you do so there's

54
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,759
something new that keeps arising new sensations in the body new feelings

55
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,199
and then settling into this body

56
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:10,639
and if your eyes are still open there's the occurrence of closing your

57
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:17,440
eyes a new beginning or an

58
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,840
ending of the eyes being open

59
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,520
and the breathing itself is one of the great teachers for

60
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,240
inconstancy all the sensations that come and go with breathing

61
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,680
are coming and going arising and passing

62
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,919
and in some ways the constancy continuity of the inconstancy of breathing

63
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:59,039
is also a wonderful reference point for seeing the

64
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:05,039
inconstancy of the mind's ability to stay focused and present

65
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:14,240
the arising of new thoughts through persistence of them the changing nature of thoughts

66
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:21,039
thoughts themselves are not one constant hum but new thoughts ideas

67
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,919
images are constantly streaming through and to be attuned to the inconstancy of the

68
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:34,000
details of thinking as a way of

69
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:45,840
not clinging so much holding on

70
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,160
as you exhale relaxing the belly

71
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:12,479
softening the belly and being aware of changing sensations that come and go as you do so

72
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:27,840
as you exhale relaxing the chest

73
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,839
as you exhale softening the shoulders

74
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:55,839
some things pass if the tension relaxes and do things arise in the shoulders

75
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:04,880
softening the muscles of the face your dear face

76
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,040
softening relaxing giving it a break

77
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:28,640
and then gently maybe lovingly to relax your thinking mind

78
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,399
maybe on the exhale softening the brain or the forehead

79
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:40,160
the holding the contraction the searching the wanting

80
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,839
exhale and soften relax the whole body

81
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,000
and then taking that thinking mind of yours

82
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,480
and letting it rest settle back as if it's settling back against a

83
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:25,760
comfortable tree on a comfortable day

84
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:33,839
ready to observe the river flowing by

85
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:46,320
the flow of arising and passing a phenomenon

86
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:53,440
sometimes we're aware of sensations coming and going sometimes aware of our attention coming

87
00:10:53,440 --> 00:11:01,839
and going our thoughts coming and going

88
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,680
one way or the other something new is always arising

89
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:15,839
it's one way or the other something is always ceasing and passing away

90
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,839
and you can do all of this seeing all of this in the breathing

91
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,160
settling into your breathing maybe your breathing is the tree you're

92
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:36,079
leaning against resting in the breathing

93
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,839
floating on this river of change

94
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:57,839
in the body as you experience breathing changing sensations of breathing

95
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
so

96
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:49,839
foreign

97
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:17,760
there's a way that the arising appearing of new

98
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:25,840
something new in awareness supports not clinging to anything

99
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,320
there's a way in which the ceasing of things the passing of things

100
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:38,559
supports not clinging not holding on

101
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:44,160
if you stay close to how things are appearing and disappearing moment by

102
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:51,200
moment it can be a little bit like a massage for

103
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:58,720
the mind the mind's tendency to want and search for and

104
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,880
create think

105
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:11,280
just let go let go let go with the inconstant

106
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:21,840
the flow of inconstancy

107
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:03,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

108
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:17,840
one of the descriptions of mindfulness practice could be that it's being available

109
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:23,679
for the way in which life is ever renewing

110
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:30,880
ever-changing to be available for what arises that's

111
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,440
new by not lingering and holding on and

112
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:44,080
living with what has passed

113
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:51,679
it's a wonderful gift to give to others to be available for them as if they are

114
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:57,440
new as if they are renewed as if you don't know them

115
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,240
but they're appearing fresh without your

116
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:10,000
old news your old ideas about who they are and what

117
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,240
they've done and your expectations of how they should be

118
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:23,520
but to be available to see how people are ever new and

119
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,399
freed of their past

120
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,679
to be available

121
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:46,159
for the ever-renewing aspects of this life so that we can love and care and

122
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:52,799
be tenderized by what is happening moment by moment

123
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,640
so we can be sensitive to the depth of the present moment

124
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,320
sensitive to the depth of our contact with others

125
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,840
how they live in our lives

126
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,679
and this ability not to linger in the past or hold on to things

127
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:24,159
to be fresh is a wonderful basis upon which to care

128
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:30,559
for others and may it be that this practice of ours

129
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:37,840
helps us to care deeply because we feel deeply

130
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,840
into the newness of each moment

131
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:48,960
may all beings be happy

132
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:54,480
may all beings be safe

133
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:01,919
may all beings be peaceful

134
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:19,840
may all beings everywhere be free

135
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,559
you
