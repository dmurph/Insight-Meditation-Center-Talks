1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,960
so here we are at the beginning of a new

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,240
week and happy to start the week with uh

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:23,119
overall an expert exploration of delusion and but for now for this morning sitting

4
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:31,840
one of the hallmarks of the pasta practice is simplicity

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,440
and if there was a menindraji any

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:46,160
indian teacher that some of us knew i had the practice with

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:54,160
he um would say that if it's not simple it's not vipassana practice

8
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,160
and the relationship between the two can be in the meaning of vipassana as clear

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,680
seeing if there is not simplicity in the

10
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:12,400
perceptions then there's a

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:20,240
you know we don't perceive clearly if we don't see clearly there is no

12
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,000
wisdom and in fact some of the wisdom that we

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,520
practice with is wisdom about simplicity the tremendous value of of not getting

14
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,560
involved in planning or analyzing or trying to

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,360
figure out or trying to fix engineer or practice

16
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,399
even if something is doesn't seem to be going right in practice rather than spending a lot of time

17
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,000
trying to make it right the kind of the paradigm shift of the

18
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,759
pasta practice is to say well what would be the simplest way of

19
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:09,280
knowing this just knowing it and to have the wisdom to some way step

20
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:18,080
away and find some freedom some kind of independence

21
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,760
in the clear seeing and the beauty of it that and really the

22
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,400
word beauty is is really meant it's part of the tradition we'll talk about it later

23
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,840
the beauty is in the clarity of the seeing and the simplicity of the perception

24
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,640
the the clearness of the knowing and it's possible to know clearly for

25
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,840
example that i'm confused there's confusion here

26
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,200
this this is an experience that's complicated

27
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,120
i don't know what's happening

28
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:12,720
my mind seems to want to fix it run away or attack it or analyze it

29
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:20,800
and each of those little recognitions can be in itself have this beauty of clarities the beauty of simplicity

30
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,280
just knowing this just knowing this

31
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
so

32
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,400
we begin with the posture meditation posture and ideally

33
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:50,480
it's a simple posture over time practicing the same meditation

34
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:57,120
posture over and over again and the body makes small adjustments and

35
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:04,560
finds its way to a posture that is relatively easy to maintain

36
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,000
and become simple

37
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:19,120
so taking a little bit of time maybe swaying forward and back

38
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,440
left to right and it kind of until you find a kind of

39
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,080
center place where there's a balance

40
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,639
and then from if you're sitting upright from the sitting bones up the spine

41
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,160
making small adjustments

42
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:57,840
to have the weight of your body your torso centered on the vertebrae

43
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,400
and as they travel up the spine you come to where they're

44
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,600
neck last vertebrae connects with the skull

45
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:23,199
maybe you can create a little space there by lifting the head up or pulling the back of the head

46
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,918
slightly up and the chin slightly down

47
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:38,560
and then gently closing your eyes

48
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:46,720
and to establish a renewed connection familiarity

49
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:55,840
grounding in the breathing taking a few long slow deep breaths

50
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:03,199
three quarters full and gently breathing long breathing out

51
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:11,440
longer than you normally would not by forcing the breath out

52
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:21,840
but by releasing letting go

53
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,840
and letting your breathing return to normal

54
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,720
and scan through your body and as you exhale

55
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:54,000
if there's places in your body that you can relax muscles held in ways that you can

56
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:03,840
release relax the muscles

57
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:31,759
also you can see if you can exhale

58
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:45,840
relax the mind the thinking mind

59
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:00,639
and part of relaxing the mind is allowing the mind for these minutes of the meditation

60
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:08,639
to be simple simply with the present moment

61
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:18,160
and perhaps you can begin practicing a simple clear awareness

62
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,520
with your breathing

63
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,919
not being ambitious with your breathing or

64
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:41,839
trying to make anything happen except being with your breathing

65
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:55,839
with clarity and knowing with simplicity of attention

66
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,880
as if the fog has cleared and you can see clearly

67
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:10,160
as if the light has been turned on and you can see clearly

68
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:19,040
not what you think you should be seeing but whatever is easy

69
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:26,240
to experience in the breathing being content with what is easy

70
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:34,079
just as a place to be in the present appreciating simple

71
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
awareness

72
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,880
and if anything occurs that makes it difficult or it takes you away from breathing

73
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:05,360
experiment with how simple you can know it

74
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,440
so simple that you're not entangled with it

75
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,720
for or against it maybe more like a

76
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,879
feeling of awe or wonder

77
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:34,880
from the lack of complications lack of being for and against

78
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,240
just simple knowing

79
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:49,360
and after knowing it for a little bit begin again with your breathing

80
00:10:53,680 --> 00:11:02,079
being simple in the attention to breathing in

81
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:15,839
and breathing out

82
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:19,840
what is the simplest way you can know what's happening now

83
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,080
and then to keep it that simple

84
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,840
take refuge in that simplicity

85
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,559
simple knowing of what's happening

86
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:21,200
can provide wisdom one wisdom

87
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:27,200
is that getting more complicated about what's

88
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:37,200
happening loses some of that simplicity

89
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,200
loses some of the clarity

90
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:48,880
loses some of the absence of entanglement

91
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:57,440
the simpler the awareness the more clearly we can see how we lose

92
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,400
that simplicity that clarity

93
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,080
and as we come to the end of the sitting

94
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:21,120
the simplicity of being present can also reveal

95
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,480
the complexity that takes us away from our good will

96
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:35,840
our simplest basic human kindness

97
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:49,039
simplicity of knowing clarity of knowing

98
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:55,278
enables basic human kindness

99
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:02,399
to have a chance to be present gives it

100
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:07,200
a room and time and space

101
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:14,559
so it too can be available for how we meet the

102
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:21,039
world and so as we come to the end of the sitting

103
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:31,600
perhaps in whatever simplicity and clarity you have to open your heart

104
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:38,960
to the world and gaze upon the world

105
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:46,398
with kindness with goodwill

106
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,919
a generosity of spirit

107
00:28:53,279 --> 00:29:01,600
wishing may all beings be happy

108
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:07,600
may all beings be safe

109
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,080
may all beings be peaceful

110
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,480
may all beings be free

111
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,840
and may there be something from this morning's meditation

112
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:35,760
that supports each of us to contribute to that as a possibility

113
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:41,840
may we all live for the welfare and happiness of all beings

114
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:59,259
[Music]

115
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:18,799
so this week's theme following up on the last two weeks

116
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:26,000
is the third of the three unwholesome roots sometimes given the dramatic

117
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:35,200
name of the three poisons sometimes describes the three ways that

118
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:42,480
when firewood burns it burns itself so that these three fires sometimes are

119
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,679
called the three fires they arise out of us they burn from

120
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:55,679
us while they also burn us so these are greed hatred and delusion

121
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:03,840
or greed ill will and confusion we'll stay with for now with

122
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:14,399
the translation delusion and um

123
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,360
excuse me for a minute

124
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:36,080
so we'll state it now for now with a translation of delusion for mohawk m-o-h-a but as the pattern has been for

125
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,840
these last two weeks this first talk will not be about

126
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,880
unwholesome root of delusion but rather the opposite

127
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,840
and the tradition calls the opposite non-delusion

128
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:58,000
and it takes for many forms it's not just simply the absence of

129
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,600
something but think of it as the absence that allows the opposite to appear

130
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:11,519
and those many things are kind of the opposite so for example wisdom discernment vision clarity

131
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:17,840
understanding the tradition also has penetration

132
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:26,720
as the opposite so we'll talk a little bit more about this but for now i want to emphasize clarity

133
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,480
that rather than wisdom being necessarily a sophisticated under

134
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,159
understanding of things certainly understanding is part of it but so much of it

135
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:44,480
arises out of clarity clear seeing clear knowing clear perception

136
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,240
and and so this is something to really appreciate a

137
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,360
lot and celebrate it's such a sense of refreshment

138
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:01,200
and openness or peacefulness or simplicity or

139
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:08,638
brightness that that comes with non-delusion

140
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:15,839
um the maybe the most dramatic or the most powerful image or idea for

141
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:24,240
this idea of non-delusion is the idea of being awake and the word buddhism

142
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:31,118
could be translated more literally into english as awake-ism it's the ism it's the

143
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:38,720
religion of being awake of being non-deluded and

144
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:46,720
often often there's a strong association with um awakening is the ending of ignorance

145
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,960
it's a variation of delusion so um

146
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:00,000
the tradition talks about because these wonderful kind of analogies for non-delusion

147
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:07,119
one of them is um turning on the light that uh you we're in the dark and then

148
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,720
the light goes on and then we see clearly what's around us

149
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,320
the other is um

150
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:30,079
this non-delusion is not a passive thing but it becomes like a skilled guide that

151
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:35,760
leads us through the forest through the jungle someone who knows the forest the jungle

152
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:42,240
really well and they can just guide us through so the non-delusion

153
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:49,040
has a function of helping us to see the path of practice it shows us

154
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,359
you know where to practice where the practice is where the path is found

155
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:02,480
and the other analogy that's given is that of an arrow an a skilled archer who can shoot an

156
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,680
arrow and it penetrates whatever it is that is shot so that the idea of a skilled archer is

157
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,440
one who has really good eyesight really precise kind of ability to really

158
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:22,079
calmly stay present and see what's there and then really see through it see kind

159
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:28,800
of not just the projections not the bias not the preferences we have but to see through

160
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,800
all that penetrate all that so we see things clearly for what they are themselves

161
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,560
and i love this analogy of an archer because of a story that i maybe i've told this before

162
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:48,480
there was here in california a wonderful zen teacher who came from japan in the late 1960s

163
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:56,160
named koben chino and apparently in japan he'd studied the japanese art of archery

164
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:05,200
and so one day he was going to demonstrate his ritual or the practice of archery

165
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:13,520
at a retreat center on the coast here called eslan and eslin was kind of has big kind of

166
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:18,880
grass lawn or something on the edge of a cliff that overlooks the

167
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,160
pacific and so there are people gathered on the lawn to watch cole bencino

168
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:29,920
do his thing and he took a long time to get all ready and a lot of the ritual and all was the preparation of

169
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:37,359
getting himself centered and balanced and the feet just grounded and the spine straight and the head in the

170
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:44,480
right position and putting the the the arrow and the bow just the right way

171
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,680
and it took apparently a very long time to all the preparations getting ready

172
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:57,359
and and but he had such focus and such stillness and such quiet and such uh poise

173
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:02,720
that i think everyone felt concentrated everyone got pulled in everyone got very quiet

174
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,160
like this was a demonstration of i don't know

175
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:14,960
skillful elegance skillful concentration presence stillness

176
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,839
and then when he had the target clearly in his sight

177
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:28,640
he let the arrow go and it flew through the air

178
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:35,599
and it hit and penetrated his target perfectly bullseye

179
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:42,000
he had aimed for the pacific ocean and the arrow landed perfectly in it

180
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,160
but this idea of being poised and still in the archer who pen and pencil see is

181
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:54,560
clearly so there are these different words that associated with

182
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:01,440
non-delusion and one of them is to have discernment to really kind of make

183
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:09,200
distinction between what is uh wholesome and unwholesome skillful and unskillful what is helpful

184
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,320
and not helpful um or to say it you know to keep it so it's really simple

185
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:20,880
between what is harmful and what's beneficial and of course not also

186
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:27,200
easy to discern this but the greater the wisdom the more clearly that's discernible

187
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:33,839
and in the the in much of buddhist practice as we get wiser and

188
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:39,520
wiser or less and less delusion it's more obvious right in the moment

189
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:45,280
where the benefit is and where the non-benefit is so this ability to see that and that

190
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:51,599
also gives birth to the ability to have a vision for where the path is the

191
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:57,760
path of practice and it's to follow what's wholesome what's beneficial to

192
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,280
follow where the non-attachment is and the freedom is and uh and to have a vision for that

193
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:10,560
this part of this clarity this non-delusion and um it gives life a

194
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:16,880
kind of a kind of a purpose a kind of direction a kind of that can be quite powerful quite

195
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:23,040
meaningful partly because it's so freeing and so valuable

196
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:31,359
the um so this factor of wisdom

197
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:40,079
discernment vision understanding is said to be a beautiful state of mind

198
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:48,240
so in its when it's there it's not obscured or or fogged over

199
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,680
by confusion and guessing and analyzing and trying to figure out

200
00:40:53,680 --> 00:41:00,160
in and of itself the state of this clear awareness of wisdom is a beautiful

201
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,640
state of mind so whether there's brightness or clarity or illumination

202
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:11,440
simplicity all these things associated with it

203
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,599
as we practice uh buddhism it's sooner or later and sometimes maybe

204
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:23,200
it's later or sometimes it's sooner and later and in between we begin to slowly wake

205
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:31,760
up slowly discern see recognize this the mind's capacity for simplicity

206
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,880
for clarity for wisdom for understanding for discernment

207
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:43,119
not in a complicated way but it's obvious it's right there and one of the ways to see that and why

208
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:49,839
i'm starting the week on with this topic is that at some point we see the distinction

209
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:57,520
between a simple clarity a simple presence simple being aware of the present moment

210
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,440
and and a way of being that's more complicated maybe much more complicated

211
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:10,000
maybe we lose the present moment for entanglement in the past and the future

212
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,400
maybe we lose the simplicity because we've gotten very caught in our preferences with what

213
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,960
should be in the present moment or we're caught up in our fears and our analysis and securities around it

214
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,800
or we're caught up in our ill will our projections our bias in relationship to whatever we're

215
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,880
present for and but if we have a reference point

216
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:42,720
of clarity of wakefulness of wisdom

217
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,800
in all its many forms and some in one of its many forms any of its forms there's a reference point to see

218
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,839
how we lose that and we see that getting

219
00:42:53,839 --> 00:43:01,040
pulled into delusion pulled into projections and biases and and

220
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:09,200
kind of an overlay of opinions and uh on top of whatever we're seeing

221
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:15,440
including seeing ourselves and seeing other people that there's a loss there there's a

222
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:22,079
diminishment there there's a the the light gets turned off the um

223
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:29,359
we don't have this we lose our calm and we become agitated we lose

224
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:37,680
our guide we lose our ability to see where the path is and so then it becomes obvious

225
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:44,319
what much more obvious easier to see what delusion is easier to see

226
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:51,119
the disadvantage because we feel we see we recognize what we've lost we've lost

227
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:56,160
that clarity to start with a you know to try to see

228
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:01,280
and understand delusion um you know just just without any practice

229
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,880
at all then it becomes an analytical exercise it becomes like getting a clear definition of it

230
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:14,800
and applying that and looking at our mind and trying to say well this this is delusion that's what they're talking about and i'm not supposed to have it

231
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,240
and it's almost like you know getting complicated to free ourselves from the complication

232
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:27,599
of delusion but if we have if we're settled calm peaceful non-agitated there's a

233
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:33,599
basic clarity of mind then we have a very different reference point for recognizing

234
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:41,040
delusion including the reference point the understanding that we don't have to get be feel

235
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,400
ashamed or feel angry or feel upset by the movement

236
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,520
to into delusion all we have to do is to recognize it as delusion

237
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:58,000
and the simple recognition the clear recognition oh this is delusion brings us back to some of

238
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:06,880
that clarity and so it's not a moralistic critique of delusion it's it's a clear recognition

239
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:14,560
knowing clear knowing of the disadvantage of being pulled into it and we know that the alternative not

240
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:20,799
being diluted is so much better so much more satisfying

241
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:27,520
so the wisdom so

242
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:34,480
it gives us the opportunity to have uh have non-delusion about delusion

243
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:41,359
to have wisdom about delusion and in some ways this is

244
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:46,880
central to the buddhism enterprise so it's not wisdom about wisdom so much

245
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:53,839
but freedom is found in wisdom about delusion and that'll be the topic for tomorrow so

246
00:45:53,839 --> 00:46:01,519
thank you all very much and look forward to our time tomorrow
