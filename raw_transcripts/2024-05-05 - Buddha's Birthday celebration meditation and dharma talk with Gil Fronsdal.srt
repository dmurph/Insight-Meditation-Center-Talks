1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:07,639
so good morning welcome and can you hear me okay

2
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:14,559
great so welcome to IMC and also to the Buddha's birthday celebration that we're

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,160
having today it's the

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:26,519
uh this the terad and Buddhist tradition we're in tends to do things

5
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:33,120
simply and so they just roll all the special days of the Buddha's life into

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,079
the same day so it's celebrating the Buddha's birth the Buddha's Enlightenment and

7
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:48,000
then Buddha's passing away each of them that are classically or traditionally depicted as

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:55,039
peaceful events uh his birth was depicted very peacefully the mother standing under a

9
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,800
tree holding a branch and uh the Buddha was born

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:08,400
peacefully and immediately took seven steps he began his walking meditation

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:16,799
right away and uh his Enlightenment of course was uh he was presented with lots of

12
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,200
challenges and uh and we're all presented with

13
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:30,000
challenges as we kind of Reach the the the greatest potential all of us have

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,079
have to be really discover a non-conflicting peace and he found that peace in his

15
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:46,000
Awakening and then his death is depicted as being very peaceful that he knew he was dying he knew his time was near he

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,479
laid himself down between two Sal trees beautiful trees in India and uh they say that out of season

17
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,399
the Sal trees uh burst into flowers and they they fell around him and all that

18
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,600
and he just he gave his last teachings to his uh people who were

19
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,080
there and he did a very respectful thing he said I'm about to die and do you have

20
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:17,640
any last questions you really want to ask this is your chance make sure that they were settled

21
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:25,000
and they said no we we have no questions and then um he went into deep meditation

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,040
and uh went through different kind of cycles of depth and meditation and and

23
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:37,160
at some point going through those Cycles um he passed away in a very peaceful

24
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:42,840
way so we celebrate the Buddha's birthday as a way of um you know

25
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:49,239
respecting the phenomenal thing this man discovered and um and I think of it I

26
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,319
think it was 1950s I forget to his name but it was said earlier than that that

27
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,599
it was impossible for human being to run uh a mile and less than a less than a

28
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:06,920
minute and then the 1950s there was someone who broke that limit and uh and

29
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:14,599
then after that um lots of people did because now was pum showed it was

30
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:22,400
possible the buddha showed it was possible to be free to let go in such a

31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:30,159
deep profound way that we can experience a profound um goodness of our hearts

32
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:37,959
profound capacity for the heart to be at ease loving peaceful and uh and we don't have to

33
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:44,120
live in the grips of our inner conflicts our inner fears our inner ways in which

34
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:51,599
we carry the weight of burden of our society and of our family and of our

35
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,879
personal history it's possible to release the Yoke that we carry and to be

36
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:04,079
free and to do that in a way that we we Keeps Us deeply connected to this world

37
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:10,640
of ours the Buddha even though he was totally liberated um stayed for 45 years

38
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:18,320
deeply connected to a society of his time teaching and supporting and guiding and being a counselor for many many

39
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,520
people in their lives and so uh one of the first early

40
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,720
teachings I received about the Buddha statue I heard the story of of uh

41
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:36,039
someone asked Suzuki roshi the founder of San Francisco Zen Center why do we bow to the

42
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:43,520
Buddha and he said because then we're bowing to ourselves uh that somehow that act is

43
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:51,120
not meant to be submissive act towards some person who lived long long ago but really

44
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:59,199
honoring and respecting something in ourselves our potential our possibility are in a sense capacity for freedom and

45
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:06,960
peace our inner buddhahood that's waiting for us and uh and this idea that the Buddha

46
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:14,240
that for those now 2500 years later the Buddha represents or or maybe not doesn't

47
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,160
represent but is a kind of a mirror for us that when we look at the Buddha we

48
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,000
see ourselves is the idea and uh I can pretty confidently say that all the

49
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,039
depictions we have of the Buddha are someone's

50
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:39,919
fantasy we don't really know what he looked like and um and so um you know so

51
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:48,240
and as Buddhism goes through different cultures uh the Buddha kind of has the facial features of that culture and uh

52
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,520
the earliest Buddha images were made in uh the

53
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,960
Greek colonies kingdoms of Afghanistan and Pakistan the legacy of V the great

54
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,800
conquering that part of the world and so the earliest depiction some of the earliest ones uh the Buddhist images

55
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,479
look very Greek and then they were then they came with Indian pictures and Cambodian and

56
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:19,360
Chinese and you know on and on so I like to believe it's because

57
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,319
everyone sees themselves in a very profound way our potential our

58
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:33,199
capacity and um and I was recently in Japan some of the Shinto shrines on

59
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,639
their altar did not didn't didn't have images of any kind of being but had

60
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,520
mirrors and uh and when I asked why is a mirror there and they I said oh so you

61
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:50,160
can see yourself on the altar is that be

62
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,840
wonderful the some of the teachings of Buddhism and you know these um teachers

63
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:02,759
like me sometimes overdo certain teachings like let go let go just about letting go it's all about letting go

64
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:09,199
just let go and uh or sometimes if we go a little bit further we might say let go because

65
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,720
there's no self just like let go of the self let go of the self and um and maybe

66
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,840
there's something good about those teachings occasionally or at the right time there might be quite profound but

67
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,199
um but what gets lost in that is that the teachings of the Buddha much of

68
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:33,879
Buddhism has a profound respect for each individual each person is a valuable

69
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:39,280
human being and we have a certain dignity a certain dignity that can grow

70
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:46,840
into it nobility and uh and it isn't that we're supposed to kind of become Mr Nobody

71
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,360
it's a character from the 60s Mr Natural that uh you know just sits there and is

72
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,720
nobody but um but that um uh we're

73
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,479
letting go of all the things that diminishes our value all things that we we deprecate ourselves or diminish

74
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:10,919
ourselves or limit ourselves and one of the ways we do that of course is with conceit and um

75
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:18,400
thinking we're really special but we're not supposed to then feel like we're not special we are important we are valuable

76
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:25,520
so we'll see in a minute in a few minutes that the uh children are going to bring in the Pagoda where in which

77
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:32,080
the baby Buddha will be standing and that's usually the centerpiece of the ceremony

78
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:38,440
here and um and it's um and uh you if you go up and look

79
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,839
closely you see that the statue uh the standing Buddha and he has one finger

80
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,480
pointing to the sky and one finger pointing to the Earth and that's because

81
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,959
U you know after he did his seven steps for he was born and took seven steps

82
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:02,440
walking meditation or something uh and then he stopped and he pointed to to to the sky and point to the Earth and he

83
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:11,320
said because he was kind of Prodigy I guess he said um Heaven above Earth

84
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:20,560
Below I alone am the honored one now you know that sounds pretty

85
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:26,040
conceited and um but I think uh it's a it's kind of a myth you know he he it

86
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:32,079
didn't happen that way but uh but what it um represents I think and what I

87
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:38,519
teach the children is that each of us should be able to say that for ourselves and we each of us can

88
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:45,640
recognize that everyone else can say it for themselves as well so it isn't like holding ourselves above everybody else

89
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:51,519
but everyone is the most special one and so to see each other that way and see

90
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,079
ourselves that way and this Heaven above and Earth Below pointing to for me also points to

91
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:03,399
the way in which the Buddha as a bridge not the Buddha but our practice puts us

92
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:09,519
as a bridge between these uh variety of or middle way between a variety of

93
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:16,640
different places we can go we can be deeply embodied grounded here and we can

94
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,839
soar in vast uh ethereal kind of dimensions of

95
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:29,480
the Mind in meditation and uh and if you choose one or the other you're in trouble

96
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:37,000
but uh our practice our mindfulness is the bridge is the connection where we can be in both standing there present

97
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,440
Within These different dimensions of who we are our deep kind of way in which

98
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:48,000
meditation takes us into this very personal world but also takes us into a

99
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,240
phenomenal connection to the people around us and the mindfulness is that bridge that can do both and hold both

100
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,000
and find the middle way between them all so I think it there ways of interpreting

101
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,560
this idea of pointing to the sky pointing to the Earth pointing to and saying I alone am the most honored one

102
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:16,079
that it's saying something profound about each of us and so the idea is to see ourselves in this the statue here is um but what's

103
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,480
what we have we have here is here right now is on the top is the Buddha in the

104
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:28,639
in the moment in his Enlightenment time of his Enlightenment the on the laying down is actually he's not sleeping he's

105
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:36,519
dying it's a statue of his last days and the children will bring in the baby Buddha and the POA to put it here and

106
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:43,880
then uh on the wall is a tanka CH Tibetan painting of the historical

107
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:50,079
Buddha as he um renounces his royalty

108
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,600
renounces the life of privilege and wealth and power uh for something that's

109
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,839
even more wonderful better than that and he found in a life of radical Simplicity

110
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:09,440
that was not bolstered by wealth and power and and status and praise that

111
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,639
often comes with that kind of Royal life and uh so he's renouncing all that

112
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:23,519
and um and uh and the little footnote to that how I have that is that uh the S

113
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,199
when I got my wife and I were married at this at the San Francisco Zen Center at the green Gulch Gardens in the outdoor

114
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:34,519
was there some 40 some 30 some years ago and

115
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:42,279
um and that was the wedding gift from San Francisco Zen Center getting married and the gift was

116
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:49,800
the picture of the Buddha renouncing and so maybe that's also

117
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:56,279
presenting us with this bridge this kind of two sides and remember the two both sides are here both sides are

118
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:04,399
important and um so that's how I have it and um so the children were told that

119
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,360
story about the heaven above Earth Below story and I alone the world honored one

120
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,720
then they they they made this pagota that they're they carry in here in a couple of

121
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:22,040
minutes and um and we'll do a little bit of um

122
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:29,279
ritual this is the today is like high church at IMC and so we'll do a little a little

123
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,480
bit of we'll chant the refuges and uh those of you who don't know the refuges

124
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,160
uh just listen and take it in and and um I'll say that I'll I'll we'll do the

125
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:47,399
precepts in a certain kind of simple ways because the kids are here uh and then um and then at some point um and

126
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:53,839
there'll be some s some song that um that uh the kids will sing coming in and

127
00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:01,480
then also that uh we'll do here as part of all this and then when it's over everyone's invited Ed to come up and um

128
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:08,399
wash the baby Buddha there's two ladles and he's sitting in a bowl with water and you come up and you wash him and and

129
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,720
um and then probably you should consider that you're really washing

130
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,480
yourself and what is it that you could wash away is anything unusual in you

131
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:25,560
that um some of us have some unusual things some Oddities that maybe would be

132
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,800
kind of nice to wash away let go of so that's kind of the

133
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,199
idea so so you might need to move a little

134
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,880
bit aside

135
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,389

136
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:04,880

[Music] yeah yeah it goes right great thank you

145
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,240
for bringing the Buddha in and thank you so much and we have the ladles in there

146
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:09,319
too fantastic we have both of them there

147
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:14,839
great so so this is the baby Buddha has been brought in a certain symbolic way

148
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:22,040
he just got born and uh and these these wonderful families help bring him to birth and

149
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:30,079
every day we bring the Buddha to life if we practice and live with loving kindness and compassion and and

150
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:35,120
appreciative joy and equinity and uh thank you all for making

151
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:43,680
the pagot and bringing the Buddha to us and um the uh for the Buddha represents

152
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:50,800
some of the most uh beautiful things in a human heart and families have some of

153
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,880
that beauty when they love each other and uh I thought maybe I didn't ask her

154
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:04,678
to do it but you probably going do it without preparation the love mix a family song absolutely so this is a song

155
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:11,240
that was sung at the Spirit Rock Family Retreat for years and there was this

156
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:18,520
wonderfully dignified I love him Abbot a terad manast monk named aan

157
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,839
pasano originally from Canada and uh he's one of my most inspiring monks that

158
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:31,080
I know in his Simplicity and ordinariness and ordinariness and dedication to practice and presence and

159
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,320
that tradition that monastic tradition he's in they're supposed to carry themselves in a certain

160
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,760
decorum and they're not supposed to sing certainly not dance and do things

161
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,320
like that and so some of the things that happened in the family retreat was not quite what monastics

162
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:53,440
do but uh he would sit sometimes in the front of the hall and Betsy Rose would

163
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:59,720
sing these songs and she sang the song that um that uh Carla's about to sing

164
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,400
and he would sit there with complete upright dignity he looks like with tears

165
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:12,000
streaming down his eyes this cheek unselfconsciously just like letting

166
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:18,600
them so but's let's do it because uh the baby Buddha really represents the love

167
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:25,320
and the best qualities that we can have as as family as a human family

168
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:41,600
and you want to show the [Music]

169
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,640
oh I don't think I could do that yeah so that the yeah so the hand

170
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,159
signs mean that this means love love

171
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:59,720
makes a family a family it's like two little birds making an S together

172
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:06,880

family thank you yeah so that's just the kind of the anthem of the children

197
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:36,760
program here and Spirit Rock and and uh my kids went through that and and uh

198
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:42,240
when my son went off to college uh he went and found all of Betsy Rose's songs

199
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:51,960
to listen to in the dorms these songs so um so then uh we'll chant the

200
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,400
refuges and I think enough of you know it and if you don't it's just take it in

201
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:06,279
and this is a uh going for Refuge is um the the word in PO is to walk literally so one walks

202
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:11,640
uh to what's as a refuge what's as a support what is a protection what is an

203
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:19,159
inspiration here in the Dharma and the Buddha and the S and this is also meant to be found in yourself it's not like

204
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:25,600
something outside mystical that's supposed to do it for you but really something that is generated by our

205
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:32,600
practice and our own goodness that we all have that that's um we is mirrored by the Buddha

206
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:39,000
to us we have a amazing potential so um so we'll chant so

207
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,960
usually you don't have to put your hands together but that's the tradition and usually there's a citation

208
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,200
to the Buddha first so

209
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,839
[Music]

210
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,200
budas budas

211
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:52,209
[Music]

212
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:59,279
Bud s s

213
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:21,400
[Music]

214
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,960
sang

215
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:38,200
[Music]

216
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:47,160
[Music]

217
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:55,520
[Music] s

218
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:04,720
so one of the ins for me inspiring

219
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,000
things I've heard some teachers say and directly and it's a common thing for

220
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,320
some teachers to say this so it's not new but is that someone come a student

221
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,320
someone is practitioner comes to the teacher and says I'm so grateful and uh I want to do something

222
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:29,640
for you what can I do for you and the teacher says practice

223
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:36,600
that's what you can do that's and so practice includes living an ethical life

224
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:44,440
and so what can you do for the Buddha if we feel grateful for what the Buddha did we can live an ethical life and it's not

225
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:51,080
just for the Buddha sake but there's a Buddha in you maybe waiting for you maybe you have a little taste and hints

226
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:58,080
of it at times and that's e and it's an ethical place it's an ethical quality of

227
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:07,640
what what's deep inside or most integral in who we are so in the sense when we do the precepts it's um it's to

228
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,159
celebrate uh this possibility or this potential this truth about who we are

229
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:22,279
that's there either we know it or it's waiting for us so um so uh I will uh

230
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:29,000
lead this chant and so I'll do it in two parts for each one and and you can

231
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,480
repeat after me if you'd like and uh but it has a little bit more value of what

232
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,320
we're doing here today than it just doing it for yourself there's children in our midsts and what a great thing for

233
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:47,320
children to hear grown-ups have this kind of inspiration to live by the

234
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,960
precepts this is pretty good so

235
00:27:52,960 --> 00:28:00,360
um for the sake of our lives together for the sake our Liv

236
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:07,039
together I commit to not harm I commit to not

237
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,000
harming for the sake of our life together for the sake of our life

238
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,799
together I commit to not stealing I commit to not stealing for the sake of

239
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:26,320
our life together for the sake of our lives together I commit to respecting

240
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:33,600
the body and hearts of others I to Respec the and hearts of others for

241
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,159
the sake of our life together for the sake of our life together I commit not

242
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:46,120
to lie I commit not to lie for the sake of our life together for the S of our

243
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:53,000
life together I commit to not intoxicating myself so I'm

244
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,240
crazy myself

245
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:12,360
so now uh we have uh car so Carla's going to teach us one song the other

246
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:19,720
brara song and then once we get the hang of it the song then uh the family the

247

249
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:37,240

250
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:44,919
the Buddha three times and it and that's a way of that's a way of cleaning your

251
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:50,880
heart and uh so um so so we'll learn the song and once we've learned it and keep
