1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,960
so again welcome welcome everybody and uh Happy New Year

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,000
I get to say that like with confidence today happy New Year you know sometimes as the days go on you don't know is it

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,279
still okay to say happy new year but here I am on the

4
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:28,480
first and so of course like on the New Year's Day often just marks A New

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:34,320
Beginning often obviously a new year but it's not uncommon for us to set new

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:41,600
intentions I have this idea I'm going to do this out of the other thing I'm going to finally eat more

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,000
fiber exercise more meditate more you like all these things that uh we say

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,239
that we're going to do and I couldn't help myself I have found myself this past week thinking oh I I should do this

9
00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,559
I should do that so and then I would little chastise myself a little bit like oh d just

10
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,760
because it's the beginning of the year doesn't mean you have to set these

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,840
resolutions but it's a a time of the year of maybe new beginnings and we might think of these

12
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:20,040
Beginnings in a number of different ways and in Buddhism in this practice we

13
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,240
tend to talk more about endings than

14
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:32,799
Beginnings the ending of suffering right this path of practice is all about the ending of suffering like no longer

15
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:40,399
having the confusion or the sense of it's just not right

16
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:47,560
somehow or we teach about uh impermanence how thing nothing is lasting forever it's always

17
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:54,640
ending things are transient all experiences are transient of course they

18
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:02,399
are but implicit in these teachings even if it's not EXP explicit is this idea of

19
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:10,640
Beginnings we see this showing up again and again for me often when I'm giving a

20
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,640
guided meditation even if I'm like sometimes I'll give a guided meditation to myself

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,599
sometimes I even will use a little uh voice to myself if I'm feeling particularly like

22
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,920
unsettled but I often hear myself saying either out loud or to myself sometimes

23
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,480
if you find yourself lost in thought begin again just simply Begin Again know

24
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,959
this idea of it doesn't matter how many times you've been lost in thought of

25
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:48,440
what the mind has been doing you always just very simply just come back to the

26
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,720
breath and it's doesn't matter how many times we have to do that

27
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,840
10,000 10 million 1,100 whatever

28
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,000
it also doesn't matter like how long we've been away lost in

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,920
thought 10 seconds 10 minutes 10 hours it also that be holds for our

30
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:18,720
meditation practice like even just coming to the cushion maybe you haven't meditated in years maybe you haven't

31
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:26,400
meditated in months weeks days whatever it is we can always begin

32
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:33,879
again and in some ways it's even to be um really

33
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:41,439
valued there's this of course probably many of you know this book by shenu

34
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:47,040
Suzuki Zen mind beginner's mind this recognition that in the

35
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,879
beginner that there's this possibility there's some opening whereas the expert has this idea

36
00:03:53,879 --> 00:04:00,560
of like oh yeah I have everything I I got it I I don't need to learn anything new

37
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,280
this is kind of um exemplified by this

38
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:13,519
story of a Zen or I should say Buddhist Professor

39
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:20,479
going to the Zen master and saying you know I I understand a lot about uh Buddhism but I

40
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,840
I'd like to learn something from you and the Zen master says great thank you yeah

41
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,080
welcome come on in here have a cup of tea

42
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:38,680
and the Zen master offers the professor a cup zen master gets the cattle of tea

43
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,800
and pours and pours and pretty soon the

44
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,639
Tea's coming up near the top and starts to overflow and the professor's like wait wait wait it's overflowing and the

45
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:56,759
Zen master said the cup is like your mind you think that you have all the answers there is no room for anything

46
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:05,039
else there's no room for me to pour anything in in there so this idea of Beginnings being

47
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:11,560
valued and not only are they value just an encouragement to always come back

48
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:16,880
begin again and of course this whole idea of beginning is part of this uh

49
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:25,080
notion of cultivation whether we're cultivating mindfulness or loving kindness or our ethical

50
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,080
conduct showing up with truthfulness and not causing harm

51
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,400
of course that has some beginning

52
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,960
too so maybe I'm like uh saying again and again this word about beginning but

53
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:51,000
I also want to share something about the Buddha and his Beginnings some of the ways in which his

54
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,199
the story of the Buddha's Awakening shows up we tend

55
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:02,680
to idealize the Buddha beautiful fantastic thing to

56
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,400
do we can also emphasize maybe some of the things that we where he didn't take

57
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:15,720
a clear straight line that his Beginnings maybe weren't

58
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:22,080
as obvious or straightforward as we might

59
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:31,479
imagine a story of his seeking for awakening is that he became dismayed

60
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:40,199
with the life that he was living even though it had so much uh opulence and luxury and sensual

61
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:46,680
Pleasures probably anything that was available there at that time in Ancient

62
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,639
India and he became dismayed with this after

63
00:06:52,639 --> 00:07:00,639
seeing someone who was old someone who was sick and a corpse

64
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:09,400
recognizing that that was going to happen in his life also so instead he set out to seek the

65
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:18,160
Supreme state of sublime peace the Supreme state of sublime

66
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,960
peace AUM

67
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:32,039
sidam so I went in a with some teachers and learned about some meditation practices and excelled at

68
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,919
them still hadn't found this state of sublime

69
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:44,319
peace then he did some extreme asceticism still didn't find these

70
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:50,240
states of sublime piece then he does the middle

71
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:57,000
way not extreme austerities not extreme

72
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:03,960
opulence and sits under a Bo tree to discover this Sublime

73
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,360
piece and he

74
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,560
does I like this expression Sublime peace in some ways I think it's all what

75
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:22,560
we're looking for place where we can

76
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:31,720
rest have some security a sense of like maybe like this final

77
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:40,360
exhale but the Buddha he had to find his way it wasn't so clear exactly how to

78
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:46,000
get there so his beginning of his seeking wasn't always you know just a

79
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,040
clear straight line he knew exactly how to get there and didn't waver didn't do

80
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:57,200
anything else took him a number of years many

81
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:05,440
years so then he is awakened and then he doesn't begin to

82
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,920
teach the story is that he hesitates he's like how am I going to

83
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:18,000
explain this there are so many people that just wouldn't understand this

84
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,120
and he decides to not

85
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,160
teach and the tradition holds that there is a special classification of individ

86
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,360
ual like this they're called Pacha Buddhas the Pacha Buddhas are those

87
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:40,800
individuals that become completely awakened through their own um without

88
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:49,200
having heard any teachings and declin to teach it's a valid path not everybody is

89
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:55,079
intended to be a teacher but then there's some

90
00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:01,959
intervention and the story is that some divine

91
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:08,440
intervention comes down and says no but you must teach and so he

92
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,839
does and as I mentioned the other day when I was talking about uh

93
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:25,519
impermanence just mention briefly that he first teaches this former practitioners these uh group of five

94
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:32,640
that he had been practicing austerities with and when he approaches them they all

95
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,839
agree amongst themselves but we're not going to treat him with respect we will

96
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:44,680
acknowledge Him but we will not treat him with respect because he gave up the

97
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:51,440
austerities and is now living in luxury so when he shows up the group of

98
00:10:51,440 --> 00:11:00,160
five speak to him and a what the what the Buddha considers a disrespectful way

99
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:08,760
but then he convinces them that um no in fact he is awakened and that they should listen to

100
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:16,600
him and he gives them teachings and even for them who have the

101
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,639
Buddha who's you know just freshly awakened it takes them quite some time

102
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:26,720
to become awakened the story is of how they had to go out repeatedly for Ms

103
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:33,120
rounds so days and some of them would go out for Ms and

104
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,000
come back and get food for all the rest before these group of five are

105
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,920
awakened and then the sixth person that the Buddha meets and gives a teaching to

106
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,320
his yasa who is this lay person like

107
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:57,959
us the Buddha gives him some teachings he becomes

108
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:03,600
awakened these individuals had been practicing austerities like extreme

109
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:11,959
austerities took them quite some time a lay person like us got in

110
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:21,199
immediately we might wonder why is that I don't know we can

111
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:27,120
speculate maybe the Buddha was still learning how to teach and maybe his

112
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,320
teaching wasn't the best for he group of five maybe these group of five in order

113
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:40,560
to do such extreme austerities you have to have a rigidness you have to have a

114
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:48,800
fundamentalist you have to have a very um kind of like narrow way in which to live right to do

115
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:54,040
extreme to do the type of austerities or you know starving

116
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,800
oneself for example whereas at l person doesn't have

117
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:06,639
that they have this little bit more flexibility of mind trying things and seeing things

118
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,800
experiencing different things and I'll come back to this later

119
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:17,880
about the teachings that yasa received that helped him to become

120
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:24,000
awake but before I do that I want to also just say of course we have all had

121
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
our own Beginnings with practice

122
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,800
I remember the first time I ever sat down to meditate I was uh on a Meditation

123
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:45,360
Retreat I thought I knew how to meditate but actually I didn't I had done yoga

124
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:52,240
and I thought lying down on the floor with eyes closed for a couple of minutes was meditating but I had a hard time on

125
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,440
that first retreat but you know that was the beginning of my practice all of you had

126
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,279
a beginning the beginning of maybe reading the

127
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:11,759
Dharma Dharma book or hearing a a podcast or app or com to a dma

128
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,920
talk but one thing about Beginnings is that they're about

129
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:27,800
change something new when I was working in Corporate

130
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:35,639
America there was a time in which uh there's a lot of planning happening about some changes that were going to

131
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:41,360
happen and you know to you know make certain improvements

132
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:48,880
and and I remember this one individual saying to a group of us saying you know

133
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,920
if we're going to make changes in how the department does things if we're going to make

134
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,120
changes this means you actually have to

135
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,560
change and I remember at that moment feeling like oh I was just kind of

136
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,440
hoping I could stay exactly the way I was kind of comfortable with the way things

137
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,279
are but this recognition of like oh yeah if things are going to be

138
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:25,800
different it's going to be a little bit uncomfortable have to get out of the

139
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,600
usual and do something new

140
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,079
and pointing to that I'd like to read a poem about Beginnings it's written by

141
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:43,920
John odonahue an Irish poet and it points to

142
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:51,399
this about this the beginning the new the new year whatever it is that's going

143
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:57,600
to begin for you and it starts this

144
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,880
way in out of the way places of the heart

145
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:10,279
where your thoughts never think to wander this beginning has been quietly

146
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:17,360
forming waiting until you are ready to emerge for a long time and has watched

147
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:24,560
your desire feeling The Emptiness growing inside you noticing how you w

148
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,880
yourself on still unable to leave what you had

149
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:36,880
outgrown it watched you play with the seduction of safety and the gray

150
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,639
promises that sameness whispered heard the waves of turmoil

151
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,880
rise and relent wondered would you always live like

152
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:55,720
this then the Delight when your courage kindled and out you stepped onto new

153
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:02,759
ground your eyes young again with energy and dream a path of plenitude opening

154
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,918
before you though your destination is not yet

155
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:13,079
clear you can trust the promise of this

156
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:19,000
opening and furl yourself into the grace of

157
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,079
beginning this is at one with your life's

158
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:32,880
desire awaken your spirit to Adventure hold nothing back learn to find ease in

159
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:41,440
Risk soon you will be home in a new Rhythm for your soul senses the world

160
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,559
that awaits you this

161
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:50,960
encouragement for a

162
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:59,600
beginning I appreciate that in this first stanza is this line this beginning

163
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,120
has been quietly

164
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:11,520
forming there's less emphasis on Willpower and brute strength and I got

165
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:18,360
to do this I should do this instead there's this feeling of something that's

166
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:25,679
growing something that's finding its way maybe like those little blades of

167
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:32,440
grass that show up in the side walk or after a rain there little mushrooms that

168
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:39,880
just pop up everywhere are just so delightful kind of unexpectedly and the lawn and the wood

169
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:48,919
or the a log that has fallen down whatever whatever we see it the beginning that is quietly

170
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:57,000
forming so there's more of this emphasis on allowing and this unfolding unfurling

171
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,640
this growing instead of okay I should do this I'm

172
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,880
going to make this happen you know that lasts for as long as it

173
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:18,320
lasts but instead this pointing to something that's you know that's naturally forming and that can

174
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:24,960
grow and this poem also includes these lines it watched you play with a

175
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:31,720
seduction of safety and the gray promises that

176
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:37,559
sameness whispered the gray promises that

177
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:45,080
sameness whispered and the seduction of

178
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,159
safety how often have our reality doesn't match the

179
00:19:52,159 --> 00:20:01,640
promise buy this do this you'll be happy and it turns out that it

180
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,440
doesn't but instead kind of like tuning in or you know becoming sensitive to

181
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,679
what's happening inside us this and allowing that to unfold and and

182
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,600
furl this does carry this some of this

183
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:26,840
promise for something new a new beginning but maybe it's not neat and

184
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:33,880
tidy Maybe it's not even clear what it is maybe like the Buddha we start going

185
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:40,760
One Direction and realize no that doesn't work okay I'm going to go this direction oh yeah that doesn't work

186
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:47,120
either but there's this kind of honoring of something inside this uh

187
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,720
seeking this Sublime piece maybe there's something inside of

188
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,120
you that's showing or Whispering something

189
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,360
something about Sublime

190
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,480
peace this poem says though your destination is not yet clear you can

191
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:17,360
trust the promise of this opening trust the promise of this

192
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:23,880
opening my practice is all about opening it's kind of like this gesture

193
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:29,799
of like letting go it's not the gesture of tightening

194
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:36,840
up and so often there can be the sense of straining okay I got to do

195
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,919
this I know that um I had this idea on a

196
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,480
long retreat that I I supposed to get really

197
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:54,559
concentrated I had this idea in my mind okay this is a long retreat and this is why people go on Long Retreats as to get

198
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:01,279
concentrated I strained so much I went a little off the

199
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:09,400
rails and the teachers are like okay Diana stop meditating and just go outside and go you need to spend hours

200
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:15,279
out hiking amongst the trees and just kind of loosen up I just got so tense

201
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:21,720
and tight and I don't know closed down thinking you know that that was the way

202
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,440
to get concentrated it turns out that's if you

203
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:33,360
want to have the mind be settled there has to be

204
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:41,440
openness the sense of well-being is an integral ingredient it's it's not

205
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,400
optional the sense of well-being and how we Define well-being maybe shifts and

206
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:54,559
changes and as we practice but it's part of what supports

207
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,960
this uh seeking for Sublime peace for all of us

208
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:09,039
I'll read this poem again in out of the way places of the

209
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:17,360
heart where your thoughts never think to wander this beginning has been quietly

210
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:25,120
forming waiting until you were ready to emerge for a long time it has watched

211
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,960
your desire feeling that emptiness growing inside you noticing how you

212
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:37,960
willed yourself on still unable to leave what you had

213
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,720
outgrown it watched you play with the seduction of safety and the gray

214
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:50,720
promises that sameness whispered heard the waves of turmoil rise and relent

215
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:56,200
wondered would you always live like

216
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:03,400
this then the Delight when your courage kindled and out you stepped onto new

217
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:10,640
ground your eyes young again with energy and dream a path of plenitude opening

218
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:22,120
before you though your destination is not yet clear you can trust the promise of this

219
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:29,799
opening unfurl yourself into the grace of beginning

220
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:37,919
this is at one with your life's desire awaken your spirit to

221
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,559
Adventure hold nothing back learn to find ease in

222
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:48,799
Risk soon you will be home in a new

223
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:56,000
Rhythm for your soul senses the world that awaits

224
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:04,039
you and again that poem is for A New Beginning by John odonahue

225
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:10,720
and you might say Okay D it that that sounds interesting I want to begin but I

226
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,520
I really don't know where or what or I'm not

227
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:24,960
sure maybe there's something inside of you but you're don't have a clear sense of what to begin or how to

228
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,399
begin I'll offer the teaching that the Buddha gave to

229
00:25:31,399 --> 00:25:38,480
yasa the first lay person that became awakened and what was the first teaching

230
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:45,919
that the Buddha gave to this person in which he also gave to yes's

231
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:52,840
father and then two women and they all became awakened so what was this first

232
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:59,320
teaching generosity this generosity this sense of

233
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:08,720
opening this sense of Letting Go this sense of not holding in not uh

234
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:15,440
clinging but instead you know this this this gesture of

235
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,000
sharing being generous of spirit if somebody makes a mistake not

236
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:29,600
just immediately pointing it out to them if maybe it doesn't really matter so much

237
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:38,039
the generosity of giving somebody the benefit of the doubt thinking that doesn't really make

238
00:26:38,039 --> 00:26:44,559
sense to me what you're saying but maybe there's a piece that I missed instead of saying like a person doesn't know what

239
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:52,520
they're talking about instead to say there must be something here that you must know something that I don't know or

240
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:58,159
maybe you can help me understand whether this is somebody we

241
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:06,159
know or somebody that we hear about this practice is not about

242
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:13,960
acquiring more and more this practice is not about getting Tighter and Tighter this practice is not about acquiring or

243
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:21,279
attaining or getting it turns out it's all about letting go and then this

244
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:28,710
something this something this beginning maybe inside of us then has this space

245
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:35,960
[Music] to Blossom and become whatever it is going

246
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:44,000
to become when generosity is the first

247
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,480
teaching it's also the last teaching after people are awakened the

248
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:56,320
Buddha gives the instructions for them to go out and to share with others share

249
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,000
the teachings share the Dharma and we can interpret the Dharma

250
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,640
in a number of different ways obvious ways the teachings but

251
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:16,080
that's not always appropriate this is we are not about prz and this

252
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:21,679
tradition but the Dharma maybe is you know just the way things

253
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:28,080
are this recognition that we don't have to join in

254
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:34,760
in when there's some harming

255
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:40,240
happening the drama can be our way of our commitment to

256
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:46,840
non-harming it can be our commitment to learning about ourselves and cultivating

257
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:53,799
some mental stability some well-being so that we can be a support

258
00:28:53,799 --> 00:29:02,200
for others generosity is also the ground of

259
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:08,399
compassion letting go at least at that moment of this sense of okay I'm only

260
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:14,519
concerned with myself but letting go of this and saying oh here is some

261
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:19,799
suffering may this may there be an end to this suffering and maybe it's just a

262
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:26,799
movement of the heart maybe it's something that we actually do but generosity is a part of letting go of

263
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:32,600
only being concerned with myself or only those people that I like but maybe

264
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:38,360
there's others who are suffering and to have some generosity and spirit or maybe

265
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:45,360
it's you know literally with time or service or

266
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,600
money and this practice of generosity we learn about

267
00:29:53,600 --> 00:30:00,880
ourselves we learn about what is it that's easy to let go of and what are

268
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,840
our cherished things what's most important to us and we can see are these

269
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:14,760
things that are supportive or not we can feel into that what are some of our beliefs that

270
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:20,880
are the most important and what are the ones that we're willing to

271
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:28,640
change our beliefs about who deserves things our beliefs about the what ises

272
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:35,600
money stand for or what things are worth or what's important what's not

273
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:42,039
important so generosity is such a key and it's a beautiful

274
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:48,120
teaching and it's awkward for Dharma teachers to talk

275
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:54,480
about so we don't but I wanted to just say this

276
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,519
because it's can be such a powerful thing and it's it's something that all of us can do because we might have this

277
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:08,159
idea I want to begin something I want to begin something that's going to support my life and we have these high ideals

278
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:15,679
I'm going to meditate every day it's a beautiful thing I highly recommend it but it's not always easy we are not

279
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:21,919
machines we can't just do things like this and sometimes we just have to begin

280
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:28,440
again but generosity is something that we can do when we're in our daily life

281
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,880
when we meet people when we're having conversations with people as I said giving them space giving them time

282
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:42,320
giving the benefit of the doubt it's something that we can do in so many situations as a way of

283
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:51,440
practice and then I'd like to end with this recognition

284
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,720
that the beginnings also have implicit in them endings right you know

285
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,600
beginnings and endings of course they go together and as I mentioned we tend to talk more about

286
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:09,519
endings but these endings of course is a certain amount of letting go of

287
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:16,760
course and here's another poem this one's by Rosemary

288
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:23,399
traumer she I just love her poems she's a fantastic poet she writes a poem every

289
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:29,720
single day and she posts it on the internet so they're just generosity right just freely

290
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,760
offered and this poem was written on December 24th

291
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:44,440
2020 you know right of the the pandemic and it's called bonfire of the

292
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:50,039
heart I thought it was a good poem for the kind of like as the end of the year

293
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:56,080
and as we're starting the new year Rosemary trummer her poem bonfire

294
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:03,240
of the heart I throw in any tallies I've been keeping

295
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,799
the ones that record who did what and when I throw in all the letters I wrote

296
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:15,720
in my head but didn't send I throw in tickets I didn't buy to places I didn't

297
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:22,679
visit I throw in all those expectations I had for myself and the world last year

298
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:28,960
and countless lists of things I thought I should do

299
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:35,360
I love watching them ignite turn into Embers to

300
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,480
Ash I love this space they leave behind

301
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:48,039
where anything can happen I love watching them ignite turn

302
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:55,960
into Embers to Ash I love this space they leave behind where anything can

303
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:02,360
happen at the end of 2020 we had to let go of

304
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:09,800
all kinds of things but even just a few years later every year we all have these

305
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,839
tallies we've been keeping these letters that we wrote In Our Heads but never

306
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:22,720
sent places we didn't visit just put those

307
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:29,878
aside make room for whatever is going to begin this

308
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:36,000
year whatever is inside of us something that's searching for this

309
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,520
Sublime peace maybe in the same way that the Buddha had this sense yes there's

310
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:48,480
something better it is possible I'd like to say it's possible I

311
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,520
know it's possible my life is completely different than how it used to be I have found a

312
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:03,119
piece that uh I certainly did not have years ago so maybe with that I want to wish

313
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:09,119
you all a Happy New Year and I'll open it up if anybody has

314
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,799

315
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:34,280

317
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,040
happy New Year um that state of sublime peace um you

318
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:54,359
told us the poly phrase for it could you say it again slowly yeah so um this the

319
00:35:54,359 --> 00:36:01,040
the poly was the highest state of s Sublime piece yeah so let's see here where's the ply I don't have this memor

320
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:10,440
so I have to read it um here he goes Anam this means highest Santi Santi

321
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:16,599
means peace VAR is um like

322
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:23,720
Sublime and padam is state so the highest the Supreme state

323
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:29,480
of sublime peace Anum Santi

324
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,960
veram ananti

325
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:44,960
veram uh diah there's a

326
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,480
um there's a question online uh how do you drive consistency

327
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:58,680
in your meditation habit

328
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:06,359
yeah that's the question right and we get all year to practice with that

329
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:11,440
question okay so consistency with a meditation habit I'll just say a few

330
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,599
things there's lots of things and we all get to find what works for us a few

331
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:24,800
things is to recognize that 2 minutes is better than zero minutes there's something about

332
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,240
just or maybe even one minute so sometimes there's this way if like we

333
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,599
can say oh shoot I haven't meditated for you know x amount of time oh f it I'm

334
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:41,920
not going to meditate anymore do something like that we often do this right where we just abandon the whole

335
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:48,079
thing so we are not machines we will do this I promise you everybody does this

336
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:57,400
can begin and you can begin with one minute two minutes something like this this is a way we find some consistency

337
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:03,000
two come up with contingency plans we often have this idea okay I'm going to

338
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,160
meditate in the morning before I go to work and going to squeeze in some time

339
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:14,599
you know there or something like that but what we often don't say is have this contingency plan if for whatever reason

340
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:19,760
that doesn't work then I'm going to squeeze in 2 minutes 5 minutes 5 hours

341
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,920
whatever it happens to be when I get home from work before I start cooking dinner I'm just going to sit down for 2

342
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,319
minutes or I'm sit in my car for 2 minutes or something like this you know

343
00:38:31,319 --> 00:38:38,160
so have a contingency plan is good um three

344
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:45,000
is it's helpful to connect to what's important for

345
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:52,560
us this recognition that you know change is not easy doing something that we

346
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,640
haven't done before is not easy

347
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:03,920
so on those times when it's tough can we point to or connect to or remind

348
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:10,359
ourselves or borrow some wisdom from somebody else a book a podcast an app a

349
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:16,760
Dharma talk like okay yeah I know this is helpful I really don't want to do it

350
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:22,000
but I'm going to do it anyway there's this way in which we can

351
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,319
um idealize think that every time that we should always want to sit and we

352
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:33,880
should always sit and it should be a pleasant experience or something but there's something

353
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:39,720
about keeping in mind the benefits I guess maybe is the word I'm looking for

354
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:47,640
and even when we don't have that in mind to maybe look at um others or you know

355
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:52,920
look for some external support I guess that's the word I'm looking for which can be in many

356
00:39:52,920 --> 00:40:00,599
forms coming to a meditation center turns out to be really helpful you can ask all the people here myself included

357
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:07,599
right and I just came from a retreat and why do we go and Retreats because it's hard to sit that much by

358
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:15,480
yourself and you know it's if you can with others whether it's online or in

359
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,640
person I'd like to ask you what are what are you that some of you what have you

360
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,359
learned about ways to have some consistency in practice

361
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,200
anybody has something they'd like to share we don't all have to be perfect

362
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:42,359
but what what are some things that have helped a reminder on my calendar a

363
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:49,760
reminder in your calendar great thank you it's a great idea we're so often looking at our

364
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,280
calendars right meetings like oh

365
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:05,319
yeah yeah I to guided I'll teer I

366
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:12,200
like yeah finding a teacher that you really like and listening to their guided meditations I'm just repeating it

367
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:19,119
so that uh for the microphone anybody else have some yes I

368
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:33,000
think and emotions that

369
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:38,640
wased

370
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,680
yeah

371
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:56,680
yeah thank you and what is your name namita namita namita was sharing that

372
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:02,520
she used an app uh 10% happier and uh I

373
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:08,200
I'm familiar with this app I know most of the teachers on there I can recommend them right Joseph goldsteen was one of

374
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:14,560
my teachers and he's a main teacher um on that app um and you she was saying that

375
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:19,720
there's like different topics on their emotions or ethics or loving kindness

376
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:25,280
there's so much stuff on there and you can choose the duration of the time I think you have to pay for that app

377
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:33,040
though right yeah namita was also talking about the 7 a Monday through Friday on YouTube uh you

378
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:39,640
know with Gil and friends and uh I'm just coming

379
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:45,400
here what about you Jim well well I was going to say so there were two comments

380
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:53,000
one uh reiterating the the 7 a group on the week weekdays with IMC helps and

381
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:59,559
also a Audio Dharma is absolutely amazing adio Dharma wow right how many

382
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:04,680
thousands of talks are on there I don't do guid meditations now there was a time

383
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:09,760
when I did so I there's lots of guided meditations from me and from Gil and so

384
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:16,480
many teachers and what about you Jim for your consistency practice what have you what's what's my consistency uh well I

385
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:23,119
have a u meditation app on my phone and I have it set for a certain number of

386
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:28,520
minutes on days when I know I'm not even going to do that I always at least start

387
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:35,520
it so that it shows that that day got used so I I see how many days in a row I

388
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:41,599
can keep it going Monday is often difficult because I don't use it when I

389
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:47,240
come here to sit so that this is this is where often where the Gap is I see I see

390
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:53,359
um you're using an app too right okay all these modern gizmos yeah there was

391
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:58,440
one other comment that I heard a few weeks ago that was really good about

392
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:05,599
this notion of getting having some ideal of what the practice is supposed to lead

393
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:10,720
to and um what Anam tub0 talks about is that

394
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:16,480
sometimes that can be just another chain of like I'm supposed to be you know

395
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:25,280
perfectly calm and equanimous he said it might be better to just have the

396
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:34,920
aspiration to be the person that your dog thinks you are I love it the person dog your dog

397
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:43,440
Pro I mean if you have a dog or a cat or something you know kind of thinks that you're really this you know kind you

398
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:51,119
know generous human love it I love it that's so great so that that's more doable in some ways yeah yeah I'd love

399
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:59,400
that thank you okay so thank you all and Happy New
