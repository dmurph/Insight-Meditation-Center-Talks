1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,040
so uh so welcome welcome folks

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,599
um yeah nice to be with you see the names over

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:20,000
there um let's uh let's meditate

4
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:42,760
and just immediately when you hear that Q let's

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,039
meditate just notice what you

6
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:01,038
do to move from the mode of chatting with friends

7
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,200
to beginning formal

8
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,320
practice and maybe you do need to do do some of the things you

9
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,560
do but maybe not others

10
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,959
and so we begin by uh just being very

11
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,440
natural at this moment

12
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:36,800
not forcing us into some

13
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:43,760
slot that we think is meditation is very

14
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:56,120
natural certain kind of trust that the ingredients or wisdom

15
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,840
love are already here

16
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,760
e

17
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
e

18
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
e

19
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
e

20
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
e

21
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
e

22
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
e

23
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
e

24
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,520
e e

25
00:08:23,479 --> 00:08:30,599
relax whatever can be relaxed let go

26
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:34,320
whatever can be let

27
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:53,240
go are clinging necessitates a lot of uh agitation in our attention

28
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,200
as we begin to uh make peace with the

29
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,440
imperfection of the moment

30
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,680
to uh to not

31
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:45,640
be constantly seduced by the the thought

32
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,279
that something could get

33
00:09:51,760 --> 00:10:00,959
better so we make this kind of Peace the attention system Settles

34
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,680
the spotlight of attention that illuminates

35
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:14,040
phenomena the breath the body sound

36
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,079
whatever starts to Glide more

37
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
smoothly

38
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

39
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

40
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

41
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

42
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

43
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

44
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
e e

45
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,040
and sometimes

46
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:13,160
we relinquish uh control even further not

47
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:21,440
even trying to direct the spotlight of attention anywhere

48
00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:34,839
come to rest

49
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,600
back in

50
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:59,839
awareness and so if I told you to stop

51
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,160
being aware you couldn't do

52
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:18,000
it and whatever you cannot

53
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,560
stop rest

54
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
there

55
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

56
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

57
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

58
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

59
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

60
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,720
e e

61
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:23,240
the attentional spotlight can be used

62
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:30,559
for developing some Stillness

63
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:39,840
focusing the attention or the attentional spotlight

64
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,640
uh also necessary for

65
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,720
clinging the awareness pointing to

66
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,320
only ever let's

67
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
go

68
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

69
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

70
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

71
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

72
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

73
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360

74
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320

75
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

76
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
e e

77
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:51,440
we're awake and knowing is

78
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:59,919
happening the field of knowing is

79
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:20,440
unpartitioned but the knowing doesn't feel like it depends on me

80
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,559
the awareness no longer

81
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:36,880
tastes like

82
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
me

83
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,120
e e

84
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,849
[Music]

85
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,039
e e

86
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:46,398
okay so um a Dharma Dharma

87
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:54,519
Pleasures um we could have chose from many many

88
00:30:54,519 --> 00:31:01,880
but um began with the pleasure of having a p PA the pleasure of sourcing motivation

89
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:08,440
from love purification the pleasure of

90
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:15,200
purification the pleasure of Tranquility of turning the dial

91
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:22,600
down and um today the uh the

92
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,638
pleasure of uh friendship

93
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:37,559
a colleague colleague of mine jezelle Jones um who's

94
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:42,760
uh couples who does a lot of couples

95
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:49,840
therapy it's a clinical social worker um she defines

96
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:55,519
intimacy and that she comes as a a guest speaker in this UCLA undergraduate class

97
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:03,720
for for uh mindfulness practi I of Science of mindfulness and um comes in each each

98
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:12,240
quarter um and to to give a lecture to the undergrads and um and defines

99
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,480
Intimacy in that context as the willingness and the ability to see and

100
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,600
be seen the willingness and the ability to see and be

101
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:30,320
seen and um I I believe that

102
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:37,080
we we need to be seen at our best and our

103
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:47,159
worst we need to be seen at our best and our worst if um we're only known in our

104
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:53,120
strength we might become arrogant or

105
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,200
defensive and if we're only known in our our

106
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:06,120
pain uh we might become

107
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:11,399
deflated and so it it feels important to be seen

108
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:21,679
clearly lovingly in both our strength and um and our desperation

109
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:42,399
um there are uh there are primary relationships mostly

110
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:51,279
family kind of relationships where where my defilements are known with such

111
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:58,279
Exquisite detail you know you know those relationships yeah

112
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:04,360
so there are there are several people in my life who could give a

113
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:10,320
topographically precise map of my

114
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,638
imperfection very precise you

115
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:23,839
know and it actually feels great to be known in that way yeah like if you

116
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:30,440
aren't it feels like you're hiding that hurts and so to be known in

117
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:38,560
one's imperfection feels vital but we also need to be known in

118
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,839
our [Music] Beauty and sometimes loved ones do this

119
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:50,000
of course but sometimes they're too close to see or sometimes they may not

120
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,878
know exactly what to look for and so we

121
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:01,680
have kalana the spiritual

122
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:09,400
friends and spiritual friends have have many roles in our life but

123
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:15,680
um uh one of them one of them is to see

124
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:24,480
the most beautiful Parts in US yeah that's part of the role of s yeah

125
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:29,640
we say s this community of spiritual friends

126
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:35,720
now that does not mean that a spiritual friend is ignorant about our Neurosis

127
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:43,078
but their attention their attention is directed to

128
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:54,319
goodness their attentions directed to goodness and there's there's much pleasure in abiding with others in

129
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:59,560
goodness uh the the the poet

130
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:07,520
uh canel said um sometimes it's it's necessary to reteach a thing it's

131
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:14,040
loveliness yeah and um that's part of the function of

132
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:21,160
spiritual friends yeah to illuminate goodness we become sensitized to

133
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:29,280
goodness we start to see it everywhere yeah and uh

134
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:36,599
and our our goodness is recognized the intimacy of of the

135
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:40,920
ability willingness to see and be

136
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:48,359
seen we um we need good friends because

137
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:53,480
um we're so we're so porous you know and

138
00:36:53,480 --> 00:37:00,880
we're we're way more suggestible than we think we have this sense of like H I'm kind of an island

139
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,680
and or something like that even if we think of ourselves as very relational you know we think these are

140
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:12,760
my views I I my I'm Matthew Eric Bren silver and this is what I believe you

141
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:18,079
know this is why I believe that and it's like

142
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:25,880
please who knows who knows where our ideas come from all the places that

143
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:32,960
shape The View shape the nature of the fabrication shape the way the

144
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,480
confabulation of our

145
00:37:38,319 --> 00:37:47,800
life we we just take on the tone of what's around us yeah and so I walk into

146
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:55,760
a fancy store and I start believing in wealth I walk into a party with fancy

147
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:03,680
people and I start believing in power and we need places

148
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,920
where uh we believe in wisdom and

149
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:15,359
love we um in other words must be continually

150
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:22,640
reminded of our goodness

151
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,359
and this all this Dharma stuff sometimes seems so self

152
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:35,480
evident to us in a moment of peace or Clarity so

153
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:43,680
self-evident but it's very inside baseball yeah it's very peculiar and

154
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,400
idiosyncratic and against the stream and

155
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:56,240
Fringe I I was driving through California from the Bay Area down down

156
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:03,599
through Southern California through Bakersfield and into uh to a retreat at um at Big Bear in the

157
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:11,440
mountains and um so many cities and towns and Landscape so

158
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:17,079
particular and I it was intense you know I I felt

159
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:23,160
like um just in seeing seeing it felt like I could kind of

160
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:28,200
infer something about the Mind States based on the geography

161
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:36,119
and the buildings and everything and um I I did not see the

162
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:44,720
Dharma many places it looked like it would be very hard to sustain Dharma

163
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:54,280
attention and um that's not that person's that place's

164
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:59,319
fault but it's intense yeah

165
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:06,079
and so maybe we have conditions that remind us of Dharma that reconnect us to

166
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:12,960
the necessity of wisdom of love and we need our friends to keep

167
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,920
reminding us of the urgency of that

168
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:28,200
project our our practice is you know Dharma practice sometimes

169
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:36,079
I talk about it as like okay it's making our heart into something like

170
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:44,400
art and um you know I don't know much about art an art

171
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,680
connoisseur like um seees something sees a painting say and they know so much

172
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:56,119
about it they see they literally see more than I
