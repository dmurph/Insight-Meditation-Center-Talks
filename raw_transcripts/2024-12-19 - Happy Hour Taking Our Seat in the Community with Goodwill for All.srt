interpersonally or the news of the world and really the the work that we do the practice that we

for for Community Goodwill gratitude for Community as a resource as a resource we

20
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,239
don't do this practice alone if you were just you know doing this practice alone

21
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,760
on your own it would be very different not as supported not as supportive

22
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,239
as um coming together either on Zoom or on YouTube knowing others are practicing

23
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:32,760
with you or perhaps if you listen later on on the recording just trusting having

24
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:42,200
the sense that oh there are other practitioners who are practicing with you the sa this community that that um

25
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:50,040
is committed to cultivating a Kinder gentler more compassionate world one

26
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:57,560
heart at a time to transform our own Hearts so so that's the invitation and also the last

27
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,640
thing to say we know that when we wish well when we have good will for others

28
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,720
um that makes us happy it's it's it's a happy making process it's the more we

29
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:16,280
give the more we give of Our Kind kindness the more we have the more

30
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:23,200
goodwi and and joy we have so that's the that's the theme it's good willll and

31
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,439
meta for the s for others for the community which includes by the way us

160
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,919
practicing or Goodwill and for me there were many and and one in particular was

161
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:49,840
considering all the it just occurred to me all the people that I've taught uh or

162
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:56,120
connected I think I've taught more than a 100 retreats in person so so many people that I've met in person over

163
00:28:56,120 --> 00:29:03,200
thousands of people uh by now so it just I was struck by wow this so lovely all

164
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:09,880
of us so many people over time um yeah it was a moment of wow this is quite a

165
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:16,399
vast Network that that this being is in interconnected with in this practice

166
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:22,399
just really brought a lot of joy for me so so I want to invite you to connect

167
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:28,799
with one another because now you're going to be in small groups in small

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:36,000
small SAS in in small you know four people three four people uh communities

169
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:43,039
of at first when you enter the the zoom room uh to just start with a moment of

170
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:50,240
maybe maybe a a few moments of silence and just wishing each other well just seeing all the zoom or if somebody's on

171
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:57,559
the phone the phone number like oh yeah wishing each other well wishing each other well um so starting by maybe just

172
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:04,519

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,409
yeah and [Music]

221
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:28,440
Diana um I had this weird possibly negative um

222
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:34,440
thing going on um in terms I was feeling connected when you

223
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:42,640
talked about taking our part or taking our place that's what it was uh but I

224
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:48,079
tended to not feel a a group I couldn't I somehow it

225
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:56,520
came to me that there's this group almost like a professional group or something and I and where that came from

226
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:04,720
so I decided to uh just be with people because I always think of this group as people I

227
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:12,640
see all the various people up there and I see them as individuals and uh feel very close that

228
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:18,079
way so because somehow in my head there was some sort of a group label thing

229
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:25,000
going on and so I decided to approach it more individually and then also uh

230
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,160
offered meta for my small group in my in my hometown here as well for myself

231
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,760
because I wasn't I wasn't feeling my group is a group or something

232
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:42,319
I don't know TR how to put it yeah what I'm appreciating in what you're

233
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:47,359
describing Diana is you know how mind was creating some blocks and and you

234
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:56,119
just worked with it okay that that feels funny okay fine I'll try this okay that works that's sweet cool so this is great

235
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:03,960
that's exactly right that's what happen that's that's what it is it's our minds finding ways to make the practice work

236
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:09,040
even though part of the mind like nope not that not that that doesn't work I so

237
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:15,520

247
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,400
situation and there is heaviness and being underneath that heaviness is the

248
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:29,839
need to connect is the need to have more love so that's beautiful so appreciate that and um also appreciating that there
