1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:13,519
so good morning everyone and welcome good day I trust that you can hear me and um

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,000
and here I am the last day here at IRC

3
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,980
and um you know I haven't seen much of it

4
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,080
except for this you know the Altar and it's me sitting here but

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:37,280
I do feel very kind of content and happy to

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,940
introduce you to IRC for those who've never been here kind of have you here in a sense

7
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:51,800
and um so

8
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:13,560
so one of the wonderful Expressions that I like is the two words together

9
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,659
her breathing room and since I do a lot of my time

10
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:25,259
connected to my breathing meditation throughout the day as I go about things it's kind of second nature for me to

11
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:33,960
stay connected to breathing the idea breathing room having room to breathe such a you know

12
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,360
I think it's a sense of relief that people can have and a space you know to

13
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,740
have a lot more personal space when we feel claustrophobic and feel really nice

14
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:51,960
to be in a large vast natural setting

15
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:57,180
where it seems that the vastness of the setting can hold all the way we are

16
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,180
without any judgment that um maybe in some ways I've been in some

17
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,920
settings where it's vast natural settings where I felt simultaneously

18
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:18,540
very small like a small little piece of this universe and the same time kind of

19
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,940
acutely aware of being alive and the sensations and the

20
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:32,280
body being conscious being aware and being aware of it where there was lots of space to be as I am

21
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:39,300
and so meditation is a place to create space create room to create time

22
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:46,920
lots of time and maybe one definition of meditation is to

23
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,560
give ourselves infinite time as if we have all the time in the world

24
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,019
as if there is no time give ourselves all the space in the

25
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:04,620
world as if there's no limitation to the fast space in which we belong or

26
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:12,420
which holds us or allows all of us to be and one of the ways that Buddhism has

27
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:20,940
um kind of use this kind of ideas is to liken awareness to space

28
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,220
or to the sky and when birds fly through the sky they

29
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:32,340
don't leave any traces they don't disturb the sky this guy has infinite room for the birds

30
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:40,620
to fly through in a sense or if a rock gets thrown through the air there it doesn't mind words go through

31
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:48,239
the air the air doesn't mind there's lots of space for it and so awareness is that way

32
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,340
that awareness is like space there's something about knowing sensing feeling

33
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:59,400
know that being aware that can be vast and

34
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:04,819
open and lots of breathing room

35
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:13,439
so perhaps for this morning sitting there can be as we connect Here and Now

36
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,979
to our present moment experience maybe there can also be a sense of ass

37
00:04:19,979 --> 00:04:26,240
space lots of breathing room for whatever is here

38
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,380
in a sense not disturbed by anything not bothered by anything

39
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,540
not needing anything not wanting anything to be different except

40
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:43,639
to hold whatever is including desires and wants in vast space

41
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:51,139
so to begin

42
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,840
assuming a posture that may be

43
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,680
takes up more space than usual another way it may be saying

44
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,220
being a little more erect and open in the chest and

45
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:18,000
with an head and neck that a little bit alert upright

46
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,460
gently closing the eyes

47
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:36,840
and slowly gently expanding

48
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,400
the Torso as you breathe in deep inhales

49
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:54,620
making space becoming larger Biggers lungs fill with air

50
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:01,639
as a diaphragm pushes down and the stomach out

51
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:14,000
and releasing relaxing as you exhale

52
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:28,039
and letting the breathing return to normal

53
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:38,880
and as you inhale maybe you can see imagine that your

54
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,660
awareness also expands now with the inhale

55
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:52,860
expands out to stretch and to meet wherever in your body there is tension

56
00:06:52,860 --> 00:07:02,039
expand outward to touch caress tension and tightness

57
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:09,139
as if it's no problem but just being touched with the inhale with awareness

58
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:16,819
and on the exhale relaxing the tension

59
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:20,360
softening in the body

60
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:55,080
breathing normally imagine that you have lots of breathing

61
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,840
room in which to breathe

62
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:08,340
Maybe there's a lot of space around your body

63
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:15,419
and imagining that two three four five feet distance

64
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:23,840
from your body is a broad soft welcoming space

65
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:32,300
into which two breathe in breathe out

66
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:17,880
in exhaling exhaling and settling in relaxing in

67
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,500
deeply into the body

68
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,220
inhaling from the depths of your body outwards

69
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,700
with the expansion of the Torso in the chest and inhale

70
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:53,959
an expensive expansiveness that spreads beyond the body even

71
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:23,760
sometimes the more the thinking mind relaxes quiets

72
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,000
the more space quiet silent space there can be

73
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,620
for the breathing room for all things

74
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,720
that are occurring in the present moment

75
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,459
each thing allowed to be its own thing

76
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,800
as it comes and goes

77
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:45,500
wherever you're sitting now imagine the space around you

78
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,960
between you and the walls and the ceiling

79
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:59,960
or if you're outside in vast space beyond you

80
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,760
and however far away you can imagine the space

81
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:15,860
in a certain kind of way that's the distance how large

82
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:20,720
the bubble of awareness is

83
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:39,360
in some movements of the Mind contract

84
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,840
the awareness sets limits on it boxes it in

85
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,700
other movements of the Mind open it expand it

86
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:56,179
with no limits

87
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:03,980
the Buddha said that greed

88
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:11,900
boxes limits the mind creates a limit about boundary to the Mind awareness

89
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:19,679
generosity expands animosity

90
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:25,340
boxes the mind in love

91
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,120
expands it without limit

92
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:37,820
delusion Narrows the mind

93
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,220
wisdom makes awareness expansive

94
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:54,829
[Music]

95
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,460
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

96
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,799
to mention that the love the compassion that

97
00:24:52,799 --> 00:25:01,020
can flow out of Buddhist practice is a love compassion that has lots of

98
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:07,159
room lots of breathing room

99
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:14,460
so much room at some point it can hold all the suffering of the

100
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:23,658
world without being oppressed by it or troubled by it

101
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:38,460
and it's an amazing phenomenon that the heart has the ability

102
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:45,860
to be present for suffering without being troubled

103
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:54,120
we can be the opposite that if we practice and are mindful

104
00:25:54,120 --> 00:26:00,140
aware it's almost as if we're making more room

105
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,779
all the room that's needed

106
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,260
and by not being troubled there's more

107
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:26,000
opportunity more space in our hearts to care

108
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:34,440
to Aspire to move into action to care and care for

109
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,600
others care for oneself

110
00:26:39,659 --> 00:26:45,500
to wish others well to love others

111
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:54,260
may all beings be happy

112
00:26:55,799 --> 00:27:02,240
may all beings be safe

113
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:09,080
may all beings be peaceful

114
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:15,559
and may all beings everywhere be free

115
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:26,640
and may those who can use companionship know that we accompany them

116
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,299
with our care our good wishes our our love

117
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:38,720
may all beings be happy

thank you

foreign

123
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:13,919
and welcome to this final talk about

124
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:21,000
the seven factors of compassion and um we were talking about compassion

125
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,539
for some time two weeks ago and now this week and one of the things I would try to

126
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:33,299
convey is that um there are many characteristics of

127
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:39,480
compassion or many supportive conditions that come together in order to have a healthy form of

128
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:46,799
compassion that maybe many people don't realize that if

129
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:52,980
people are have a capacity to feel compassion they might just kind of assume that

130
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:58,260
whatever way they happen to feel compassion as though a way to experience it

131
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:05,700
and it might be that in doing so having just one way that um it might be a good way sometimes but

132
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:11,279
it might not be universally useful if for example

133
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:18,559
uh the suffering of the world uh kind of touches in wounds that we have or

134
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:24,659
insecurities we have if uh if the being present for the

135
00:30:24,659 --> 00:30:30,778
suffering of the world frightens us or

136
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:38,100
distresses us or depresses us that all those things can happen and if

137
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:43,980
that's mixed up or entangled with the compassion then the compassion is not

138
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:50,159
you know it you know is being kind of influenced by It or The Compassion might

139
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,860
not be the most healthy way to be in the world and to learn to bring in these other

140
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:04,020
qualities to bear on a compassion and to have them included is a protection

141
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:08,000
from the suffering of the world

142
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:14,580
harming us and causing us to be exhausted and fatigued and troubled and

143
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:21,779
depressed it kind of keeps it keeps US fluid Keeps Us open Keeps Us kind of

144
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:27,960
um transparent in a certain way to the suffering of the world

145
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,059
so they're suffering the world it doesn't land on the places we're holding

146
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:39,600
on to a sense of self protecting a sense of self or asserting a sense of self or the ways that we want to see ourselves

147
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,299
or know ourselves and and so sometimes that suffering it

148
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:52,020
doesn't you know get interfered with our desires and our animosities

149
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:58,320
and so to begin appreciating that these different characteristics of qualities

150
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,720
that can come along with compassion so for example that there's awareness

151
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:09,480
that can come along mindfulness can come along that there is a sense of Investigation

152
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:17,039
of really seeing the distinction between being present for suffering in ways that

153
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:22,380
cause a harm to ourselves to limit ourselves cause causes us suffering in

154
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:28,200
ways of being present with it there's more opening and freeing to really feel that and see what's

155
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:36,539
happening inside as we meet suffering to be able to make effort to make to be able to choose the fork the path of less

156
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:43,860
suffering of less strain less tension that the path of creating more space more

157
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:49,620
peace more openness around the capacity to meet suffering

158
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:56,039
to appreciate the uh that that compassion can come with a Sweetness in

159
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:01,080
fact if there isn't something that feels sweet or feels a rightness in it then

160
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:07,380
probably it's the compassion is mixed up with things which are unnecessary and then we go back to the awareness

161
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:12,899
practice to really see what's going on here and back to this making a distinction

162
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:18,539
seeing clearly the two Paths of what leads to what's leading us to feel

163
00:33:18,539 --> 00:33:23,880
stressed and what's leading us away from that and then choosing it acting on one

164
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,640
living in in the one that's more beneficial

165
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:36,539
and then compassion can have a Tranquility for it and so if if we're compassionate and we

166
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:43,320
feel agitated Restless um that's on you know it's it's very

167
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:49,919
easy to add that to happen but to know that then the compassion it

168
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:58,860
is not going to be so clean or so spacious or then we're more vulnerable to some of the kind of

169
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:04,919
undermining ways that we can be impacted by suffering if we if we're agitated

170
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:10,500
and then the samadhi factor a sense of being really at home

171
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:16,440
stable unified centered in this bubble of compassion of care

172
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:23,220
love it's kind of like our home we feel like we're home with it as opposed to

173
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:31,560
something that we should do or we have to kind of gear up or you know tense up to try to have it

174
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:38,460
or constantly being distracted from it and then finally today the Equanimity

175
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:44,220
factor of compassion and sometimes it's hard for people to

176
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:52,320
appreciate that compassion and Equanimity can come together so there's can be a very strong kind of

177
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,680
feeling or idea that we have to um we were supposed to be distressed

178
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:07,020
we're supposed to be upset we're supposed to feel the suffering of the world in a way that we suffer as well

179
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:14,160
and if we don't feel it that way and suffer then we're not really connected to it but in fact we don't have to feel the

180
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:24,720
suffering of the the same suffering of the world the feeling or sensing the suffering of others is a a is a is a

181
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:30,000
kind of a a kind of a loving recognition it's a

182
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,240
kind of a it's sensing without suffering we're not suffering with them

183
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:44,640
then it's a kind of you know I don't know I don't know if there's any hope then but it is feeling them knowing

184
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:52,859
them fully so there's a kind of accompanying a kind of recognition a kind of kind of sense of uh capacity of

185
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:59,640
caring and accompanying and and respecting others but without us

186
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:07,079
suffering as well and Equanimity is part of that that heart of compassion

187
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:13,980
the capacity to be untroubled or unagitated or non-reactive

188
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:20,040
in the encounter with suffering and um and for some people hearing that

189
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:25,380
it can seem like and then the compassion is aloof or indifferent but in fact it's

190
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:31,859
it's the opposite that the capacity the ability to have compassion have lots of breathing room

191
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:37,260
before suffering lots of space for it without clamping down without

192
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:44,520
creating limits and contractions and tightness and awareness actually allows us to be more fully

193
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:51,660
present to be more sensitive to be more sensing and intuitive and and attuned to

194
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:56,760
other people so one of the one of the meanings of

195
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:03,540
equanimity is a very satisfying

196
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:08,820
kind of peaceful non-reactivity of the Mind

197
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:14,060
and I say satisfying and peaceful because

198
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:20,040
non-reactivity by itself can be a kind of a indifference or disassociation or

199
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:28,619
something like not caring but or kind of closing down neutrality

200
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:34,140
but this is not a neutral State it's very satisfying it's very it's a peaceful

201
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:41,040
and it's available to be present for things and it's not reactive

202
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:49,880
and it's a it's such a delightful kind of medicine relief for a joy for the mind

203
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:55,560
to feel like the mind is not being hijacked by

204
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:01,380
reactivity it's kind of a bit like kind of when we're no longer being having a reactive

205
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:06,839
mind they can finally say oh now I'm home now

206
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:13,140
you know um you know I can now and more fully myself

207
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:19,500
now this is a kind of a healthy state that we're very reactive agitated mind

208
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:25,320
it doesn't really feel like it might if you don't know anything else it might feel like that's who we are

209
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,660
but the Deep back when emanates while I go now I am who I am it's that

210
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:36,540
satisfying so the um um

211
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:45,599
so these seven factors of compassion are reference points for understanding

212
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:52,619
the full potential in the full Beauty and the full strength of compassion

213
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:59,460
and so to have these as a kind of list to kind of refer back to when you're

214
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:05,180
encountering suffering and feeling compassion and care for it and and

215
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:11,220
bringing along mindfulness in the middle of it don't forget to be mindful

216
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:16,460
or recognize that mindfulness is coming along it's a sense them

217
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:22,619
recognize how it how being careful about where the suffering

218
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:29,040
is where the freedom of suffering is is the movement of compassion

219
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,079
and effort and joy and tranquility and

220
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:40,619
samadhi and equanimity it they're part of the reason why it's such a beautiful thing reference point

221
00:39:40,619 --> 00:39:46,099
and maybe sometimes practice is to bring this along with compassion is that

222
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:52,740
when compassion is strongest and most healthy and most I don't know

223
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:58,619
and itself clean these seven factors of compassion

224
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:04,440
come along with them effortlessly we don't have to practice them they're

225
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:09,540
just there and uh so if they're not there

226
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:15,000
then uh you know then we know where to work we know what to explore and

227
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:22,440
practice with so we can evoke or release this natural capacity of compassion to

228
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:28,680
have these seven beautiful qualities so um

229
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:34,859
it's uh it's a kind of a life work to explore

230
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:41,160
this it's not something that we can expect to do overnight or do well all the time or

231
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:47,820
but rather compassion is a wonderful mirror for ourselves to see ourselves

232
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:56,820
better and see where we get hung up see where we limit the mind or limit awareness to some more contracted state

233
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:03,660
and uh and you know it's a lifetime exploration and and the idea of spending

234
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:08,760
a lifetime on the Journey of discovering and

235
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:14,040
practicing and enacting and living by compassion it's a great journey it's a

236
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:23,160
great adventure it's a great kind of valuable treasure it's a gift we

237
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:29,099
do to ourselves in a gift we do to others so um

238
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:36,240
May compassion be a heightened these talks this week

239
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:43,880

240
