1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,899
one and I'm here in the meditation Hall and uh in Psych Retreat Center

2
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:14,340
and I feel very lucky to have a but in eight nine people here some of

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:21,980
the residents and some of the people who 've been part of this program that came down to teach for a couple of days

4
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,439
I've been very fortunate to be here I miss patachara I said I would be able to be with her

5
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,860
these two days but the technology doesn't work so well

6
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:39,680
so this works much better here foreign

7
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,090
[Music]

8
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:57,559
at some point in my meditation practice on retreat I learned an interesting uh

9
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,920
technique and I had an image that went along with it so the image would kind of come up

10
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:10,439
when I use this technique uh kind of the back of the mind and that

11
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,740
was that um the image was that of a horse that had escaped from its Corral

12
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,799
or something or they needed to come back to the barn or something

13
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:29,580
and so a writer would go down another horse and go out to find the first one and

14
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,360
then would ride up right next to it okay almost you know brought it together

15
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,540
and then the new horse with the writer would gently make a big curve big turn

16
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:48,540
180 degrees around and the Stray horse would then just follow along and come

17
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:54,119
back to the barn and so that image was how I worked with

18
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,759
some of the uh thinking that would come up for me I would start thinking about

19
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,520
something and rather than being opposed to it or rather than being troubled by

20
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:12,300
it it was just a horse that had kind of gone off and uh and I would come along and

21
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:19,319
imagine myself kind of coming up next to it and just letting it continue to think and letting it kind of just keep going

22
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,780
but then I would kind of you know over a few seconds I would kind of turn it

23
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:31,860
around and kind of bring It the whole thing back to being grounded and centered here in

24
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:39,680
my body back in my breathing and uh and that was such a harmonious way of working with my

25
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,980
distracted thought that uh you know it's been something I've done ever since it's been quite wonderful to do

26
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,739
um it's very different than how I was when I was you know a new meditator when it was a

27
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,319
little bit of a war between me and my thinking you know like this is terrible that it's happening and

28
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,959
or it was a little bit of a whack-a-ball kind of exercise whereas I pounded out

29
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,140
of existed somehow that I was thinking but this harmonious way of just coming around and just kind of bringing it back

30
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:17,819
and one of the Arts of that was that was it coming up next to the horse next

31
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:23,580
to the thinking and all that was coming up next to someplace in the body that

32
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:31,560
was um uh either that was associated with a thinking it was somehow Pleasant

33
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,040
or somehow um kind of like the right place to be or the place where it felt that I'm

34
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,920
connected to this event of thinking and um and so there was not just so I

35
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:50,519
was little I was I was stepping away from the content of my bonds but I wasn't stepping away from thinking

36
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:56,519
that could continue but I shift the orientation from the thinking about the

37
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:02,400
content to something it felt right to me felt kind of some occasionally kind of cozy sometimes

38
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,220
a little bit uh Pleasant enjoyable or bright sometimes a sense of aliveness a

39
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:14,580
Vitality that was kind of cozy or connected in my body so this idea of learning to shift the

40
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:21,600
attention not from one thing to another but shifting attention within what's

41
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,820
happening to some aspect of what's Happening that feels like a better place

42
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:32,880
to be centered and so we're not rejecting anything or letting go of something necessarily but

43
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,960
we are shifting the perspective we're shifting with how we're aware of it and one of the important places is

44
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:46,800
around thinkgeever it's so easy a company called the contents or if there's a lot of emotions it's so easy

45
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,020
to um somehow it could also be involved in the thinking the meaning the memories

46
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:58,199
the projections into the future of what this emotion is about but even there's there's some place that

47
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:04,979
feels like a good place to attend attention to being in relationship to the emotion so places

48
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:10,320
feels right yes it feels alive in a very good way feel

49
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,419
Pleasant enjoyable all right same thing with pain

50
00:05:15,419 --> 00:05:22,860
now to reject the name not to kind of fight it but is there some kind of harmonious way of being present for it

51
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,960
but by not necessarily being with the what's most difficult about the pain but

52
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:33,240
something that feels like a rightness to it and they kind of agreed with that

53
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,900
with pain sometimes for me and I'm not saying it should be for other people it's a way of kind of working with a

54
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:46,320
pain in the horse kind of is uh what feels often the most right thing to do

55
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,840
is to sit in the middle of where it's most painful and there's something about sitting

56
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,720
there that changes the nature of the pain for me where just go okay now I can

57
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:04,919
be here but if I'm not there in the center of it then um then it's uh then I'm still kind of

58
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:12,479
the thinking mind and the reactive mind kind of has a Freer reign

59
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:20,940
so this is what I'd like to suggest for today that if you sit here in meditation and um and something arises that takes

60
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:28,020
you away from the present for your breathing present here um not to fight it or even let go of it

61
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:34,620
but think of it as a horse and where do you ride up next to it to accompany it

62
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:42,120
with the place where you're up against it when it is something that feels right about the composite the whole experience

63
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:50,039
of whatever it is what is it that um that you can feel that has a ripeness A

64
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,560
pleasantness aliveness in that experience that supports you to bring

65
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,680
the horse back home back into the body back in here and present

66
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:08,840
so taking a comfortable alert posture

67
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,419
and then play closing the eyes

68
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,940
taking a few moments to feel experience how you are right now

69
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,900
all the different ways you might be at any given moment

70
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,560
now allowing at all to be there where could you Center yourself that

71
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,139
feels the most right or the most Pleasant

72
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:04,940
the most sense of being alive in a nice way balanced way

73
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:17,419
maybe on the exhale relaxing around that spot

74
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,318
Amy centered on that spot taking a few long slow deep breaths

75
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:38,120
to settle in more fully here

76
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:09,080
and letting the breathing return to they were wrong

77
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:17,820
[Music] where is it in connection to breathing

78
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:24,200
root feels most right to Center their attention

79
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,480
where in the breathing does it feel most Pleasant

80
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,360
most alive most clear

81
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,019
foreign no matter what happens during the

82
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:53,880
meditation ask yourself that question given what's happening

83
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,700
where's the where in the all the different parts aspects of the

84
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:05,000
experience music most Pleasant

85
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:12,980
alive right yeah be aware of it

86
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:20,120
the body and the feelings emotions mind States

87
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,640
where it feels like it's most right to feel

88
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:37,980
there's a gentle turning to be more fully here

89
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,360
coming home here

90
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,519
foreign

91
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:18,919
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

92
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:29,179
we appreciate that we are multifaceted many different

93
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:36,500
components of what makes up our personal experience in any given moment

94
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,779
components of kind of how we are

95
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:47,940
the meditation practice is one of the practices that shifts that

96
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:54,419
from being stuck maybe in the thoughts ideas concerns

97
00:25:55,260 --> 00:26:01,158
to being somehow energized and an agitated way

98
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:07,740
to being able to focus on how we can feel grounded and centered

99
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:14,580
embodied maybe a little bit more connected to our

100
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,059
hearts

101
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,840
more centered here

102
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:36,080
and have more fluidity to be able to move between the component parts of ourselves

103
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:42,779
you know at the end maybe to move the attention to the Heart Center

104
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:49,740
to the place within your body where you feel compassion your care love

105
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:57,179
kindness sometimes felt as a tenderness

106
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:05,419
sometimes a warm sometimes is a kind of inner strength

107
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,859
you breathe with that Heart Center [Music]

108
00:27:18,299 --> 00:27:27,020
into [Music] gaze out upon the world

109
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,299
from your kindness

110
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:41,960
Your Love to end the meditation

111
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:51,000
with directly establishing a connection with the meditation [Music]

112
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,779
in Goodwill for the world around us good will for the people we know we

113
00:27:57,779 --> 00:28:03,840
don't know people whoever it's easy to learn and

114
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:12,080
people who is not so easy and then they they say Goodwill

115
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:24,600
to extend that Goodwill intentionally purposefully

116
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:31,519
choicefully with words that are something like

117
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,100
may all beings be happy

118
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:44,539
may all beings be safe

119
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,600
male beings be peaceful

120
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:57,679
may all beings be free

121
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:07,579
[Music]

122
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:17,839
thank you [Music]

123
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:27,620
thank you

124
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,679
um

125
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,419
hello everyone again and I'm greeting you from the inside retweet

126
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:07,080
Center here in the Redwood in in Santa Cruz County right now I don't think it's

127
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:15,299
raining there was uh the major entryway highway to Santa Cruz

128
00:30:15,299 --> 00:30:23,039
was just entry into Santa Cruz side of it was blocked with big landslides yesterday

129
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:29,460
it's kind of dramatic at times here in this area usually lots of landslides

130
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:34,740
but we've been safe here at IRC and comfortable and

131
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:42,059
um it's nice to be here a nice degree I'll review on YouTube get

132
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:47,760
a little taste of the retreat center here and you don't see much of it now but maybe at the end of it I can we can

133
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,340
zoom out and show you the more of the meditation room

134
00:30:54,059 --> 00:31:00,000
so this week the series is on the Dharma of challenges

135
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,760
and uh it's Following last week where I

136
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:11,279
um you know the week was on a question that and the topic was what is the Dharma

137
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,440
and I offered five different meanings of the word Dharma

138
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:24,419
and um and so I'm building on that and now how each different meaning of Dharma can be

139
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:30,480
an approach to how to work great practice with challenges we have and this is still laying down a foundation

140
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,240
so it's not getting into details but the foundation of a series now as we

141
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:43,260
go along here on uh working with challenges and particular ways of working with it and I'm kind of a little

142
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:48,659
bit I'm not sure exactly how this is going to unfold over the weeks so I've been hoping that it's a bit of a journey

143
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:54,779
into a kind of a deeper deeper connection to oneself around this topic of the

144
00:31:54,779 --> 00:32:01,620
challenges we have of being human beings and um

145
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:07,020
so the

146
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,179
um one of the meanings that I talked last week about with what Dharma is is

147
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:17,640
Dharma as action and there is a places in the ancient

148
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:23,460
texts where the Buddha is called the teacher of action that come about and or

149
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:30,059
in his teaching is a teaching of Acts of action kamavada

150
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,720
and um kind of related to the word terravata with the same bada at the end

151
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,899
and um so a teaching of action and there's one way of understanding the Dharma and even

152
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:51,360
understanding uh Insight practice that um it's a practice of action it's a

153
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,419
acting if there's a doing we do that involves Insight practice

154
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:04,640
meditation and sometimes it's useful to emphasize that it is an action is a doing

155
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:11,279
uh because um otherwise sometimes we don't recognize we are doing something and

156
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:17,460
sometimes we have language in this tradition of not doing anything just allowing and just being

157
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:24,419
and um but there's a way which that also isn't doing um if we stop doing we do a lot of we're

158
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:30,019
busy in the mind and very active and we choose to stop it all and be still

159
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:36,480
there's a way that's also a doing um it's a doing of stopping

160
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:42,539
and then we do that we don't stop our life life continues and there's all this

161
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:49,140
Vitality so if you're sitting in meditation upright um then there's action involved in being

162
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:55,260
present for that posture present here for this uh if some people will practice you know

163
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:01,260
non-doing just radical kind of letting go of all the normal doings of the mind

164
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:07,140
and the body just be still but there's still the doing of of being aware of

165
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:13,679
that to be is it doing of action the action of of awareness that maybe we're

166
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:19,378
not doing but it's being done it's action happening it's really happening

167
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:25,260
and the reason why I would like to emphasize the action in relationship to challenges

168
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:34,618
is that uh when we're challenged by life in simple ways and deep deep ways

169
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:42,960
that the challenge part of it something inside of us as as uh sprung into action

170
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,179
we've been activated in some way or maybe we find ourselves thinking a lot

171
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:53,580
about it and trying to figure out the problem solve perhaps we're physically

172
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:58,800
activated in some way we want to run away or want to attack something because

173
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:06,720
we're really something is wrong or we want to shut down I kind of sometimes my kind of default

174
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:11,940
of uh when I be challenged is the ostrich approach the challenge kind of

175
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:19,500
like sticking my head in the in the sand and kind of like pretending it's not there some people's default is to attack

176
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:25,380
you know get angry and blame some people it's thrown away and shut down all kinds

177
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:30,660
of things and those are all actions and some people they're commenting is

178
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:35,880
just being out and about and projections and Fantasies and ideas what

179
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:42,900
if or what could have been or what and all these are kind of actions and um

180
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:48,720
and uh so we're already doing something and it turns out when we're really

181
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,760
challenged uh it's not often it's very good for the heart and the mind and

182
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:01,079
their whole psyche um to feel like we have some agency that we can do something and we can act

183
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:07,920
and if there were the challenge big challenges you know challenges squared to challenge a couple challenge is when

184
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:14,579
we feel it's too much and you feel like giving up it's hopeless and the feeling of hopelessness is one of the great or

185
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:20,220
helplessness is really one of the great uh maybe the greatest challenge within

186
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:25,920
challenges feeling giving up or feeling there's no no opportunity to do anything

187
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,560
and uh in the dire mom there's always something we can do

188
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:38,220
and uh and maybe we can't do something to fix this challenge but we can't find

189
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:43,260
where we have some agency what can I do here what can we how can

190
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:49,140
we Act and I remember many years ago I talked to a woman she was going in for a major

191
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:55,619
surgery and she's had a lot I had a lot of surgeries and one more time

192
00:36:55,619 --> 00:37:00,720
and uh I taught her to do on a kindness medication

193
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,880
and uh after the surgery she told me Gail that was so helpful because in the

194
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,760
past I felt once I'm on the gurney and they're laying there waiting to go into surgery waiting in the hallway or

195
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,160
whatever she's waiting um I feel helpless like my life is in the hands of someone else and I just

196
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:22,320
can't do anything but uh now I I felt empowered there's

197
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:29,040
some something I can do I can do loving kindness and she felt so engaged and so

198
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:35,160
um um empowered or did she had her agency back

199
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:40,740
at this crucial moments in her life of going into surgery so she could you know

200
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:46,460
Define what we can do in a situation and learn we don't have to be helpless

201
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:52,020
even uh you know when it's time for people to die

202
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:58,920
that uh that does not necessarily a time to give up there's a time to let go in a healthy

203
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,260
way which is also an action and it if we learn the value of letting

204
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:11,099
go then um it's an action which is invited we appreciate doing it we see the value of

205
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:17,960
it okay now I can let go of so many concerns and so many things now there's an opportunity to do something else here

206
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:24,060
not to be kind of snow and under or covered over with

207
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:29,220
um with sense of helplessness hopelessness even though the person

208
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:36,900
might be dying you know that's kind of a challenge or a crisis for some people but if it's happening anyway then a

209
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:43,760
Dharma practitioner finds what action can I engage here that meets this nicely

210
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,780
and so one of the actions that we do in Mind Quest practice meditation for

211
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:55,260
example is the choice to sell to not do so in our physical body we

212
00:38:55,260 --> 00:39:02,460
choose not to move the body too much within reason you know maybe you have to move it if it's uncomfortable but to be

213
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:09,480
still for a period of time we might have a choice to uh still some

214
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:16,500
of the thinking mind that there are some of the things we think about that we realized you know I've done this

215
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:22,320
a lot I don't need to do this anymore and so there's a healthy appropriate way

216
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:30,000
to say I stopped I'm not doing this that is an engagement of our agency of our

217
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:36,119
choice so we can do and there are things we can't have choice about stopping and we have to

218
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:43,020
learn to practice with that and so for someone who's doing mindfulness medication one of the doings

219
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:48,119
one of the actions with you is to meet it with attention made it with

220
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:53,579
investigation meaning with curiosity to be present here and um and that's

221
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:59,339
something we do that some I think sometimes people under uh value

222
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:06,660
the action of showing up for our experience okay here I am with it that's taking agency that

223
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:13,079
said you have something to do we're not helpless when we bring attention to something

224
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:21,540
right the um and sometimes what we can do is um is be present for the experience of

225
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:26,760
challenge but learn how to be present for it in a useful way

226
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:33,119
and one of the ways is to realize when we're challenged the more challenged we

227
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:40,920
are probably accidentally it's a way of saying in that sometimes the challenge is we see it out there maybe it's like

228
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:47,220
an object it's objectified somehow but I propose that the this the bigger

229
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:55,320
the challenge is the more we're activated with our thinking mind our emotional Minds our fear or anxiety or

230
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:00,599
concerns and um and that activation

231
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:07,520
uh is something to bring attention to but to bring attention to it

232
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:14,160
uh in a careful way to explore and discover where am I activated what's Li

233
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:21,599
what's activated here and where does it feel most right to bring the attention where does it

234
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:27,540
feel most within it where where would in this how I feel is most grounding

235
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:33,599
both centering where and how I'm feeling now which I'm feeling so agitated so unstable

236
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:38,820
is there some place where it feels Pleasant it's enjoyable to have the

237
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:43,920
attention and so I remember yesterday uh when we had

238
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,920
some trouble with the um technology and making it work uh I sat down and I was a

239
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,920
little bit you know more activated more energized uh spinning a little bit than

240
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,640
I usually am when I sit down to do the YouTube and um and so as I sat there uh I I

241
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:09,359
brought my attention to the the way I was energized a little bit agitated and

242
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:15,180
where it was most Pleasant was in my arms there was a flow of energy there of

243
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:21,960
um of you know usually my arms I don't feel that strongly when I meditate the upper arms but now there was a flow of

244
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:27,780
energy there that was part of the activation but it actually felt kind of nice that flow and liveness and tingling

245
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:33,839
there in the upper arm and so I wanted to be present for how I

246
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:39,180
was and but I wanted to also be present for it in a way where I wasn't going to

247
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:44,940
spin out more in the thoughts and the ideas and the concerns but to uh but to

248
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:50,220
be present for in a way that um entered into it in a way that allows

249
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:56,520
for a deeper connection or a subtleness so or having a calmness in the middle of

250
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:04,260
the storm and so finding that place where it was pleasant or or that's sometimes too high

251
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:10,880
too high a bar to find but to find where it is um

252
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,500
feels a ripeness to it and I love this idea of where is the

253
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:23,099
brightness so it feels right and it feels like they're given how challenging it is and what's going on given it

254
00:43:23,099 --> 00:43:30,839
whereas that feels like the right place to be present to be centered or be attentive to it and um and that's I find

255
00:43:30,839 --> 00:43:37,560
it's just to ask that question it gives us is the beginning to uh

256
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:42,660
um take on agency I can do this I can do something

257
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:49,020
so the Dharma has action that Buddha was a teaching teacher of action

258
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:56,400
and we're learning how to act to engage to do in a way that is freeing that

259
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:05,720
brings peace that brings a sense of well-being and and that path to that

260
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:13,380
goes through can go through uh learning to feel confident in our capacity with

261
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:18,839
agency even if we can't solve the challenge we don't have to give up our

262
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:25,440
finding a way to be present and alive in a way that we feel like we can do

263
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:32,760
something and we don't have to feel helpless so uh it might be interesting for today

264
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:40,500
as you go through this that um you explore this for yourself that you know

265
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:47,819
if you feel challenged by things first look and see uh recognize if you've been

266
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:53,099
activated and you are already acting you're already engaged so it might be

267
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:58,560
like um you know this is hopeless and hopeless and I'm a disaster

268
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:03,660
that's an action that's a doing so see when you're challenged what

269
00:45:03,660 --> 00:45:09,480
you're already doing and find one of two things or both what

270
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:15,540
you can do instead that gives you a healthy agency to do something appropriate here

271
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:21,060
and the second is um to be more present for how you feel

272
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:26,760
challenged but to feel where does it feel most right

273
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:33,359
what aspect of your psychophysical experience maybe even it's kind of pleasant in the middle of this very

274
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:40,319
unpleasant event that's going on where does it most common to connect to it

275
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:46,260
and uh maybe it's an exercise today you don't want to choose the most difficult challenges of the day but maybe there's

276
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:51,680
some small challenges that would be interesting to explore this with

277
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:58,200
and um so thank you and um I'm a little bit aware also that

278
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:03,660
yes last week was a foundation for this week and what's coming but in fact the

279
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:09,480
last week of the year of 2022 I talked about right effort is also may be a very

280
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:16,140
important foundation for what's coming the prequel for it you didn't listen to it you might want

281
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:21,720
to go back so here I am at IRC so thank you all for

282
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:28,440
being here and I thought I would take a couple of minutes here uh just to introduce you to our wonderful Retreat

283
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:36,380
Center we have um and I don't know can you um uh zoom out we see the whole meditational

284
00:46:40,859 --> 00:46:48,359
and then again obviously it takes a I don't know there's a delay between going from our

285
00:46:48,359 --> 00:46:55,800
computer to zoom to YouTube it's longer than the delay when I go directly to YouTube from IMC

286
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:01,740
and um so I don't know if you can look out the windows but we have wonderful redwood

287
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:07,619
trees just outside and now we have this wonderful Hall we're on the second floor of the building

288
00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:13,680
and when we moved into this building bought the building and it was unfinished it was an unconstructed kind

289
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:20,160
of Unfinished space up here and we walked into the space up here we all felt this is the place for the

290
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,380
meditation Hall that was the one again it had had a presence here that ah this

291
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:31,920
is it and now it's it now it's our medication on and we have a few people here who live

292
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:39,960
here and we've been involved with IRC for a long time I wonder if any of you would like to come and introduce yourself to the YouTube Community

293
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:45,180
um partly because uh you're very important for this wider IMC Community

294

you're part of what supports it all and keeps you all going supports me and anybody I know asking you kind of

295
00:47:53,339 --> 00:48:00,119
out of the blue but anything you'd like to come and say hello yes elizo says hey hello this Powell is a managing director
