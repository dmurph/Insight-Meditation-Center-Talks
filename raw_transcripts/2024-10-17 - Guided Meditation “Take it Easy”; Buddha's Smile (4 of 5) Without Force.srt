1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:07,719
lovely to see everybody welcoming one another checking in and as I did yesterday

2
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:17,320
uh I'd like to just welcome everybody who is uh not not saying good morning in

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:22,560
the chat which is most of us

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,039
um welcome

5
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,480
everyone it's a a theme we'll address a little bit

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,559
tomorrow but uh before we begin formally today I'll just say

7
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:45,360
that one of the most important attributes of the IMC practice Community

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,960
is its inclusiveness and so I like to recognize

9
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,840
that there's a lot of us just sitting in without chatting and that we're part of

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,239
the in group too um I like to say that at IMC there are no

11
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:11,360
Outsiders and that U everyone's part of the in

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:19,400
group and that's in part because as many of you know at IMC everything is run by

13
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,960
us every Everybody all the teachers everybody who opens the doors and takes

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,280
care of the facilities it's all volunteers it's all Donna it's all given

15
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:38,000
freely as the teachings are given freely by the teachers all right at seven here on the

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,159
West Coast um and uh been enjoying thinking about

17
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,920
today since yesterday we'll continue with this theme of the Buddhist smile

18
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,880
the smile that develops in the meditation as a result of the the

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,920
deepening of the meditation we we establish and cultivate

20
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:07,520
the conditions for the deepening of the meditation and with its deepening we can expect five knowledges to arise this is

21
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:13,040
the theme of the text that guides us this week and uh the fourth of these

22
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,400
knowledges is I'm going to read it here very it's a really interesting one uh in

23
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,360
the original language in which it's presented can I find

24
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,840
it oh where did it go okay um

25
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:43,000
yeah this one says this meditation is peaceful tranquil unified and not held

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:49,080
in place by forceful suppression so I thought I would call

27
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:56,239
today's uh talk today's talk without Force so important

28
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:03,280
in our practice to avoid forcefully doing anything any even small amount of force or

29
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,840
violence or hostility toward ourselves in the practice toward the mind is

30
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,239
counterproductive and sometimes it takes some dedicated effort to let go some of

31
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:21,799
those habits and for the guided meditation I chose to refer to the Eagle

32
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,200
song Take It Easy those of you of my generation will

33
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,799
already be correcting me and remembering that although the song was made famous by The Eagles it was written by Jackson

34
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:43,959
Brown when he was a teenager don't know what he knew as a teenager about taking it easy but the song um encouraged a

35
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:49,120
generation to take it easy so let's sit

36
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,560
together uh bringing our eyes down bringing our attention inward bringing

37
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,439
our attention downward at the same time and

38
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:06,840
and settling into this familiar place of Greater ease greater

39
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:13,879
Stillness where freedom is possible and where just that possibility

40
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:20,199
just the hint of it can give rise give rise to this in this internal smile that

41
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:25,479
sometimes plays across our features and that we see mirrored echoed in the

42
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:34,720
features of the Buddha and in the various representations of the of the Buddha that surround us in the

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,199
practice we can bring attention to the breathing as one

44
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:47,919
among several bodily experiences that can help ground

45
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:54,520
us give us a center point the breath has these wonderful

46
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:02,360
qualities within it of ease balance Simplicity and slow pace compared to the

47
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:07,478
world of rushing thought in which we're so much

48
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,199
engaged and every time we reconnect with the breath and as I've pointed out

49
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,759
yesterday and I think earlier in the week every time we return to the breath

50
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:27,880
far from being uh the source of frustration that it sometimes appears to us can be useful

51
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:34,240
to think of it as an opportunity to reconnect with the qualities of the breathing that are inherent in the

52
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,080
breathing it's slower than thought it's more simple than the complicated

53
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,319
entangling Place places of range of the mind and it's naturally

54
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:53,680
balanced we don't have to constantly remind the breath to take in this much this much oxygen or exhale this much

55
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,720
waste gas that the breath balances itself if I climb up to the third floor

56
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,319
to get the Bell so I can end a meditation as I did earlier the breath knows what to do going to need some more

57
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:13,360
oxygen it's going to move more quickly I don't have to think about it the

58
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,880
breath and of course there's exceptions sometimes the breath is more complicated I myself have some significant asthma

59
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,280
from childhood but in general the breath is

60
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:32,680
simpler slow and balanced compared to to the world of thought so settle in with

61
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,720
the breath and today take it

62
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:45,160
easy don't let the sound of your own wheels drive you crazy in the words of the song If I remember them

63
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:51,960
correctly and today we can take this as a way to return to the breathing we return to the

64
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:59,319
breath without hurry with gentleness we don't need to engage in

65
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:05,680
the oh I've I've drifted away from the breath the mind has wandered away from the breath or the mind has become all

66
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:12,960
tight around contracted around thinking about the future the past other people myself we can just

67
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:20,280
notice that the mind is thus and then we can gently without hurry as if we're

68
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:26,039
tugging on the leash of a young puppy to come back and sit in our lap maybe again

69
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:32,879
and again we do it it doesn't help to yank we can do this with this fundamental

70
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:39,360
practice of returning our attention to the here and now do it without hurry do it without

71
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:46,639
Force do it without violence or hostility do it without frustration or a

72
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:54,280
sense of failure we can do it without doubt sense of inadequacy or we're not right for the

73
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,800
practice or the practice isn't right for us just return keep it simple

74
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,198
take it

75
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
easy

114
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:22,960
so gently unhurriedly without

115
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,080
Force perhaps almost without trying

116
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:34,960
we allow the Here and Now of our experience to to come back to

117
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,559
Center as we do this fundamental practice in the meditation

118
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:55,159
of opening our attention back up to the here and now when the Mind becomes contracted and tight around

119
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:02,000
thought planning for the future thinking about the past thinking about other people

120
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,399
thinking about ourselves we can bring attention back to

121
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:17,399
the here and now we can open attention back up more broadly to our experience in this moment moment in a way that's

122
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:24,919
gentle the way with the way a way that has no Force no violence no judgment in

123
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:31,240
it and this is so much more important than it seems this fundamental

124
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:37,159
instruction in a way has all the teachings in it to be fully present with

125
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:42,080
our experience without adding anything

126
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,600
extra in the words of the song quoted at the outset can take it

127
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:58,760
easy we can avoid letting the sound of our own wheels

128
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:04,320
drive us crazy what do we do with the sound of

129
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:10,960
our own wheels the Mind spinning what if we just let it come and

130
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:18,799
go we let the sound of our own wheels on the gravel road on the freeway

131
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:24,279
come into awareness and then drift away again

132
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:35,799
as we come to the end of the meditation we can take this attitude of taking it

133
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:41,679
easy allowing our experience to arise so that we can let it

134
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,840
in and let it go we can we can take the

135
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:53,880
ease that comes with that the inner smile that arises and share

136
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,360
it we engage in this practice for our own benefit

137
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:06,399
and we also engage in it for the benefit of others and as we share the

138
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:10,200
ease as we share the

139
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,518
smile as we share the Buddhist

140
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:25,639
smile we're giving something away perhaps but it's not in the giving away

141
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:31,200
diminishing our own ease contentment in the

142
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,480
practice may all beings share in

143
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,960
this contentment and the potential to be

144
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:48,720
awake may all beings be free

145
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:10,658
[Music]

146
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:17,960
thank you everyone and apologies if the first strike of that Bell

147
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:23,120
was a little louder than a little louder than necessary to

148
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,519
bring people gently unhurriedly back to Here and Now

149
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:35,080
good morning again welcome and in the chat I want to acknowledge I see some Dear Old Friends uh and very much

150
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:42,440
appreciate the gesture of practicing together I see Dear Old Friends of my mothers also and acknowledge their

151
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:47,880
presence and again I want to acknowledge all those of us who aren't engaging in

152
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:55,880
the in the chat as it as it Scrolls up so we return to the teachings of this

153
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:02,159
week the five knowledges or understandings that arise

154
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:09,840
as the meditation deepens the text encourages us to cultivate and deepen the meditation

155
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:16,600
practice and then just notes that as we do so five understandings about the meditation

156
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:23,919
arise naturally and I think I've been sort of drawing attention this week to how each of these five help further

157
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:29,399
deepen the practice not surprisingly this is part of the momentum that we

158
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:35,679
create in the practice that as we bring attention to these understandings as

159
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:41,440
they arise we further strengthen that tendency that propensity in our minds in

160
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,200
our lives to move toward greater Freedom sometimes people I'm going to

161
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:54,760
just Riff on that for a second leaving my notes for a moment notes on my the back of my iPhone

162
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:01,080
um to say that sometimes people ask or wonder well when teachers when we teachers say

163
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:07,600
things like cultivate in the practice what does that mean how does that happen there may be many ways it happens

164
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:14,560
through study through you know one way it happens in the meditation practice is simply a function of how our brains work

165
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:21,440
that as we bring attention to Wholesome mind states that strengthens them so going

166
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:28,000
back to the first day when we notice that the pleasure that comes up in the meditation is wholesome that it doesn't

167
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:35,520
depend on outside conditions exterior conditions that it's onward leading that it points towards greater ease as we

168
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,760
notice that and bring it into mind and hold it there it's stronger and it

169
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:48,118
creates forward momentum so today um the knowledge that arises in

170
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:54,560
the meditation is and uh let me see if I can quote the text again where did it

171
00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,800
go um this immersion this this meditation as it deepens is peaceful and

172
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,000
tranquil and unified and is not held in place by forceful suppression and this

173
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,160
is the message today that this Tranquility the unification of mind the

174
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:17,520
collectedness of mind that develops in the meditation isn't a result of force

175
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,160
but rather of letting go and have sort of roughly three things

176
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:28,960
that come up for me as I as I thought about this this morning with my cup of coffee

177
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:36,359
one is that for many of us gathered here uh how we got here how we got where we

178
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:43,280
did in life our professional accomplishments our um successful raising of children or whatever it is um

179
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:50,599
that we've done usually um resulted from a pattern of Engagement with life that

180
00:35:50,599 --> 00:36:00,920
has in it quite a bit of striving quite a bit of planning quite a bit of um effortful um um setting and attaining of

181
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:08,280
objectives and goals which is wonderful that the mind can do those things in this practice

182
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:16,839
there's a way in which we we move into an alternate kind of world where the balance between effort and allowing is

183
00:36:16,839 --> 00:36:22,960
shifted noticeably toward allowing and in this way too we uh in

184
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:30,440
the meditation and in our practices we're taking it easy we're let letting things arise instead of trying to force

185
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:38,440
things to arise and you can notice this throughout the meditation practice that um we

186
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:45,240
provide a certain amount of discipline we come and sit we come and sit together at 7 AM or earlier or later depending on

187
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:51,800
where you are and in doing that we um exert a certain amount of discipline and

188
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,240
effort to create the conditions for the meditation to deepen but then we let the

189
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:04,480
medit a deepen on its own and this knowledge comes to us that

190
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,599
oh it's it's in letting go it's an allowing experience to rise and pass

191
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:17,960
like those tires on a grav road now I'm mixing songs from the 70s and the 90s

192
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:24,680
the Eagles or Jackson Brown with Lucinda Williams nonetheless we let that sound

193
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:30,880
of tires on the road come and go instead of driving us crazy and we do that by

194
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:38,400
allowing it to come up we don't try to keep it from experience and then we let

195
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:46,560
go so this is this is part of um this is part of um an important part

196
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:52,839
of the balance of the practice and it's one of the reasons I think that it's so useful to bring attention again and

197
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:58,319
again to bodily um Sensations particularly that of breathing in which

198
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:03,680
the balance between effort and allowing is there and is effortless and every

199
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:11,160
time we make contact with the breathing it's true of other bodily experience too sounds

200
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:17,280
coming and going in our in our environment for example that we are

201
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:24,400
directly in touch with something that is balanced between effort and allowing and as we bring our mind again

202
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:31,160
and again back in touch with the breathing for example um a little bit of that attitude

203
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:37,480
if you will of the breath rubs off on the mind oh the mind can enjoy finding

204
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:43,760
this place of rest in a balance of efforting and allowing you know I put a

205
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:51,400
little effort in here to gently unhurriedly tug attention back to the breath and then I let

206
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:58,400
go also I allow that experience to arise to be known okay okay the mind's off

207
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:05,000
planning there's some awareness that oh okay there's that happening I bring a exert I drop in a little bit of effort

208
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:11,160
and discipline to reenter open back up maybe if things are very tight to the Here and

209
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:17,200
Now And so there's this constant balance of eorting and allowing efforting by the

210
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:24,040
way which is probably not English is one of Gill's words and so I love it

211
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:30,760
efforting and allowing um just in case people wondered where that was coming from balancing

212
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:35,839
efforting and allowing and it's there in the breath we don't have to make it up we don't have to force it we don't have

213
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:41,800
to create it we don't have to renew it all we do is connect with the breathing where it's already happening it's

214
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:47,599
already part of our experience what we're doing is paying attention oh

215
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:54,880
there's balance here there's balance here and with with time in the mind

216
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,480
enjoys resting in this balance so this knowledge arises for us this

217
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:07,240
fourth knowledge ah resting here um the Mind enjoys this place of

218
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:13,359
balance between effort and allowing between efforting and letting

219
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:20,599
go so that's the first thing I might say um the second thing is this idea of No

220
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:26,119
Force um I think one way

221
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:32,000
to just just know this is that it's not at all uncommon I think it's probably

222
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,040
Universal particularly at the beginning of practice that when we become aware that the mind has wandered we we have a

223
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:46,440
voice inside again it's sometimes that voice of professional accomplishment out there that says dang you know I'm lost I

224
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:51,839
can't I didn't do it right I need to re you know I need to pull a attention back

225
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:57,920
to the breath dang it sometimes we use more forceful language again and again

226
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,440
once again and it's very easy for thoughts to come in like oh it's not working today or it's not working ever

227
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:09,040
or it's not right for me or all those little things that come in and I think

228
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:14,920
it can be useful to notice that in bringing the Mind back to or attention back to the breathing there can

229
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:21,640
sometimes be quite a bit of force exerted and that's Force that's we can let go of over time and this takes some

230
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:27,960
this takes practice to just go oh almost without effort and as you do this more and more those you who've been doing

231
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:33,000
this a while you know that you can attention can come back to the breathing

232
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:40,240
almost without effort almost without any trying happening it's just like oh here's yeah

233
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:46,079
where's Center reentering there's no there's no reason

234
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,880
it should be any different and this is the thing to keep in mind teaching I share that's come to

235
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:58,520
me in my practice from Gil uh is that nothing is out of place in the practice

236
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:04,359
in the meditation there's nothing that comes up that doesn't belong here nothing needs to be pushed away nothing

237
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:12,680
needs to be excluded it's all legitimate part of the practice when we really lean into this

238
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:19,040
uh we return to the breath with a sense of of coess that's a word I'm making up

239
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:25,040
actually um of coess it's just like of course of course of course I come back

240
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,960
to center now doesn't uh doesn't mean that anything's gone wrong doesn't mean

241
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:37,160
that I have done anything wrong doesn't mean that the practice isn't working

242
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:41,160
it's just uh part of what's here

243
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:48,119
now the um so this can be to sum up that

244
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:54,960
second point just that nothing's out of place here in the meditation nothing's

245
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:02,559
not supposed to arise nothing needs to be pushed down pushed away can all be met very gently with an

246
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:10,040
open heart oh it's like this now this is arising

247
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:15,280
now when we do that it's easier to return to Center without

248
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,960
judgment and eventually without much

249
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:30,720
effort final thing this idea of that this knowledge includes in it this idea

250
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:37,040
that this meditation that doesn't benefit from forceful action of the

251
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:43,720
mind is that it that it uh that the meditation is Unified in some way that

252
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:49,000
it's collected that it brings together and holds

253
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:56,359
together uh a lovely part of this knowledge that arises can be the sense

254
00:43:56,359 --> 00:44:02,720
that all of us that is all of you all of all of you can be here all of you is

255
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:11,040
welcome in the meditation it follows on from the second thing nothing needs to be pushed away so

256
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:16,760
yeah all of the things that come up can be included in this experience no aspect

257
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:22,280
of ourselves no um no particular course of

258
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:29,040
thought uh needs to be excluded all of us can be included

259
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:36,160
I uh have the pleasure of put providing a roof to a close friend Dharma friend

260
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:43,240
and teaching colleague Diana Clark last night and this morning I want to give her her props for suggesting that not

261
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:51,000
only can does all of you can be here in the meditation but all of you must be here and this is a really a lovely idea

262
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,359
that one thing we recognize I think and this is part of this fourth knowledge arising is a natural process product of

263
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:04,319
the meditation deepening is the recognition that all of us has to be included here for the meditation to keep

264
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:09,440
getting deeper and uh you know maybe without

265
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:16,119
without any force in that just recognizing that all of it all of it is here all of it has its

266
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:21,680
place here all of it in a sense must be included and included gently included

267
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:27,040
without Force so this simple instruction that we

268
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:33,960
receive and that as teachers we share of returning attention to the breath and the classic formulation is to bring the

269
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:41,079
be breath back to back sorry bring attention back to the breath when it's w when the mind has wandered away just a

270
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:47,359
metaphor the mind doesn't go anywhere um but this instruction which

271
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:52,480
seems so basic I would never say basic it's foundational it has all the

272
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:58,000
teaching in it that the way we interact with our experience including this

273
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,760
experience of mind the way we interact with it is the practice and we can do so in a way

274
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:11,559
that's free where we know oh the mind is like this now it's agitated say or it's

275
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:17,880
at rest we know that and as we become more familiar with that we recognize

276
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:24,160
that the mind has a preference for ease and as we notice that we strengthen that

277
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:29,720
propensity we create a momentum in that direction toward

278
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:35,480
Freedom so to return attention to the breath

279
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:43,079
when the mind has wandered how we do it is critically important and with time you'll notice

280
00:46:43,079 --> 00:46:48,480
you don't have to do very much just notice that when it's done with ease which will happen by itself sometimes

281
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,680
it's better it's Freer it's more supportive of practice it results in a

282
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:59,599
deeper meditation so once again I see we're over time and

283
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:05,240
I could go on and on but I won't I'll close with thanking you uh acknowledging

284
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:11,640
the presence of this large community of several hundred people sitting together supporting one another's

285
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:18,599
practice and uh again I encourage you to share the Buddhist smile today as it comes to you from the meditation as it

286
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:24,680
arises naturally as a as a beneficial byproduct beneficial side effect of the

287
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:30,720
meditation practice to share um with others thank you and see you

288
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,720
tomorrow
