1
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:16,758
so good morning good day hello and um

2
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,560
sometimes it's useful to see ourselves in a different way than

3
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,880
we habitually do so it occurred to me to say to greet you

4
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,960
calling you all earthlings so you know good day earthlings

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,840
and for me that calling ourselves earthlings

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,079
immediate identification with this earth that this is our place this is our home

7
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,199
and that uh there's kind of a mutual kind of identification with all living beings

8
00:00:53,199 --> 00:01:00,399
that are here not just human beings that share this planet and so um to

9
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:08,000
you know to have this different name like different than homo sapiens or people or something

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,200
and so this idea this ability to you know to shift our orientation

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,520
simply with a word uh can make a huge difference in meditation practice and in mindfulness

12
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:29,520
and in liberation because we often are unconsciously many times

13
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,720
conditioned by concepts we've internalized that our society our family

14
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,520
experience somehow points us in that direction so that we think in that way all the time

15
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,880
and i know that sometimes with um

16
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:55,360
like with kovid my son got coveted and i had had contact with him about

17
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:02,320
almost two months ago now and uh and i had contact with him before he knew he was

18
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,439
he had it and so he called me up and explained the situation and

19
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:14,000
so that day i was oriented towards

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:22,560
all kinds of little changes in my body temperature and the raspiness of my throat and

21
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,120
was that is that a headache or not a headache i was having and i was just like enough that my orientation became focused on different

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,319
body parts that were associated with symptoms of copaid

23
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,680
other times uh you know i you know there have been times my life where i've see i used to

24
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,760
have very long blonde hair and i remember uh seeing other people with long blonde hair and

25
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,239
and now i was you know concerned with comparing myself to them and my my orientation who i was through

26
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:58,959
my hair so the ways in which we understand our body

27
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:05,200
can be biased the way we orient ourselves towards our body can be to a particular lens

28
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,640
and that lens can be wind drag that lens can be a little bit of a weight

29
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,519
maybe it's a little bit negative self-talk maybe it's we orient ourselves in a way that towards ourselves that we're not happy

30
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,640
with our body and just connecting to our body is a little bit discouraging and

31
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,640
because of the orientation we have so this 32 or 31 parts of the body

32
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:36,319
exercise one of its functions is to begin shifting the way that we

33
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,840
understand or oriented towards our body the concepts in which we hold it by

34
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:48,560
from one that often can produce a lot of suffering to one that doesn't the one that

35
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,879
actually helps us become concentrated and i think so

36
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,400
so that's all i'll say for now so um you know we're kind of taking a

37
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,519
a side tour a detour right now and the kind of the simplest way of continuing

38
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:12,319
with sati patana but this is the way the text goes and maybe for good reason it's uh now that

39
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:18,959
we've kind of done the foundation work now we're continuing to lay down a stronger foundation with this

40
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,639
32 parts of the of the body

41
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:31,040
i keep saying 32 the usual meditation practice is 32 parts but in this discourse we're doing

42
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,440
there's only listed 31 the brain is left out and

43
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,520
so for today what i'd like to do and for the beginning of this sitting is to

44
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,120
do a version of this practice of the parts of the body

45
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:57,280
often people when they learn it they learn it in groups of five so i'll teach you a group of five

46
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,360
i'll guide you with a few rounds around how doing this and then we'll be silent and you can either continue with the

47
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,960
rounds and just keep doing it and see if the focus on it both

48
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:15,280
develop some concentration and also and or also um

49
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,440
kind of begins orient yourself to your body in a different way that maybe brings more

50
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,880
stability more freedom more ease maybe so see what the difference is how

51
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,840
you do it so

52
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,479
so the the five parts of the body is the

53
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:45,199
progression from the external to the internal so the first is the skin

54
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:51,120
then the flesh then the tendons then the bones

55
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,840
and then the bone marrow so skin tendons

56
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:04,800
skins flesh tendon bones marrow and i'll post it here on the in the chat just

57
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,639
if you want to see it there skin flesh tendons

58
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:17,919
bone marrow and you might try repeating it with me a few times out

59
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:24,639
loud or silently so you get the hang of it skin

60
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:30,639
flesh tendons marrow

61
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,400
tendons bones marrow i need to get the hang of it skin

62
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,720
tendons there we go again skin flesh

63
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,599
tendons bone marrow skin flesh

64
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:55,280
tendon bones marrow so

65
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,560
taking a meditation posture and

66
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,400
kind of maybe shaking a little bit in your body and

67
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,280
swaying back and forth a little bit to help you settle in

68
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,680
and

69
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:25,759
gently closing the eyes and letting the eyes be relaxed

70
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:33,960
some people find it helpful to imagine or feel the eyes as cool cool eyes

71
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:57,080
and then a few long slow deep breaths settling into your body as you exhale

72
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,880
letting your breathing come to normal

73
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,880
and again with the ordinary breath continue this process of

74
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:03,800
relaxing into your body softening

75
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:33,519
and then bring your attention to one of your hands

76
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,839
and you feel the sensations of your hands of your hand

77
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,800
the warmth and coolness that's there

78
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,279
any tingling and pulsing that might be there

79
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,720
any contact of the hand against some other part of the body

80
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,200
pressure weight softness

81
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:30,240
and then for a few moments here now focus on the sensations on the skin

82
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,360
the warmth or coolness that might be there

83
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:47,640
if the skin is touching something feeling the content the contact of the skin

84
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,440
to be aware of the skin but see if you can feel

85
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:08,160
from the sensations of skin more than your thoughts and ideas and

86
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:16,640
memories of what your hands look like we see the hand from the outside

87
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:24,560
when we look at it but we can feel the hand from the inside

88
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,519
to what are the sensations of the skin surface of the hand

89
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,480
with your eyes closed maybe no need to have an image or memory

90
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,800
or ideas about your hand just to feel the skin

91
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:57,839
and then to spread your attention of skin throughout your body

92
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:07,440
letting the awareness float to wherever in the body the skin

93
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,839
has sensations

94
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,519
and be aware of skin

95
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,839
underneath the skin is flesh

96
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,160
the muscles that we have

97
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,279
maybe it includes the fat that's there and can you kind of feel your way or

98
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,600
imagine your way to someplace in your body where

99
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:03,360
you feel the sensations or you sense into it the flesh that's there

100
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,920
the sensations that are deeper than the skin

101
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,160
and feel those

102
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,720
independent of what you think about it the ideas you have

103
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:38,079
that this exercise is giving permission for the flesh to reveal itself

104
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:45,360
in its own terms the flesh has no ideas about

105
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,399
how it should and shouldn't be it just is

106
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,320
and allow the sensations just be

107
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,639
and then going deeper in there's a tendons ligaments

108
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:19,120
perhaps the tendons connecting the bow to the bones

109
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,760
maybe you feel i can imagine them stretched if your knees are bent

110
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:34,399
maybe there's no obvious sensations but vague sense of

111
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,240
location or place or  shape

112
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,480
of tendons

113
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,480
the achilles tendon

114
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:01,040
and if you don't feel it then the exercise is to imagine it

115
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,120
imagine maybe what it looks like

116
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,839
and then deeper is the bones

117
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:32,399
perhaps some version of white white bones

118
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:44,079
perhaps you've seen nowadays around here a lot of life-size halloween

119
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:52,680
skeletons skull and rib cage

120
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,079
hips

121
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,519
if your ability to visualize you can visualize your bones

122
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:16,160
where you can feel or sense the hardness the solidity

123
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,720
the structure of the bones that hold you upright maybe

124
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,759
and then deep in the bones especially some of the larger bones in the body

125
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,759
is marrow

126
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,839
where blood is made life-giving blood is made

127
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:02,120
a little bit more fibrous perhaps than the outer side of the bone

128
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:10,880
imagine visualizing the marrow feeling yourself settling into the

129
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,160
center of some of the bones

130
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:30,079
so for a few rounds i'll just recite this five areas of the body

131
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,759
and let yourself follow the path from this surface to inside

132
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,039
feeling imagining visualizing sensing

133
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,840
these important parts of your physical body

134
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,160
without which you wouldn't be able to manage in your

135
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,160
life

136
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,919
skin

137
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,440
flesh

138
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,640
tendons

139
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,720
bones

140
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,400
marrow

141
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,799
i'll do it one more time and then you're on your own you can do it slower or faster or not at

142
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:24,120
all skin

143
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,799
flesh

144
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,880
tendons

145
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,919
bones

146
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,600
marrow

147
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,919
you

148
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,399
and then as we come to the end of the setting

149
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,960
to consider other people and maybe for them also to

150
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,039
see them in a new way different than the usual one

151
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:07,039
but perhaps to see them as skin flesh

152
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:11,278
tendons bones and marrow

153
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,158
to imagine to visualize

154
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,360
to reflect that they too just like you have skin

155
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,600
flesh tendons bones and marrow

156
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:40,640
they too have the skin that holds everything together

157
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:48,080
flesh and muscles that store nutrients and

158
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:53,440
house the muscles to which we can be active

159
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,480
tendons that hold the bones together

160
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,000
the bones they too have bones

161
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,120
and marrow

162
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:17,440
all material that it's arisen out of this earth

163
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,240
all material which is recycled

164
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,279
our physical beings are made up of recycled materials

165
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,200
atoms that are in us now and

166
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,840
will be somewhere else when we die

167
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:59,279
we are made from this earth

168
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,399
earthlings all of us

169
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:16,320
and perhaps sensing the physicality and the earthiness of each being

170
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:23,039
perhaps seeing them differently in a way that

171
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:28,799
we share so much commonality we share

172
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:35,120
our earthling-ness we share

173
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,760
in this endless recycling of material

174
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,080
may we live together as a community of earthlings may we live

175
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:01,840
together with care for each other with respect for each

176
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:08,398
other with generosity to each other

177
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:17,240
may we live together with love for each other

178
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,600
and may we in small or large ways

179
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:33,840
find ways to live and express that love the care the respect

180
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:41,919
for other earthlings may all beings be happy

181
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,919
may all beings be free

182
00:31:51,820 --> 00:32:00,970
[Music]

183
00:32:54,240 --> 00:33:01,519
so we're exploring the fourth exercise

184
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:07,440
of the satipatanasuta and perhaps some of you who are settling

185
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:14,000
in to the sequence from before feel like we're taking a little detour

186
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,960
and now we're using parts of our mind that are usually not associated with mindfulness practice

187
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:28,000
imagination reflection consideration

188
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,120
of these body parts that we have and

189
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:40,000
i think it's worthwhile pointing out that this is a time-honored practice in the buddhist

190
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,039
tradition and monastics are so many novice or new monastics this is the

191
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:51,039
first practice they're given and it's meant to set the stage the

192
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:56,799
foundation for developing practice further it kind of changes the kind of the

193
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:03,760
mental ecology in a certain way that maybe makes it easier to settle when we get back into kind of really

194
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,040
focusing in the in the more you know classic idea of what

195
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,079
mindfulness practice is and for one thing what it does it's

196
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:22,000
meant to cultivate concentration and so uh some people will memorize the list of

197
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,040
31 or 32 if the brain is added to it and

198
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:33,679
and then once you've memorized it just keep reciting it and some people there's a practice of doing it forward and

199
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,679
backwards so memorizing it from from from the

200
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:46,079
starts with the head hair it ends with urine so you go in that direction and then you do it backwards from urine to

201
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:52,878
head here and it requires focus and attention to stay on it and

202
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:58,880
keep it at a regular pace that it's very hard to think about other things and wonder off

203
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:06,560
and to keep doing it over and over again kind of like a little bit like a mantra but do it over and over again it was something that requires uh alertness and

204
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:12,880
an eff certain kind of effort uh over time that that disgrace distracted mind might quiet down and

205
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:19,200
settle and we find there's a gathering together a focusing of the mind

206
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,400
that then we can stop using focusing on reciting the parts of the

207
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,000
body and just focus now on the practice itself because we're stable or steady so

208
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,760
it's a way of building concentration the other thing it does is that

209
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:42,640
it shifts the orientation towards our body from one maybe if if one has a kind of

210
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:49,119
unhelpful orientation to the body for example just body image some people are caught up in body image some people

211
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:55,200
spend a tremendous amount of time fixing their body image making it just right

212
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:01,040
and and then body image often involves a lot of comparative thinking

213
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,839
and um the um

214
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:12,160
and the painful comparative thing a lot of suffering when we make involved in the world of comparative thinking of how

215
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:19,520
i am compared to others and to shift out of that mode the concentration is one way to do that

216
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:27,040
but to do it also to begin developing a different way of understanding perceiving the body

217
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,800
and to see the body not as a unified whole which sometimes lends itself to a

218
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,640
kind of abstract concepts but to look at the parts of the body individually as if

219
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,200
each of them stands out by itself and there are two uh analogies given

220
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,760
um known as one here one analogy given here for this particular way of seeing the body in parts

221
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:57,599
and that is um a bag like a bag of skin but a bag

222
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,800
that contains a lot of

223
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:10,720
rice and beans so here's the description just as if a person with good eyesight

224
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:18,720
were to look into a sack with an opening at each end filled with various kinds of seeds such as fine rice

225
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,960
patty rice mung beans garbanzo beans sesame seeds and husk rice

226
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:31,359
one would recognize this is fine rice this is patty rice this is mung beans these are garbanzo beans these are

227
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:38,000
sesame seeds soda practitioner reviews visualize imagines

228
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,200
this very body uppered from the soles of the feet downward from the head of the hair

229
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,599
covered with skin and full of various kinds of unclean things in this body

230
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:55,839
there is head here body here nails teeth and skin

231
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:01,440
flesh tendons bones marrow kidneys

232
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,040
heart uh liver diaphragm spleen

233
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:13,280
lungs large intestines small intestines contents of the stomach

234
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:19,280
feces bio phlegm um

235
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,760
pus and blood sweat

236
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:32,760
fat tears oil um

237
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:41,040
fat tears oil and snot

238
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,200
saliva fluid of the joints and

239
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,640
urine so the

240
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:59,760
so when we've used oneself the same way and when i imagine this bag full of seeds

241
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:06,240
and beans and different colors and be able to see each one you know clearly for what is being different from

242
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,359
the others and be able to see the difference but don't all blend

243
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:17,359
the same they're all different and distinct and i've i imagine these seeds has been

244
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:23,680
quite beautiful now fresh dried new seeds are so beautiful to have to see

245
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,720
at least i admire them and and so there's a kind of uh positive

246
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,240
association then with how we review this body uh even though so

247
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,920
this it is a house and the idea of seeing it as being unclean or

248
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:46,640
impure or something and um but we're shifting our orientation

249
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:52,880
and in a new way to these parts of the body and feeling different ways so

250
00:39:52,880 --> 00:40:00,160
so to go through and have memorized the 31 parts and then to use it as a body scan

251
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:07,359
and simply go through over and over again so it's not just like a chant that you do but it's uh now it's a guided meditation

252
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:14,960
you give yourself and you go steadily through the body to feel the different parts or imagine the different parts

253
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:22,000
and so it certainly breaks can break up the hegemony of the old body image and body

254
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,640
ideas and body challenges that we have on image and ideas of the body to a new way of

255
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:34,000
experiencing the body that can be much more compassionate than freeing

256
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,200
but it also begins awakening our capacity to feel the body to be in the

257
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:46,480
body and this is also one of the great functions of this exercise is to start feeling more connected to your body

258
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,480
so that it becomes easier and easier to practice breathing with the whole body

259
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,520
sensing the whole body and the more you can feel your whole body

260
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:04,480
then as the meditation practice continues to develop it the body then becomes a better

261
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,920
receptor or repository for some of the good feelings that

262
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:15,200
develop through meditation some of the relaxation some of the joy some of the

263
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,560
delight some of the pleasures that come as we settle into the practice

264
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,760
and the practice can build on that foundation of well-being that

265
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:32,560
can be spreading through the body it makes it easier to stay grounded and present

266
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:38,800
so uh these are some of the functions the last function is that is um

267
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:45,599
is for people who have a lot of sexual lust and sexual imagination of partners and all

268
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:51,119
kinds of creative things human bodies can do with each other that

269
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:57,599
sometimes this 32 parts of the body are given as a way to somehow

270
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:05,440
break out of the way of considering bodies if that were required for sexual lust to happen

271
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,480
and maybe you don't feel like that's very interesting to do or you know valuable

272
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,560
to do but for people who are trying to meditate especially like a lot of meditation

273
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:21,839
and find themselves repeatedly pulled into the world of sexual fantasy sexual desires

274
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:29,920
it's one of the antidotes and so it ends up being less frustrating than trying to continually working against

275
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,520
you know their sexual ideas their feelings desires one has

276
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,720
and um and remember that this practice is often given to the new

277
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,240
monks you know and young men who maybe have a

278
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,760
you know young women nuns and maybe you have a little bit more orientation around that than

279
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:56,560
older people sometimes do so

280
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,319
so this is a practice of concentration of developing contact to the body

281
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:10,079
awakening the body and finding more freedom through a new connection to the body

282
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,359
so we'll do this uh spend one more day on this tomorrow and then we'll move on

283
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:20,720
to the next exercise and um and i hope that uh

284
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:27,680
the little contact we do here gives you some appreciation for this practice and also some sense of how it

285
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,839
can be beneficial and be a resource a way of practicing it at a times when

286
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:41,760
it'd be useful so hair

287
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:49,359
head hair body hair nails teeth skin and flesh tendons

288
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:54,640

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,560
fluids of the joints and urine

294
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:31,440
may you enjoy your body today may you be connected to your body

295
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:39,040
and um and curious about your body and more familiar with your body

296
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,760
so thank you
