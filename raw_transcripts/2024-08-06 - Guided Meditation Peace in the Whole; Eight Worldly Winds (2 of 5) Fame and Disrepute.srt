1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:09,639
hello everyone and welcome and uh for this meditation today

2
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:16,640
I want to continue on the instructions of wholeness somehow

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:24,320
our capacity to have the attention be broad enough to some to take in the

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,359
whole of the present moment uh it's possible to be

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:40,480
in a natural setting maybe at the beach or a park and be absorbed and looking at

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,840
some or preoccupied with some insect or a snake that's right there on the path and and to be absorbed in that maybe

7
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,640
fascinated by it and then um or maybe part of a conversation with a friend

8
00:00:53,640 --> 00:01:01,719
that's intense and difficult and and then uh something there's a pause and

9
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:09,240
standing up and looking around and seeing wow the whole of this natural

10
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,680
setting includes so much more than the conversation or the insect the particular thing we're focusing on and

11
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,079
there's a sense of kind of the expansiveness and broadness and a wider

12
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:27,079
context for what's happening rather than what's right up in the details of it

13
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:34,640
all and much of the ways in which we're troubled uh is because there's something

14
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,720
that we are focusing on something we're thinking about concerned with something we're

15
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,680
feeling and without having to make anything go

16
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:55,719
away uh there is another way of finding peace and that is the peace that is

17
00:01:55,719 --> 00:02:01,960
broader that's wider and the

18
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:10,119
particular trouble that we have to expand outwards it's kind of like um maybe

19
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:16,120
being in a very large room and then somehow becoming a tune to

20
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:22,440
the empty space in the room none that holds the chairs the tables the people

21
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,760
that are in the room they all happen within that wider space but the space in

22
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:35,319
and of itself is calm is peaceful even if the people are arguing

23
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:44,120
or being you know rushing around so the context of Peace The Wider

24
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:50,519
peace that's here that's there beyond the edges of whatever you're troubled by

25
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:59,959
whatever is challenging beyond the edges of it in the space space of awareness around it

26
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:06,760
and see if that can um support you to be here for whatever

27
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:13,000
is happening mindful in a non-reactive way mindful

28
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,360
without picking anything up or pushing anything away expanding outward into the hole the

29
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:27,560
peaceful sense of wide attention so to

30
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,840
begin being centered here in the

31
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:42,040
hole by feeling where the weight of your body is supported by a cushion a chair a

32
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,280
bed a floor wherever the weight of your body

33
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:59,319
rests and gently taking a little deeper breaths and as you exhale settle into

34
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:06,239
the place place where your weight rests that your weight is of your body

35
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,040
is held place of

36
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,959
contact gently close your

37
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:31,720
eyes and as you exhale relax the shoulder

38
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:38,600
the shoulders G give let them give into the

39
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,240
pool of

40
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,759
gravity relaxing the

41
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:59,159
belly maybe there's a softening of the fingers and the hands

42
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,918
a softening of the thighs and

43
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,240
legs and a softening of the thinking

44
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:31,199
mind any physical tension pressure you feel connected to thinking

45
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:38,000
physical sense of agitation there's

46
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,280
always the calm or peace beyond the edges of your

47
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,319
thoughts that your thoughts don't fill the

48
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,880
universe beyond the edges of the tension and

49
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,440
pressure there's peace and calm as you

50
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:10,160
exhale let the pressure and tension of thinking relax outward into that

51
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:33,000
peace and to the degree to which you can sense the Bas around your

52
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,319
body that is not your body but surrounds the

53
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:54,080
body feel the calm or the Stillness of the space

54
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:04,599
itself let your awareness be wide and Broad to

55
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:15,000
include peace the calm that's beyond the edges of your thoughts and your

56
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,120
feelings sensations of your body

57
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,680
and as if that wider calm or

58
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:50,159
piece holds all things even what is difficult is Nest

59
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:55,960
nested in The Wider peace and calm

60
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,599
and in the middle of it all is

61
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,759
breathing inhale begins and as the body

62
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,479
expands the sense of attention expanding outwards into the

63
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,759
peace and as you as you inhale

64
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:36,080
I think I meant to say the inhale as it expands it touches the peace and the

65
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,399
calm all around and as you

66
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,440
exhale bringing that peace and calm

67
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:54,320
back to touch the depth inside of

68
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:05,760
you breathing a massage that goes out into the hole of

69
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,600
everything touching the

70
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,079
peace with the exhale returning that

71
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:22,279
peace to some tender place

72
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
within

73
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
for

74
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
for

75
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
for

76
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
for

77
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
for

78
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
for for

79
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
for for

80
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:03,920
if you become preoccupied with thoughts or feelings

81
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,720
events in your life notice how that is a collapsing or

82
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,480
Contracting or narrowing of

83
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:24,399
attention and see if you can open up wider beyond the edges of your

84
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:31,800
concerns notice that there's more Happening Here and Now than you're think thinking you're

85
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:40,880
feeling not to dismiss or ignore but to include more to put things

86
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,120
in context

87
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:56,440
and and even expand outwards through the whole the whole experience of the

88
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:02,399
present moment that includes the Body Sensations the

89
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:10,279
emotions the mental States all of it working

90
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:18,600
together the whole that goes beyond any particular thing that includes the calm

91
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:27,440
or the Peace of nonattached attention

92
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,480
in which everything

93
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
swims

94
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

95
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

96
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

97
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

98
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
for

99
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

100
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

101
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

102
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

103
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

104
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,480
for for

105
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:01,360
for for

106
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,320
and as we come to the end of this

107
00:25:50,320 --> 00:26:00,120
sitting to appreciate or notice whatever way you are more SLE

108
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,720
calmer more peaceful now than at the beginning of the

109
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:12,000
meditation even if there's still something which troubles

110
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:23,039
you is there also a subtleness a quieter place within around

111
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:33,200
you do you have a reference point for some degree of calm or

112
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:40,679
peace sense of [Music] well-being sense of

113
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:45,760
being here and now in a way that

114
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:53,320
feels wholesome or feels right maybe feels better than some of

115
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:59,640
the alternative ways you can be when you

116
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,880
get up and get involved in your life taking care of all the details and

117
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,960
things the return of your

118
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:20,320
concerns and what if in your encounters with other

119
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:27,679
people you stay grounded and rooted in this sense of calm where peace

120
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:33,000
settl well-being

121
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:41,360
rightness that it becomes a reference point to not become

122
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:49,559
reactive aggressive

123
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:56,600
assertive closed down but

124
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,360
rather being settled on

125
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:10,399
yourself you can meet others with Good

126
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:18,600
Will with basic friendliness basic

127
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,760
Simple Kindness

128
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:34,640
so that whoever you encounter today something inside of

129
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,279
you remembers to have good

130
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:48,640
will wishing everyone you meet may they be

131
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:58,880
happy may they be safe may they be peaceful

132
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:07,320
may they be free of Oppression and attachments and

133
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,769
[Music]

134
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:39,399
thank

135
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,000
you e

136
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,720
[Music] so welcome to this second talk on the

137
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,200
eight worldly winds and perhaps it's easy enough to

138
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:55,559
focus on these worldly winds as problems and somehow contend with them

139
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:02,600
as the problem and we have to do something about them so these worldly winds are the ways

140
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:09,919
in which the ways of the world uh get us caught get

141
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:16,679
us push us around or trouble us or get us

142
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:22,720
reactive and um so these to remind you these are gain and

143
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,799
loss Fame and disrepute fame and disgrace

144
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:34,960
praise and blame and um Pleasure and

145
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:42,480
Pain so today I want to talk about this um Fame and disgrace Fame and

146
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:49,240
disrepute and um but I don't want to start with the idea that they're out there and problems and how terrible they

147
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:56,720
are and how they cause problems for us and we should do something about them but rather to start with a having a

148
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:03,000
reference point with in and this is the advantage of Buddhist practice what we're looking for through Buddhist

149
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:10,679
practice Buddhist Meditation is um a way of being a reference point a state a quality of

150
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:17,679
being a a a way of practicing that uh where we feel this is

151
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:25,799
good this is right this there's a sense of well-being there's a sense of Peace sense of at homeness a sense of being

152
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:30,919
settled here and now a sense of uh being

153
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:36,600
somehow uh disentangled from all the preoccupations normally were caught

154
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:44,120
in so there's something like that and it's a wide range of possibility exactly what this is uh maybe it's just a little

155
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,559
bit calmer than usual and that's a reference point to

156
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:55,519
understand ourselves better to and what we understand we understand how we lose

157
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:01,840
that calm we lose the peace we lose the being rooted in ourselves at home in

158
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:07,480
ourselves we learn how we sacrifice ourselves give ourselves up for the good

159
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:15,200
cause for the bad cause for uh for our resentments for our uh the you know the

160
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:21,519
um our our hurts our um grudges all kinds of things our

161
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:28,720
desires our wishes we we leave and depart we ignore we abandon

162
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:35,000
the sense of being centered and rooted here in ourselves and so we want to understand

163
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,000
this and as we understand it we understand and see that it's not it's

164
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,000
better actually not to be caught it's better to be more subtle than unsettled it's better to be calm than to be

165
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:54,399
agitated it's better to be um peaceful than it is to be

166
00:33:54,399 --> 00:34:02,159
conflictive and uh and not that it's just a cognitive idea that we should be a certain way but it's uh almost as if

167
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:08,440
you know put your hand on the hot stove and you move your hand automatically goes away you don't have to have a

168
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:17,358
philosophy or a belief or a sense of should operating that pulls the hand away standing on a uh stepping on a on a

169
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,760
um on a splinter on your foot we pull we we stop we don't keep walking with it we

170
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,079
pull it out so it's that simple that we are kind

171
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,799
of beginning to I'm going to sneeze so hang

172
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:46,158
on I hope I turned off the mic in time so um so that um it's that simple

173
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:52,760
that we have this reference point and with that reference point we can understand these worldly winds better

174
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:58,960
and our relationship to it we learn that the worldly winds are ways in which we

175
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:04,920
give up or sacrifice or abandon or lose touch with something that feels uh

176
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:13,119
holistic something feels good right something that allows us to enter the world in a Wholesome Way in a connected

177
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,160
way in a useful way in a uh rather than one that makes the

178
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:24,440
whole situation worse and so uh for the

179
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:29,119
um hang on a minute again

180
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:45,760
so um uh so this is where we come now to these worldly winds that these are ways

181
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:53,160
which many people can easily lose themselves easily lose touch with what has been developing in the in meditation

182
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:59,800
or Buddhist practice with the goodness the wholeness the sense of being at peace with

183
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,359
oneself and so one of the second the second pair is Fame and

184
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:13,440
distribute and uh Fame uh is well known to really trip people up

185
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:20,200
when people are feeding on the fame when their sense of Vitality their sense of

186
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:27,040
rightness a sense of having value as a person depends on having lots of people

187
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:34,640
uh Focus on you and some people it uh it's even um um Fame you know Fame I

188
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:42,960
guess I think I think the word fame here doesn't mean um means having a really good reputation in the world um and so

189
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,040
that uh somehow you're uh not the same thing as praise which is the next one

190
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:55,720
but just many many people know you you feel so there's a feeling of that you have value you're connected you're

191
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:02,160
Somebody by the number of uh you know friends you have on Instagram or

192
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,280
Facebook or the number of people who log on to YouTube Every Morning to listen

193
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:16,160
that that's where the sense of Vitality and S of liveness and something when we don't have that we feel deflated we feel

194
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:23,720
lost we feel somehow uh you know that we're not fully Alive anymore because

195
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:30,599
the aliveness is fed is be feeding on others feeding on this sense of uh Fame

196
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:35,760
and and uh what people think of us what people are thinking of us that

197
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:42,920
we're known we're somebody and uh and then the pendulum can swing to disrepute to being

198
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:48,200
disgraced to having a bad reputation in the world where again our sense of

199
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:53,520
well-being or uh is really dependent on what others think of us and how many

200
00:37:53,520 --> 00:38:00,319
people think of this and um and uh and so there what there isn't is

201
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:06,400
being fed from the inside out what there isn't is uh learning to be alive

202
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,000
breathing in a relaxed Way open way settled way and allowing and feeling

203
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,560
quite content with ourselves quite at home and at peace with ourselves it is

204
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,680
possible to have that and it's very difficult to believe that sometimes when

205
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:32,280
the whole our whole psychophysical system has been conditioned by Society by our experience by by by being fed

206
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:39,720
from the outside in and um and so this drive uh that we have to get it we have

207
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:46,920
to have it and so uh if uh if the fame goes away

208
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:53,760
which inevitably Fame goes away then or is not there in the same way to

209
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:01,040
feed us and to support us and to energize us uh and there there's nothing inside to replace it then some people

210
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,240
crash and get depressed and and uh feel kind of lost and feel like they don't

211
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:13,960
count and and you know sometimes uh um you know it's people lives unwind in

212
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:21,400
deep and painful ways um and uh or if there's this uh uh

213
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:28,839
dis people feel disgraced or feel like they now lots of people think that they're aad person

214
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:35,880
then uh that also something then uh is is challenged inside that uh we're not

215
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:42,599
getting reinforced this outer validation and um and

216
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:47,680
so there's nothing wrong necessarily with Fame there's nothing wrong

217
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,440
necessarily with not having any Fame to losing that fame um where the where the

218
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:01,319
challenge is is how we're relating to it and if we're relating to it as the

219
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:08,079
source of our well-being then it's a challenge and the one of the one of the

220
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:15,839
benefits of doing maybe any kind of spiritual practice or anything that connects us to a kind of much more of

221
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:21,359
a I almost want to say innate sense of well-being a sense of well-being that

222
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:27,839
doesn't have to have a reason being fed from the outside of um success and Fame

223
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:33,400
and recognition and all this it just because we're breathing because we're

224
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:41,000
alive that's enough just being in this world in a kind open supportive way and

225
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,280
not succumbing to the beliefs that we have to be different we have to have

226
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,359
more we have to be known and recognized and do something big in the world so

227
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:58,079
that we have our 15 minutes of fame uh it's okay just to be alive and

228
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,280
present and here and uh and the one of the

229
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:10,280
validations of this whole approach of Buddhist practice finding some deep inner peace here that's unconditioned

230
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:15,880
unaffected unpend not dependent on the world and things and thoughts and

231
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:21,040
feelings is that um this turns out to be a

232
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,480
phenomenally effective powerful meaningful way to respond and live in

233
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:33,640
the world in a Wholesome Way with compassion and care and love and and uh

234
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:39,720
and um and caregiving to this world a caregiving to the world a love and a

235
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:45,720
compassion where we don't lose ourselves in the process uh we don't uh feel like

236
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:51,440
we have to hurry and rush and our sense of well-being our sense of personhood is

237
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:57,640
depended on um the outcomes of our of our service our care our love of the

238
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:04,119
things we do we do things because it's the natural or easy kind of

239
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:09,280
manifestation of being deeply at peace and connected not because of what we get

240
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:15,400
from it or what we should happen from ourselves so that's why Fame and

241
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:22,920
disrepute is such an important thing to be attentive to because uh uh it's a way

242
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:28,000
of losing touch with ourselves losing the ways in which we can be fed from the

243
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:36,000
inside out where we can feel the Deep sense of contentment just to be just to be here

244
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,599
trusting or more than trusting knowing that being at peace and

245
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:49,000
settled with almost like with nothing you have to do that that is a powerful

246
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,960
and effective uh state from which to

247
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:01,440
do and and it's a little bit of a paradox to not have to do

248
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:08,240
anything allows us to do everything peacefully and effectively and uh

249
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:15,440
without succumbing to clinging in attachment

250
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:21,319
so um so Fame and disrepute whether it's

251
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:27,800
Fame locally in our neighborhood or places at work that uh or whether it's

252
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:34,400
uh you know these days many people have um on social media and count their

253
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:41,040
friends and the connections maybe Fame is

254
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:48,800
overrated and maybe disrepute to the lack of Fame is also overrated and we

255
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,880
don't have to base our life on either one so thank you very

256
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:03,040
much and and um I have one announcement and uh the Spirit Rock

257
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:10,079
Meditation Center that I'm very connected to up in Marin County uh had asked me to invited me or requested of

258
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:17,000
me to uh do kind of a event celebrating the publication of my new book this year

259
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,800
called Everything Is practice and I agreed and and then and now they would

260
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:30,400
like me to uh try to um encourage people to come to it and um so maybe some of

261
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,640
you would like to come it's this coming Sunday it's on zoom and it's at 6: pm

262
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,440
and I'll talk a little bit about my book but I didn't really want to focus only on my book so I want to talk a little

263
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:47,559
bit about um the great value of retreat practice the book is kind of a manual

264
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:54,040
for insight Retreat practice so that's what I want to kind of just uh talk a little bit about so some of you might be

265
00:44:54,040 --> 00:45:02,440
interested in going to it there's a link to it you have to register there's a link to it on the IMC homepage on that

266
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:09,200
little box in the lower right there's called what's new there's an announcement there about it and uh also

267
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:15,599
if you go on Spirit Rock's website you can probably find it and um it's a small I think it'll be

268
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:22,880
small somewhat intimate kind of opportunity on Zoom to have a discussion and and uh I'm certainly looking forward

269
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:27,960
to um having this uh little period of

270
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,559
exchange so thank you
