may all beings be free may all beings be well including myself

135
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:30,919
thank you all thank you for your practice

136
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:43,039
I'll say a couple of words about what we did tonight

137
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:49,679
so I invited us to first start with selling with the body

138
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:57,500
a sense of connection of the sit Bones the feet with the body with the Earth

139
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:04,440
and the sense of letting our s letting us take our seat on this Earth just as

140
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:11,520
the Buddha did letting there be a sense of a brightness of awe that we are part of this amazing

141
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:18,240
world this and this body knows how to breathe it has so many capacities and

142
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:24,480
then I invited us to feel into the Delight the pleasure first with the

143
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:31,500
breath and then knowing there is Delight there's just built-in delight and joy

144
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:37,559
that we often miss to know to to be aware in the Here and

145
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:46,679
Now that no matter what it is we are knowing breath Sensations thoughts Etc and again

146
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:52,320
at first we get our training wheels just knowing the breath knowing the perhaps

147
00:31:52,320 --> 00:32:01,200
the comfortable areas of the body then we open up more and more to other phenomena and and then when we even know

148
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:09,419
dukkha when we know suffering when we know challenge pain in the heart or in the body there is a light I know that for myself

149
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:16,380
and I know that from many many practitioners there is the sense of delight to know actually to meet what's

150
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:24,120
challenging so they're pushing it away or or not going to deal with it being afraid of it all but seeing it just

151
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:31,260
knowing it always like this oh there's a sense of a brightness there's a sense of strength pleasure Delight

152
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:36,899
and another thing that I invited us to feel into and bring in was enjoying the

153
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:42,419
Delight the pleasure of of practice the breath the body because sometimes

154
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:47,820
Buddhism get gets this bad rap about being a joy denying practice like you're

155
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:53,460
not supposed to enjoy your practice you're supposed to concentrate on

156
00:32:53,460 --> 00:33:00,380
couldn't be further from the truth and so much longer talk but but um

157
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:06,360
enjoy without attaching without grasping like I want more but when it's here of

158
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:12,779
course enjoy it take Delight in the Delight that's present now if you I want oh that thing

159
00:33:12,779 --> 00:33:18,480
that just happened I want more of that no that will be cause of suffering so don't do that but when it's here just

160
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:25,140
enjoy and Let It Go like the poem uh I'll maybe I'll grab it

161
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:30,899
when you're in in breakout rooms or one who kisses the joy as it flies

162
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:39,840
um lives in eternity's Sunrise so with that I'd like to invite us now

163
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:46,320
turn to turn to practicing in small groups maybe groups of three you'll be

164
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:54,419
about six or seven minutes roughly and and the prompt is

165
00:33:54,419 --> 00:34:00,480
um again you can pass when your turn comes you can just say pass and and hold

166
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,899
um silence hold kind silence for yourself and for others you don't have to share

167
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:12,118
when your turn comes and let's Go reverse alphabetical order and when your

168
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:18,780
turn comes um if you want to share something about how this was for you oh yeah I related

169
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:24,179
or it wasn't or I related with but the body but not with the cow or wow was

170
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:29,398
amazing it actually lit up or I slept the whole time I just woke up it's

171
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:34,800
perfectly fine there are no wrong answers it's just showing up and and and

172
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,800
being held witness with community and holding others witness so

173
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,378
you'll have the chance to maybe share for a minute the next person if they want they'll share for a minute the next

174
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:53,520
person for a minute and then you have a chance to add some more so so let it not be a long monologue just a nugget and go

175
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:00,119
around and run and again you can always say pass and we share from our own experience we don't ask questions or

176
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:09,240
give advice uh just I statements um so creating a a offering each other

177
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:15,480
kindness this is really where the practice meets the rubber meets the road

178
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:22,500
offering each other kindness and um and acceptance what whatever they say

179
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:29,099
couldn't couldn't be greater couldn't be better um not you know asking questions or

180
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:35,220
interrogating okay so I've created the rooms again take care of yourselves take care of each other what a great

181
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:40,320
opportunity to to uh chat with a couple of other

182
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:47,640
um practitioners about this practice again The Prompt has to do with how is this practice of finding joy and feeling

183
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:54,540
into the joy the light of knowing knowing what's here right now and also wearing a smile I

184
00:35:54,540 --> 00:36:00,839
forgot that wearing a smile at the end all right here we go enjoy take care of each other take care

185
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:04,700
of yourselves opening all rooms

186
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:18,420
five more seconds and while we're waiting okay I think the rooms are closed okay everybody's back and

187
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:24,720
and uh great so we have some time for for reflection especially if you haven't

188
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:32,339
shared in a while or love to ask you to pull forward uh Richard your hand shut

189
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:35,180
up what's up

190
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:47,040
mute okay um I tonight I I wish I could have heard

191
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,880
the summary of The Meditation before the meditation

192
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:58,859
because you know the because it's almost like I keep on getting

193
00:36:58,859 --> 00:37:04,560
my attention is always torn between let's say my breath and the instructions

194
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,820
and I think for me it would be easier to hear the general outline ahead of time

195
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:16,579
so it would be easier to like follow it

196
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:22,800
yeah yeah okay I appreciate hearing that um and

197
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,859
and yet there are advantages I I I I see both I think there are advantages and

198
00:37:28,859 --> 00:37:36,119
disadvantages to both and sometimes I do it that way and sometimes I do it the other way so yeah thanks for for your

199
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:43,200
feedback Richard I appreciate that for you hearing the the instructions while I'm giving them out loud for some people

200
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,500
actually kind of not overloading at the beginning but just giving it piece by piece like oh yeah

201
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:55,200
here we are but but I appreciate both ways thanks for sharing that Richard

202
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,720
foreign hi

203
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:07,579
um the part I really liked was when you said you don't have to be a Puritan it's okay to enjoy it

204
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:12,839
which I took to add to my practice and also um you know just like why can't I

205
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:18,480
just add some warmth to the breath here instead of it just being clinically the breath

206
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,060
and then I was also applying it to like oh I don't have to be a Puritan and be

207
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:31,320
so serious when I'm getting through my list of things work I do all day it's like ah this would have to be a

208
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:38,160
Puritan I love that yay yay thanks Susan so having descended

209
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,460
from one it's in my bloodline

210
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:48,900
yeah yeah and and also it's it's again in the west it feels like it's so much

211
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:54,960
part of the perceived Buddhist teachings to be so serious and awakened and

212
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,240
whereas actually they light and joy and pleasure are really important part of

213
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:06,960
the path really important um so yeah thanks Susan I appreciate I

214
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,300
appreciate how that how you share that really uh uh clicked for you yeah may

215
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:19,140
you have joy may you enjoy all everything you do during the day not just the breath but everything everything on your to-do list

216
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:25,800
Kenneth please um yeah so um

217
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,740
I enjoy sometimes not knowing because you have some nice Buddhist tricks

218
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:37,619
like will said loving kindness out to other everybody else for 20 minutes and then all of a sudden we'll send it back

219
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:42,720
to us we'll go whoa and that that really works so as I call

220
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:49,020
it a Buddhist trick um I have a a little this is not a big issue but sometimes I wake up and I

221
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:54,859
don't feel good so I do uh Tomlin practice

222
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:03,079
I don't have trouble stopping it it just wants to go on and on you know

223
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:12,359
why is that a problem wait so just just for references when you

224
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:18,960
mentioned tongling just for for folks who may not know what that is that's a beautiful beautiful Buddhist uh

225
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:26,400
Tibetan Buddhist practice of of taking in breathing in the The Suffering of

226
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:32,640
other suffering of herself suffering of the world suffering breathing and suffering and and and imagining that the

227
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,099
heart transforms it into peace into into sucker and then breathing it out in such

228
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:44,220
a beautiful practice so with every breath it feels like oh we're bringing peace and goodness to ourselves to

229
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:51,240
others it's it's a lovely practice it's breathing with breathing with suffering and transforming it so that's what Ken

230
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:59,119
is talking about what's the problem for it wanting to continue to go on I'm not sure

231
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:06,980
it is a very nice breakfast I love it oh it's a lovely lovely so so but I'm

232
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:14,400
I feel like a problem can you just go on or is it a problem let's explore that I

233
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:21,359
cuddle babies at the hospital no and I use Tylenol with the babies all time

234
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:27,780
because I'm just breathing out love and kindness to them and breathing in I don't know some kind

235
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:34,140
of suffering so I I don't know it's just once I started it in the morning if I'm half asleep it just goes on and on and

236
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:39,960
on shouldn't I stop this at some point oh my God are you kidding me I'm just I'm

237
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:47,880
loving and other I see other hearts and thumbs up showing up on on um on Zoom like people I I think we're

238
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:54,000
all supporting you can keep keep doing it it's lovely that it's become so

239
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,180
I'm still free so lovely that it's become natural for you so oh my goodness this is this

240
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:05,640
actually let's celebrate it and and their mind that them peace of mind that

241
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:12,660
comes and says oh um shouldn't I stop this the answer is why are you asking me who are you making

242
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:18,060
a problem on it from something that's actually a beautiful cultivation you've

243
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:24,359
cultivated it so much that it's now become an automatic response to the

244
00:42:24,359 --> 00:42:31,740
suffering of the world it's I I give an example of my own practice I've done these practices that they just

245
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:37,980
show up like when I'm doing nothing or I'm swimming or I'm just breathing or I'm sitting it just shows up or even the

246
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:44,460
words sometimes show up safe happy healthy ease they just show up like oh

247
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:50,280
how nice they're comforting and they show outside so this is this is the

248
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:57,180
fruit of your cultivation Ken enjoy it thank you so much for sharing that all

249
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:03,300
beings support you in in doing that that's that's lovely

250
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:10,500
great that's lovely yeah so Claire I see your hand

251
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:16,380
oh I think that was maybe okay all right so so I Claire disappeared all right so

252
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:24,720
let's let's close let's close and uh and dedicate the Merit of our practice

253
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:30,720
um oh actually you know what maybe before we close I do want to ask you questions if anybody wants to reflect on

254
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:37,740
this um did any of you feel did any of you feel into or or have an opening or an

255
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:44,460
aha moment into that what I was guiding you especially the you know the big topic of tonight the Delight the

256
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:49,680
pleasure of knowing it's just so pleasant or was that just the doll again

257
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:57,000
of course we know that or was like wow there's pleasure here in knowing whatever it is

258
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,040
was it a dahlia of course or was it an aha moment for anyone well I wonder

259
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:08,640
let's see I see a thumbs up is that you want to talk or are you just giving a thumbs up and I'm not quite sure who's giving the thumbs up and the long list

260
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,680
of people uh you want to raise your hand maybe that was just a thumbs up

261
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,720
so which one

262
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:24,900
who is it all right Neil okay Neil you get the last word I'm going to choose C

263
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:30,680
it was like what is she talking about I I

264
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:37,160
you know right right in fact it was what is she talking about and when is this meditation over right so there was like

265
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:44,099
frustration restlessness all kind of like bundled in you know that said you

266
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:51,500
know I felt very peaceful and it was all kind of nice right but but when you were saying that I'm like

267
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:58,920
I love it so so that it that that peace and and it kind of being nice it's well

268
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:06,599
well when you were saying it it wasn't right right you're saying it definitely like left me frustrated right but but

269
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:13,680
afterward right which I must be honest this isn't the this isn't the first or the 100th and

270
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:20,040
first time that that you know that's happened right I hear the instruction and I'm like this is dumb right but then

271
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:26,400
but then like maybe it works you know so

272
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:33,240
yeah and so so so no no your track record Neil with your

273
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:39,240
with you know the the goodness of your practice and you know this reflection of this is dumb you know it comes up a lot

274
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:45,720
and the frustration and and maybe what in this case what I would invite you to oh actually I missed there was a diff

275
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:53,460
there was a reflection there I love the Delight in knowing it was a huge opening oh Mary uh thank you Mary I didn't see

276
00:45:53,460 --> 00:46:00,000
your reflection earlier thank you for that so um yeah so so with what you said

277
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,359
Anil I think what I would invite you is to to get to know the frustration

278
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:13,140
because there is a no so so what if you actually know the frustration instead of

279
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:18,440
right so so that's where the Aikido I think some of the Aikido movements of of

280
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:24,599
awareness and mindfulness like what was it actually just to know it oh yeah I'm frustrated in this there's frustration

281
00:46:24,599 --> 00:46:31,859
there's arising ah wow there's a delight in turning out of it and actually

282
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:37,319
knowing it instead of being in it yeah so that's the invitation I'll give

283
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:43,140
you if you decide to continue to practice with this so so thank you thank

284
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:49,560
you all for your practice and and uh how wonderful and and may you may you open

285
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:57,420
up to the Delight to the pleasure of knowing may it open up for you there's such a joy to know may all beings be

286
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:02,960
well may all beings be free including ourselves

287
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,980
thanks everyone see one
