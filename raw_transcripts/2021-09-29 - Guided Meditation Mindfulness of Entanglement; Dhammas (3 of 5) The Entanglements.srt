foreign

2
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:23,359
warm greetings from imc in redwood city california

3
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:32,078
and uh i have a delightful feeling of the goodwill that uh somehow

4
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:38,000
circles uh the spot that i'm in with through all the youtube kind of spreading out in all

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,200
directions and i hope that each of you maybe can feel the same thing that

6
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:51,200
from your spot their circles of goodwill as this community gathers around the globe

7
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:56,840
and so this week i'm offering little

8
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,359
exercises mindfulness exercises that go along with the darmette them the teachings that i'm

9
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,880
doing and so the idea is to do continue with your

10
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,799
mindfulness practice as you do it but then this little exercise might

11
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,200
be relevant that you could do as you go along and now this one

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,720
has to do with the idea that something happens

13
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,759
and then we react to it of course we don't always react but there are reactions

14
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,439
there's a a difficult sound outside uncomfortable

15
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,720
sound and then we react to it we get involved in it we get

16
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:51,600
for and against it we start thinking about it it might not be a perfect match for the

17
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,960
our english idea of react reaction but the buddha

18
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,640
used the word not entanglement sometimes it's translated into english

19
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,399
as fetter so a knot getting knotted up in something

20
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,840
and so this idea of getting caught maybe we use in english

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,800
but uh you know if you get caught in a spider web the spider web is kind of responsible uh when we get knotted up

22
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,560
we're the ones who create the knot we tie ourselves up

23
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,840
and so as you go along in this meditation i want to say one more thing that

24
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,599
this way in which we get knotted up with things caught in things is

25
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,280
not always so conscious uh it kind of happens a little bit but not not necessarily in the unconscious

26
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,120
but it happens kind of under the radar we're busy focusing on whatever we do

27
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,200
and we don't notice some of the more subtle ways we get entangled and caught

28
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,440
so at this exercise as you we go along doing the basic mindfulness practice

29
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,200
and uh whatever you notice whatever you're noticing whatever like

30
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,760
if you're noticing the in-breath of the out breath you're noticing a sound a body sensation a feeling whatever it is

31
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,360
that comes into awareness if there is a

32
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,720
if you're caught in it reacting to it and tangled with it

33
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:33,519
then use the word label not k-n-o-t

34
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,840
and i kind of lighten this label because uh it can also be spelled n-o-t

35
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,760
so in other words uh not this let's not let's not get entangled let's not get knotted up

36
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,000
so you say very gently lovingly calmly not not

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,319
there's a knot recognizing there's a knot and a little subliminal kind of feeling or maybe not maybe i don't need

38
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:08,159
to so just not and just notice so if you start thinking about something

39
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:14,959
start thinking about your breath in a subtle way maybe without any discomfort you are kind of not in the

40
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:22,800
buddhist language you're not knotted up in it you're now involved in it so maybe involved is an english

41
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,040
word for this but um knotted up and um

42
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,800
so if this seems like too much or you know you know you don't care for this you please you don't have to do it

43
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,080
but um but it might be interesting to notice how often

44
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,000
in some way or other you get involved in what's happening and uh interested in might be

45
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:54,960
interesting to see what happens if you just quietly uh recognize it as a not not

46
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,800
so taking a

47
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:03,600
meditative posture

48
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:13,680
establishing posture that's upright or alert or supportive for you

49
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,919
and the one that also allows you to relax

50
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:32,960
to relax to

51
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:41,360
make room for yourself to become for calmer calmness to be here as well

52
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:51,000
even if you're agitated there could be a

53
00:05:52,720 --> 00:06:02,759
a wave of calmness or a envelope of calmness around it

54
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,319
gently closing your eyes

55
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,199
and taking a few long slow deep breaths

56
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:41,840
with the idea that these deeper breaths are calming you bringing some calm some subtleness

57
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:52,240
especially as you exhale a calming peaceful effect

58
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,840
breathing in breathing out

59
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,680
letting your breathing return to normal and on the exhale for a little while

60
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:42,400
relax your body different parts of your body with the idea that each little micro

61
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:49,800
relaxation is a gentle calming settling

62
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,000
and steadying yourself on a normal breath

63
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:42,560
calming yourself into an attention centered on breathing

64
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,959
maybe the exhale has a little peacemaking movement

65
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,600
a wave of calming settling

66
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,399
and allow yourself to feel the calming soothing

67
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,920
impact of exhaling even if it's just at the very near the

68
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:32,519
end of the exhale letting go of thoughts

69
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,680
every every exhale letting go of thoughts

70
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,920
and if you find yourself involved with anything if you're in the present moment

71
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,480
distra thinking feelings body sensations sounds

72
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:16,800
any concern anything that we call be called a concern because you're caught up in it they're involved

73
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,360
gently lovingly say the word not recognize it as a

74
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,279
a knot an entanglement

75
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:36,399
and see what happens in the wake of simply recognizing it as

76
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:45,120
such no need to let go of it just recognize oh there's a knot

77
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,560
and then continue with your breathing

78
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:14,880
if you are involved in thinking you probably have a knot

79
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,959
entanglement

80
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,798
it can feel innocent enough to be involved in thinking

81
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,559
but when it takes us out of the flow of the present moment

82
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,799
we would call it a knot

83
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,640
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

84
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:44,320
to turn your attention outward to the people community that

85
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:50,720
you somehow are touched with contact with interact with

86
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,440
and consider what it would be like to be present with them

87
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:05,919
without being reactive without being entangled

88
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:11,880
without a knot being knotted up

89
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,559
maybe consider the peace or the calm or the

90
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,720
ease it might provide you to be present

91
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:40,000
unentangled just present available

92
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:47,440
attentive and what it would be like for them

93
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:53,760
to be able to experience themselves without being entangled with anything

94
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:59,840
with themselves with others with their things

95
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,880
they can still be attentive and engaged engaged but not entangled

96
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:17,240
and if we have some experience of disentanglement

97
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:24,640
and the benefits of it we can know more

98
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:32,320
about the kind of happiness and peace and ease that's possible for human beings

99
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,840
and for whatever peace and well-being and happiness that we know is

100
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:43,520
possible may we wish it for others

101
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:52,440
may we be inspired that this be a possibility for others to experience

102
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,158
may all beings be happy

103
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,880
may all beings be safe

104
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:16,480
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings

105
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,720
be disentangled

106
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:42,749

107

[Music]

108
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:49,360
so before i begin this talk of announcement

109
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:58,320
the so there is starting to be plans there are plans now to try to reopen imc

110
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:05,120
sometime in the next few weeks with kind of a covet era protocol different

111

types including only being open for people who are vaccinated

112
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,000

there'll be more announcements about this and information about that will appear on their website

114
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:28,320
but the announcement now is that this sunday after the 10 o'clock dharma talk sunday morning

115
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:34,000
we'll have a community meeting on zoom to discuss the opening and questions

116
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,200
concerns similar to what we did in i think in july when we were thinking about opening

117
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,480
back then and uh so if anybody'd like to come you're welcome to come even if you don't

118
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:51,279
plan to not relevant for you because you're not not planning to come in person but it might be interesting just

119
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:56,960
come along and uh the information for that is um in the calendar

120
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:03,039
imc's calendar and also in the what's new section of

121
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:09,600
the website the home page of the website imc website there's on the bottom right there's a section called what's new and

122
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,360
there there's an announcement about the community meeting with the link the zoom link and it's password

123
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:22,919
protected so and the password is there but the password is meta m-e-t-t-a

124
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,158
so

125
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,760
so this week i'm going through the five x mindfulness exercises

126
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,799
that are taught in discourse on the four foundations of mindfulness

127
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,880
and these are i call them exercises these are ways of practicing in order to develop

128
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,880
a heightened sense of mindfulness so that mindfulness is established and

129
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,640
so it's kind of a means and the means to be mindful is in a sense to be mindful

130
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:05,679
but there are in particular ways or emphasises that are given and uh in the fourth foundation is

131
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:12,960
beginning to pay attention to either the way we get entangled in things get caught up and attached or the

132
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,398
process by which we get free and liberated

133
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:23,919
and um and so the there are three exercises around being

134
00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:31,760
entangled being caught and uh they're going going from coarser maybe more activated more

135
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:36,800
conceptual more story-centered more more

136
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:45,280
complex world that we live in to the simpler and simpler and so it started off with

137
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:51,440
the complex world of our attachments to to our desires and

138
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,800
aversions uh and to the things where we desire and have aversions towards and that could be

139
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,160
anything complicated things in the world and ideas and and

140
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,520
things like get along once we stop getting so concerned in the world

141
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,760
of objects and things in a sense including our own comfort then we settle down

142
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,760
and there's a next layer i talked about yesterday which is the ways which we identify

143
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,359
the way we get involved with things based on me myself and mine

144
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:30,960
as we get quieter still and there's less coarser this more subtle and there's

145
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:38,079
less baggage less complicated ideas and concepts no concepts of self anymore

146
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,520
we're left to with simple sense experience in the present moment

147
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:49,920
we're not thinking about the future in the past we're just really present here and we hear a sound

148
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:58,480
we feel a body sensation we recognize there's a thought and these are all considered very simple

149
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,920
sense recognitions and we don't usually think of the mind doors being a

150
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,440
sense but whatever ability we have to recognize the simplest recognition was happening

151
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,880
in the mind before the complexities around it and reactions to it is it called you know

152
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,880
the a sense experience and so with uh the eye

153
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:28,160
there's the object of the eye that's things we see and then the buddha talked about the

154
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:34,160
entanglement between them the knot that gets formed how we get knotted up with it

155
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,560
so there are three things happening there's the eyesight there's the ability to see the eye

156
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:47,200
the eyesight that sees there's a thing that we see and then kind of imagine that between

157
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:54,480
the object of sight and and the eye there's things get knotted up

158
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:01,200
of course the knot is in our brain and our mind but we get involved we get attached to

159
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:08,560
we get caught up in we get sticky we start thinking about it wanting it reacting to it and

160
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,680
it's not the complicated ideas of the world

161
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:19,280
like winning the lottery it's just in the moment as we go about

162
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:26,640
it's something very simple there is a sound and and then we recognize the sound as a car

163
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,680
and then we might get entangled with it we might start thinking of thinking about the sound

164
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:37,200
and or not liking it because it's unpleasant or liking it because it's pleasant and wanting more of it or

165
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:42,960
wanting less of it and so getting knotted up and the in the

166
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,240
most english translations they translate this word as fetter

167
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:54,800
and i don't use the word feder in my ordinary english life i don't know if maybe some of you do

168
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:01,200
but uh the pali word has the meaning of being knotted up

169
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:08,000
not and um so i'd like to i like just knotted up

170
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,400
and um and so it's now recognizing that there's always there can be two things there's

171
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:21,599
the experience we're having and there's the way that we relate to it and that way we relate to it might be

172
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,640
not free it might be free of any entanglement we can engage in it we can

173
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,079
think about it we can care for things without being entangled

174
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:38,079
but we also can be a entangled there can be attachment and it can be very very subtle

175
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,680
if you just simply simply start in meditation simply start thinking about something that's happening

176
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:50,240
you've left the flow of the present moment and you now become um you know you're kind of gonna

177
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:57,760
maybe maybe the word like not or entanglement seems too big but um we've gotten it's gotten sticky

178
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,680
we got leaning into it and we kind of lost something in the process of thinking about it we

179
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,920
lost our mindfulness in our present moment experience so um

180
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:17,040
so the buddha says that talks about how in this exercise when one is aware

181
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,079
that there's seeing when aware one is aware of what is being

182
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,839
seen and then aware of what that relationship is the entanglement in particular how

183
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:34,160
we're caught by it or reactive to it and um and then uh

184
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:40,560
and so we know when it's present the fetter the the knot we know what

185
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:46,880
it's like when it's not there and this distinction between recognizing the presence of something

186
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:53,200
and the absence something of something is very important in um mindfulness meditation we often

187
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,720
emphasize being recognizing what's happening in the present which kind of always gives a subject

188
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:05,440
something is happening that we're aware of but in fact sometimes it's important to be mindful of absence

189
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,040
not all the time but when we've been attached to something

190
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:18,800
it's valuable to take some time to experience what it's like to be unattached the freedom that comes

191
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,400
so to be knotted up and then know the experience of being unknotted the ease the

192
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:30,240
we breathe more easily there's more sense of openness spaciousness lightness all kinds of whatever way it

193
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:36,319
might be experienced so that it registers and we kind of begin to

194
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:43,119
those channels too that kind of unentanglement starts becoming more available to us because we let it

195
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:49,200
register more deeply and so the buddha talked about noticing the

196
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,520
presence of these knots the absence of them no and then being present enough in the

197
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:01,680
moment that we can see that a knot that hasn't arisen yet

198
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,720
does arise we notice the arising of it oh here i get knotted up and that takes

199
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,000
a sharp mindfulness to really be here and say oh i can watch the process

200
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:19,520
we don't wait until we find ourselves knotted up we watch the process and this is what a benefit can come

201
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:26,400
when the mindfulness gets established well enough in the present moment that there's a kind of sense of flow

202
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,160
uh in the present a sense of rising and passing appearing and disappearing

203
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:39,599
the river of experience that's happening here and now that as we stay present for that

204
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,200
we notice when we leave the flow when we get involved in something and we

205
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:50,480
can watch the beginning of that because it's part of the flow originally

206
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:56,560
and then and he talked also about then knowing

207
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:02,560
that the knot has been abandoned let go of he doesn't say to let go of it but i

208
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,880
think maybe it's implied but um

209
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:13,440
we're aware of it and letting go of it as well that it's gone we've let go of it it's

210
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,040
not there so that we can benefit from experiencing the absence of it

211
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:25,599
so there is some uh so i like to say that if it's easy to let go of something

212
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,760
like a knot let go of the knot we're not necessarily letting going things in the world we're letting go of

213
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:39,520
that entanglement that's between us and the thing and then take time to be aware

214
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:46,560
of what that absence of entanglement is like if we do this regularly and strongly

215
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:54,079
a special time will come where in practice where we have a clear sense

216
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:00,319
that the entanglement is not going to arise again at least not in this meditation or in

217
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:07,440
this state of mind this kind of presence we have and and this clarity and confidence wow

218
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,440
i'm so settled i'm so present i'm so so much peace and and self-awareness

219
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,040
awareness going on here that no way am i going to get entangled

220
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:25,920
that requires a kind of a coarser activity a kind of choice and involvement that i'm simply

221
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,440
not inclined to do now and to really feel that wow

222
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:37,119
i i you know i'm not inclined to to get in entangled again it's like

223
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:42,319
now i'm safe at least for this meditation for this next few minutes

224
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:49,760
and to feel that possibility to know that this is possible is can be life-changing because we know

225
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:57,119
that life doesn't require attachment doesn't require being entangled

226
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:03,280
so um at first we're we're disentangling ourselves from the coarser

227
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:10,800
big ideas of the world the things we want and don't want that involve stories and ideas and complicated concepts and

228
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,560
that are you know that are the hindrances and then we do something more subtle

229
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:23,200
which is the whole way in which we attach to self and then we get more subtle in uh in

230
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:29,440
just our relationship to sense contact and um it might seem uninteresting it might

231
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:35,040
seem not so valuable to be aware at this more base level of of

232
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:41,280
sense contact but it turns out that some of the deepest attachments we have

233
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:47,839
arise out of the attachment to these basic sense contacts it sets the stage for all the other attachments and

234
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:56,240
sufferings we have so it's very powerful to kind of settled enough to really track it

235
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:02,319
and and as we start getting more sensitive and aware of the entanglements and the absence of them

236
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:10,079
then we're poised to be aware of some of the benefits that come on the path to disentanglement on the

237
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:17,520
path to really becoming free and that's a topic for tomorrow and so for the next 24 hours

238
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:23,359
you maybe use this concept of a knot or an entanglement

239
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:29,839
and go through the day recognizing as much as you can your entanglements

240
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:35,200
either while you're doing it also afterwards you might kind of reflect back over the day and say well where was

241
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:40,640
i entangled and caught sometimes it's hard to see in the present moment but sometimes

242
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:46,720
retrospectively we can see oh i see and and see what you learned about yourself

243
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,920
in that process so thank you
