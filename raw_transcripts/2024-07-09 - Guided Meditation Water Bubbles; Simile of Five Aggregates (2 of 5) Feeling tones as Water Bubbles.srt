00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:10,599
all right good morning and good day uh for all of you from all around the world

2
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:14,080
I'm seeing it in the chat

3
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:22,240
message so today uh we're going to um go

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:31,239
into the second simile of the five Aggregates or five bundles and the human

5
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,440
process yesterday we uh practiced with uh the

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,680
first uh Sim of this five Bondo which is

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:48,039
using the lump of foam on the river

8
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:53,320
ganes uh to uh liken this sense the felt

9
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:01,399
sense of this embodied feeling material form and this body kind of this

10
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:08,400
form and um today uh we're going to use

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:17,880
yet another Sile uh that's also used to illustrate uh some embodied aspect um of

12
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:25,040
Being Human and this uh second aspect the poly term is

13
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:32,079
Vena many of you may have heard of this and this term sometimes gets translated

14
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:39,439
as feelings or feeling tones um in Sati patana this is the

15
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:47,560
second um satiana second aspect that's often being practiced

16
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:55,040
with and um uh often when we're speaking about

17
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:03,159
feeling tones um uh we may be referring to what in there's a whole Spectrum from

18
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:09,720
unpleasant to neutral to Pleasant kind of feelings they're not like a black and

19
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:17,200
white lines drawn but it's really a spectrum uh there is a whole Spectrum

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,239
from being extremely unpleasant and painful and all the way

21
00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:30,080
to just Heavenly pleasantness um it can happen both in

22
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:38,720
the embodied way and also in the way that may be related to a mental being in

23
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,280
some way and uh I was looking up at the PO

24
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:53,599
dictionary of this term sometimes um the translation of a v is just a Sensations

25
00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:03,920
so it may be included here too um and and the suta uh described this

26
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,080
feeling tone a feelings or uh feeling

27
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:16,400
tones um as if they are the M ring or

28
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:24,959
Autumn rain uh in India uh that you know they hit on the

29
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,720
puddles and to make water bubbles popping

30
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,519
because of the rain contact of the rain with water and and the water bubbles pop

31
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:42,280
up and burst away and it's quite a visual again and I

32
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:48,360
will'll practice with it and uh and then I'll offer some more

33
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:56,000
words uh when we switch to the daret and again if you like to stay in your

34
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,680
meditative bubble uh please do so even as we're

35
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:12,760
transitioning uh to the darat session D darat part later um so here we go let's

36
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,789
[Music]

37
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:30,240
practice maybe taking a few long deep breath

38
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:38,080
as you breathe out arriving

39
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,639
here and now as if you're entering into the

40
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:51,960
Temple of this body mind and a heart

41
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:05,680
arriving with a sound

42
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,400
arriving with a breath

43
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,080
entering into the posture you're in

44
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,280
a sense of irreverence may come

45
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:46,479
in maybe a sense of safety entering into this meditative

46
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:55,680
bubble kind of a protection of our heart and mind

47
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:11,319
allow mindful awareness to be on the foreground front and the

48
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,479
center there maybe heartfulness is here too

49
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,039
whatever the word heartfulness might mean for

50
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,120
you you don't have to think about

51
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:55,879
it there may just be a kind of a bodily response to it

52
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:22,800
being mindful one moment and

53
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,120
another and yet another

54
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:48,759
the momentary mindfulness can form a chain of

55
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,759
mindfulness

56
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:06,599
maybe there is a sense being more and more

57
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:24,680
present at some point the continuity of

58
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,440
Sati maybe strong enough

59
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:40,240
such that we feel or more

60
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:50,759
available available to the lived experience here and

61
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:01,440
now and the momentary experiences are available to us

62
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:29,279
us there he is a sense maybe more and more rooted

63
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,880
stabilizing in

64
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:52,378
mindfulness the F sense of a [Music]

65
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,600
breathing may become Fuller

66
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:08,399
are more fully registered received

67
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:46,120
allow the mindfulness to

68
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,120
expand throughout the

69
00:10:52,440 --> 00:11:01,240
body from inside or all around

70
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,320
as you

71
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,920
breathe the breath enlightens the body

72
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,959
a sense of aliveness may come

73
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,720
forth as if you're melting

74
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:04,680
into the f sense of a dancing Sensations in the

75
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,959
body tingling

76
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:23,399
puling vibrating

77
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,839
gentle expansion

78
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,720
contraction rising and

79
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,360
falling

80
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,160
Ric e

81
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:43,680
experiencing this body from within

82
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:57,839
itself releasing Concepts ideas

83
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,720
feeling and

84
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,360
sensing quietly

85
00:14:52,519 --> 00:15:01,000
you may began to notice Fe enough

86
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,600
feelings feeling

87
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:19,000
tones maybe pervasive kind of pleasant

88
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:31,890
Sensations like a light drizzle of the rain drizzling

89
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:38,600
[Music] rain hitting a peaceful

90
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:53,639
Lake making tiny water bubbles on the surface of the lake

91
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,800
maybe bubbly

92
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:11,639
present bubbly Pleasant

93
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:30,920

94
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,040
drops hitting the surface of the

95
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:49,639
lake or the big water bubbles burst up

96
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:09,520
like a occasional sharp unpleasant

feelings e

98
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:24,760
resting in the felt sense in the sea of Sensations

99
00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:53,440
a spectrum of pleasant unpleasant May shift and change

100
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,400
just like the

101
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:19,640
raindrops hitting the surface of the lake or the puddle may

102
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:25,799
change the shapes the intensity of the water

103
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
bubbles

104
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640

e e

108
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:36,080
as you stay connected with the immediacy of the felt

109
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:44,559
sense of your experience it can

110
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,919
highlight how the mind might

111
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,600
react where the likes and dislikes

112
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:11,000
cleaning aversion judging

113
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:27,440
fixing and you can know is our

114
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
extra

115
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440

128
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:50,760
and in a minute I'll end the meditation with the

129
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:56,679
sound of a bell but if you like to stay in the meditative

130
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:02,360
bubble please please feel free to do so

131
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,880
for

132
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:51,648
[Music]

133
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:05,240
and I'd like to read you this part of the simile from the

134
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,919
sua suppose practitioners that in the

135
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:20,559
Autumn when it's raining and the big raindrops are

136
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:26,840
falling a water bubble arises and it bursts on the surface of the

137
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:35,159
water a person with good sight would inspect it ponder it and carefully

138
00:32:35,159 --> 00:32:42,080
investigate it and it would appear to them to be

139
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:48,639
void Hollow insubstantial for what substance would

140
00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:54,360
there be in a water bubble so too

141
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:04,519
practitioners whatever kind of a feeling there is whether past future or present internal

142
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:11,159
or external gross or subtle inferior or

143
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:19,159
Superior far or near a practitioner inspects it pund it

144
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:29,760
and carefully investigates it and it would appear to them to be void Hollow

145
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:38,639
insubstantial for what substance would there be in feeling

146
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:48,240
tones so as we were meditating I was inviting us to

147
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:55,919
imagine that maybe in the fall the monsoon season in some parts of

148
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:01,480
India there are this kind kind of rain um

149
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:09,000
maybe sometimes ongoing drizzle or sometimes this kind of periodic pouring

150
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,960
ring with the gaps in between and sometimes maybe it's kind of

151
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:23,440
sparingly for a while with a big raindrops hitting the

152
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,560
ground and the water bubbles arise out of all the contact of

153
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:36,560
raindrops on the surface of a water and they burst

154
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:45,960
away and the Buddha likened this as kind of a feeling tones emerging out of the

155
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:51,319
contact with the body and sometimes even the

156
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:02,480
mind and so sometimes this may feel Pleasant maybe in the

157
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,920
hot um hot day uh when the uh cool

158
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:14,920
raindrops falling making contact with the skin

159
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:21,160
face neck that's kind of a pleasant feeling

160
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:28,240
you know Pleasant Sensations um that can emerge

161
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:34,280
and just like the water bubbles um that quickly make contact and

162
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:39,680
they um arise and pass

163
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:46,880
away and in the meditation and I was having a uh

164
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:54,960
somewhat of a more kind of um quiet kind of pleasant Sensations

165
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,040
uh in my body and are very energetic

166
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:08,200
Pleasant and I felt like this uh pervasive layers of um you know thing

167
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:17,400
water bubbles um on the surface of the lake and other times uh if there may be

168
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:23,640
a prolonged um Intense or mild uh

169
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:30,880
unpleasant Sensations and that can also feel like like a rain maybe a bigger rain kind of

170
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:38,319
non-stop raindrop hitting a water surface and the water bubbles are kind

171
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:45,680
of a pervasive uh sense of unpleasant and they may be harder to

172
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:51,000
tease apart and yet other times the water

173
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,640
bubbles may feel kind of distinct kind of like you know this kind of pleasant

174
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:02,839
Sensations that may be more more um

175
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:08,880
sparkly or unpleasant unpleasant Sensations that may be more

176
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:17,160
sparkly uh kind of like you know occasionally you have this sharp ping um

177
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:22,560
happen in certain kind of the body certain parts of the body but it just

178
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,960
kind kind of comes and goes like this big water bubble that

179
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,839
gets formed and Pops away and that they are

180
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:41,520
distinct and so there are are all the the flavors of um feeling tone that can

181
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:49,079
emerge in us um the Buddha used this simile of

182
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:54,240
water bubbles and pointing at the fact

183
00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:02,000
that all of this uh Fe tones the Vaden us they come and go whether they feel

184
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:09,680
like a pervasive or whether they feel like a sparkly you know kind of one moment at

185
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:17,319
and the next yet they're all kind of a bursting away in one way or

186
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:24,000
another and so this is the way and that the Buddha was pointing I feel like this

187
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:32,880
more like how we're experiencing it uh in our own F sense it's quite

188
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:40,000
immediate and yet often uh when we're sitting in our meditation what we may

189
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:48,760
also observe is when there are Pleasant and unpleasant feeling tones

190
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:54,280
arising often there are kind of uh habitual

191
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:01,920
tendencies that are kind of reactivities that arise immediately with it as

192
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:10,920
well you know the unpleasant we may have a sense of not liking it or we want to

193
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:19,920
push it away uh we have certain kind of aversion to it or uh even worse when the

194
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,880
unpleasant don't go away we can blame ourselves we can shame

195
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:31,440
ourselves and we can try very hard to try to fix

196
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:40,200
it and when the pleasant Sensations come and we can try to hand on to it and

197
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:46,640
when they go away we really want to to Ling in and uh

198
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:53,680
get them back but this image of water

199
00:39:53,680 --> 00:40:02,359
bubbles we can't really Gras grasp at bursting water bubbles right and that's

200
00:40:02,359 --> 00:40:07,520
very Vivid to illustrate this aspect of

201
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:13,520
um uh human experiences in its own nature they're

202
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:20,240
not graspable they're not cleanable and yet the

203
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:28,000
reactivity um can uh feel like they you know wanted to grasp at something that

204
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:37,880
is actually inherently not graspable and I I also like to point out

205
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:46,319
um that this doesn't mean somehow that uh there is no appropriate

206
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:51,560
response uh to our feeling tones to our

207
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:58,079
Vena for example often and there is a lot of pain

208
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,920
in the body maybe um you know unbearable

209
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:11,800
pain and uh the invitation is not just to say you know we're not going to be

210
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:17,520
able to do anything but rather uh when we're

211
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:24,319
staying with our experience in the immediate way we're

212
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:30,680
not covered by the layers of reactivities in our

213
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:36,800
mind um there is more room resource and

214
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,079
space for us to tune in to what may be

215
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:49,240
needed here what is the skillful response that can emerge and become

216
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:55,400
available to us there is a deeper kind of embodied

217
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:01,960
intelligence that may be available available that is much more

218
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:09,160
intuitive and much more immediate so when we're not tuned in

219
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:18,319
this kind of immediate emergent um intuitive kind of uh uh

220
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:23,920
intelligence or response they don't have a

221
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:31,119
chance because we're so often uh getting caught by how we want to fix

222
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:43,480
things and we don't allow this deeper kind of a care and a uh a wise response to come

223
00:42:45,559 --> 00:42:52,720
forth and so when we're staying attuned uh to our immediate experience those are

224
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:58,760
become wiser and a more compassionate aspect of our being being becomes more

225
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:08,839
available to us and that's also the nature of this human body and human mind

226
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:15,319
too and so we're not just um um somehow

227
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:20,640
believing that we needed to just bear with the pain sometimes that may be

228
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:27,640
appropriate and other times there may be wise responses compassionate responses

229
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:33,920
that can come forth and similarly uh in relationship

230
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:42,000
to the pleasant uh Sensations and pleasant state of a being and so often

231
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,839
The Habit Tendencies are to Ling in you know I want to Ling in to this again and

232
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:54,880
again I wanted to hand on onto it and when we don't get it we get very

233
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,720
frustrated I remember

234
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:09,720
uh uh the past uh when I did self- retreat at home and sometimes I would be

235
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:15,720
in a rather quiet uh sweet kind of a state of a

236
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:22,119
being but then all of a sudden it occurred to me oh it's time for me to go

237
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:29,319
pick up my son from school and that often you know uh I would notice this

238
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:36,240
momentary aversion coming oh I don't wanted to to let go of

239
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:45,160
this and it took me a while to notice this momentary aversion um that comes and

240
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:51,480
gradually learning to let go of this say

241
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:59,200
ah this experiences are uh situational it's a lot more important

242
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:06,920
for us to learn to let go of this different forms of a cleaning and

243
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:13,520
aversion than trying to hand on to the pleasant

244
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:20,079
experience and so this are the teachings on the water bubbles from the

245
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:27,640
rain and so my invitation is for today as you go about your day maybe allow

246
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:37,720
this simile to come alive in you and um enjoy the rest of the day

247
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:55,059
[Music]

248
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:05,359
we'll see you tomorrow
