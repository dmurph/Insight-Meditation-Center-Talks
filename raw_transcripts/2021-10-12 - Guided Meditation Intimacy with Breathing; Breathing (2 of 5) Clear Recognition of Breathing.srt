00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:09,279
warm greetings from imc in redwood city and

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:17,119
in continuing with this series on this week on mindfulness of breathing

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:24,960
the if you if one is sitting still

4
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,119
being still not moving the body but then was going to notice

5
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,079
the largest movements that are still happening

6
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,320
chances are you become aware of the movements of breathing even if the rest of the body is still

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,280
not moving the movements of the chest the diaphragm the belly the shoulders the back ribcage

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,399
all the parts of the body that come into play with breathing are still moving and

9
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:01,280
they're as they're supposed to and so if we're sitting still

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,799
and attentive to the body one of the things that we will start

11
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,040
noticing is the breathing the breathing will make itself known

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,840
and this idea of what makes itself known is a very interesting idea

13
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,400
because often we are directing our attention we are have an agenda for what we want what we're looking for what

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,920
we're concerned with and there might be a lot of will a lot of

15
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,920
directedness in our attention and there's another whole way of

16
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,360
in terms of meditation or the way of being in life even and that's fascinating

17
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,840
and and kind of deepening for the purpose of meditation is what is it that is known what is it

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,439
that makes itself known and um and so

19
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,040
the breathing can make itself known and there's a play here a little bit between

20
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:07,119
uh our directing our attention to the breathing and all and are kind of receiving the

21
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,959
breathing it's maybe a little bit like we intentionally open a window

22
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,879
and then we can feel the breeze coming in so we open the window of attention to

23
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:25,280
the breathing and then we start feeling that experience that experience becomes

24
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:32,640
known and so it's a little bit less at some point of directing the mind on the breathing

25
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,840
as it is repeatedly opening the window

26
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:45,760
to receive the sensations of breathing and then those sensations become known

27
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,319
and or felt and one of the first things we can do is we can feel the breathing feel the

28
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,560
sensations and the feeling of the sensations is one of

29
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,680
the ways to develop concentration is to stay close to the sensate the

30
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,360
sensory experience so one of those is the movements of the breathing

31
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,680
another is the as you breathe in maybe the expansion the pressure

32
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,800
top of the in breath there might be a tautness as we reach near the limit there

33
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,560
and on the exhale there's a release relaxing a smoothness

34
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,799
maybe and sometimes that's breathing in and breathing out feels like a smooth feeling and sometimes it

35
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,319
feels choppy kind of like little segments that are going in and going out

36
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:44,879
and whatever it was to feel it and to feel it where in the body it's most compelling where the experience of

37
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:50,560
breathing is easiest and that sometimes called the home base

38
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,720
for some people it's the it's the um a particular spot

39
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:03,280
sometimes people really love feeling it in the lower belly just below the navel some people feel it in the chest around

40
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,480
the solar plexus diaphragm area some people will feel it at the at the nose the sensations of the air going in

41
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:17,199
and out through the nose and tip of the nose the top of the lip some people find it very nice to just

42
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,639
feel the whole experience of the body so it's kind of a holistic sense

43
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,720
censoring of it all as we get concentrated

44
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:36,320
there's a subtle shift that can begin happening and now in addition to sensing and feeling it

45
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,560
there's a very quiet relaxed knowing that can we can engage in we know that

46
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,240
that is moving movement we know that is pressure and release of pressure

47
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,440
we know that that is a sense of expansion and contraction we start

48
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:00,160
kind of recognizing knowing that what those sensations actually are

49
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,800
and then to go further down as we gets quieter the knowing begins to fade away or not

50
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,000
as important and it becomes a quiet observing

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,560
where there's not much recognition just observing and the intimacy of the feeling at the

52
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:25,280
beginning is replaced by an intimacy of the observing the observing has a clarity to

53
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,240
it and a beauty to it at the right time as as it gets more and more settled

54
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,759
so um so to

55
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:45,120
assume a meditation posture and

56
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,720
and adjusting the posture to make it a little easier for your

57
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,360
lungs to breathe your diaphragm to move and for some people that's letting the

58
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,800
chest be a little bit more open

59
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,960
sometimes sitting a little bit straighter so that we're not we're not collapsing in the front of our body

60
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:17,520
can make it easier to breathe and gently closing the eyes

61
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,840
and relaxing

62
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:34,280
seeing where in the body you can relax maybe relaxing around the belly

63
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,680
and as if you relax a lot in the belly you might want to readjust your posture

64
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,800
slightly so that the weight of your

65
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,800
body through your spine feels just right

66
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,319
and relaxing your shoulders

67
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,319
and there too maybe some subtle shifts in how your hands are

68
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,039
can feel good in the shoulders let them relax more

69
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,759
and softening in the face maybe letting there be a soft little

70
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,479
opening in the mouth

71
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,199
relaxing around the eyes

72
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:52,160
and then to allow the breathing to be known almost as the breathing

73
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:59,360
comes into awareness more fully gently take a few two or three deeper

74
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:06,560
breaths receiving the full experience and sense sensory

75
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,560
experience of breathing in and breathing out

76
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,000
and letting your breathing return to normal

77
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:40,000
and don't be too concerned what normal is if you find yourself controlling the breath or the bath a

78
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,920
little bit held in check

79
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:55,240
it's okay for the purpose of mindfulness it's just to feel it how it is

80
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:03,279
without any need really to for it to be different it's okay the way it is

81
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,640
the task is to feel it as it is

82
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,720
what is the body's experience of breathing

83
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:37,560
where's the predominant place where you feel the body breathing

84
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,839
the belly the chest the nose

85
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,880
or the whole body in a certain way the whole torso

86
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,440
and the more you allow yourself to feel the sensations of breathing

87
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:30,160
the less the the energy of attention goes into thinking about other things

88
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,680
now's not the time to be thinking about other things so

89
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,279
at least to put those things into the background of the mind

90
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,600
in the foreground

91
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,959
receive the sensations of breathing

92
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,680
like the window is open and the rhythm of breathing in and

93
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:14,920
breathing out is like a gentle breeze or gentle waves lapping up on the shore

94
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:49,640
to feel the experience of breathing is to be intimate

95
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:57,360
mindfulness is never in a hurry mindfulness is as an attitude of as

96
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:03,200
that you have all the time in the world

97
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:09,000
to sense and feel what's happening

98
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,480
as a gentle way of staying connected to your breathing

99
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,799
there's a very subtle way of thinking alternative thinking to being distracted

100
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,798
is to very gently with all the time in the world

101
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:22,160
recognize some of the sensations that come into play as you breathe

102
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,079
kind of kind of like you're stroking the sensations or

103
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:39,200
like you're putting a gentle hand on them too just acknowledge their presence

104
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:45,480
it can be as simple as recognition of movement

105
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,960
tingling warmth coolness

106
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,679
pleasure if anything of breathing is pleasant

107
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,880
or unpleasant if anything is unpleasant

108
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:10,320
pressure tightness looseness

109
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,440
sometimes there's a little pulling with the exhale

110
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,120
or releasing

111
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,120
jagged or smooth

112
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:41,679
the gentle little recognition that keeps you gently tethered

113
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,720
to your breathing

114
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,440
saying it in such a quiet voice

115
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,880
that that act of recognition is quieting for the distracted mind

116
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,600
stay close to the sensations of breathing feeling the breath

117
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:59,440
it has a gentle contact

118
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,480
gentle holding of those sensations

119
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:12,080
recognize them with a little word or act of recognition for what they are

120
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:20,320
not all of them not straining whatever is obvious

121
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:29,120
and easy in such a way that their recognition

122
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:35,240
support you to be intimate with the sensations

123
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,799
where the act of recognition is not a final decision at what's there

124
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,360
but rather it's more like opening the window

125
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:44,840
almost like a question mark so that you feel it more fully

126
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,799
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

127
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:36,679
is there any way that your breathing has become more useful

128
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:43,760
little more fluid or relaxed in the course of the meditation

129
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:57,600
and to feel that sense of ease or an easeful breath

130
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:03,120
and if it hasn't that's okay

131
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,679
it's also very important to recognize a no well

132
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,519
a breathing which is not useful

133
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:25,440
in both ways can be a reference for appreciating

134
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:32,320
other people understanding that they and their breathing

135
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:39,120
is sometimes difficult sometimes labored and tense

136
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:48,120
held and that all beings have the potential

137
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:55,760
of an easy breath open relaxed easeful breath

138
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,840
and it's not an incidental thing to do to have an easeful breath

139
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:11,519
because the breathing is connected to our psychology our minds our hearts

140
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:20,399
to breathe easy is to be relaxed in other ways too

141
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,000
to be at ease in this world

142
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:33,200
and may it be that as we end the sitting then we can wish

143
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:40,159
that others also have the experience of having enough ease and safety and

144
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,279
well-being that they can breathe easily

145
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:52,000
it's one of the great luxuries of life relaxed easy

146
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,880
to have breathing room for our breathing

147
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:08,639
and through that easeful breath may beings be nourished and supported

148
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:18,080
may it teach them about their potential for being being at peace and happy

149
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,880
contented

150
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:31,600
may all beings be at ease in their breathing

151
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,278
may they have the safety to breathe easily

152
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,559
may they have peace

153
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,360
so they breathe openly

154
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,919
may all beings have their breathing free free breath

155
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:08,320
and may we live in such a way that supports others

156
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:14,080
to be at ease in their breathing at ease in themselves

157
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:20,840
may the many of us gather together here this morning live our days

158
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,399
contributing to the greater peace well-being and happiness of others

159
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:32,278
may all beings be well

160
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,919
so i have been

161
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,159
i was introduced to a meditation on breathing

162
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:16,720
probably almost 50 years ago and if someone had told me 50 years ago

163
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,840
when i was still a teenager that

164
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:31,200
i'd still be practicing mindfulness or breathing 50 years later and those 50 years would

165
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,279
have spent a lot of time tuning into my breathing i probably would have

166
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:43,039
i don't know it probably would not have been a welcomed idea

167
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:50,000
but in fact it's been a wonderful thing that um these years and

168
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,840
in meditation it just feels like it just keeps deepening and opening and a great and great appreciation for meditation

169
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,640
for being present for attention and to do it through the the vehicle of breathing and i spent a lot of time

170
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,720
paying attention to my breathing in fact um my my attention to breathing

171
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,159
is kind of with me most of the time if i'm doing things talking reading

172
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,200
being on the computer it's kind of almost like i have become a second nature

173
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,919
to also be with my breathing at the same time it's like my breathing accompanies me with everything

174
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,440
and it doesn't interfere with my ability to do whatever i'm going to do but it um

175
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,799
it supports me it guides me i recognize right away or not quickly

176
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:41,919
enough sometimes sometimes right away when i get tense when i get tight

177
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:48,240
holding concerned when i'm pushing and trying too hard it all gets translated into how my

178
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,760
breathing operates and i lose the easeful relaxed breath and sometimes that's completely

179
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:00,159
appropriate to have the breathing change if i go for a run or you know hike

180
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:06,799
up the hill or have some real fun with some friends playing or something that the breathing does change in ways but

181
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:12,159
it's qualitatively feels wonderful if it's in for a good purpose that the

182
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:18,399
but sometimes you know there's there's uh you know i'm trying too hard or i'm tense or

183
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:24,240
you know trying to figure out my computer and you know i feel my whole chest kind of tighten up and affects the breathing

184
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:30,640
it's held and so they're constantly be aware of it kind of supports guides or supports me

185
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:37,120
and having a much more easeful peaceful kind of life as i go through my days

186
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,559
and i love my breathing his intimacy with it is almost like an intimacy with life and

187
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:51,760
keeps me intimate and connected in a wonderful way so the theme for today is recognizing

188
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:58,480
yesterday was relaxing and we can relax too much and become kind of a just a

189
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:06,720
you know collapse in some way but uh most people they relax deeply deeply to have meditation be a place of

190
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:14,158
releasing releasing the holding intention is one of the great purposes of meditation

191
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,599
but it's not the only purpose and if we over we can overemphasize in such a way that we kind of

192
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,960
slump a lot or collapse or just get kind of dull

193
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:30,960
and some of the sharpness of meditation comes from the factor of recognition

194
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:38,720
and this is kind of the heart of what mindfulness is usually taught that there's a recognizing quality to it

195
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:44,158
and and different teachers will emphasize different aspects of this

196
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:50,638
mindfulness of recognition because many people in the west tend to be thinking thinkers think a lot get

197
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,638
lost in their thought and up in the control tower some teachers like to really emphasize

198
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:03,839
language of feeling sensing feeling your breathing sensing your breathing

199
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:11,599
placing your attention in the middle of your the physic physicality of breathing is and just to really sense and feel it

200
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:18,640
um but there are kind of three major forms of recognition that come into play with

201
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,400
mindfulness practice and they different times different ones of them are relevant

202
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,640
and and knowing these three can be very helpful because sometimes we're trying one when the

203
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,240
other one is actually more appropriate it's more useful for the whole system and

204
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,240
sometimes one of them is more helpful to work through some kind of difficulty than others so knowing these threes can

205
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,280
be very helpful so one is this emphasis on feeling sensing

206
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:54,160
the direct physical sensation experience of breathing and that's one of the means of getting concentrated

207
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,839
because you find some place where the breathing occurs in the body where there's a sensation

208
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,880
and you kind of ride the sensation closely maybe you kind of imagine yourself

209
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:11,359
sitting in the middle of the sensation and being carried by it or focused on it or just really kind of

210
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,800
attuned very closely attuned so the mind doesn't wander off very easily just the

211
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,520
sensing becomes the grounding the stabilizing force the steadying force for the mind to quiet down and get

212
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,720
focused and stable and concentrated and um

213
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,960
people who do the nostrils will have their sensations on their nostrils uh their breath kind of very they get very

214
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,200
precise and acute and very sensitive and it's amazing how how cute the sensations

215
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:48,640
can get and very compelling very pleasant sometimes the feeling in the chest little movement it might be

216
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,000
the whole chest that it might be as we get concentrated at just a little round

217
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,280
spot maybe around the solar plexus or higher up somewhere in the midline and just a

218
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,400
feeling just right there feeling it and if it's uh in the belly it might be

219
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:11,520
there's a classic places of the hara this place is about two inches below the navel maybe kind of like one inch into

220
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:18,880
the body and like the attention is right there feeling the sensations and there you're feeling the movements often the

221
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:25,280
sensation movements the flow back and forth and

222
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:32,320
so it can be very effective to get us out of our head sometimes that way other times and for some people

223
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:38,560
what's more helpful is the what's really the heart of the recognition factor

224
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:44,800
which is to know what the sensations are to know what the experience is while it's happening

225
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:51,200
so to recognize it's an inhale when we're breathing in to recognize and exhale with the exhale

226
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:57,359
and the recognition is a little bit cognitive it could be all with a single word

227
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:04,400
we use mental notes sometimes or almost as if there's a mental note like we imagine we're saying saying the note

228
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:11,359
like um inhaling or in out or it might be that there's a movement

229
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:17,040
expansion and we recognize that we break now that's expansion with like expansions

230
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:23,119
happening that's known expansion is known there is release as we exhale those

231
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,880
knowing the release or there might be a whole slew of sensations that come into play maybe too

232
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:35,280
fast to kind of name them all but there's kind of a silent recognition or an acknowledgement of what these

233
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:42,079
sensations are so in a sense after an inhale you might uh remember in a sense that

234
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:48,400
there were because you recognized it well if you were there that there was a subtle release as the inhale began

235
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:54,400
and then there was a gentle push in the part of the chest perhaps and then an expansion is spreading

236
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,480
and then at the top of the inhale there was um some sense of tautness like some

237
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,000
resistance to breathing in any more and then um and then maybe a pause and

238
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,800
then a release as the exhale begin so there's a uh and the recognition if it's done too

239
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:19,920
effortfully like you're doing a checklist approach it just makes the mind busy it kind of

240
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,960
uses a coarser active part of the mind the idea is to be it very simple and

241
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,960
natural and easy almost like a wonderful expression is the cognitive functioning of

242
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:39,440
emptiness the mind left to its own very its mind is very relaxed and very present it will know

243
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,040
it'll it knowing just happens on its own it's not so much a willful effort

244
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:51,200
but initially there might be a little bit of effort to know but it's kind of like not so willful it's just just a way

245
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:58,000
of helping to stay present it's a tether it's an anchor to the present it's a way of having a little

246
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,160
more clarity about what's going on and as meditation deepens the clarity becomes stronger

247
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:09,520
and there's less of the filter or the cloudiness of that happens when we're

248
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,560
distracted a lot caught up in our thoughts and our feelings and so

249
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,800
there's more and more ease ease and just recognizing and some people will go

250
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,079
through this pattern of starting with feeling the breathing and then as the things settle down and

251
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:31,119
get quiet and concentrated it just feels natural then to

252
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:38,800
brighten things up to sharpen the clarity of the mind by having a gentle soft recognition knowing cognitive knowing

253
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,839
of what is actually happening here and it turns out that in deeper meditation

254
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:48,880
there's something very deepening about this cognitive knowing just very simple

255
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:54,640
natural cognitive functioning of emptiness at some point that cognitive functioning

256
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:00,079
might seem like it's too much and and at some point it shifts just to

257
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:06,160
observing very simple observing of the experience it doesn't

258
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:13,839
have the same kind of direct contact and intimacy of feeling it doesn't necessarily have the same

259
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:22,160
kind of clarity as as recognition of cognitive knowing but observing can be very spacious very

260
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:28,319
it's meant to be kind of one of the deeper places we come to we settle back and we're not entangled

261
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:34,400
not identified not involved trying to fix anything that's going on we're just there

262
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,680
peacefully just watching it it's almost like we get out of our own

263
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,520
way when there's observation there's observing but no observer kind

264
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:51,920
of thing and so these are kind of three of the main kind of

265
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,520
forms of mindfulness and different times different ones are relative

266
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:04,880
useful um and it's i kind of talked about them as being deepening but sometimes when the mind is

267
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,079
kind of very active some people find it's better to just settle back and observe

268
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:16,640
rather than feel sometimes the intimacy of feeling gets hooks us into being kind of caught and

269
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:23,280
more engaged so and sometimes the cognitive knowing

270
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:29,520
is can be so beautiful it's like um it's like in the knowing the cognitive

271
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:35,599
knowing is where this freedom is it's almost like you say to yourself oh

272
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,960
it's just an inhale it's just a tight breath it's just a

273
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:48,400
control breath and that recognition is like oh that's all it is and let it be

274
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,000
and um the so um

275
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:02,640
so the recognition factor and so we begin with some relaxation so we're not tense in doing all this

276
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:10,319
and then we practice recognition in three forms and you can experiment and there's feeling sensing

277
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:15,599
then there's cognitive knowing and then there is just observing simple

278
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,960
observation and um and this is uh

279
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:28,319
and uh for people who are real beginners i'd recommend just the feeling and sensing

280
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:33,920
and then stay with the sensations the best you can and and then as it shifts you know these

281
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,440
other ones as well and so thank you

282
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:46,440
and i look forward to continuing this topic of breathing tomorrow
