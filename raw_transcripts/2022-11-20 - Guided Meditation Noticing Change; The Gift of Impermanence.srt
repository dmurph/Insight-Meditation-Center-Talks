5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,980
sitting together and I'll offer a very lightly guided sit just to help us

6
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:45,000
settle so

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,840
arriving

8
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:58,878
arriving in this body arriving in this moment in time

9
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:21,979
and bringing awareness to this body to this body sitting

10
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:29,220
or maybe at home you are lying down if your body needs to lie down right now

11
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:36,020
because of pain or self-care the position of this body

12
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,860
and if there is movement needed right now rolling back the shoulders perhaps

13
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:50,460
ah maybe trying to sit up a little straighter just a tiny bit

14
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:58,398
just to bring more awareness more uprightness

15
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:04,159
more sense of integrity and alignment

16
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:20,959

21
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:04,019
lot has happened before you got here physically

22

how awesome is that yeah just really yeah actually I want to invite all of us

132
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:52,380
because I'm really feeling the the poignancy of being in a room with other human

133
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:57,780
beings and and listening to the Dharma sharing the Dharma supporting each other

134
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:03,359
in this path it's so poignant and and all of us have

135
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:10,079

136
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:18,500
thank you for for being here really thank you for each other for being here

137
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:26,820
so so for the topic for today's reflections

138
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:33,440
I'd like to invite us to reflect on um

139
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,839
unchanged on impermanence you might have already guessed that from

140
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:45,079
the invitations in the guided meditation yeah you noticed yeah yeah yeah

141
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:51,660
so the guided meditation just to share what what the intention was was at the

142
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:58,040
beginning to try to stabilize with the body become stable feel the grounding

143
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:06,060
because in order to know change it's helpful to have a sense of stability right remember the the metaphor I used

144
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:12,960
with the snow globe that's shaken and it's like oh everything is twirling all

145
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:20,480
the little bits and pieces and when we arrive often on the cushion our minds are like that and oh set it down

146
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:27,420
ah set it down yes feel the body feel the stability feel yourself in the Earth

147
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:33,540
on the ground and in fact the Earth mudra you see the Buddha is touching the

148
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:39,240
Earth right groundedness groundedness and the story

149
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:46,500
of the earth mudra there as as you've seen many Buddha statues actually have the Earth mudra

150
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:52,380
story is that in the night of his Enlightenment the Buddha uh was was assailed

151
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:58,040
by Mara the personification of uh of

152
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:05,700
doubt and and all the other you know the full catastrophe that we have in our

153
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:11,520
minds I can't do this oh and and it's it's said that the story is that Mara it

154
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:20,460
comes as doubt and says who are you you think you're gonna wake up and awaken who'd who do you think you are and and

155
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:27,060
with all of what's going on that is the shaking right the shaking of the all the little

156
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:34,619
pieces moving the the all the moving pieces in the mind the Buddha touches the Earth as

157
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:40,500
Earth be my witness I belong here as Earth be my witness I belong here and

158
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:48,000
studies himself grounds himself hence the Earth mudra so remember at any

159
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,640
time there's no Globe the little pieces are are twirling inside and they do

160
00:40:53,640 --> 00:41:00,839
twirl don't they a lot not just in sitting meditation but throughout the day who do you think you are or this or

161
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:05,660
that I guess ground ground

162
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:12,119
so so in our guided meditation I started with inviting you to ground the body

163
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:18,619
feeling the connection to the Earth feeling the the breath

164
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:25,500
relaxing relaxing the different parts of the body very briefly because as again

165
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:32,940
as the body relaxes the mind can relax or so connected they're so connected and

166
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:38,460
and especially if you're a newer meditator um

167
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:45,480
sometimes as a newer meditator I remember I would sit and I would come and sit and like okay I'm trying to quiet my mind it took me a while to

168
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:51,720
realize oh I need to quiet my body first if I really settle my body if I really

169
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:59,820
stabilize pay attention to my bodies stabilize it around it oh yeah the mind

170
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:07,020
it's like a little babies like when you call me it's like oh yeah it it falls asleep it becomes not sleep but you know

171
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:15,720
it calms it becomes calmer when the body is calming so so again coming back to the to the

172
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:22,320
guided meditation what we did is to settle in the body relax and then I invited you to notice change

173
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:28,560
I invited you to turn to change internally starting with a breath

174
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:35,099
each in-breath as a spring a rival new arrival each out breath as

175
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:41,940
falling as a falling of leaves as like the fall and specially given that in northern hemisphere is the fall as I was

176
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:48,300
driving to IMC this morning especially down uh Bridge Street wow all the leaves have

177
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:54,780
fallen it's so beautiful there is a Grace there's a beauty in the letting go in the fall so

178
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:00,960
change every breath in breath the spring every out breath of fall and noticing

179
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,180
the change noticing every moment Sensations there's

180
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:12,060
there's um tingling moving shifting all of that all

181
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:18,839
this change to get to know change intimately because change yeah yeah everything changes we know that concept

182
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:27,299
yeah yeah everything changes yeah for sure what's new but really getting to know it intimately

183
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:33,240
is an Insight it's actually a profound inside

184
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:40,680
in Buddhism it's one what's known as one of the

185
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:46,920
three characteristics of existence

186
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:54,599
and the three characteristics

187
00:43:54,599 --> 00:44:01,859
as a review the first one is impermanence in constancy Anita Anita

188
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:07,920
I'll talk more about that today that's the focus of the reflections today

189
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:16,500
a ninja the other one is tukka this word that often gets translated as suffering

190
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:22,920
but it actually that's one translation another translation just as well could

191
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:29,579
be stress or unsatisfactoriness or just things not quite being right it's like it's never

192
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:36,480
right do you notice get yourself comfortable and say you're okay for a few minutes it's like oh it's not

193
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,700
it's that sense of dukkha is just that is that is there not quite

194
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:47,420
right ever even if you get conditions you know perfect

195
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:54,619
a nature impermanence unsatisfactoriness and anata

196
00:44:54,619 --> 00:44:59,760
impersonality or not self which doesn't mean that you don't exist

197
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:07,280
and there isn't a self but it means that it's impersonal it's ungovernable and these three

198
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:14,099
characteristics actually relate to each other they're all different aspects of one another

199
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:19,260
when something is inconstant keeps changing right Anita when something

200
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:25,800
isn't constant it's ungovernable it just can't quite fix it get it in one place right hence

201
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,960
anata comes out of that and and also when something keeps changing you can't

202
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,020
quite make it satisfactory and let it stay that way right so these three are

203
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:44,160
different it's like the light coming through a diamond and just a refraction just going

204
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:50,760
out different it's the same light but you just see it in different ways in your experience

205
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:58,200
foreign so impermanent such an important thing to uh to uh

206
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:04,160
contemplate to to actually become aware of it's really liberating it's a liberating

207
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:09,720
reflection and it's not bad news it's not

208
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:15,180
like ah Everything Changes okay might as well that's not the idea here but to

209
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:22,740
actually appreciate that things change they're not going to stay this way they change

210
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:29,220
all the time borrowed from

211
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:35,460
from saido Ray Ranchi from the examined right life

212
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:41,880
and they say wisdom it's not merely something to be gained with old age

213
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:47,160
one can be wise in every stage of one's life

214
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:52,800
to manifest wisdom means simply to step back

215
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:57,839
and see to reflect in choir be aware

216
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:03,180
be disciplined and be focused not once in a while but

217
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:11,220
all the time moment to moment this life is precious and fleeting pay

218
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:18,660
attention this life is precious and fleeting pay

219
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:27,660
attention so one aspect of appreciating impermanence is not to have

220
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:33,720
the delusion of permanence because we have the delusional permanence that's

221
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:39,480
the modus operandi that as human beings we operate on and it's not our fault

222
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:45,180
it's just evolutionarily we're designed to think oh yeah things are fixed and you just think about tomorrow and the

223
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:52,079
day after and the next year and the next decade is going to be fixed and nothing's going to change and things are changing

224
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:59,400
it's not going to stay this way appreciate it appreciate it especially

225
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:06,960
this being the Sunday before in in North America in the U.S Being Thanksgiving

226
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:14,220
next week appreciate giving thanks things are not going to stay the same they're they're shifting and changing

227
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:19,440
all the time people you appreciate in your life people whom you love and care about

228
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:25,980
people who annoy you appreciate them all these relationships are impermanent

229
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:34,200
they are so important we are we're so impermanent we just don't quite connect with it we feel

230
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:40,440
like maybe we do connect with it intellectually but not um

231
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:47,280
on an inside level there are different levels of insight and also talk about this a little more in a moment

232
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:55,020
so the word um Anita again impermanence if you if

233
00:48:55,020 --> 00:49:01,160
you pay it if you notice in many Buddhist teachings impermanence teachings and impermanence keep coming

234
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:06,900
impermanence impermanence impermanence and impermanence is a doorway really

235
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:14,520
deep insight into impermanence it's a doorway to nabana to Liberation

236
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:20,579
to the mind opening up becoming freed up it is a doorway it's

237
00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:27,480
not just some something nice to do or have but this is the way

238
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:36,740
so pay attention pay attention to change pay attention to how you react to change

239
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:47,700
say more about that in a minute but um say something about the word so Anita in

240
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:52,920
Pali this word is spelled a-r-a-n-i

241
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:58,740
-c-ca and the sea is is pronounced as cha

242
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:04,079
instead of Anika it's actually Anita a-n-i-c-c-a

243
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:10,020
and in poly the word literally means inconstant

244
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:17,640
and it arises from the synthesis of two separate words one being Nicha

245
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:23,760
and the Primitive ah which negates everything so Nicha means continuous

246
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:31,160
concept of continuity and permanence and ah means not so not permanent

247
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:39,119
and Suzuki roshi the author of Zen mind beginner's mind

248
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:45,180
and the founder of San Francisco Zen Center

249
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:52,020
the ones they were asked by a student who came to them and said I've been

250
00:50:52,020 --> 00:50:58,380
listening to your lectures for years and I still don't understand can you please can you please express

251
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:03,260
Buddhism in a nutshell thank you

252
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:11,700
so he did he replied everything changes

253
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:17,400
that's Buddhism in a nutshell Everything Changes

254
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:23,160
Everything Changes Everything Changes

255
00:51:23,160 --> 00:51:30,079
Everything Changes Everything Changes

256
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:48,420
so when we fight that right do you notice in your heart if we fight that

257
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:54,259
everything changes our when we fight that we suffer

258
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:59,900
when we make peace with that yeah

259
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:06,359
this body changes it ages it's Age It's Gonna Age It's Gonna Die

260
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:12,480
everything everyone I love they'll change they'll be separated from

261
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,058
everything I love thing change

262
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:27,540
when you make deep peace with change

263
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:32,579
when you make peace with that your heart is liberated

264
00:52:32,579 --> 00:52:37,740
it's not constantly uh whenever change happens or the thought

265
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:45,359
of change it relaxes it's freed it can have Equanimity to

266
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:50,760
hold change it can still grieve it's okay you don't become a robot

267
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:56,460
it's okay to have emotions and grief it's fine but there is the sense of

268
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:02,339
ease there's a sea and sense of ease and not fighting not fighting with Things

269
00:53:02,339 --> 00:53:04,640
Are

270
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:16,680
another quote from Suzuki roshi continuing that so he says everything

271
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:24,780
changes there is nothing to stick to that is the Buddha's most important

272
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:32,220
teaching so so today's topic is the Buddha's most

273
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:39,599
important teaching according to Suzuki Rashi Everything Changes

274
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:45,180
and change is so around us it's it's within us it's

275
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:50,339
around us you know on so many different levels geologically

276
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:55,859
we can see and we can see uh cultures and when we go to historical places

277
00:53:55,859 --> 00:54:02,180
perhaps if we if we travel and we see different

278
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:08,220
civilizations that have come and gone I remember years ago I went to um

279
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:16,020
Cambodia to Angkor Wat and seeing the the glamor that is it's a Grandeur the

280
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:21,720
Grandeur of of the Southeast Asian um

281
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:27,540
um civilization and wow things how things have changed and made me realize oh this sympathization the western

282
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:33,780
civilization if there were the Roman and the Greeks and now you know there is the United States in some ways and you're

283
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:40,500
the hegemony of the US and like oh if it's all impermanent we're just part of

284
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:47,280
part of this this um this ocean ocean of change ocean of

285
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,440
change so larger levels historical and

286
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:57,960
then chapters of our lives right you're not the child anymore you're not

287
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:03,720
a teenager it's all gone who are you

288
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:09,599
and not just that not just chapters of your lives but of your life but also

289
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:16,319
every day since you woke up this morning how many thoughts how many emotions how

290
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:22,559
many Reflections have you had like since you arrived here at IMC or turned

291
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:28,619
on the YouTube channel like how many thoughts how many Sensations like it keeps changing

292
00:55:28,619 --> 00:55:34,260
he keeps changing all the time

293
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:41,819
your body your mind your eye just keeps change just this this it's like a waterfall when you actually

294
00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:47,819
start to notice so when when invitation in practice

295
00:55:47,819 --> 00:55:54,300
in meditation is as as I invited you in the guided meditation and then again this was a

296
00:55:54,300 --> 00:56:01,260
short meditation and short time to to contemplate change but say on on Long

297
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:07,500
Retreats when your mind is really stable and quiet and actually it can happen in

298
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:13,619
short sits too so not to to um say it can't happen but but

299
00:56:13,619 --> 00:56:19,260
um the mind when the mind can be if the mind is quiet it can happen anytime if

300
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:26,099
the mind is really present to get to see that they appearance is like a waterfall

301
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:33,859
appearance is like a waterfall so much changing shifting all the time

302
00:56:33,859 --> 00:56:37,279
all the time

303
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:51,500
and what's so seeing change so when we see change

304
00:56:53,040 --> 00:57:00,540
our minds can react in many ways and often the first reaction that our

305
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:06,480
minds have is resistance and that it's natural don't blame yourself this is

306
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:12,780
just what happens when we see change our minds tend to resist it we don't

307
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:19,319
want it we want things to stay the same unless unless we want impermanence to be on our side and sometimes impermanence

308
00:57:19,319 --> 00:57:26,220
is on our side right it's like I don't I don't like the situation impermanence change it please

309
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:31,380
except for that usually we we don't like change

310
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:39,540
we're scared of it perhaps there's a sense of um unsettledness or or fear that can arise

311
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:44,780
because even sometimes even if things are uncomfortable

312
00:57:44,819 --> 00:57:51,540
then at least it's what we know it's a devil we know versus the devil we don't or we don't want chains maybe it's a

313
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:58,579
relationship that's not quite happy but we know it we don't want change right

314
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:02,720
so being afraid of change

315
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:13,680
and we often blame ourselves we blame others

316
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:18,740
there's a sense of blame with the resistance that can come

317
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:23,599
we don't want our bodies to change our minds

318
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:30,900
one concept here which which I really like to to

319
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:36,059
um um it's a it's a when I heard that the

320
00:58:36,059 --> 00:58:42,059
first time something lit up for me like yeah that makes sense of course so

321
00:58:42,059 --> 00:58:47,640
as I was saying earlier if we resist change we suffer and one way to say that

322
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:52,980
is rope burned right when there is a big when there's a rope and the Rope keeps

323
00:58:52,980 --> 00:59:00,240
going and we're trying to hold on to the Rope really really hard really really tight we get rope burned you know what

324
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:05,400
rope burn is yeah your hands are so notice when you are new when you're

325
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:14,640
connected when you don't want things to change so so why is let's turn to why is this

326
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:21,440
teaching on impermanence why is it one of the most important teachings of the Buddha

327
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:30,359
so let's contemplate that for a moment why would it be there's so many different teachings right find this one

328
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:33,558
Well I this one

329
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:49,380
I'll share a suit to reference

330
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:56,460
this is from Maji manikaya 37 the shorter discourse on the destruction

331
00:59:56,460 --> 01:00:04,319
of craving and this is translation quoted by Joseph

332
01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:09,599
Goldstein so so pay attention

333
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:17,540
in seeing impermanence the mind doesn't cling

334
01:00:19,859 --> 01:00:27,020
it's not agitated when it's not agitated it personally

335
01:00:27,020 --> 01:00:30,859
attains Nirvana

336
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:38,460
I'm going to read this again this is not just poetry so it sounds beautiful but these are actually

337
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:44,760
instructions to how to practice how to become free

338
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:50,660
it's very clear step by step by step pay attention

339
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:58,260
by the way there have been examples where where um where people have given Dharma talks

340
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:04,370
people have listened and they have suddenly become awakened so pay attention this might just happen [Laughter]

341
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:12,359
[Music] there's always hoping so here we go 37.

342
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:20,540
in seeing impermanence the mind doesn't cling

343
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:32,180
when the mind doesn't cling it's not agitated

344
01:01:32,339 --> 01:01:39,920
when it's not agitated it personally attains Nirvana

345
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:46,550
yes [Laughter]

346
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:51,260
it's always hoping

347
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:08,339
a couple of things to uh to be aware of when is that impermanence is not

348
01:02:08,339 --> 01:02:14,220
suppose this insight into impermanence is not supposed to be used

349
01:02:14,220 --> 01:02:21,359
as a spiritual bypass be very careful about that oh yeah

350
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:27,780
everything changes whatever no point yeah whatever I'm just gonna go on lie

351
01:02:27,780 --> 01:02:33,680
there and let things change that's not wisdom

352
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:43,740
so it's not that nothing matters is that actually things are even more precious

353
01:02:43,740 --> 01:02:49,380
life this life is precious pay attention it's impermanent

354
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:56,280
it actually imbues you know there is when the heart is free and not agitated

355
01:02:56,280 --> 01:03:02,700
then it has more capacity for beauty for goodness for love for

356
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:08,760
service instead of being threatened by every shift and change

357
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:17,700
aging lost if it's okay yet these are part of the human experience can we appreciate value value at all and and

358
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:25,619
live and love fully in the midst of all the change so it frees the heart to

359
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:32,460
Love More not to not care and say yeah whatever I don't it doesn't matter it's quite the

360
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:38,099
opposite you see so please don't

361
01:03:38,099 --> 01:03:45,559
use impermanence as a as an impermanent slap as a uh

362
01:03:45,559 --> 01:03:52,020
to slap it on a spiritual Bypass or it doesn't matter quite the opposite truly

363
01:03:52,020 --> 01:03:58,099
as an Insight it allows one to care more and love more deeply

364
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:11,819
it also allows one to develop to

365
01:04:11,819 --> 01:04:18,119
um drop into different levels of perception

366
01:04:18,119 --> 01:04:25,680
from the content into the process right because we are often stuck with

367
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:32,520
the content but when we see impermanence we get to

368
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:37,859
see the process we get to see change itself not the thing but the process we

369
01:04:37,859 --> 01:04:44,700
get to drop down a level from the movie of our life being an actor being and we were still

370
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:51,839
an actor but we we step out a little bit and see we see the movie on the screen

371
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:58,578
oh yes we are an actor yes we still love we still care

372
01:04:59,339 --> 01:05:06,059
we still care but it frees us up to actually love and care more freely

373
01:05:06,059 --> 01:05:11,579
not to be so attached to things that are impermanent of course they're

374
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:17,099
impermanent let's wake up waking up nibana let's wake up to the fact that

375
01:05:17,099 --> 01:05:23,400
things are impermanent and they are beautiful they're precious they're wonderful but not to be

376
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:28,039
threatened all the time of that

377
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:40,680
so there's more I can say but I think I would like to pause and maybe what I

378
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:46,559
like to do is to turn it around and ask you a couple questions

379
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:54,119
so if you will so one is the meditation earlier is

380
01:05:54,119 --> 01:06:01,200
there anything that came up for you anything that in your first person experience and now the meditation was

381
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:06,720
gosh a whole what 30 minutes an hour ago so much has happened so much content you

382
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:11,760
might have forgotten all about it but if there was something that really jumped out

383
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:17,819
for you when you when the invitation was given to observe change in your first

384
01:06:17,819 --> 01:06:23,880
person experience for the benefit of others for the benefit of others I'd

385
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:30,180
like to invite you to to share let's open up to that if if there is anyone or

386
01:06:30,180 --> 01:06:37,578
anything that comes out and if not it's okay too

387
01:06:38,819 --> 01:06:46,020
hi there oh okay that's a little bit loud but um so the thing that I noticed is that I have in the past tended to

388
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:52,799
experience sensation and a kind of like mental map of like where I think the body should be and what it should be

389
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:58,079
like and then you kept emphasizing like personal experience I was like oh oh

390
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:04,500
like I'm just like actual like experience like there instead of on leg of the like Mental Math if that makes

391
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:10,140
sense yeah yeah totally nice great so what I hear happened for you is

392
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:15,900
usually you experience Sensations as if it's a mental map as it's like it's out there it's like oh yeah there's a leg

393
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:21,660
there's some emotion whereas today what happened for you it's like oh it's right here there's like look at that it's

394
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:27,839
moving and changing it's shifting wow beautiful thank you this is great stay

395
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:34,680
with that because that's how this the the intimacy of this inside arises from

396
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:38,298
that thank you thank you

397
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:54,059
thank you Nikki um I recently took a class with Bob Stahl on the 32 parts of the body

398
01:07:54,059 --> 01:08:00,000
and um for me the meditation was um

399
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:06,599
being aware of your bodily processes and all of the sort of birth and death

400
01:08:06,599 --> 01:08:12,119
that's constantly going on just within your body

401
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:18,480
yeah great thank you for that Nancy yeah wonderful it's just this awareness of

402
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:24,600
the constant birth and death and the processes in the body and and the way I

403
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:30,838
hear you because you've done this practice now with with Bob stahlgrade the third parts of the body it's I'm not

404
01:08:30,839 --> 01:08:36,600
here I'm hearing a sense of oh wow this is what it is it's like ah because again

405
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:42,480
that sense of fear or disgust or whatever it might be it can arise but after a while when one actually really

406
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:47,520
stays where the wisdom and Rises oh yeah this is how it is I usually ignore it I

407
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:56,758
push it under the carpet wow isn't this amazing this body this body that is mine

408
01:08:56,759 --> 01:09:04,199
but yet not quite my like how did this even happen right I've been born as this

409
01:09:04,199 --> 01:09:11,480
body and this keeps changing and moving and and um digesting and like I don't have any

410
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:16,920
healing and I don't I I don't have any control over this it's just this this

411
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:24,900
awe this amazement for being human can be born out of this uh a sense of

412
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:32,580
impermanence thank you and again all of this is about loving living more fully

413
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:39,660
more being more fully human um it's not about nihilism but it's sort

414
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:48,440
of if your practice goes into no it doesn't it's all changed don't care like it's gone off the rails

415
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:55,020
though any other Reflections in a few minutes we have left or any questions from what has been or any Reflections

416
01:09:55,020 --> 01:10:00,900
that might have come up from share today yeah thank you for what you both shared

417
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:07,020
I really resonate with that um and I just appreciated the metaphor of the snow globe and oftentimes I find

418
01:10:07,020 --> 01:10:14,699
when I said it's like stop stopping snow globes like I just want to like control it to settle it down and just allowing

419
01:10:14,699 --> 01:10:21,300
the allowing things to settle naturally was really helpful so thank you great great thank you for that yeah I love the

420
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:29,100
snow globe as well yeah it's just such a nice metaphor so gentle right it takes a while for all the flurries to settle and

421
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:34,699
this sense of groundedness yeah there please

422
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:40,739
thank you I just had a question about the personal Enlightenment that you

423
01:10:40,739 --> 01:10:46,260
talked about yeah um as opposed to what it when it it's

424
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:51,300
impersonal Enlightenment or yeah yeah yeah yeah thanks for catching that yeah

425
01:10:51,300 --> 01:10:56,880
yeah this is interesting so so yeah it's um

426
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:03,239
this is an interesting I'm trying to find in the sutta that I shared yeah and

427
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:08,640
the part that is translated as when it's not agitated it personally attains Nirvana

428
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:15,840
so various interpretations about that one is the personal versus the universal

429
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:21,060
right because these are Universal insights that we

430
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:26,179
have but it actually it's um

431
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:31,679
in order to have Universe have insights into the nature

432
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:38,699
of things as they are the only way to do that isn't to think

433
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:45,540
about you know we don't start thinking about the how things work you know that's not how this practice works

434
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:54,000
it's very personal it's you you study you pay attention to your Sensations you

435
01:11:54,000 --> 01:12:02,820
know the doors of the sensations sounds thoughts uh vadana feeling tone liking

436
01:12:02,820 --> 01:12:09,000
disliking all of the you know personal Justice you become the laboratory that's

437
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:16,620
and through the personal when you study these personal things when you realize oh when I don't cling when I cling wow

438
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:22,440
it really hurts you really get to see that you really get to feel that and

439
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:28,679
when the and the when you see that oh and I let go for example ah there is

440
01:12:28,679 --> 01:12:35,340
freedom there is peace there is ease there's more space for love and care for others so it's all of these

441
01:12:35,340 --> 01:12:40,880
Universal insights are through the personal through the personal

442
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:47,880
studying which seems nitty-gritty like wait I'm becoming really self-centered I'm sitting on the cushion and just you

443
01:12:47,880 --> 01:12:54,420
know noticing my breath and Sensations but it's really through the personal that we get to the

444
01:12:54,420 --> 01:13:01,140
universal otherwise it becomes waxing philosophy so one way to interpret it interpret this this line that personally

445
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:08,940
attains a Nirvana is this personal through through the door of the personal to the universal I'm sure there are

446
01:13:08,940 --> 01:13:15,620
other interpretations too but I leave you with this one thank you okay

447
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:23,179
maybe one last reflection if there is one yeah violet

448
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:30,780
um a few years ago when I was meditating very regularly I put the daily

449
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:37,020
remembrances on my wall and they were a source of great sort of joy and peace and then

450
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:42,840
as my meditation sort of comes and goes in regular practice sometimes I look at them and I'm like

451
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:48,540
gross I should take those down there's like aversion to it and um

452
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:55,920
I guess something I've experienced in permanence with in the last year is like impermanence in my like belief and faith

453
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:01,620
in like Dharma teaching and is that kind of impermanence okay like the

454
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:07,199
impermanence of just like belief that

455
01:14:07,199 --> 01:14:13,280
it's hard to maintain faith that contemplating impermanence actually brings more peace than suffering

456
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:19,020
yeah yeah yeah so um so thank you for that for bringing

457
01:14:19,020 --> 01:14:24,960
that in multiple various things you've said so when you talked about you know

458
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:31,020
previously the five Reflections being up and then being a source of joy and

459
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:37,679
now since like ah this cusp and seems like that is a part of this shift in

460
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:43,460
your faith and [Music] um about

461
01:14:43,460 --> 01:14:50,219
and it seems like more General about General than is

462
01:14:50,219 --> 01:14:55,620
um contemplating impermanence does it really lead to

463
01:14:55,620 --> 01:15:02,880
Freedom or does it lead to more suffering I mean that's part sounds like that's part of the the

464
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:08,760
um doubt but it seems like there might be more to it right so I hear more so so

465
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:13,860
does this bring is it does this path bring more peace or does it bring more

466
01:15:13,860 --> 01:15:20,340
suffering I wonder or am I putting words in your mouth Violet I

467
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:27,840
I think yeah I think that's true yeah yeah yeah so

468
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:34,860
that's okay it goes through you know I think that the Crux of your question is does ones

469
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:41,159
Faith or or trust go does it also shift and change

470
01:15:41,159 --> 01:15:48,300
um you're not the first practitioner I've heard of where the faith comes and goes with this sense of trust becomes

471
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:53,400
stronger or weaker and I would say actually this is a um it's a natural

472
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:58,679
part of the process and it might be a maturing

473
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:05,880
it might be maturing so because sometimes we might have a blind faith maybe this might be the case may

474
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:11,640
not be but for some there might be a sense of finding say the teachings that

475
01:16:11,640 --> 01:16:18,300
armor and jumping into it so there could be a sense of Blind Faith and then later wondering what he actually does this

476
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:25,260
work does this piece work for me does this piece not work for me and becoming more Discerning about what pieces work

477
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:32,100
for you what pieces don't work and then maybe in in that discernment maybe something happens that we throw the baby

478
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:38,760
out with the bath water so that could be a part of what's happening and that's okay it's natural so we throw the baby

479
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:45,600
off with right this doesn't work because it's terrible and it's like wait actually I miss it wait that thing did work there were things about that that

480
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:50,699
really work so we start to bring in pieces and with a verified Faith so you

481
01:16:50,699 --> 01:16:58,260
might be going through that the phase of throw the baby out with the bath water then hang in there

482
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:03,719
hang in there it's it's part of the path it's part of hanging there so that your

483
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:10,199
your trust becomes a personal verified trust in what actually works for you

484
01:17:10,199 --> 01:17:18,179
because knowing you now for a while I know that there there are aspects of that that practice you've done

485
01:17:18,179 --> 01:17:25,440
um it's um having heard from you firsthand

486
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:32,960
um you've grown and you've become wiser Kinder more compassionate and that

487
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:40,260
and that can't change so so going through this period is okay

488
01:17:40,260 --> 01:17:47,699
hang in there does that does that help things that I feel like that really describes what's been going on
