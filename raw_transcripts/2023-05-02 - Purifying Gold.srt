1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:05,940
welcome welcome nice to see you all

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:13,679
how is the volume it feels a tiny bit loud for me does it seem loud to you guys that is this okay I have to talk

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,720
non-stop for an order for this to can I get a thumbs up yes okay thanks

4
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:34,980
so sometimes it's helpful to think about or reflect

5
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:42,420
and what is our hearts deepest longing

6
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:50,760
recognize it right that we have limited time on to be alive and limited resources and

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,879
limited energy is it are we spending it in a way that's

8
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:04,280
meaningful for us that's going to help to go in the direction that we would like

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,220
what are our deepest aspirations

10
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,380
maybe we'll just take a moment just to think about them

11
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:33,659
it's useful to reflect on this taking some time and what are you most inspired by

12
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,298
what makes your heart sing

13
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:44,159
when you think about it or maybe it isn't clear right now that's

14
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,820
perfectly fine but when we kind of like align with an

15
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:56,460
aspiration or we remind ourselves or touch into what's really important for

16
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,560
us there can be a feeling of lightness or

17
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,920
some ears or maybe some openness or relief

18
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,819
in contrast to this feeling like oh I should do this that's kind of like the

19
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:22,980
opposite of this openness the sense of should kind of has this sense of contraction or restriction or limitation

20
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,379
something like this but this kind of reflection it's good to

21
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:33,720
do regularly otherwise right or life just passes Us by

22
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,720
while we're taking care of all the things that need taken care of

23
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,540
sometimes it's easy to get disconnected from what's most important

24
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,300
and maybe to feel motivated like how can we even if our so much of our time and

25
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:58,019
energy has to go in one particular direction maybe there's a way we can weave into our life something that

26
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:01,519
supports our aspirations

27
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:11,700
with regard to our spiritual life we might think like aspiration that sounds too much like goal and I

28
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:18,420
don't think I want to have any goals with my spiritual life I just want to just have a spiritual life I don't have

29
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,879
any goals there might be some people who have that idea but

30
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:29,640
then we might be able to say well maybe you have a goal to

31
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:39,120
be mindful and practice mindfulness regularly or have a meditation practice regularly or maybe you have a goal to

32
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,720
listen to drama talks or read Derma books or something like this

33
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:54,239
or to practice with the Eightfold Path or with the precepts or so we might consider those kind of goals and then we

34
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:02,480
might ask well are there some goals that are okay to have but not other goals

35
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:08,040
or do we dare to Aspire for more and more freedom

36
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,819
do we dare to Aspire for more and more peace and ease

37
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,639
or do we somehow feel like that's not available for us

38
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,139
maybe you have this wish in your heart for some happiness

39
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:34,699
maybe you have a wish for happiness not only for yourself but for others

40
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:41,460
maybe you have an aspiration of service supporting others

41
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:47,780
in whatever way makes sense for you and in whatever way you're

42
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,639
life supports that

43
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,759
there's no right answer of course not it doesn't have to be one particular way

44
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:08,240
in all of us I'm sure have our own versions of this or maybe own flavors of it

45
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:15,840
so it's this and even if we have a similar aspiration the way it gets expressed will be different with

46
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:22,560
everybody I mean to say something like service is such a big General word but that should be for

47
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:29,360
different for everybody or greater Freedom you know maybe that looks different for everybody

48
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:37,500
so the Buddha recognized that uh there's aspirations

49
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:45,180
of course he's promoting the aspiration to lebana is teaching suffering and the end of

50
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:54,060
suffering so he's highlighting the ending of suffering but he give gave some talks on what how

51
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:59,460
to support our aspirations that include something in the list right are you

52
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:05,759
surprised is a list that are maybe not the usual list of things that we hear some of them are the

53
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:13,440
same but there are some things that are a little bit different and I appreciate in thisupta

54
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:21,120
the Buddhist starts by saying that just in the same way that a child of a

55
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,120
monarch has this aspiration to be the monarch

56
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,699
in the same way a practitioner has aspiration to find Freedom

57
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:38,400
kind of like this because when we think of the children of monarchs everybody's just assuming that they're gonna next

58
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:45,660
gonna take the throne I was just kind of think assume well that's of course what's going to happen and this is

59
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,539
the direction their life is going to go and maybe their whole life has been

60
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:57,120
around preparing for that to take the throne wear the crown whatever

61
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,860
it might be so I kind of like the idea is like as a similes that just in the same way

62
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:09,360
practitioners will not find Freedom like maybe their whole life is going this

63
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:17,520
direction or getting prepared for that or there's this way we can just assume yeah that's the direction we're going

64
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:24,539
in the same way that the children of the monarchs assume that they're gonna take the

65
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:32,840
monarchy at some time so what are these qualities that the Buddha less

66
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:39,660
the one is confidence confidence that the aspiration is even

67
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:45,240
possible I'm a little bit inspired to find out

68
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,280
Buddha's story of his story of um becoming a weekend

69
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:57,000
some of you may know this story and part of it is that he had some meditation teachers and with those

70
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:03,180
teachers he had some significant meditative attainments that today we would kind of call these meditative

71
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,639
attainments and he became just as Adept as his teachers

72
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,919
and his teachers were you know the most senior in their tradition

73
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,319
where you know they were their own tradition they were like the equivalent of the Buddha but uh

74
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:26,039
um you know they were the leaders of their own religious tradition let me say that and the Buddha he had the same

75
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:32,640
proficiency that they did and yet he felt like oh there's something more even

76
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,399
though there wasn't anybody else who was saying there was something more he had this sense he had this confidence that

77
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:45,300
oh yeah there's something more there's more freedom available so after the first teacher he went to a

78
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:51,959
second teacher had even higher meditative attainments and yet he still had this idea there's still Freedom

79
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:57,899
available there's a little bit of suffering here I can feel it I I believe there's an ending of

80
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:04,440
suffering so maybe we don't have that same kind of confidence that the Buddha did but just

81
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:09,600
pointing to tuning into or becoming aligned with the

82
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,740
sense that we feel like oh yeah there's there can be more freedom can't be more happiness more peace more ease whatever

83
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,940
word you want to use whatever inspires you whatever your aspiration is

84
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:30,240
Okay so in the classic teachings they will say kind of like confidence in The Awakening

85
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:39,120
of the Buddha or confidence that the Buddha is awakened you know that this is possible that people do get enlightened

86
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,720
but it's not only confidence that Enlightenment exists or whatever your aspiration might be

87
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,200
it's also so important that we have confidence that we can do it right otherwise that

88
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:58,620
just seems will be dismissive and not really apply ourselves if we have this idea yeah that'd be nice but that's for

89
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:06,500
other people it's not for me yeah that'd be great but I can't do it

90
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:13,860
that's a different uh feeling right of this confidence that the Buddha hand

91
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:19,260
and so I'm just going to say a few words here about this inner critic I kind of I

92
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:26,580
bring this up often just with uh and practice discussions with people I I

93
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:35,100
know it comes up and it certainly has come up a lot for me in my life this idea this maybe this constellation

94
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:42,240
of emotions or thoughts inside of us that it's kind of like belittling us or

95
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,839
making us think that we're inadequate in some way or making us feel like we just

96
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:54,899
aren't capable or a way that it's blaming ourselves for everything or

97
00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:00,360
maybe just this voice of negativity or often it has this quality of harshness

98
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:08,399
or maybe it's just a quiet soft you'll never make it that kind of

99
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,060
feeling right so when this is kind of this

100
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:21,420
constellation of thoughts and emotions and when it's up and running there's this feeling that of this kind of should

101
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,579
like I should do this I should have done that

102
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:34,560
I should stop doing this you know this a bunch of this this should

103
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,440
so when there's a sense of should there's kind of this also is like really heavy and I'm maybe gonna have this

104
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:47,519
oppressive feeling which is the opposite of aligning with our aspirations which has this

105
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,940
this uh brightness and openness and ease

106
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:59,459
[Applause] so there's this way in which having this set of should is maybe the suppression

107
00:11:59,459 --> 00:12:06,360
or maybe I could use the word pressure that has this lot of effects on us but

108
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:12,480
one of his one of it is that it not only does it squeeze the Joy or

109
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,779
happiness or ease out of practice but it also blocks our capacity to ask deep

110
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:26,160
questions when we have this inner critic that's really loud and authoritative then

111
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:33,600
there's a way in which we don't even dare to ask what our higher aspirations are

112
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,779
maybe for fear that we won't get achieve it or maybe for this feeling like well

113
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:47,700
who am I to even Aspire for something beautiful for my life

114
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:53,540
who am I to even think that I can do that

115
00:12:55,079 --> 00:13:01,139
so this this ability to us these questions in some ways we might even say kind of get strangled

116
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:06,839
with the pressure of this inner critic senior critic isn't true but we believe

117
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:14,220
it's true it's it's very persuasive very like authoritative

118
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:19,100
but what are some ways that we might work with this

119
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:25,019
maybe I'll say that um for quite some time I taught about the

120
00:13:25,019 --> 00:13:33,839
inner critic in the context of what a happy hour was which I did for a number of years on Tuesdays and Thursdays so in

121
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,180
the rather than giving a whole talk on this on the inner critical point to just a

122
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:46,040
few things but there is a playlist on Audio Dharma about working with

123
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:53,339
it so what's the one thing we can do with the standard critic

124
00:13:53,339 --> 00:14:02,160
practice with kindness kindness wherever it's easiest

125
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,980
because sometimes when their inner critic is up and running it's like that's a really tall order to say oh I'm

126
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:15,000
gonna have you know love myself or you know something like that that's you know I'm not really work so well

127
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:21,180
but instead to do some loving kindness practice wherever it's easiest wherever it's

128
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:28,740
easiest puppies kittens babies somebody that's in your life that's just

129
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,959
really your heart melts and when you think about them or maybe somebody who

130
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:40,019
was in your life a coach or a mentor somebody a teacher who really helped you

131
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:45,060
and supported you in your life maybe they're still in your life

132
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:51,779
and to bring them to mind and allow that to soften your heart and maybe do some regular loving

133
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:59,519
kindness practice there's just this softening of the heart that kind of like removes some of the

134
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:05,339
harshness of this inner critic and kind of like shift the mood of our heart I'll

135
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:12,240
say maybe is one one way to work with it another way is

136
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,779
allowing it to be there but maybe not buying into it so giving it some space

137
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:26,100
like oh yeah there you are I recognize you okay come along I'm not gonna listen to

138
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:32,339
you but you might as well come along but you can you know just keep on talking but while you're talking I'm gonna go do

139
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:38,760
this you know so we're honoring and respecting that part of our experience

140
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:45,420
but we're taking away its Authority taking away its ability to boss us

141
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:50,820
around or maybe we can start to learn how to

142
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:59,699
question this inner critic like maybe do some dialogue with it something like really is that so that

143
00:15:59,699 --> 00:16:06,120
I'll never do it well there was a time that I thought I couldn't do X but I actually did it

144
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:13,320
doesn't mean that we haven't had failures but it also our whole life has not been one constant failure there are

145
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:19,579
some things that we have done we've gone to school

146
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,860
we've got dressed in the morning some mornings we don't get dressed

147
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:31,079
that's okay but we don't want to sit a really high bar just notice that uh

148
00:16:31,079 --> 00:16:35,060
we're not complete failures right

149
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:43,440
so this is the first thing is to have confidence and is helpful for aspirations and I wanted to address a

150
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,139
little bit about that about the inner critic because sometimes we don't even dare to have dreams we don't even dare

151
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:54,420
to Aspire they're kind of getting undermined by this inner critic

152
00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:00,000
but a second quality I change the order of these you know and the Buddhism

153
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,600
there's all these lists and they're usually in a particular order I change the order of these but so what I'm calling is the second isn't

154
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:14,600
the second in the order it doesn't really matter so much being honest and open

155
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:22,260
the word sometimes gets translated as sincere so this is not the usual that don't tell

156
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:27,600
a lie but instead it's to be open

157
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,540
with others and yourself and in particular it talks about with

158
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:40,140
wise friends that you have so to have you know somebody

159
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,539
or some yeah maybe somebody or some group

160
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:51,480
in which you can share a little bit about your what's happening with you or maybe even

161
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,660
some uh about your practice for those of you who have participated

162
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:04,440
in girls or mine year-long courses Gail's just finished up deepening

163
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:11,100
meditation program I'm just finishing up seven factors seven shining jewels

164
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:16,260
we have people in breakout groups and we have them talk and part of it is just

165
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:22,620
that to get that opportunity to share you don't have to tell your deepest darkest Secrets but there's something

166
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:29,280
about sharing a little bit about how practices with others that kind of like normalizes what's happening and there's

167
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:36,120
wisdom in other people you might learn like oh I never thought of it that way or oh that's a great idea I'm gonna try

168
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:41,820
that so there's a way we can borrow the wisdom from other people and not feel so

169
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,280
isolated sometimes having a meditation practice is not the usual things that

170
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,500
people do and it can be really great to connect with other people

171
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:59,700
so to have this openness with others and in the in the classic teachings it talks

172
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:04,700
about with the teacher and other spiritual companions

173
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:12,120
especially in these days when we have social media and there's a lot of you know we have

174
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,880
curated uh I don't know like existences online I

175
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:24,299
don't know if everybody does this but right you know it gets posted on social media is like the best version so often

176
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:31,020
so there's this kind of pressure even if it weren't social media but to only share what's the absolute picture

177
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:36,240
perfect but what's being pointed to here is to

178
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:42,299
step away from that I'm like here's what actually happens in my practice

179
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:47,700
and to recognize that all of us have the hindrances nobody is exempt from that

180
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,740
all of us have struggles all of us have difficulties in with getting to the

181
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:59,400
cushion or whatever it might be and it can be really great to be able to connect so whether you have good

182
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,760
spiritual friends or you come here on some Sundays there's

183
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:10,320
discussions after on Sundays on Wednesdays on here there's informal

184
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:17,460
lunch people can talk and then these courses that get taught these year-long courses always have every meeting and

185
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:24,360
aspect of just people getting together on Thursday nights uh Tanya Weiser her

186
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:30,419
teachings also have people get together talk to each other so just this recognition that it's a really nice to

187
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:36,620
have somebody to talk with being honest and open

188
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,940
but there's another element to this idea of being honest and open

189
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:47,460
I have to be honest with ourselves and we might even say that this what

190
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,340
this that is what this practice is all about is really just

191
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:59,820
seeing what's really happening with ourselves and sometimes we don't know we're disconnected from ourselves we're

192
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,760
busy we have lots of things to do or we're distracted or maybe it's painful

193
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,700
and we're trying not to be with our experience

194
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,919
I am not saying jump into the most painful experience by no means am I

195
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:24,240
saying that but this practice so much is about the truth of what's really

196
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:32,340
happening with us and we might even say that without a commitment to truth there isn't really a

197
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:40,140
path of practice because this practice is so much about just being with what's actually

198
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:45,480
happening not our ideas or not what we wish were

199
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:52,020
happening or what did happen but to actually see the truth of the moment the

200
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:57,539
reality of the moment and you might even go as so far as to

201
00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:02,580
say that the Dharma is all about truth

202
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:11,100
and so this being honest and open is one way to have this way in which we can

203
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:19,080
express the Dharma and practice with the Dharma [Applause] and so it's not only that it's just

204
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:26,820
enormously helpful to learn what are our patterns what are our habits what are

205
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:35,400
our sensitive points where we get triggered or derailed or get confused or were we

206
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,460
shut down just to learn that about ourselves so we can work with it skillfully

207
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:48,120
instead we just end up spending our lives trying to avoid those areas and then our life gets smaller and smaller

208
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:56,059
we want our lives to be big and rich and full of whenever we want it to be full of

209
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:04,620
so with also with this getting to know ourselves and our habits and patterns

210
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:13,500
then maybe we can have a sense of how to move towards our aspiration

211
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:19,380
maybe we're the type of person who just wants to feel into where is their more

212
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:25,200
spaciousness and ease and I'm going to follow that or maybe it's a person you feel like you

213
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:30,900
know what I like to follow rules and I'm going to learn like what are the

214
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,840
Buddhist teachings and I'm really going to stick to that and use that to inspire me or me or maybe you're somebody who's

215
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:43,700
like well you know what I I'm gonna sketch a plan whatever it might be just learning what

216
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:49,080
motivates us and what derails US is enormously helpful I'm not telling you

217
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,539
anything you don't already know but I I like to think that the Buddha

218
00:23:54,539 --> 00:24:00,059
recognized that that each of us need to learn for ourselves how we can apply

219
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:07,559
these teachings to so that we can reach our aspirations so that our life can unfold in the way that we want it to

220
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:14,820
unfold so a third item on this list is having

221
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:20,640
like applying energy applying effort

222
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:28,559
makes sense it's one thing to think and dream it's one thing to get to know oneself and

223
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:35,159
certainly that is part of the path of practice but this recognition that effort will be required

224
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:40,580
for these aspirations and so we might say something like

225
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:47,280
perseverance or forbearance or steadfastness I don't know when I hear those words I

226
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:54,179
feel like uh you know it just feels like you know so much hard work

227
00:24:54,179 --> 00:25:00,780
but it I mean it is effort right the Buddha wasn't able to just go Shazam everybody's awake

228
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:06,419
right he's was pointed the way but he couldn't like help everybody to become

229
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:11,520
awakened not to deny that apparently there were some people that heard the Buddha's

230
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:18,900
teachings and became a weekend the rest of us we have to apply some

231
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:26,880
energy some effort and part of the practice is to learn well where should I apply my

232
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:34,279
energy and not only that how much energy should I apply

233
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:41,580
and I like this assembly of a Goldsmith I've said this a number of times but um

234
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:47,700
I'll just I'd like to share it here because sometimes when we hear this like

235
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:53,520
we have to play energy it feels like it has to be full on effort pressure all

236
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,100
the time but this simile of the Goldsmith points

237
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:04,559
out that's actually not the case it goes like this

238
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:11,400
suppose a Goldsmith would prepare a hot furnace heat up a receptacle

239
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:17,580
take some gold and using tongs put it into the receptacle

240
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:27,120
and then the receptacle would go into the furnace and then from time to time the Goldsmith would blow on the gold

241
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:34,260
hotter from time to time the Goldsmith would sprinkle water on it cool it down

242
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:41,539
and from time to time the Goldsmith would just look on as the gold was Heating

243
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:50,039
if the Goldsmith were to only blow on it the gold would just burn up if we just only sprinkle water on it and

244
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:57,480
it would just get cooler and not be malleable and if the Goldsmith were just to look on then the gold would not reach

245
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:03,539
the right consistency but if the gold smith if the Goldsmith

246
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:10,440
would would from time to time blow on it sprinkle on it and just look on then the

247
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:18,500
gold would become purified bright unblemished rid of imperfection

248
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:23,580
malleable wieldy steady and attained to

249
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:28,740
imperturbability all those qualities is how the Buddha

250
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:34,320
described his mind right before Awakening so I appreciate sometimes a little more

251
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:40,940
effort and sometimes a little bit less effort and sometimes just looking on

252
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:47,940
the fourth quality is this something that we off also don't see so often is

253
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:55,020
this recognition about the importance of Health like our physical health

254
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:01,320
and the suit is it's stated as being seldom ill so you don't have to have

255
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:06,960
perfect health of course but I'd like to open this up to

256
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:15,080
seldom ill rather to just being able to work with whatever our health is

257
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:20,820
like old age and sickness is going to happen to all of us and it doesn't mean

258
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:28,260
that we can't practice and the Buddha knew this so it doesn't have to be perfect health but maybe I'd like to

259
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:36,539
kind of expand this to have balance in our life between some of these things

260
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:44,220
that maybe are you already know do we have are we so busy that we don't

261
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:50,360
make time for our spiritual life for meditation or whatever it might be

262
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:58,260
do we have work and play do we have play in our lives

263
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:04,220
do we have time with others and time alone

264
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:10,080
and of course do we have exercise and rest just some of these things like we need

265
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:17,760
to have a balance in our life in order for us to reach our aspirations to have the best life that we can

266
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:24,179
so I appreciate that the Buddha is pointing to health and I'm imagining that life you know thousands of years

267
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:30,120
ago was very different than how it is now and I imagine living Closer To Nature as

268
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:35,700
they did and you know their life of course changed with the seasons that

269
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:41,220
maybe they had a little more balance than we do here where we're living in buildings and we

270
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:47,760
can be completely removed from what's the seasons and what's happening outside we have all

271
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:55,200
these nice lights right it doesn't matter that it's dark outside and then the last quality to help

272
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:04,799
support aspirations is having wisdom about impermanence

273
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:11,000
and I'm interpreting this two ways one is having wisdom about impermanence

274
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:17,100
reminds us that you know we're going to die just like

275
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:23,880
everything else does you know there's things end things that have the nature to be born have the

276
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:31,860
nature to die so sometimes we might think like oh I'll get to this aspiration stuff tomorrow

277
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:38,100
I'm going to do it later as soon as something or rather is done

278
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:43,158
Perfectly Natural we we do this so often

279
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,260
there's an encouragement to maybe is there a way that you can do

280
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:57,440
something that moves your life in the direction that you want it to go maybe towards some Big Dreams that you have

281
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:05,039
also this idea of impermanence if we start to see that well not only us of

282
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:11,760
course but everything is impermanent there's nothing that is permanent nothing that we can really hold on to to

283
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:19,500
be a source of lasting happiness nothing is always gonna consistently be a source

284
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:25,860
of Happiness forever that just doesn't exist we keep on looking for it

285
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:31,200
and we keep on holding on to what is bringing some pleasure or what is

286
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:37,020
bringing a certain amount of happiness but there will be a time in which it doesn't

287
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:42,960
bring the amount of happiness that we wish of course we all know this even though

288
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:49,620
the advertising companies want us to forget it and we do forget it

289
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:57,240
there's nothing I don't want to beat us up for forgetting it but this insight into impermanence when we really see it

290
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:02,279
in a deep way then we stop asking all our experiences

291
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:09,779
to be sources of lasting happiness and instead there's this kind of flooding go there's a opening a

292
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:16,919
softening and we're letting our experiences to just be our experiences

293
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:24,840
instead of demanding that they satisfy us in some particular way and it turns out that that is enormously

294
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:32,340
satisfying just to let experiences be experiences

295
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:39,179
rather than saying this is mine it's only happening to me or getting clinging around it in so many

296
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:47,279
different ways or assigning meaning to it or there because I had this experience it means this about me you're

297
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:55,740
letting all that go instead just it experiencing it that means allows some letting go

298
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:03,120
and that is the ending of suffering which supports all aspirations no matter

299
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,279
what your aspiration is and in suffering allows that one to

300
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:16,559
happen well that was anything to happen so these five qualities to help us with

301
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:26,159
a our aspirations in the same way that the children of monarchs aspire to become

302
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,580
the monarch and there's these five qualities of confidence

303
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:40,080
being honest and open having enough energy or applying effort I'll say

304
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:46,080
um having some health and well-being I'm expanding that to say balance in our

305
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:53,340
life and seen in permanence having some wisdom impermanence can motivate us as

306
00:33:53,340 --> 00:34:00,179
well as maybe help us to not cling which helps us to have less and less suffering

307
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:05,820
and more and more freedom so maybe with that I'll open it up and

308
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,460
see if there's any questions or comments

309
00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:30,138
there doesn't have to be I don't want anybody feel pressured but yeah so I have a question here

310
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:41,700
um I get a little confused between the aspirations and the experience because

311
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:48,919
sometimes my aspirations are for experience so

312
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:55,618
I don't know where the where the line is drawn what

313
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:00,839
what is an aspiration you know what oh I see you know

314
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:06,900
okay I think I'm defining experience a little bit different than you are I think I'm saying experience like right

315
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:12,240
now I'm experiencing that there's pressure against my backside while I'm sitting here I'm saying like that's an

316
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,280
experience so absolute mundane just what the body

317
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,920
is experiencing through its senses what it sees what it hears that what it feels

318
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:28,380
what it tastes what it smells that's kind of all I'm saying is an experience okay just

319
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:33,540
you know whatever just daily being alive things as opposed to some

320
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:38,640
the Disney Experience or you know something like that right okay does that

321
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:45,540
help that's helpful yes thank you thank you for the question that was good that was I love getting questions that help

322
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:54,500
me clarify things so thank you for asking that somebody else have a question Norman

323
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:58,520
yes it made me feel

324
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:11,400
I like the part from the suta that you talked about the Goldsmith

325
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:17,940
um both uh watching

326
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:23,900
the gold and blowing on it and sprinkling water

327
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:31,500
and the picture I got from the way you told it was that

328
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:37,740
um although skill was needed and and no doubt it took some effort

329
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:43,200
for the Goldsmith to develop that skill once he had the skill

330
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:49,320
um doing those things was just kind of methodical

331
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:54,599
and maybe didn't

332
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:01,079
seem like effort he needed the discipline he needed to put the time in

333
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:08,040
need to do the things but but uh it wasn't so hard

334
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:15,839
I see which makes I guess if you can just get your frame of mind about oh you know figuring out

335
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:23,579
what what the meditative process is and practicing enough to where he

336
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:31,160
develop the skill Maybe it doesn't seem hard I see

337
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:37,160
I was interpreting it a little bit different please tell yeah just that the

338
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:44,099
sensitivity to like okay how is the gold now what is needed now now is a little

339
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:51,839
bit more effort now is less effort and or backing off or and maybe or like

340
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:58,980
cooling down like if you feel agitated or something like that and sometimes it's just to do nothing just to abide

341
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:04,500
that's how I was interpreting it and then it's what you were saying a little

342
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:11,220
bit different than that I think yeah I was thinking about how you can get to a comfort level

343
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:16,579
with whatever you're doing in this case I think we're talking about meditation I see

344
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:23,220
so that no matter how much effort is required there's something at the same

345
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:29,339
time easy about it I see just like every joyful and joyful maybe

346
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:34,500
yeah just like everything we do it gets easier but I don't think we ever stop

347
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:40,079
having to feel into is a little bit more effort needed here it's a little bit

348
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:46,859
less here or should I can I just hang out here in this experience I think

349
00:38:46,859 --> 00:38:52,619
we're always having to do that I would say that's part of the art of meditation is knowing this

350
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:58,680
it's like when do I need to apply a little bit more mindfulness or effort and when can I just

351
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:04,320
because no two meditations are exactly the same exactly

352
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:12,619
thank you thank you Bill any other questions or comments

353
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:27,000
okay okay so thank you for your kind attention and

354
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,940
I'm wishing you all a wonderful rest of your evening thank you
