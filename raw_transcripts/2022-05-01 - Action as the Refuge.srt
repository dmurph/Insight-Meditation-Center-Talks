1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,799
so hello everyone and welcome to the sunday morning talk

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,559
and uh i'd like to begin with a little

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,720
something autobiographical that when i was in my twenties i was

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:25,680
living at a zen monastery sahara monastery here in california

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:33,680
for about three years and i had recently graduated from college

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,600
and had been accepted to graduate school which i then deferred

7
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:47,760
and i was living at the monastery living a monastic life

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,440
and i spent a lot of time reflecting thinking about what was i going to do with my life

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,960
go to graduate school do something else what what should i do

10
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:05,600
and i was happily engaged in the monastic life and four days of the week they had had a

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,360
five day week cycle so i'm following the monastic routines for four

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,920
days and then the fifth day was kind of half day off or something and so i would go in

13
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,840
hiking in the mountains there and those days off were my the hardest days for me

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,040
because i was left with myself in a different way and i had to reflect on

15
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,400
my concern about what i was going to do with my life what had to make a decision

16
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:40,159
so i did a lot of reflecting on those walks and after about a year of these kinds of

17
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,439
walks and reflexings and reflections and thinking what to do and

18
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,119
but uh i think it was beginning to be kind of

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,159
maybe i'd done enough reflection thinking about it with no answers

20
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,159
and at some point i realized that i was operating in some general

21
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:11,039
generalizations in imaginations imagining a future imagining things that

22
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:17,040
were beyond the monastery about what i could do and should do and

23
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,239
possibilities and i became acutely aware how much i was in my world of my imagination

24
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:30,560
thinking about all this and and so i made a decision

25
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,120
it wasn't exactly a conscious decision but it was like i don't know exactly but it was a decisive

26
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,400
moment where i decided somehow i decided that

27
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:48,959
i had enough of all these reflections and thinking it hadn't hadn't helped me

28
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,000
i decided that i would start my life over

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,239
i'll just i'll just start all over again with the next step as i walked

30
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:07,519
and and you know looking back at it now 40 years i don't know if that was naive

31
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,200
sure but anyway i did it that's what i did that's what i

32
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:18,319
and i just happened to be living in a zen monastery that was a kind of a cool place to start

33
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,159
all over again because then the bell rang and i had to go meditate bell rang he got up and did

34
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,920
went to work or did things so it was a healthy whole very wholesome place to be

35
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,000
and i just then followed uh what opened up in front of me

36
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:42,319
and uh and at some degree that was the that that represents the rest of my life that somehow

37
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,920
that just taking the next step and then seeing what happens and then responding to that and taking you know things open

38
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,519
up and doing it eventually you know let me hear you know into what's happening in redwood city

39
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:01,400
now and rest on my life and i'm still doing that just kind of

40
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,720
and uh so that was nice for me and that was a nice decision to make

41
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:16,720
and uh it turns out that uh each of us

42
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,759
every day every moment comes to that juncture

43
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:29,040
without realizing it every day you kind of start over

44
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:36,720
every moment you kind of start over believe it or not you could start over

45
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:44,880
and the way you start over is that all the things that you did in the past are now in the past

46
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:52,160
things you did in the past contribute to this moment but whatever decisions you made in the

47
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,199
past have been made you don't have to make those again

48
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:03,440
we find ourselves here and now and now is when we can decide how to

49
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,880
step take the next step now is the time we decide given

50
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,680
all the conditions that are present here and now now we're making a choice

51
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,080
to do something and the choices you've made in the past

52
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,360
they are what they are the place that's really dynamic the

53
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:34,800
place that's really significant for us in our lives is a place where today

54
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,759
and this next step we take the choice we make today and the choice we make today of how we

55
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:48,240
walk how we talk what we say what we do is consequential

56
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,479
and sometimes we there are unconscious choices we're influenced by things around us

57
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:02,080
but the choices you make have consequences that shape your future

58
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,880
imagine that there are two identical twins who grew up together

59
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:15,759
and people couldn't tell them apart they looked the same they had the same mannerisms and way of speaking

60
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,199
the same personalities you know they were just all like so similar

61
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,400
but then they decided to go to different colleges when the time came to go to college

62
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,880
and each of them had a different roommate one of them had a roommate who had a

63
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,160
strong tendency to complain the other had a roommate had a strong

64
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,680
tendency to be grateful for everything and then

65
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:51,039
they didn't know that it was like well this is what each one of them thought oh this is just what roommates are they didn't have any reference point to

66
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:57,120
think anything different but you know okay i'm your college you get a roommate this is what roommates are like

67
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,880
and they didn't and so slowly they came under the little bit the influence of

68
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:10,000
the complaining one learned to complain and you you know you one learned to be

69
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,840
grateful it wasn't exactly a choice that's where you would it's like a conscious choice

70
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:21,440
but there was a choice there was a kind of subconscious choice like okay

71
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,360
under the influence of a roommate it became you know like you got reinforced if you go in the complainer if you

72
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,560
complained it was like you know you had camaraderie ship you could

73
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,000
but the one who was grateful you had the camaraderie ship by being grateful so slowly

74
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,039
you know and and the person who the twin didn't recognize what was happening

75
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,960
how they're being shaped by the situation and after a year you could tell the

76
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,360
difference between the two twins easily and their lives started to change

77
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,479
dramatically the one that

78
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,479
started to complain more and more people kind of held their distance from that person

79
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:14,879
people everyone who was grateful people like to be with them different opportunities opened up

80
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,919
the one who complained because things you know things are a little bit uncomfortable it's an uncomfortable mental state to

81
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,560
complain stressful mental state that reinforced

82
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,640
certain other uh inner reactivities

83
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,719
annoyance at the state of mind and certain self-criticalness and made it

84
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:48,000
easier not only to be complaining but to be angry at things the person who was grateful

85
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,519
supported other mental states more relaxed states more feeling more of a generosity and

86
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:01,040
that's what came out so they both came to the same moment

87
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,120
going to college where they in a certain way started their life over

88
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,560
and then things went a different different way for each of them

89
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:19,760
so today is a new day for you today is a new beginning every moment is a new beginning and you

90
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,519
come to a fork in the road and the question is which fork do you

91
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:32,560
take there's no one who's asking you or telling you i think really about what

92
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,160
fork you should take moment by moment but what if you really took it seriously

93
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,360
that you're starting your life over today fresh new

94
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,000
because in a way you are and the way that you are maybe i'm repeating myself is that

95
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,120
this is really the only place today and now

96
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:00,880
where you can make the choices engage in the activities

97
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,959
that are going to shape your future that's if you're going to be kind of the

98
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:14,720
one who shapes your future to whatever degree we can shape it it's only you that can do that

99
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,320
even if you get a roommate who complains how you respond to that roommate how you

100
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,839
take it in and receive it is really up to you even if it's subconscious

101
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:32,000
when we are mindful we put it it and have this kind of pause

102
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,600
and ability to stay present we have a much higher sensitivity to

103
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,200
notice the choices we make higher sensitivity

104
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,560
to be wise about which fork we take the one that's

105
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:54,240
healthy and the one or the one that's unhealthy the one that creates a better life it creates crazier

106
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,600
kind of worse life for ourselves and

107
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,440
and so when we have this mindfulness practice we can really appreciate we start over

108
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,880
in that sense in a certain kind of way it's very forgiving

109
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:17,200
yes you've been influenced by the mistakes you made in the past that's part of the conditions that brought you here

110
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:23,120
but we don't have to be weighed down by the past buddhism the buddhist approach is to

111
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,959
think enough about the past reflect on it learn from it just enough

112
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:35,519
so we can aim to do better in the future buddhism in a way is forward-looking

113
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,440
so you know some people think that buddhism is all about being in the present moment it's it's about being in the present

114
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:48,959
moment part of it the reason to be in the present moment is so we can in looking forward looking

115
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:55,040
we can make the choices today that make a difference for tomorrow

116
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,079
in a good way for ourselves and even something as simple as

117
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:06,399
complaining as innocent as it is maybe sometimes

118
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:13,120
is choosing a fork which maybe one little complaint is not going to have much impact but

119
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,399
once we start making complaints more and more it affects our mind states if it affects our habits it affects how

120
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,320
people treat us and relate to us and it begins creating a new world

121
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,600
so how careful do you want to be in the world that you create

122
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,160
for yourself how you create yourself there's an expression in english i don't

123
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:46,800
know if this expression you know it's a not a not a set phrase but um it goes something like uh like this

124
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,839
if you do x you you'll you own it you own it and so i don't i couldn't

125
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,160
think of a good example but like you know if you if you um

126
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:07,279
i don't know if you if you decide to

127
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:13,360
balance all the teacups in your house on top of each other

128
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:19,680
you know and you insist on doing it when someone says you know that's not safe it's gonna they're gonna fall they're so fragile they're gonna break

129
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:25,440
and so the person then said i'm going to do it it's safe and you say okay well the person walks away so okay well then

130
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,800
whatever happens you own it meaning i think it means that you're

131
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,120
responsible for it it's up to you to take care of it it's it's your your your karma some people would say

132
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,560
yeah you own it indirectly this is what or directly the

133
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:49,360
buddha said that too 2500 years ago he said you're

134
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,360
you are the owners of your actions

135
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:03,279
you are the owners of your actions and then he goes on to say something else he has a there's a wonderful almost

136
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:09,199
like a liturgy he's kind of a very famous thing among buddhists um

137
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:15,600
line about action anything encapsulated what i'm trying to say today

138
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:23,760
uh beings are owners of their action

139
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:30,720
he air he heirs to their action they inherit them

140
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,240
and they originate from their actions

141
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:45,000
they are bound to their actions and they have actions as their refuge

142
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,639
so we're owners of our actions that's kind of what i'm saying here once we do

143
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,320
something the consequences of that somehow

144
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:03,920
continues for us so to be careful with what we do so we you know the consequences the results

145
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:10,320
the momentum we set in place is one that we want to live with live by

146
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,639
uh we inherit our actions so the heirs of our actions

147
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,880
and um so some of the uh you know we receive again some kind of the same idea but

148
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,880
um they're passed down to us from date from one day to the next

149
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:35,040
through habits through conditioning through whatever way that these all these different ways that

150
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,720
infinite ways in which actions kind of carry with them consequences in the future

151
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,079
the idea in buddhism is that

152
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:52,000
there's no free lunch when you come to action or there's no

153
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,759
free you know free consequences all actions carry consequence

154
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:04,639
and so we inherit them we inherit the consequences

155
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,759
and then we originate that's the powerful one all beings originate from

156
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:16,160
their actions so if in this way i'm talking about it today that

157
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,959
who you are today is partly the consequence of all the actions you've done in this

158
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,959
lifetime before today and it's all these things are so subtle

159
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:34,959
and small and how they come into play and build up over time

160
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:41,040
i was i think i was told once that abraham lincoln said something like by the time a person is 40 they're

161
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:47,920
responsible for their face and i think what he meant was you know all the little gestures and all

162
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:54,079
the different ways expressions we have on the face you know build over time

163
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,839
a certain kind of face and uh and i've been impressed i've seen this

164
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,120
sometimes with i see people who grew up in different cultures different countries

165
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:12,480
and like someone who their parentage was from one country

166
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,720
but they grew up in a different country and you can see sometimes like the difference facial

167
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:24,079
features or muscles or expressions how they are in their face may be built up differently because of

168
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,200
um partly might just be different muscles are used for when we speak different languages

169
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,559
and as you do that over you know decades it affects the face but also expressions

170
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,880
and all this stuff so we originate from our actions i don't know if that was the best example but

171
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,320
from the buddhist point of view it's not about our face but it's about our hearts our minds

172
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,960
and so much was shaped by all the choices we make

173
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,480
and then we are bound to our actions you can't get away from your actions you can't get

174
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,400
away from the fact that actions are consequential even if you your action is to do no

175
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,720
action just be a couch potato do nothing that's an action too

176
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,760
so you know we're bound to actions we're human beings that's what we are we're

177
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,039
human and we say we're human beings i don't think there's very very little

178
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:27,120
time we spend just being you know sooner or later you have to pee

179
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:33,440
so we're more like human it was actors that

180
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,880
human activity ears constant activities that we're doing

181
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:45,600
so to embrace that to appreciate it to find a new way

182
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,640
to be an activity activity actor an activiator

183
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:57,720
i don't know trying to do something equivalent equivalent to being

184
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,640
and because we're bound to or we're bound to

185
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,960
action we can't get away from acting so let's look at action and activity in a serious way

186
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:18,160
and then we come to the last part beings have action as their refuge

187
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:26,080
the buddha said that you can make yourself a refuge so we're not we're trapped in

188
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:32,799
action we're not trapped in you know creating problems for ourselves by what we do and what we

189
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:40,160
say and how we act we can act in ways we can engage in the world and behave in ways

190
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:46,720
that uh we become our own refuge our own support and the refuge in buddhism is a very powerful word it's almost like that

191
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:53,039
one of the i don't know it's um it's kind of like a word like um

192
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:59,919
i don't know if i don't know if it carries the same it doesn't carry the same meanings but maybe the same um

193
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:07,600
associations or the same heart feeling or emotion as in other religions they might talk about having a conversion experience

194
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,679
or having a really deep i'm a devotee of some wonderful religion or something

195
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,600
it has this very deep religious sense that their refuge but rather than the refuge being outside

196
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,120
of oneself the refuge is not exactly in ourselves it's not like you find some essence

197
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,919
inside yourself oh i can you know now i've discovered my true self in there and for the teachings of the buddha the

198
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,600
refuges as our actions how we live what we do

199
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,880
and it makes a huge difference how we live and what we do and we can do the things that are

200
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,159
supportive and nourish us and benefit us

201
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:54,158
so it means simple it's not so simple maybe but simple to say

202
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:01,039
we can live by live ethically we can live by the precepts it makes a big difference believe it or

203
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,640
not whether you kill people or don't for your heart

204
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,559
it makes a big difference whether you steal or if you don't it makes a big difference if you engage

205
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:18,080
in sexual activity that harms others or you don't it makes a big difference

206
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,280
whether you lie or if you don't it makes a big difference if you engage

207
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:29,840
in intoxication or if you don't it makes a big difference whether you're

208
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:37,440
greedy or if you're not big difference if you have hatred or if you're not

209
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,280
it makes a big difference if you're generous or if you're not

210
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:49,840
it makes a big difference if you are grateful

211
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:57,600
or if you're complaining it makes a big difference whether you take the time to see people

212
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:03,840
with respect and even reference or maybe the opposite

213
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:12,880
and those are all these are all actions these are all behaviors and choosing the side of the equation

214
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,720
that is healthy we create our own refuge

215
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:25,360
we create a inner life that we're happy to be in that we're proud of that that brings us

216
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:32,240
a sense of joy and delight more importantly for meditators it brings us a possibility of relaxation of

217
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,919
ease we look within and we're not we don't find conflict we

218
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:44,320
don't find this is you know oh no my regrets of what i said or challenged by what i've done but we look

219
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:49,600
inside so oh it's good in there imagine oh

220
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,200
it's a nice to be in there who's your best friend

221
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:02,799
your own heart your what you find inside but to do to discover that to find that

222
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:08,640
it's through our actions that we do some people uh

223
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,159
feel like they have a lot of doubts and lack of confidence

224
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:20,480
how do you find confidence how do you find faith

225
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,480
some people think it's by reading a lot of books until they find the perfect teaching

226
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,159
sometimes just thinking they have to find some state of you know meditative state of mind that's going to come out

227
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:38,320
correct everything but the way to build confidence

228
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:44,880
is step by step in the actions you do

229
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:52,080
and it might be that uh it's just like you know after a while you've been practiced honestly

230
00:23:52,080 --> 00:24:00,799
for you know in small little increments slowly getting more honest then after a while you you feel that oh

231
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:08,240
i think i have confidence i've learned the skill to communicate honestly in a way that's effective and helpful and

232
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,080
and safe i've but we learn and develop that

233
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:21,279
we learn to be generous maybe in small steps until we feel oh i know how to be

234
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:26,960
generous i know when to be generous and how to be generous and and you know i know about the world of

235
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:33,520
generosity a bit and so it's through actions

236
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,799
that we develop ourselves cultivate ourselves it's by actions that

237
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:45,600
we develop confidence and faith the faith and the dharma faith and buddha in buddhism is not like faith

238
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:51,679
in buddhism so much there might be some of that but you want to have enough faith in

239
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:57,600
buddhism that you begin acting in different ways behaving differently

240
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,600
and then the the refuge the faith becomes less and less about buddhism

241
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,799
and more about yourself knowing how to behave and act

242
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:14,799
beautifully and and so the word beauty

243
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:20,320
now when the buddha talked about action he talked about

244
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:26,320
the word here is karma he sometimes in english translations

245
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,880
you'll read his teachings they'll talk about good and bad karma

246
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,799
the word for good literally is in pali ancient language is

247
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,919
beautiful there's bad karma and then there's

248
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:50,240
beautiful karma what a difference there's bad behavior

249
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:57,600
and then there's beautiful behavior that creates a very different feeling it doesn't have the moralistic flavor

250
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:03,520
of good karma i think and so what are we creating here what are we

251
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:10,480
living our life as what if we say we're doing what's beautiful

252
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:16,480
living our beauty living beauty and that

253
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,760
is more an ethical life but it doesn't have the heaviness

254
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,679
of being of calling an ethical life it has some sense of maybe for me

255
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,120
some place of freedom and delight and joy that we're living at the joy we're

256
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,000
living the delight of what we want to what we do

257
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:45,039
and uh so to um

258
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,720
so the teaching about that's so that's so central to the buddhism that it has to

259
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,320
do with action how do we live our life behave in our life

260
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:03,840
is not always conveyed for people learning meditation

261
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:11,760
and it's uh there's a particular syndrome among a few individuals here in the modern west

262
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,000
of being uh uh

263
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,520
any any emphasis on doing and doing doing something ties them in

264
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:29,279
knots because they feel like they they're not they can't do it right they're wrong

265
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,880
they have to strain they have to push they have to try too hard and get tense like this is serious i have to prove

266
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,799
myself all these kind of ideas that weigh down

267
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:46,000
so much so that if you hear a talk about action you feel exhausted

268
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,640
just hearing about it oh no i have to do more i think i'm just you know i've been that's all i do is do i you know

269
00:27:52,640 --> 00:28:00,880
you know i just need meditation as a break so yes meditation can be a break and to

270
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:09,360
get that break some people love meditation teachings and buddhist teachings that talk about not don't do just be

271
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,880
it can be very profound to hear the instruction just be and don't do

272
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:22,398
as an antidote to all the being and doing and proving that goes on in this culture

273
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,760
but as good as this that the teaching is it doesn't really represent the fullness

274
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,039
of what the buddha had to teach the buddha taught about action

275
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,159
and how to do it wisely and one of the ways to do it wisely when

276
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:45,520
we pay attention we start learning from the feedback loop

277
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,960
when and how our behavior adds stress and stress

278
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,159
how and when our behavior is refreshing and

279
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:01,279
brings ease we start recognizing the extra attitudes

280
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:07,679
and that we pile on top that make it kind of heavy and difficult

281
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:14,480
and we are learning other attitudes that our behavior acting in the world can be

282
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,399
light and easy and fresh and you know there's not we don't we don't care so

283
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:26,799
much at stake it's just oh i'll do this and i think this is one of the

284
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,840
important things to learn is that as we recognize that actions can

285
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:38,320
be our own refuge how do we act

286
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,880
so that it's not a burden how do we act how do we live and behave in the world

287
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,559
so that there's a fees and it's beautiful it's it's uh

288
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:56,080
enjoy it's not what you enjoy to do so by when we finish doing something

289
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,520
we're not exhausted by it but we feel revived by it

290
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:08,720
it's possible to do that much more than most people realize so that means again mindfulness to keep

291
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:16,960
the mindfulness turn on oneself and track carefully the extra attention the extra

292
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:23,600
stress the extra straining that goes into what we do

293
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,799
and to learn how to to act the solution is not to avoid

294
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:34,880
acting the solution is to act without all the extra stuff

295
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:41,600
when i was at that zen monastery they there was stories about the founder of it

296
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:49,039
a japanese monk named shinri suzuki he was pretty short i think maybe it was five foot tall or something

297
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:55,520
and uh he was in his late 60s and and uh

298
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:03,200
this young american strong tall he really he kind of loved having tall americans male students

299
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:08,960
and one of the things he liked about them was they would come to him and help him to help him with his rock garden and

300
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:16,159
they had these big they had his big boulders and um and uh the stories from those

301
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:22,880
people who worked with him in the garden was that when when suzuki russia was going to move a big boulder

302
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:29,440
um he seemed to have used no extra effort than more effort than it was needed

303
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:37,679
his body seemed to stay relaxed and he knew how to engage move the boulder without any extra strain

304
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:43,360
so i wasn't there so i don't know what they actually saw but but that principle stuck with me yes you can even move

305
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,360
boulders adding extra on top of it

306
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:57,600
so beings are owners of their actions

307
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:03,519
heirs of their actions bound to their actions

308
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:10,320
originate in their actions and have actions as their refuge

309
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:18,240
you have actions as your ref can be your refuge and it's your choice

310
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,240
which those two you whether you make it a refuge or make it something that keeps you

311
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:30,158
bound up and caught and in a certain kind of prison

312
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,600
so those are my thoughts this morning so um we have a few minutes if any of you want

313
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:44,960
to ask some questions or comments or testimonials about actions or

314
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,720
complaints

315
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:12,559
or anything else it seems to me very hopeful because i get a new chance all the time

316
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:19,039
yes it's hopeful you get a new chance all the time yes you do carry with you the effects of

317
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:25,840
the past but you always always can see okay now i get to start over

318
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,720
so you don't have to be weighed down by it yes

319
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:45,200
well i do try to do the best i can most all the time

320
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:53,039
but since i can't guarantee that i will not offend you because i don't i'm not there and you're

321
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:59,279
being i asked the people around me that if i offend them in any way please

322
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:05,519
tell me because then i can look at it maybe and correct my mistake but if i don't know

323
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:11,040
about it i can't so i think i think that's really wise

324
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:17,839
that's really wise yeah so we we have a lot of you know unconscious behavior and a lot of

325
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:24,158
foolish behavior and you know all kinds of things we do and so how do we take that into account

326
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:32,079
uh you don't want to be in a straitjacket and so that's what you just explained was is a really important way of

327
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:38,480
having a community to support us and finding our way and so to make a make agreements or

328
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:44,878
arrangements with people you know or to choose friends who can offer you feedback and places

329
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:50,878
where you're safe to make mistakes and be told about it and find your way forward

330
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:56,320
this is a really really useful yes

331
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,760
it's difficult for people because people don't want to offend you right yes

332
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,160
thank you thank you

333
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,800
if you would say your names it would be nicer so we can also my name's jeannie

334
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,920
and i'm suzanne i just had the thought that

335
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:35,200
what you were talking about living with a teenager you start anew every day

336
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,160
because now that i'm in there the the teenager's mood changes from day to

337
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,839
day sometimes moment to moment and you're seeing a new person each day or each moment

338
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:53,200
and having to learn to flex and change with that and

339
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:59,839
decide you're going to do things differently is probably very good buddhist practice fantastic because maybe you'll then

340
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:05,440
learn to do it for yourself because you probably changed more than you realized

341
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,160
great thank you

342
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,200
thank you gill for explaining actions as a refuge it was confusing to

343
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:31,839
me when i first saw that statement but now it's very clear that good actions can

344
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:38,160
become certainly a refuge for going forward great great

345
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,400
and beautiful actions too i'm inspired by this idea of called you know calling it beautiful actions

346
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,160
because rather than good actions and uh i don't quite know what to do with it

347
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:57,079
it's honest to be honest but uh it inspires me quite a bit

348
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,280
hi my name is abhishek and can you please explain what's the difference between a

349
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:31,200
dread action and a beautiful election that's uh can i distinguish between a good action and a beautiful action

350
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,440
um you know the word good probably both words need

351
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,800
need defining we use it so lightly word use the word good so easily as if everyone

352
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:49,119
understands what we mean but i think you can ask what do you mean by good

353
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:56,000
um i i i would like to use the word good that it means that it's useful and a bit

354
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,240
uh beneficial for some purpose uh rather than focusing on the morality of

355
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,359
it its good action is an ethical action which certainly is for some people

356
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:13,200
that it's useful it's healthy and beneficial for certain things and

357
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:19,599
whereas beautiful for me is that there is a

358
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:28,000
uh it's certainly pleasant it's uh it's almost like it like looking at art that just it's so nice to see

359
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,760
someone says something beautiful to another person it's not just useful but there's a kind

360
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:40,000
of a grace there's kind of a pleasure delight kind of inspiration

361
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,280
uh it's kind of that this you know wow that was well done that was a nice thing

362
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:53,359
um so you know if i i don't know if this i can i you'll you'll forgive me for being so

363
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:59,040
poor at examples but if i just said something like well you know

364
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,040
well thanks for that question that was great that was a good question thanks that's one thing right

365
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,720
but if i say wow that was a really great question that

366
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,760
was important you know it makes me reflect on it now and it kind of gives me something to think about even more

367
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,200
that difference and and i hope my answer was was good

368
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,839
but uh thank you so maybe the first was not so

369
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:33,200
beautiful maybe the second approach beauty is that how is that my getting am i in

370
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:39,680
the ballpark for you yes so it's what i get is like how we do things uh

371
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,839
relates more to beauty and what within what we do let's move on good oh

372
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:52,380
the beauty has to do with how yeah i like that very nice

373
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:55,469
[Music]

374
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:12,640
okay so i guess okay and uh

375
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,960
thank you all very much for coming and uh you know we used to when we met before

376
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,640
the pandemic we would often periodically ask people to turn next to each other and say hello and all that and i feel

377
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,560
you know a little hesitant to do it now with the pandemic and all that and how we are with masks and being closely

378
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:36,319
together but if you go outside in the gravel or under the tree or something and

379
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:41,359
and just maybe some of you would be like to say hello to each other and uh

380
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:46,800
maybe people you have never met before and if you're standing in the gravel or

381
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:53,680
you're available to say hello to and maybe chat a little bit yes uh and if anyone's new i'd be happy

382
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,319
to you know show you around or ah

383
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:07,760
right perfect and yeah jeannie used to do that before pandemic so yes so so she's offering

384
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,440
anybody who's new or relatively new and would like to just say hello to an old timer and hear a

385
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,720
little bit about what goes on here um yeah go see genie you'll be outside too

386
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,800
right great okay during the hall just outside yeah great

387
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,920
okay thank you all
