1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:13,200
so good day everyone and the way we could say perhaps um good

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,960
year and kind of like good morning good beginning of this new year for us on this

3
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:28,240
7 a.m sitting and teaching so i'm happy to be here for this anniversary day and so we'll have a zoom

4
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,520
meeting afterwards and for those of you who don't want to be on zoom

5
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:41,440
i think i'll just keep the youtube on and you won't necessarily

6
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:50,640
get all of it but you'll get half of it of myself responding and talking in a little bit and and and

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,840
the zoom link is the is at the very top of this chat and i'll post it near the bottom

8
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,680
when we finish here as well it's also found on the imc website in two places

9
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:11,200
in the calendar section of it where it's listed as an event and on the

10
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,280
what's new there's a little notice also in the bottom right hand side of the home page and if you use those

11
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,720
links you have to use the password which is meta m-e-t-t-a if you use the link

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,720
that's uh on the chat you click picture right there and i won't turn it on until i finish here so

13
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,920
there might be a minute or so in between

14
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,040
so so um

15
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,360
as a child i spent a lot of time swimming in water and i loved to go underwater and

16
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,680
swim as far as i could without and holding my breath and that explains maybe a little bit why i

17
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,119
um a little bit i paid tiny bit attention to

18
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,160
people who do free diving and people who do records for free diving

19
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,480
underwater the longest the deepest distance down into the water or or in

20
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,400
the ocean or perhaps a whole you know swim the longest underwater or be longest underwater

21
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,400
and i think they're one of the records i believe for staying underwater without breathing is about 11 minutes

22
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,200
so it's kind of phenomenal that people can train to do that but one of the things that people who do

23
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,239
that learn to do is to quiet their thinking

24
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:52,720
because thinking takes up a lot of oxygen you need a lot of energy and to think and and so they

25
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,720
they're certainly aware and engaged what they're doing and very hyper attentive to what they're

26
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:05,440
doing in a very particular way but they're ordinary um

27
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,440
energy draining battery draining app has been turned off the discursive

28
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,879
thinking the commentary they that they do

29
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:23,519
and so this also happens in meditation it's one of the reason why in deeper meditation it seems that we stop

30
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,599
breathing because there's very little need to breathe when this

31
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,879
heavy app that we have that's really kind of going on all the time in the background and

32
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:43,040
you know it's one of these apps that kind of take over and and work even you know

33
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:50,959
behind the scenes our thinking app so to uh to as we get into meditation

34
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:58,400
uh the idea is to enjoy it settle into it and settle into that

35
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:06,000
enjoyment into the contentment into the quiet into the piece of it even if it's just hints of it

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,120
kind of orient kind of a paradigm shift where we're orienting towards something else besides our thinking

37
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,040
and we're orienting towards the breathing and the peacefulness the quiet the

38
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:27,520
stillness the the joy and the contentment that comes from developing samadhi

39
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,440
and with that uh there's a shift away from the thinking mind the commentary

40
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,280
mind the dis having discussions and plans and memories and all that

41
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,360
and so to appreciate the value of that appreciate how good it feels to let that

42
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,639
part of the mind go quiet and if these deep sea divers can do it certainly we can do it as we do our own

43
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:59,280
kind of version of deep sea diving which is dipping into samadhi deeping it

44
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,479
deepening into this kind of states of goodness and wholeness

45
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,720
that don't require us to think and think a lot and when we realize how safe it is and

46
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:19,120
good it is and nourishing it is then we begin to let go of the the tremendous

47
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:26,320
interest the mind has with this app um the thinking app

48
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,840
so to assume a meditation posture

49
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:41,039
and to relax tremendous amount of what we're doing in

50
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:50,160
the going into samadhi is in fact relaxing letting things become tranquil

51
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,680
not only letting go and relaxing the body

52
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,160
but also taking some of the mental apps offline they're not needed or energy drains for

53
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,360
human battery and they can come back online again

54
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,199
later but we're letting go or relaxing

55
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:22,240
doing less and less except for us settling in steadying

56
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,919
ourselves on the breathing and enjoying it

57
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:40,560
so taking a few long slow deep breaths and on the exhale

58
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,199
thinking of it as turning off so much of the unnecessary app so we

59
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,880
have running the tensions in our body

60
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,919
softening the shoulders especially

61
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,840
softening the belly

62
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:15,680
and if you are taking some deep slow breaths then as you stop that appreciate that

63
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,319
you are letting go of that effort

64
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:31,840
and now you're just letting yourself breathe in a more easy way

65
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,720
and then to continue relaxing the body a

66
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:50,000
bit the surface body of the shoulders the face the belly

67
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:03,360
and deep in the body the deep holding resistance bracing

68
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:12,240
the deep holding ourselves

69
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:27,840
even holding ourselves together

70
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,240
and then to also

71
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:41,839
orient yourself to the quietude of the mind

72
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,839
let's let yourself become aware in the ways of the mind

73
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:00,959
quiet clear relaxed

74
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:12,959
and as you exhale settle into that quiet

75
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:21,920
letting go of the thinking mind and if it doesn't let go completely it's

76
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:28,000
okay for now let it recede into the

77
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:42,240
background and then with the mind

78
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,600
let the mind land on your breathing

79
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,040
and have the mind the attention

80
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:03,200
find uh establish yourself to be steady on the breathing

81
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,160
steady the mind and its focus on the breathing

82
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:25,120
and much of our physical experience of breathing is in fact silent doesn't require

83
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:32,079
thinking the silent feeling and sensing of the body

84
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:37,440
steady yourself on that experience of sensing

85
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,240
the changing flow of sensations as you

86
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
breathe

87
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:08,079
as you exhale letting go of your thoughts and letting go into

88
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:15,839
a quiet steadiness on breathing

89
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,360
and if you use any thoughts at all let it be thoughts of counting the

90
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,360
breath counting up to one or up to three or up

91
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,320
to 10 or simply the word yes

92
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:43,839
so said so quietly in the mind that it's almost like you imagine you're saying it

93
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:57,839
steadying yourself on the breathing and whatever good feelings that come

94
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:11,839
with a quietude and steadiness breathing in and breathing out

95
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,959
appreciating the quietude that's here even if your mind is

96
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:16,319
thinking a lot look past it

97
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:23,839
to the quietness steadiness of attention on breathing

98
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:31,279
a paradigm shift away from your thinking mind

99
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,839
to a quiet steady awareness of breathing

100
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:51,839
and whatever goodness is in that attention

101
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:08,080
switching from thinking to a quiet seeing

102
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:15,278
a quiet sensing aware of breathing

103
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:33,840
steadying yourself on the breathing

104
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,970
[Music]

105
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
so

106
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:51,600
and then as we come to the end of this sitting appreciating the paradigm shift from

107
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,158
thinking to seeing

108
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,000
seeing with the quietness of the mind

109
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,559
so we're not seeing through the filter of our thoughts ideas opinions

110
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,200
but we're seeing through the quietness

111
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,679
steadiness and safety of

112
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:31,840
simply seeing simple awareness of what is

113
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,960
and in the maybe the comfort and safety of meditation

114
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:45,840
can you turn the gaze of this quiet

115
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:53,279
steady seeing awareness

116
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,799
to the people in your life

117
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:12,880
those who are close and you have contact with those who are far away and you don't have direct contact those who you know

118
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,480
personally and those who don't

119
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:29,679
and see if you can simply from meditation gaze upon them

120
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,559
quietly silently without the judgments and the stories and

121
00:29:38,679 --> 00:29:47,120
anticipations of what it means just gazing on them quietly

122
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:59,360
and see if that gaze that awareness can be kind that in the quiet and safety of

123
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:08,720
privacy of your own meditation a kind steady gaze

124
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:15,600
be still and gaze upon all everyone kindly

125
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:28,960
not complicating it with your stories ideas memories plans

126
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:37,840
just the simplicity of others

127
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:50,080
and perhaps that kindness then can be expressed in the words

128
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:55,679
of kindness you might repeat after me

129
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:05,840
may they be happy

130
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,000
may they be safe

131
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:23,120
may they be peaceful

132
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,440
may they be free

133
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:49,039
may all beings everywhere be happy [Music]

134
00:31:55,560 --> 00:32:00,250
[Music]

135
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,919
you

136
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:03,919
so continuing on the topic of samadhi

137
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:10,000
and the 11th step of mindfulness of

138
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,480
breathing

139
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,679
and samadhi is sometimes the word samadhi is sometimes

140
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:28,240
the generic word a general word for meditation

141
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:33,440
or the meditation and cultivating our mind our body

142
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,559
cultivating ourselves in the meditation practice and then

143
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:46,398
when we look kind of within this universe of samadhi there's all kinds of things that we're

144
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,480
we are gathering together we're unifying we're coming together

145
00:33:52,480 --> 00:34:00,720
that to develop and grow and enhance our experience and samadhi is not meant

146
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,799
to be an experience that diminishes us that makes us less and deprives us

147
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,720
but it's actually the opposite it's one of the richest ways of experiencing ourselves

148
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:20,638
enhances fulfill very fulfilling very filling very nourishing and it's developing

149
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,720
these beautiful wholesome qualities these beautiful wholesome states of mind

150
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:34,158
but in doing so it's also kind of getting out of the way of our but not adding all this extra

151
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:41,040
tension and stress that uh can exist in the mind and moves us to less and less stressful

152
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,960
states of mind or states of being less and less activated

153
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:54,800
places of agitation and moving to deeper and deeper peace and as we do so even wholesome states of

154
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:01,520
mind wholesome activities of mind that are more energetic than need to be

155
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:08,240
begin to be shed or relaxed or settled and it's a movement from more energetic

156
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:15,040
states to quieter and stiller states and not that quiet stillness i think some people have very

157
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:22,560
negative relate experiences of quiet and stillness and silence so we have to kind of try to put those

158
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,760
associations aside and somehow realize that the quietness

159
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:35,200
and the stillness silence that we're developing is letting go letting go it's kind of like filling us with

160
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:42,880
feelings of real goodness and contentment and fulfillment satisfaction but there is this movement

161
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:50,400
towards less and less agitation less energetic movements and things that in that in

162
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,920
that context of the mind getting peace more more peaceful things that were wholesome and

163
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,280
wonderful before can be felt now they feel like they're a little bit too agitating

164
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,920
they're a little bit stressful to be there so for example one of the things that happens in samadhi is there

165
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,680
can be a lot of joy but joy at some point seems like it's too much it's too agitating

166
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:20,480
and even though at the beginning it seems like this is the best that anybody could ever experience and um but as we get more familiar with

167
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:28,000
it it's the energy of it seems like too much and then we um

168
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:36,640
and then we settle down more and more into um um into um

169
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:43,119
you know a piece or a more quiet place that feels even more satisfying so this movement and this is kind of the

170
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,960
general trajectory of deepening samadhi developing samadhi

171
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:55,119
is this movement from more agitated more energetic states to less energetic states that i feel

172
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,800
more and more satisfying as we go into them and so i say this because it's a guiding

173
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,079
principle for tuning into our practice that um

174
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:12,160
that the the kind of the way to see the path forward in samadhi is to appreciate at

175
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,200
some point that really feel at some point that what felt really wonderful

176
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:24,640
at one one stage of practice we're ready now to let go of it or let it become quieter and move to a

177
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,079
less energetic less activated state and uh and as that's the movement that's

178
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:36,000
the direction that the practice is going and and and then there are

179
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,040
various landmarks along the way that stand out as we do this process of

180
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:49,280
settling and settling and settling that goes on more peace that happens but the principle is

181
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:54,480
removing in this direction and it's helpful to keep that principle in mind

182
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:02,320
because sometimes when people read about samadhi they learn about like four stages of jhana four stages of deep absorption

183
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:08,640
and it becomes a little bit mechanical or technical like am i in the right place am i at the first john i'm at the second

184
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:14,800
jhana and there's a kind of like samadhi my numbers that goes on which

185
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:21,119
can get overdone sometimes and people are too preoccupied about the technical definitions and aspects of

186
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:28,000
this rather than living in the organic flow of samadhi that we can and just allowing things to

187
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:35,920
unfold and not be so concerned about the numbers and stages and how far we've gotten and

188
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:42,320
it's easier to do that if you understand that principle that we're going from more activated states to less activated

189
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:49,040
more stressful to less stressful more from more agitation to less agitation

190
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:54,079
and so there is a kind of a trajectory kind of a path and some of the landmarks of that

191
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:01,280
are is first is a real appreciation

192
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:09,440
for no longer any kind of relief from no longer being actively engaged in unwholesome ways of thinking

193
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:16,480
so if we have spent a lot of time with resentment just like why did that person do that or desire just really want

194
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,079
something hostility fantasy and you after a while

195
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:28,960
we feel the flatness of it the two-dimensionality of it the way in which it keeps us stressed and so

196
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:35,839
with somalia with developing meditation we're starting to let go of those things and when we really are become separate

197
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:42,480
from it's temporarily put aside or deactivated those apps of greed hate and

198
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,800
delusion the unwholesome it's such a relief and there's a kind of a gladness and joy

199
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,640
that wells up but more important as uh this relief and the goodness the

200
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:02,880
happiness of this relief now the meditation can really begin to do our gentle work of practice

201
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:09,359
uh staying present applying the mind and staying there and this idea of the gentle work of just

202
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:15,119
okay stay here be with us hang in there come back be here

203
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:21,200
now it's done without the stress of having to struggle against unwholesome

204
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:28,560
distractions and difficulties of mine but there is a kind of gentle work of okay stay here that can be represented

205
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:35,040
by what happens on the in-breath uh we have to the in the beginning then breath is a whole

206
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:42,160
new experience the mind has to connect to that and then we stay there for the full in-breath

207
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:48,319
then we connect again to the beginning of the out breath and stay there for the whole time it's a very gentle some people don't

208
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:53,839
even notice that they're doing it but there is a kind of little movement to these two movements of the mind

209
00:40:53,839 --> 00:41:00,560
little working massaging kneading the dough kind of experience but it

210
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,760
comes along with the relief and the happiness of not being distracted anymore finally

211
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:12,000
being able to be here and do this as we settle in and we at the steady

212
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:17,920
we land and and there there's a steadiness and the um we there's less and less of

213
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:24,240
this need to make the work of connecting and staying it becomes second nature the mind is just starting

214
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:29,920
to become stable and we're just able just to rest in the breathing and just stay there's

215
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:36,319
very little tendency to wander off just there we're here we're finally here and that gives birth to a different kind

216
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:42,960
of joy of just being really now being able to put aside that extra work of

217
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:50,079
connecting and being and there's a kind of gliding soaring sliding

218
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:55,440
on the experience of of and so it kind of feels like it's like petting

219
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,640
the cat the pep begins to purr we're kind of there

220
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:07,760
being touched in some deep way and um and it's kind of like the uh pleasure

221
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,200
principle where we're just kind of being touched this beautiful feeling of just staying with the breath and

222
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,200
being there and being that a different kind of joy arises and that can be quite strong and

223
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,520
energetic at times and after a while that joy feels like it's too much

224
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,960
and so then uh it's ready to kind of to let go of that level of agitation

225
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:36,319
activation and by tuning into there's actually a deeper satisfaction

226
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:42,160
feeling of contentment and feeling of mindfulness feeling of

227
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,599
clear comprehension a simple awareness simple recognition of what's happening

228
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:53,680
simple awareness of what's happening and the goodness and contentment of just being in this happiness or

229
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,200
this deeper sense of pleasure and we let go of the joy because

230
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:04,800
and then as we go deeper in that happiness feels i don't know if it feels like it's

231
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:11,839
too much but the happiness begins feeling begins to soften and relax and it falls away

232
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:21,359
into something that's much more satisfying which is a deep sense of tranquility equanimity

233
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:29,280
and where the awareness is very pure very pure awareness sometimes it depends

234
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:36,800
how we translate the pali the buddhist teachings on is but its awareness is very closely connected to equanimity

235
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:42,720
that its awareness which is purified by equanimity and so the awareness is very peaceful

236
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:48,000
very aware and and uh very still and because there's so little mental activity so

237
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:55,359
little stressful activity much of our ordinary way of experiencing ourselves has temporarily fallen away

238
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:01,359
people even have the sense of not really being in their having a body the body edges fall away

239
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:06,480
and no sense of being in a body and it's not being disassociated it's

240
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,680
actually the opposite we're so connected that uh and so still

241
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:19,119
that we don't need the reference points we usually have so um

242
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:28,000
so the principle of this movement to lessen less activity as we go into samadhi and part of the

243
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:36,560
purpose of this is to clarify our gaze our ability to see to observe

244
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:44,480
so it doesn't have a lot of agitation or filters or disturbances of

245
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:51,200
unwholesome thinking but even our thinking and projections and ideas and concepts that we overlay even if the

246
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,960
concepts are accurate enough to no longer be overlaying concepts on our experience

247
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:04,000
and and so it isn't that samadhi we're doing it for its own sake but for the way in which there's a

248
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:10,800
cleans the our perception cleans purifies awareness so we can start

249
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:18,000
seeing in a deeper and deeper way for the purpose of liberation
