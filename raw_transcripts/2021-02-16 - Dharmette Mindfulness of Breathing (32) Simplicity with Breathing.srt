1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,799
so it's one of the i think

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,599
wonderful things that simplicity

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,880
is one of the

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,800
hallmarks or one of the characteristics

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,039
of this meditation practice

6
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,119
and sometimes that's not quite seen

7
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,720
because

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,480
sometimes teachings teachers like me

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,080
might give all kinds of instructions and

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,359
it might seem like there's a lot of

11
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,398
instructions to keep in mind

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,960
a teacher i i knew when i was in india

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,440
named

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,879
manindra menindraji he was a student of

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,280
many of the early western

16
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,640
practitioners of vipassona

17
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,199
he had many wonderful sayings and one of

18
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,719
them was

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,480
if it's not simple it's not vipasuna

20
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,719
and and so the idea is to keep it simple

21
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,320
so how is it that this practice is

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,760
simple

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,439
it's simple by relying on

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,840
the simplicity of how we can be aware of

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,479
something and

26
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,400
to be aware maybe in the simplest

27
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
possible way

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,080
and and uh and for each of us

29
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,400
and each of us at different times what

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,159
it means to be aware

31
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,200
will be different and so that this part

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,840
of the fascination of it all is to see

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,799
how the uh what what we call attention

34
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:33,840
or awareness

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,720
shifts and changes um depending on how

36
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,640
settled we are how focused we are

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,479
and and the kind of attention that's

38
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,960
useful in any given moment

39
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,759
but the guideline is to always keep it

40
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,159
simple

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,280
and partly that means not to be

42
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,960
striving for it to be different

43
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,360
not to be trying to engineer your

44
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,240
meditation to get it just right

45
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,920
it's partly to partly means to

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,920
not be trying to avoid experience and

47
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,479
get away from something

48
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,080
is not trying to overthink the

49
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,760
experience or think our way into

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,640
something and

51
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,879
trying to figure out analytically even

52
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,920
what's the right way

53
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,160
and it's also not trying to do too much

54
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,640
at once

55
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,520
the idea is to kind of

56
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,840
be content with just being

57
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,959
now just being is not the end game of

58
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,160
meditation

59
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,800
but there's kind of a reference point

60
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,959
for keeping it simple

61
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,440
rather than a lot of doing there's a lot

62
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,879
of being

63
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,920
and in that being in the simplicity to

64
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:48,879
allow

65
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,480
of whatever the native awareness is

66
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,160
allows us to know that we're in the

67
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,840
present moment to

68
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,280
be there and surface and show itself

69
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,040
because the mind drifts off in thought a

70
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,200
lot and is caught up in thought

71
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,319
that then to

72
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,959
one of the things that many people find

73
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,720
useful and it's not necessarily useful

74
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,840
for everyone

75
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,239
and then teachers can give other

76
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,519
instructions

77
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,840
but um is to the simplicity of breathing

78
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,560
and uh the breathing is kind of like the

79
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,920
the

80
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,680
sometimes you use like the the anchor

81
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,280
line or the

82
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,720
tether or the support for staying in the

83
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,920
present moment

84
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,519
breathing is always in the present

85
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,480
moment it has a rhythm to it

86
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
it's not a fixed experience it's a

87
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,239
flowing or moving or

88
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,319
changing experience and there's

89
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,280
something about attention

90
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,400
following a moving changing phenomena

91
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,040
that makes it easier to be relaxed in

92
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,640
the present moment

93
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,799
kind of like if we're watching a uh

94
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:57,680
we're sitting

95
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,799
under under a tree relaxing

96
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,200
in the shade of a warm day watching

97
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,280
maybe the river go by

98
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,799
and we're kind of just watching the

99
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:08,959
ripples and the little wavelets and

100
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,840
the currents this flow and flow and

101
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,040
we're not

102
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,000
studying it intensely we're just kind of

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,680
allowing the experience to come we see

104
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,440
it maybe clearly

105
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,400
and there's something about that

106
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,280
movement where the mind doesn't fixate

107
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,040
on something but just allows things to

108
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,840
flow

109
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,720
it keeps the eyes soft and relaxed and

110
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,639
kind of moving along with it

111
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,360
that part of the reason why it can be

112
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,680
very relaxing and people can spend

113
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,280
long periods of time just watching a

114
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,800
river go that by or

115
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,840
watching the waves on the beach come and

116
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,000
go

117
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,880
or watch a fire just a burn in the

118
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,800
changing patterns of the flames as we

119
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,280
watch the

120
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,479
little fire the fireplace perhaps

121
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,840
and so it's that movement of breathing

122
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,759
the coming and going of the inhale

123
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,840
they're coming and going in the exhale

124
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,759
that that can can work for some people a

125
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,199
very nice way

126
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,080
of just keeping us in the present moment

127
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,240
and then of course for many of us

128
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,639
especially if you're starting that can

129
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:11,840
be we start getting

130
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,360
more complicated than we need to be and

131
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,880
and part of simplicity is to relax

132
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,320
around making it complicated you don't

133
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,560
don't hold up simplicity as is something

134
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,240
to strive for and

135
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,639
and to engineer into but rather

136
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,280
kind of take yourself as you are in a

137
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,240
certain way

138
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,199
meditation is a come as your party so

139
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:37,840
come as you

140
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,919
are and sit down and allow yourself to

141
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,360
be how you are

142
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,400
and and that allowing

143
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,360
and settle into it and that and uh and

144
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,120
the art is not to

145
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,360
let yourself be as you are and continue

146
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,160
and have your thoughts galloping away

147
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,800
but allow yourself to be as you are and

148
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
then really settle

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,880
into the the direct experience the

150
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,199
embody the living experience

151
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,160
of how you are so there's a turning of

152
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,360
attention

153
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,240
inward to the body and and what is the

154
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,560
embodied experience of all this

155
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,120
what's the embodied experience of our

156
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,360
mood our emotional state our mental

157
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,080
state or

158
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,199
physical state and

159
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,240
and because it's the simplicity of being

160
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,400
has a lot to do with what our experience

161
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,520
here and now in the present moment the

162
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,680
body is always in the present moment

163
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,919
the breathing is always in the present

164
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:36,800
moment

165
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,600
so coming here and settling into it and

166
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,440
then as we settle into it

167
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,720
at some point to tune it

168
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,680
become attuned to or align ourselves

169
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,039
with the experience of breathing

170
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,319
and and to be with that simply

171
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,080
sometimes we're controlling the breath

172
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,680
sometimes the breath feels tight and

173
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,160
constricted or held in some ways

174
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,800
not particularly comfortable and so the

175
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,560
experience of simplicity is just

176
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,280
allow that to be and breathe with that

177
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,560
breathe through it

178
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,280
uh make room for it to be uncomfortable

179
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,720
or controlled

180
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,120
because that making a room for giving

181
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,639
breathing room

182
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,319
is part of the way of keeping things

183
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,160
simple and allowing

184
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,039
something inside which is not yourself

185
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,520
your own engineering efforts your own

186
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,680
kind of try mechanisms of trying to fix

187
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,800
and change

188
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,960
something inside of you will begin to

189
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,400
unfold

190
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,639
um begin to unwind will begin to release

191
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,759
begin to kind of find itself and

192
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,440
so that's one of the things that

193
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,560
the in the principle of simplicity

194
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,680
is uh trust the simplicity of just being

195
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,360
with experience

196
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,840
trust trust your experience if you're

197
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,199
present for it

198
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,440
even it's even if it's not necessarily

199
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,240
ideal or comfortable or something

200
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,280
and then something within begins to open

201
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,800
unravel relax

202
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,080
on its own there's a very strong

203
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,599
momentum in our body

204
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,639
in our in our whole being

205
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,840
towards the release of tension

206
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,599
towards the release of holding and

207
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,400
tension and pushing and pressure

208
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,440
and and so part of this giving breathing

209
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:25,759
room

210
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,400
to ourselves and allowing things to be

211
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,199
is in fact this movement towards

212
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,440
allowing for this settling this

213
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,880
releasing this

214
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,919
freeing that can happen

215
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,599
when we just keep showing up and being

216
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,839
present

217
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,440
so maybe what i've said this morning

218
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,680
that was already too complicated

219
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,880
so i apologize but it's all

220
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,480
kind of an effort to try to point to

221
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,200
just being simple and maybe the

222
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,480
breathing can help you with that

223
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,600
simplicity just be

224
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,040
with the breathing trust the breathing

225
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,440
i like the expression entrust yourself

226
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,680
with breathing

227
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,200
and uh and um and then it doesn't have

228
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,640
to you know it doesn't make me doesn't

229
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,240
look so sophisticated doesn't look so

230
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,880
wonderfully spiritual but to keep it

231
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,920
simple

232
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,360
and in that simplicity uh of being with

233
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,600
experience being with the simplicity of

234
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,040
it um

235
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,120
feeling the embodied experience of

236
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,160
breathing

237
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,839
that something will begin to settle

238
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,200
something will begin to open

239
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,480
something will happen that um is the

240
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,920
journey of meditation practice

241
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,480
