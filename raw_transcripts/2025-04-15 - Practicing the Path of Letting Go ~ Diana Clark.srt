1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,560
good

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:12,120
evening so I'm going to start the talk tonight with a

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,760
poem it's by Rosemary Traummer of course those of you who come here often know

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,640
that I'm often reading her poems she's a beautiful poet and a practitioner Buddhist practitioner or

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,000
meditation practitioner so this poem is called When the Stakes

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,280
Are Low when the Stakes Are Low by Rosemary

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:45,040
Tramer for the fourth time in four weeks I slip my spade into the dark soil of

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,200
the half circle garden i make 20 shallow

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:57,360
holes then lift the pansies from crinkly from crinkly plastic containers and drop

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:05,320
the rootbound squares into the earth within hours the small brown bunny

11
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:13,720
arrives with his pink twitchy nose and his small round lump of soft bunny

12
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:21,880
body and while I wash dishes I meet through the window his innocent unbleing

13
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,200
gaze as he consumes a dozen deep purple

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:35,520
petals in small efficient tugs he looks at me as as if to say "You

15
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,119
love me and I do." a crune at the bunny how

16
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,680
cute his small ears how perfect his bliss how good he is for eating his

17
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,439
pretty bunny food tomorrow the rest of the blooms

18
00:01:53,439 --> 00:02:02,200
will be gone in a week the le the leaves will be gone too every single

19
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,280
one and I will go buy more pansies

20
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:15,599
how sweet it's become this path of surrender the strange joy that rises in

21
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,760
me when I see my precious pansies nibbled to the

22
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:28,560
roots now that the stakes are low it's much easier to bow to the way things are

23
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,800
for the price of pansies I can practice again and again how to find true delight

24
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:42,920
in this art of letting go true delight in this art of letting

25
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:49,000
go and we could say so much about Buddhist practice is about learning

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,400
this and that's a little bit what I'd like to talk about tonight because there's this way that uh

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,440
letting go is just part of helps a way in which

28
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,519
helps us navigate the constant change of life maybe we don't even think about it

29
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,360
but there's this way with this letting go helps us to reduce stress in some

30
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:22,760
kind of way if we are insisting that things be the same every single time then that's a recipe for

31
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:30,239
stress things change people change the weather changes this durations of

32
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:38,319
daylight change right all this we know this we know this and yet there's sometimes there's this way in which we

33
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,440
like have an idea of how things should be and we're holding on to that idea and

34
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:50,840
the holding on of that idea causes stress and discomfort dooka we might

35
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,920
say for example you might have this idea that you would um spend some time with

36
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,959
your friend and uh one afternoon but at the last minute your friend cancels like oh shoot we were going to

37
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,480
go for a hike and there could be this little disappointment and anger and

38
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,959
frustration and with this uh friend but you could just let go of like oh okay

39
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:20,759
great now I have some time to do

40
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:27,600
nothing go for a hike by myself sit and uh watch the clouds go by

41
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:34,720
do something else this letting go of things have to go the certain way that we're planning or maybe

42
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,759
this shows up in meditation maybe uh during a meditation period we sit to

43
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:46,960
meditate we're hoping for peacefulness but then we find that the mind is all over the place and can't

44
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,080
settle at all and then instead of fighting it

45
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,000
instead of think like oh when is this going to settle down and seems like other people are can meditate why can't

46
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I meditate i've been doing this for so long and I still can't do it or you know all these stories that we come up for

47
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:12,080
ourselves but if you let go of the wish for stillness letting go of that wish

48
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,080
this this uh implicit in this wish is things are not okay now and I want them

49
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,280
to be different if we let go of that that

50
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:31,120
invites calm even though there might be some of this agitation in the mind there can still be this

51
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:38,960
calm so as as I said briefly this idea of letting go as part of the

52
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,400
foundational teachings of the Buddhist teachings one way we can understand this

53
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,720
is if we use the four noble truths as a framework for Buddhist teachings there's

54
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,360
different frameworks we can use and this is just one of them the four noble truths some of you might be familiar

55
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,520
with this the first is the truth of dooka and duka is this really

56
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:10,560
interesting word that uh in English it stands for I should say in Pauline it

57
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:18,800
stands for this wide wide wide range to just this minor irritation annoyance to

58
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,520
horrifying absolute worst thing so this big wide range often gets translated as

59
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,000
suffering it could be translated as stress get translated a number of different ways but the first normal

60
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,800
truth the truth of dooka things oh Lee Brazeni translates

61
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,880
uh dooka as bummer things can be a

62
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:51,199
bummer i kind of like that it has a certain playfulness to it and then the second noble truth is that

63
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,840
there's a cause of bummerness there's a cause of duka and

64
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,120
often we can understand that as clinging or grasping or craving this kind of like

65
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:10,520
really wanting and holding on to the third is there's also the ending of this

66
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:17,880
dooka and then the fourth is and there's a path that leads to the end of

67
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,120
duca and so I'm going to highlight the second noble truth that there is this

68
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,280
there's a cause for duka for suffering for stress for things being a

69
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,520
bummer and that cause is craving or clinging or grasping this kind of like

70
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:41,960
really holding on to and then there's a lot of teachings of like well how to abandon how to let

71
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:48,599
go of the clinging or the grasping and that leads to the end of

72
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:56,479
suffering so this idea of letting go is like just inherent in one of these core teachings of the Buddhist path but not

73
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:03,120
only that it's also the fourth noble truth this path that leads to the ending of suffering some of you might know this

74
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,440
the path is known as the eight-fold path [Music]

75
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:15,720
and step number six is about effort you know what we apply our energy

76
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:22,960
towards and those uh we play our energy towards this gets so complicated four

77
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,199
things but one is the abandoning of unhelpful

78
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:35,560
states this is what we put our energy towards is abandon those things that aren't helpful helpful for the ending of

79
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:43,120
suffering so in some of these core foundational teachings is this whole idea of letting go uh abandoning

80
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,560
renouncing um can't right now at the moment speak

81
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:54,240
of any other English words i just I looked it up uh earlier today and in

82
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:03,200
Paulie there's like half a dozen words that have this meaning just because this is such like an integral part of the

83
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:10,720
teachings but there's this way in which we might feel uncomfortable this

84
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:17,360
idea of letting go because after all like society and media and all the advertising industry all this kind of

85
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,959
stuff is about more more you need more get more buy more be more it's all about

86
00:09:23,959 --> 00:09:29,839
more there's so much we uh there's this uh real movement towards like uh

87
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,120
instituting a sense of lack or insufficiency or inadequacy into people

88
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,720
or into anything really just so that there's this real sense of it's not

89
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:48,480
enough you got to have more whatever it is more stillness when you meditate more

90
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:57,480
friends more friends that show up on time when you want to go hiking or I mean just more cars more houses more

91
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:04,320
stuff and so this idea of like well what letting go this opposite of movement of

92
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,680
acquiring in some ways feels maybe a little bit radical maybe it's a little

93
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,519
bit uh revolutionary in terms of it's so different than the message that we get

94
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:21,200
so often but there's also this way in which

95
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:28,480
letting go can might feel like this sense of renunciation and we might feel like well

96
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:36,720
I I don't really want to be a monastic i don't really want to move into a cave sell all my beans and shave my head sell

97
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,480
all my belongings shave my head and move into a cave or something like that or

98
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,360
maybe there's this way that letting go feels like surrender in some kind of

99
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:53,839
way so just the way that we've been socialized this whole idea of letting go

100
00:10:53,839 --> 00:11:00,640
it sometimes can feel not so attractive especially when we have this feeling of

101
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:08,519
there's not enough not enough love not enough care not enough attention not

102
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:16,279
enough security and safety this idea of letting go can feel pretty threatening

103
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:21,600
so there's this way this sense of deprivation or of lack of safety might

104
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,640
be associated with our ideas about letting go but I'm going to point to kind of

105
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:35,040
like what happens when we actually do it but before I get there I want to say the Buddha never talked about that you have

106
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,440
to get rid of your belongings or you know give away everything and that you can't have wealth or personal

107
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,120
possessions we come through a tradition that was uh preserved by monastics so

108
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,880
came through kind of like the monastics um teachings we're not monastics and so

109
00:11:52,880 --> 00:12:00,320
there were teachings that were for lay people and there was it was about how to use your money wisely to support having

110
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,800
more freedom for you and your family most the majority of the teachings are for monastics and they have that little

111
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:14,880
bit of this flavor of a renunciation but instead this Buddha he

112
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:21,279
said that uh is we don't have to get rid of our wealth or our possessions but to

113
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:29,360
let go of what's not useful what's not helpful what's not skillful and so much

114
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:36,800
about this practice is about our discovering for ourselves what is useful

115
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,680
what is helpful helpful for having more peace more freedom more ease for having a

116
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,240
sense of sufficiency adequacy so this pointing to letting go

117
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:57,040
of that which isn't helpful and there's this uh way in which he has

118
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,720
there's a quote from the dhamapata it's uh letting go is not this

119
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,800
denial or aestheticism instead it's related to this

120
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:14,839
happiness as uh rosemary trauma in this last line of this poem the delight in the art of letting

121
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:21,480
go this quote in the dharmapata is if by giving up a lesser

122
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:28,560
happiness one could experience greater happiness a wise person would renounce

123
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:34,240
the lesser to behold the greater so part of this practice is for

124
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:40,639
us to understand what are these lesser happinesses and we might say that some of these are just some of pleasures that

125
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,920
are fleeting and might even be causing harm to us ourselves those are lesser

126
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:53,200
happinesses some of these greater happinesses is this uh sense of well-being a sense of ease sense of

127
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,320
peace and freedom so there's this way this letting

128
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,320
go is really pointing to it should bring some delight it should bring some joy it

129
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,639
should bring some happiness so and along these lines this idea of

130
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:18,560
letting go or abandoning or renouncing what if instead of we

131
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:26,440
translated as this way of giving giving up like up

132
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,760
above and there's this way like giving up above can be almost like a way of

133
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,440
maybe like there's an altar or that we're um giving something for a higher

134
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,040
purpose or something like this this maybe like making an offering or an act

135
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,160
of generosity perhaps maybe maybe like those pansies

136
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:53,440
for the little bunny right you know this act of generosity in that poem

137
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,199
so this maybe this letting go is more of a movement of the heart and it's maybe

138
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:06,800
has this uh flavor of um something that's beautiful and that is uh is

139
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,160
associated with uh more spaciousness and

140
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:17,600
ease because letting go is not so much about what you lose it's not so much

141
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:23,760
about what you're letting go of as it's about what you gain and the Buddha

142
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:32,000
talked about this so there's the obvious obvious things there's this letting go that has a sense of

143
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:37,839
relief some time ago i uh put on a blouse that I used to wear to work back

144
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,760
when I had a job in corporate America and I thought I would wear it for a particular occasion and I put it on and

145
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:49,440
I was like "Oh my gosh this boss is so itchy and scratchy how did I never

146
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,680
notice this before i just took it off and put on

147
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,040
something else i didn't have to debate should I let go of this should I not do

148
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,839
this?" or something like this it was just like "Oh this is uncomfortable i'm going to take it

149
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:14,800
off." That's what's getting pointed to here that's what's getting pointed to and part of the practice is for us to

150
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:22,399
learn what is uncomfortable part of how we learn that is by learning what's comfortable like

151
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:28,880
experiencing more and more states of ease and some well-being and some of that happens with meditation practice as

152
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:34,240
the mind and the body settle there often not always there often can be this

153
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,399
greater sense of well-being and ease that then highlights all the other

154
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:46,480
places where there's this tightness and this gripping and striving and straining

155
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,480
in a way that's not so helpful

156
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:59,399
so one of the things that we gain when we're letting go in in a way that is

157
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:05,360
helpful is some of I would say joy or happiness and that Buddha pointed to

158
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,640
this in some teachings i'll just mention this briefly this idea of this gladness

159
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:17,880
pentad so letting go leads to gladness which leads to joy and

160
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:23,438
tranquility happiness and concentration and then seeing things clearly so this

161
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,039
is a cascade that gets pointed to over and over again in the Buddhist teachings

162
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:34,240
so this idea that gladness and joy tranquility or happiness are integral

163
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,520
parts of the practice i would say they're required actually because we

164
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:46,039
need to have some lightness of being to do letting go as well as to help us see

165
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:55,039
clearly see clearly about ourselves the ways that uh the things that we're doing that are leading to dooka and the things

166
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:02,240
that we're doing that helps us to have uh less dooka so the Buddha pointed to this

167
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,320
gladness pentan as letting go points to that but there's also this way in which

168
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,679
this letting go is sometimes is letting go of those things that are obstructing

169
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:22,440
or obscuring or getting in the way of what's in our hearts what's already

170
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,320
there is just getting obscured this can be the seven factors

171
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:34,840
of awakening i won't go through this whole list but uh I'll say that happiness and

172
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:42,000
concentration are part of this uh these seven factors of awakening maybe I should go through the

173
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:50,320
whole list let's see if I have it in my mind mindfulness investigation energy

174
00:18:53,000 --> 00:19:00,559
joy concentration equinimity is that seven six

175
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:07,720
is happiness joy serenity concentration

176
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:16,640
there's seven factors of awakening i said six of them we'll find I gave a a

177
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,720
number of years ago I gave a talk in each one of the seven so and then I did something about the seven together a few

178
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:29,760
times and you would think I would have learned it but uh right now I don't have it in my head so these things that are

179
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,360
in our hearts get exposed when we're letting go of those things that aren't helpful including the seven factors of

180
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:42,440
awakening and these are factors these are elements these are qualities that really support

181
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:48,160
awakening greater freedom and peace and ease there's also the Brahma vaharas

182
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,840
these are like four qualities of the heart loving kindness compassion

183
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:00,240
sympathetic joy and equinimity these are these heart qualities of love we could

184
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:07,120
call it the four faces of love this is all inside of all of us sometimes we

185
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,120
just have things that are getting in the way and so this practice of letting go is

186
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:21,039
part of just letting go of these things that are either keeping uh what's obstructing it there in place or uh

187
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:28,240
actually letting go of the last little bit there to release the these heart

188
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,760
qualities so what are some of the things that we

189
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,720
can let go of to make this a little bit more

190
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:45,919
tangible grasping to objects it's not objects themselves that we have to get

191
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:53,200
rid of to have more ease and peace it's the grasping it's the belief that they

192
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,200
are going to be lasting sources of happiness and therefore we have to hold on to them to make sure that we have

193
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,760
happiness objects are not lasting sources of

194
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:12,240
happiness i like some objects we have to maintain

195
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:20,320
we have to uh there are batteries we have to uh take care of or and we have to clean

196
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,679
them or they die and we have to replace them or what if they're perfectly fine

197
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,400
for our whole life but then when we die I mean they're just go to the next

198
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:37,440
person or to wherever they're going to go they're not something that's going to

199
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:44,400
bring us these lasting source of happiness that we really want they do bring pleasure but there's a lot of data

200
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:50,320
that shows that when you're purchasing something like for example on something like Amazon when they measure kind of

201
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:58,000
like the delight in individuals brains measured with uh different neurotransmitters the biggest hit of

202
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,559
delight is when you put the item in the shopping cart not when you buy it not when it

203
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:12,039
arrives it's when you put it in the shopping cart and it can just stay there

204
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:17,480
so I this is a practice I do sometimes i just put things in the shopping

205
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:23,159
cart without buying them i don't need to buy them

206
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:28,400
so everything changes but you know things aren't like what maybe at what

207
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,679
time was it seemed like a lasting would provide lasting sources of happiness

208
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,960
maybe this object isn't changing so much but we're changing this little stuffed

209
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,679
animal that we had when we were a kid right maybe that seemed like it was going to be lasting source of happiness

210
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:51,280
and maybe we had a blanket or something that we took around with us everywhere we had favorite toys or something like

211
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,799
this and you know as an adult it's clearly we have a different relationship

212
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:03,840
with it so this is one thing things to let go of it's the grasping to objects we can

213
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:10,720
have objects as part of our life but it's this holding on to them and insisting

214
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:18,200
that they stay the same and in insisting again and again that they make us happy that's a recipe for

215
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:24,159
disappointment of course it is and the advertising agencies are betting on this

216
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,960
that you'll just be satisfied with something just for a short while and then want something else

217
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:38,600
something else to let go of or this clinging to our views so long and so often we have this

218
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:46,320
idea this is true and everything else is wrong i I know it's right and those

219
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:54,320
people over there they don't know anything they're wrong of course we need views

220
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,360
we need to be oriented in the world and we need to be inspired and have a

221
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:07,039
direction in which we want to go it's this clinging to them thinking that okay what I have is

222
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:15,080
what I understanding is the right one and I don't know what those other people are doing but they're clearly wrong

223
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,520
was um very interesting this morning i was

224
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:26,080
uh teaching a a class and uh we as part

225
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:32,480
of the reading they they had read something and uh we were going to discuss it and

226
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:40,360
people they started uh having comments about what the reading was and then I just dropped

227
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:47,200
in who the author was and the context in which it was written the what they were

228
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:53,960
reading was written All of a sudden everything

229
00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:01,039
changed it was quite striking to see how oh just a reinterpretation of everything

230
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:06,840
and understanding everything differently i said maybe three

231
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:12,919
sentences and everything changed for them and they understood everything

232
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:18,000
differently this is a good reminder for us we think that I mean we have certain

233
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,600
amount of information and we have views based on that but how can we be sure

234
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,960
that there won't be some other new information that will change our ideas

235
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:35,520
our views so instead can we hold this well my current understanding this is

236
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:42,720
what I believe this is what makes sense to me now this this is uh from what I've seen

237
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,200
so far this is uh my view on this instead of saying this is right and

238
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,919
everything else is wrong having this provisional understanding

239
00:25:54,919 --> 00:26:00,960
wow this your life will just unfold so much easier if you can instead of this

240
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,039
idea of we're right and they are wrong i'm right you're wrong because then we

241
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:13,279
have to defend what this right is and we have to defend like oh no no no they if

242
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:19,679
we see that those people over there if they happen to do something that's helpful or good but then we have to

243
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:26,240
discard that because it doesn't fit our idea of them being bad and us being good and all kinds of mental gymnastics we

244
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,159
have to do to maintain this so instead it's like yeah this is my provisional understanding this is

245
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:39,760
what makes sense to me right now and it just leaves the door open that some more information might change

246
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:46,919
our ideas change our views to things to let go of clinging to

247
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:54,520
views clinging to objects clinging to views including to views about

248
00:26:54,520 --> 00:27:00,799
ourselves i'm the person who doesn't do this I only do that or something like

249
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:06,320
this it's amazing the views we have about ourselves and so often they're not

250
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,760
uh complimentary in the sense of like no I can't do that

251
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,440
i can't drive on that windy road or I can't um I don't know there so many

252
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,480
things we have this about

253
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:32,279
ourselves things to let go of clinging to objects clinging to views let go of trying to control

254
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:39,000
others if only those other people would get things right do things the way that they I think they

255
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,080
should there's this way in which be kind of like uh implicitly or trying to like

256
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,720
possess them in such a way that they can will do whatever we want them to do whether these are complete strangers we

257
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:57,159
don't even know if they're just hypothetical people that them over there or maybe they're

258
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:05,640
even partners family members children aging parents these types of

259
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:11,799
things it doesn't work and it's

260
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:18,720
annoying has you have you ever had somebody try to control you right it just doesn't work so there's this way in

261
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,760
which we often set up this battle with like well if only this person would do

262
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:29,840
this you know because we care for them we love them we want them to do something we know it'd make them feel

263
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:39,559
better but for whatever reason this person doesn't want to do it can we be okay with that

264
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,760
can we be okay with uh recognizing the autonomy of other people doesn't mean

265
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:53,600
that we don't ever make suggestions or support them or things like that but we stop trying to control them we let go of

266
00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:00,039
trying to control people and instead we find this way in which we can

267
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:07,880
just love them just love them the way they are

268
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,760
so in this way if we are letting go of this clinging and grasping and

269
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:21,760
controlling which doesn't work in the way that we hope it will or won't doesn't provide the peace and ease that

270
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,279
we're imagining it will there's a way that it can lives

271
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:33,600
provide some spaciousness in our hearts and minds there's this way if we're always

272
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:41,559
chasing trying to fulfill all our desires or all the things that we think that we

273
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:47,279
need if we kind of soften that then there just seems to be more space in the

274
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:53,240
heart and mind and time in the day if we're not always chasing

275
00:29:53,240 --> 00:30:00,080
things with we're letting go there's also provides some clarity with regards to okay well what are desires versus

276
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:07,360
needs sometimes when we go on uh meditation retreats there's like really simple and

277
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,399
the accommodations are really simple and they might be comfortable but really

278
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:20,520
simple or when you travel maybe you just bring a subset of your belongings and there's this way this recognition of the

279
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:27,440
simplicity really highlights oh yeah I don't actually need so much of this stuff that I own i'm doing fine with

280
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:33,840
just this small bit that I brought with me so we start to have maybe with this letting go of stuff we start to have

281
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,039
more and more clarity about okay what is it that we really

282
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:46,799
need there's also this confidence that grows with this letting go because as

283
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:52,600
I've been pointing to there's this sense of

284
00:30:53,120 --> 00:31:00,080
um often the sense of lack or inadequacy or insufficiency is driving this uh

285
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,360
desire for more but if we're letting go of some of the clinging and grasping

286
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,200
which is tied up with desire for more then there starts to be more of a

287
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,120
feeling of okayess there starts to be a feeling of

288
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:24,080
this is sufficient this is adequate somehow we have this idea i

289
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,200
know I certainly did feel like okay well I I'll feel better as soon as I have

290
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,320
this and then you know I managed to get this oh okay well that didn't work okay

291
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:40,240
now I need to have this work hard do something other and then I get this oh yeah okay well that

292
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:46,080
didn't work okay now I need to get this right this is well established this hedonic treadmill is a way to understand

293
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,279
it we just could spend our whole life chasing after the next thing trying to

294
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:55,080
get more more and more

295
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:03,399
so what are some of these ways to support this letting go this letting

296
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:09,559
go one cultivate a feeling of

297
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:16,720
abundance cultivate a feeling of abundance you say "Well that's nice Diana but how do we do that how do you

298
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:24,480
cultivate a feeling of abundance?" Be generous in whatever way feels would be

299
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,720
generous for you your time your expertise resources be generous in some

300
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:37,640
kind of way this is a definitely a way to feel like a sense of abundance

301
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:45,120
if you find yourself that uh you're for example on Amazon shopping

302
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:55,240
for this thing or that thing or something like this just when you uh remember ask yourself do I really need

303
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:00,799
this do I really need this and maybe you put something in the

304
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:06,000
shopping cart and say well I'll come back and buy it maybe another time then

305
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:13,600
chances are when you come which happens for me when I come back if I say oh I don't need that but just ask yourself do I really

306
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,960
need this or when sometimes you have this

307
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:26,159
feeling of like it's not enough I need more whatever this more might be more

308
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:33,000
stuff or more attention more love

309
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,679
everybody has this feeling they could have some more love but when you have this maybe idea

310
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:49,960
about there's not enough you can ask yourself when has it ever been

311
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:57,760
enough when will it be and I'll say for me I was asking this

312
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,840
question that that's the biggest change in my life i had a perfectly respectable

313
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:10,158
job and I felt like my life just wasn't going the direction i don't know i just

314
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:16,720
had I had enough stuff i just didn't feel like my life was going I I don't

315
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:24,280
know i just felt like it's not right but I felt like oh I need more money i need more status i need more

316
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:30,480
security and it wasn't until I realized when will it ever be enough i

317
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:37,919
will always feel like I need more i will always feel like I need more so I'm

318
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:43,200
going to stop working anyway in this particular setting in

319
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:51,118
this particular corporate America setting that turned out to be a huge change in my life that's not appropriate

320
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,960
for everybody my life situation allowed me to do that at that time but it was my

321
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:04,320
asking this question when will it be enough when has it ever been enough what will it take for me to finally feel like

322
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,160
I have enough and was what I doing was I doing

323
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:16,040
was what I was doing going to get me this feeling

324
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,599
so one more thing about this what can help support this letting go this

325
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:31,520
movement of releasing and releasing clinging and grasping is to practice letting go for

326
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,839
short moments many times letting go of this clinging for

327
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:43,920
short moments example of things in the shopping cart but not buying them okay I

328
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,200
just put them there or maybe the example of planting flowers and letting a bunny

329
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:55,880
rabbit come and eat them watch the the little bunny rabbit eat them and then just

330
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:03,440
notice the mind state and just the feeling of this little small little moment of letting go whatever it might

331
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,960
be not the third cookie or not uh watching one more YouTube video or

332
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:15,200
clicking on or one more hour on video games whatever it might be whatever it might be for all of us it's something

333
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,839
different but when you kind of like let go of this just notice how that

334
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:28,160
feels and celebrate it appreciate it this is how it works it's not We

335
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:36,320
can't like browbeat ourselves into letting go we can't uh threaten ourselves with letting go it's all about

336
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:42,240
feeling the delight this little bit of uplift this joy this happiness this

337
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:48,680
happens when there's a letting go that in a way that's helpful not 100% of letting go is

338
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:55,280
helpful we don't want to let go of things that take care of our health or let go of our responsibilities for

339
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,720
others that kind of a thing but notice doing these small bits of letting go and

340
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:10,520
then noticing the uplift in the heart after that happens this is a tremendous support for letting go

341
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,040
but it does take time it takes time to stop like trusting

342
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,280
the like the promise or the allure of objects or unh wholesome activities

343
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:30,920
unhelpful activities they're seductive and it's not easy not easy to let

344
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:37,400
go of always wanting more but and it takes time

345
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:46,480
then maybe I'll just read this poem as a closure

346
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,760
here for the fourth time in four weeks I

347
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,960
slip my spade into the dark soil of the half circle garden

348
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:09,040
i make 20 shallow holes then lift the pansies from crinkly plastic containers

349
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:16,839
and drop the rootbound squares into the earth within hours the small brown bunny

350
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:24,280
arrives with his pink twitchy nose and his small round lump of soft bunny

351
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:30,359
body and while I wash dishes I meet through the window his innocent

352
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:36,000
unblinking gaze as he consumes a dozen deep purple

353
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,040
petals and small efficient tugs he looks at me as if to say "You

354
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:49,520
love me and I do." I crun at the bunny how cute his

355
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:55,640
small ears how perfect his bliss how good he is for eating his pretty bunny

356
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:02,640
food tomorrow the rest of the blooms will be gone in a week the leaves will

357
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:09,960
be gone too every single one and I will go buy more

358
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:16,160
pansies how sweet it's become this path of surrender

359
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:22,839
the strange joy that rises in me when I see my precious pansies nibbled to the

360
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:28,839
roots now that the stakes are low it's much easier to bow to the way things

361
00:39:28,839 --> 00:39:35,280
are for the price of pansies I can practice again and again how to find

362
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:42,000
true delight in this art of letting go thank

363
00:39:44,359 --> 00:39:51,920
you and with that I'll open it up to see if there are some questions or

364
00:39:54,119 --> 00:40:01,560
comments yes I kind of liked that uh this poem had a bunny and it felt like this time of year there are

365
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:08,119
bunnies this morning I saw some baby ducklings made me so happy

366
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:15,839
so if we're in a relationship like it could be even just a boyfriend girlfriend but and it's causing us

367
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:21,839
emotional pain how do you know when the answer isn't letting go of it being a certain way but actually leaving that

368
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,839
relationship

369
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,640
how do you know when it's what was the first what was the first option so if you have like a relationship that is

370
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:40,160
causing you to suffer so you could say well I need to let go of it being a certain way that maybe I wouldn't suffer

371
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:46,880
so much versus maybe I need to leave this relationship yeah so this is part of the art of

372
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:53,280
practice and I would say it's part of the art of living is when there's suffering that leads to more suffering

373
00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:01,800
and there's suffering that leads to less suffering and this is maybe the question you're asking yeah

374
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:10,520
and I think that uh maybe it's helpful to make a distinction between harm and

375
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:17,400
discomfort so if harm is being caused that's not the direction you want to go if there's

376
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:23,119
discomfort anger sadness you know confusion whatever it might be that's

377
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:30,400
but that then it feels like uh it's uh the discomfort can be um you can get to

378
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:36,000
the other side of it and move on versus harm and sometimes people if sometimes

379
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,839
discomfort feels like harm and so the part of is just really to feel into what

380
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:48,280
is the difference and I don't know if this is helpful or not

381
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:57,319
anybody else have a comment or question maybe back here

382
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:09,000
yeah thanks for the talk and for the poem um there was a part of the poem that I've been trying to uh

383
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,319
interpret uh which is like uh there's the part of now that the stakes are low

384
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:22,160
or stakes are lower so I interpreted it as like her realizing

385
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:28,400
um her recognizing this situation with the bunny and saying "Oh the the stakes are

386
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,599
low." um you know because I'm surrendering or

387
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,960
whatever she's actively making this situation low or another way is she's

388
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,160
also um recognizing this as one of the many situations in life where like the

389
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,520
stakes are low indeed um so I've been trying to like riff with that and think

390
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:56,480
about like is the idea that you want to pick out situations where you know the stakes for sure are low or just every

391
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:03,280
situation find a way to like make the stakes low by you know surrendering

392
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,880
regardless of how high you think the stakes are but I thought that was an interesting line so I'm sure there's

393
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:15,359
different ways to interpret it but yeah that's fantastic i love what you're bringing up i think we can do both we

394
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:23,599
can let go of the things where it's easy or we can let go of the idea our our ideas around things so that

395
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:29,920
let that for example the idea that something will be a lasting source of happiness and uh then that makes the if

396
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,480
we realize it's not going to be then the stakes become lower

397
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:42,359
this is an interesting line now that the stakes are low and it's also right the title of the poem when the stakes are

398
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:47,520
low i was interpreting it um as something that was happening in her

399
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:53,200
personal life that uh I was assuming that there was something when the stakes were high

400
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,800
that that's implied in the poem that we don't know what they are but I I like

401
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:05,040
your interpretation a little bit better yeah yeah we got to recognize the bunny

402
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:13,040
and there's other bigger things happening maybe yeah yeah or maybe it's because the the first

403
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:19,440
line is for the fourth time in four weeks so she realizes oh this is what's

404
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:25,680
going to happen but maybe earlier maybe the first time it happened the stakes were higher because she was upset and

405
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,359
actually expected to have pansies in her garden or something like this i don't

406
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,838
know

407
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:45,200
okay well thank you all for your kind attention and it's time to let go of the

408
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:53,200
time in which we're having a dharma talk and uh I wish you all wonderful rest of the evening and safe travels home thank

409
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,200
you
