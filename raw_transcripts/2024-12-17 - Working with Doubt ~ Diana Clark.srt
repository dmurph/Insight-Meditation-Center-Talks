1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:05,600
good evening welcome welcome and you know what Jim I I said

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,000
that we might have to turn the volume up I had to I moved the microphone a little bit can we just increase the volume just

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,839
a tiny bit I have to talk so we can thank you thank you there we

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:27,420
go hope you guys are all doing well with the rain mixed feelings about the

5
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,160
[Laughter] rain we I we need it I appreciate it but you

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:39,280
know discovered that blue skies are kind of nice too but

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,360
nevertheless so I want to start with this poem that is written by somebody

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,640
who read some of the poems of the terata and the terata some of you might

9
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,760
know is the oldest literature attributed to women in the

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,760
history of the humans so this literature that's written by women attributed to

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,320
women and we partly we know it's written by women because it has a lot of feminine aspects it talks a lot about

12
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,320
motherhood and husbands and you know stuff like this thousands of years

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:24,520
old it's in the Buddhist Cannon and uh there's a poet who read

14
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:32,240
some of these poems I should say this literature is poems they are Awakening poems it's the like poems that uh it's

15
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,000
part of the tradition that after you have an Awakening experience or sometime you would have a little poem to describe

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,079
it so I'm not going to talk about the Awakening poems precisely maybe I will

17
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,799
on another night and they have been spoken about a number of times here at IMC if you're interested you can find

18
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:57,320
them on aiio Dara but a poet who read these poems and

19
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,880
wrote his own poem inspired by what he had written these Awakening

20
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:11,160
poems so the uh the title of the poems are about the woman the woman's name and

21
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,440
this so this one the woman's name is Vaya we can translate that as Victor you

22
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,480
know somebody who like wins you know has Victory something like

23
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:30,160
that and uh these poems are written in a um contemporary style and in a way that

24
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:36,680
you know a modern practitioner could relate to them unlike the ones that are thousands of years ago sometimes they're

25
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,760
a little bit uh you know they're they read like they're thousands of years

26
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:49,760
old okay so uh this is vayia and the poet is Maddie

27
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:57,040
weest and the poem goes like this when everyone else was

28
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,560
meditating I'd be outside circling the

29
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,360
hall finally I went to confess I'm

30
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:16,360
hopeless I said the Elder none smiled just keep

31
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:22,440
going she said nothing stays in orbit

32
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:30,599
forever if this circling is all you have why not make this circling your home

33
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:39,519
I did as she told me and went on circling the hall if you find yourself partly in and

34
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:47,519
partly out if you find yourself drawn to this path and also drawing

35
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,959
away I can assure you you're in good company just keep

36
00:03:53,959 --> 00:04:00,959
going sometimes the most direct path isn't a straight line

37
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:09,280
I'll read this again I I kind I like this poem very much just there's so much in here and um

38
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,599
I'll unpack it a little bit but when everyone else was

39
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:22,520
meditating I'd be outside circling the hall finally I went to

40
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,720
confess I'm hopeless I said the Elder none

41
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:36,280
smiled just keep going she said nothing stays in orbit

42
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:43,479
forever if this circling is all you have why not make this circling your

43
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:49,520
home I did as she told me and went on circling the

44
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:56,960
hall if you find yourself partly in and partly out if you find yourself drawn to

45
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:04,720
this path and also drawing away I can assure you you're in good

46
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,240
company just keep going sometimes the most direct path

47
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,080
isn't a straight line so this is describing a

48
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:23,039
practitioner somebody who had this hesitation about the practice and U some

49
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,240
she was convinced that she was hopeless and that she had to do

50
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,960
something different like okay I'm just circling outside I need to do something

51
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:42,360
else and but something that's beautiful about this uh poem and about this practice is this practice isn't asking

52
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:48,000
us to be somebody that we're not we don't have to like completely reinvent

53
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,440
ourselves and if you find yourself circling circling the hole circling the

54
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,199
practice or maybe sometimes for me I feel circling is like well this like uh

55
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:07,319
vassel olation or hesitation or just kind of like feeling a feeling of stuckness just going around and

56
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:14,080
around so the teacher gives her this instruction well just keep

57
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:20,639
circling nothing stays in orbit forever because I think what the teacher

58
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,800
is pointing to here is so often when we have this feeling like I'm

59
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,720
hopeless then we just abandon the practice and go do something else we just stop if we feel like okay I

60
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,759
maybe other people can do this I can't do this there's this way in which

61
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:44,560
sometimes we have this feeling like you know what this I I can't do it I don't even know what they're talking about what's being pointed to maybe I used to

62
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:52,280
be able to meditate but now I don't or maybe like everybody else seems to know how to meditate in the whole and but I'm

63
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:59,120
not I can't or whatever it might be we might have some of these ideas about how

64
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:06,120
it should be and we have we're noticing how our experience is and it's not matching up the ideas of how we think it

65
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:13,039
should be and then then that gets expanded to just because my experience

66
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:21,560
doesn't match my expectations it means somehow that I'm failing I'm hopeless she says in here

67
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:27,479
this and all of really that's happening is you had expectations and you're having experiences and they don't match

68
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:34,879
that's all that's happening but we've really just turned it into a big thing this commentary about our worthiness as

69
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:43,039
practitioners or maybe even goes beyond to um our the practice as a whole or

70
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,240
something like this or some other ideas that we might

71
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,280
have for me I feel a little bit um

72
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:00,800
sensitive to this idea that in this poem it says finally I went to confess this word confess I feel like it doesn't feel

73
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:07,800
like such a good word instead maybe it could be like I just went to talk to somebody about it or I mentioned this to

74
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,240
somebody or you know I shared it with myself instead of hiding it in shame

75
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:18,800
like oh I'm actually really a terrible meditator everybody else is okay but I

76
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,199
have this shameful feeling about a way that I am that's not what we want the

77
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,879
truth is meditation is not always easy it takes practice

78
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:36,919
sometimes if we had a really busy day and our minds are really busy or if we have some emotional stuff that is coming

79
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,279
up and our life is filled with emotional stuff that comes up this is what it means to be a

80
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:50,160
human then you know maybe our our mind just doesn't settle and can that be okay instead of

81
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,480
making these Grand uh conclusions I'm

82
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,800
hopeless so there's something else that I'd like to talk to that this poem is pointing to in one interpretation

83
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:09,000
there's lots of interpretations we could do here there's I don't want to say there's only one but here's one this

84
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:16,880
whole idea of circling and this feeling like I'm not going anywhere I'm just going around and

85
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,440
around points to this hindrance of Doubt skeptical doubt some of you might be

86
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:29,600
familiar with this idea that uh there's these five classical

87
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,880
things that get in the way of meditation things that are like barriers or

88
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:43,240
obstacles or hindrances hindrances to getting settled hindrances to feeling

89
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,720
connected to ourselves hindrances to feeling connected to other people and to our

90
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,920
life and one of these five is doubt and this is something that uh for

91
00:09:54,920 --> 00:10:04,320
me I take comfort in thousands of years ago they were talking about this humans had troubles meditating back then too so

92
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:11,160
D is one of them I'll just mention the other ones I'm not going to talk about them desire this really wanting

93
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:18,959
something and I Noti I do this with my body because it kind of feels like this like we're leaning forward I got to get something other is aversion like oh get

94
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,440
this away from me I don't want it the third uh third is restlessness

95
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:32,399
this just feeling like just Twitchy and you want to jump out of your skin kind of feeling the fourth is sloth and

96
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:39,880
torper which is just this real tiredness like falling asleep sometimes literally falling asleep and the fifth one is

97
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:46,000
doubt so I want to talk a little bit about doubt and uh how to work with it

98
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,680
and I would say of these five hindrances doubt is the one that has the biggest

99
00:10:52,680 --> 00:11:00,040
impact on us and it's the one that gets maybe seen is the most difficult to see

100
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:06,560
and can't have um as I said maybe earlier just give us to abandon this

101
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:13,720
whole idea of practicing so there's this idea

102
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,600
of Doubt is there's a number of ways we can talk about it and one is this

103
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,560
feeling like I can't do it like it seems like

104
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:33,200
other people can or the teacher talks about it or the drama book talks about it or I heard my friends talk about this

105
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,880
and but I don't know I I just just I don't know what they're talking about because it doesn't match what experience

106
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:45,040
I'm having or something like this so it's not

107
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:52,800
uncommon for I would say in the modern West and for this phenomenon to rise and

108
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,760
in particular we can see it in something like this with meditation and that is

109
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:04,600
the in inner critic gets activated this this inner critic this

110
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:13,240
feeling like whatever I'm doing is not quite right it's not enough or it's not

111
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:18,839
good enough or it's somehow is inadequate and then that kind of like

112
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:24,639
bleeds into I'm inadequate and I can't do

113
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:32,040
it and right in here in the poem she's saying I'm hopeless there's this little voice that's like

114
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,440
and it's we believe it right it's not only that it's a little voice that's showing up that somehow we think it's

115
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,600
the truth it's not the truth I'm telling you it's not the truth but doesn't

116
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:49,440
matter what I say you have to have this own experience just hearing me say that is not going to be necessarily helpful

117
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,880
but there's this way in which we uh we can undermine our capacity or our

118
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:04,000
capability or our what we're able to do our ideas about ourselves by this uh

119
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,120
voice that shows up we might call it some people call like a subpersonality

120
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:17,120
maybe like this a companion that shows up on occasion saying you'll never make

121
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,560
it this terrible uh voice and that we

122
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:31,440
believe so I'll just I've um done a number of talks on the inner critic it occurs to me I haven't done one maybe

123
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:39,000
two recently so maybe that's I should put as an idea to do one but um there's

124
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:46,120
this way in which this uh has like a harsh tone this

125
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,880
voice that's telling us that uh we were not doing it right and whatever our

126
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:58,320
experience is it's not the right experience and then I'll just say

127
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:05,759
briefly here if you find that you're like swimming in this inner critic that's really like putting you

128
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:12,839
down I me one thing you could if you can remember this is to just ask how am I

129
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:18,040
right now because we don't need to be critical of the critic right that just

130
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,800
perpetuates it we don't we don't have to try to get rid of it we don't have to make it wrong we don't have to turn it

131
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:31,279
into a problem to get solved instead just ask yourself how am I right now how

132
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:37,160
am I right now and that kind of like turns into your experience at this

133
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:44,199
moment and that's this movement towards how you're feeling that could be like your bodily

134
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:50,560
experience or your emotional experience that movement that orientation towards asking that question

135
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,639
how am I right now is a way that uh is more like a movement of care it's a

136
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:05,120
movement of some wisdom too and that really can undermine the inner critic so

137
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,639
I can uh like I said I can give a whole talk on this but that's a short version

138
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,759
this feeling of like oh I can't do it and just like well how am I right now

139
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:23,360
you might say well actually I'm agitated and then you could say well how does that feel in the body agitation feels

140
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:30,079
like restlessness like my legs want to move for example like I want to get up and do something or I want to distract

141
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:37,079
myself and and then as best you can can you then feel the distractedness and then here you are

142
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:43,319
right in the middle of practice this is what practice is it's just being present for our experience even if that

143
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:48,240
experience is not what we want even if it's

144
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:55,160
unpleasant so doubt can have this show up as this experience of the inner

145
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:02,680
critic putting ourselves down it can also Al uh show up as doubt in the

146
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:09,440
teachings like well I don't know those Buddhists they seem like they are

147
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:16,160
austere or they don't seem like they have enough fun or they're just sitting quiet what good is that I don't know we

148
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:23,199
can have all these stories about uh just this practice and it's uh whether it's going

149
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:31,839
to support us and help us have a life that we want a life that has more joy and freedom and peace and

150
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,480
ease or of course we can start to have a doubt about the

151
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:43,279
teachings uh maybe the practices the teachings and the teachers like does she

152
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,959
really know what she's talking about this is a legitimate question right I think if somebody's going to sit up here

153
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:55,079
you're allowed to wonder well I don't know what does she know what she's talking about does anybody know what

154
00:16:55,079 --> 00:17:00,360
they're talking about you know those Dharma books and whatever the Dharma talks that you hear so doubt shows up in

155
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,558
these different ways oneself the teachings the practice the teachers and

156
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:14,079
one kind of like way that you can know it's doubt is there's this feeling of like this hesitation or vacillation or

157
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:20,720
I'm doing this with my hands going around and around in circles because there's this uh way in which we feel

158
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,079
like we're not really going anywhere we're just feeling kind of stuck and we're just

159
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:32,240
maybe moving around with a trying to like in Lost in our thoughts

160
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,440
and figure things out and thinking about them and and one of the consequence of

161
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,600
this of this well I don't know is should I do this is this the right practice or

162
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:50,600
maybe it shows up in some particular way when you're um sitting down for meditation you like oh gee yeah I'm kind

163
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:57,480
of agitated may maybe I'll um just count my breaths to really get uh settled and

164
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,760
then you realize oh gee I can only get to number two well maybe I'll do some loving kindness practice and then you do

165
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:11,400
loving kindness for a few minutes and then you think okay well I don't want to do Ling kindness I'm just going to open it up and do open awareness and oh that

166
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,760
sound oh that dog I can't believe that dog is barking again I'm going to write a nasty note to the neighbor maybe I'll

167
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:24,360
go do that now no I'm not going to okay I'm going to go back to meta practice so we spend our whole time really just going from one practice to another to

168
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:31,280
another to another and never really settle down so that could be a way in which this doubt shows up too is like

169
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:38,840
not really knowing which practice to do and instead we're just doing trying to put out uh perceived

170
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:46,400
fires so doubt is I would say it's rarely recognized as doubt initially

171
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:54,720
it's just seen as agitation or some kind of way or this uh or maybe agitation or

172
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,520
hesitation maybe there's a holding back or

173
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:06,200
a way in which we're not really engaged with what's happening this is one of the

174
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:11,559
consequences of Doubt is we're no longer really present with what's happening

175
00:19:11,559 --> 00:19:17,720
instead we're lost in thoughts in fact we could say that doubt is a loose

176
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:24,240
collection of a family of thoughts that they're not onward leading instead

177
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:31,360
they're just uh we're just kind of like stuck when going round and

178
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:40,440
round so here how can we work with it how can we work with doubt whatever kind of doubt that it is one if you can

179
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:45,880
recognize what's happening just like oh I'm I'm uh kind

180
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:53,520
of feeling stuck here I'm or hesitant or vacillating or something like

181
00:19:53,520 --> 00:20:03,440
this maybe there's this feeling of going in circles or hesitation or maybe there's some confusion or or maybe

182
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:11,440
there's a way in which doubt can get activated as a consequence of maybe just

183
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,720
touching into something that's uncomfortable like maybe there's just a

184
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,840
tiny bit of like a little bit of loneliness sadness

185
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:30,280
Despair and then this a lot of anger rather than feeling the despair loneliness will jump over into doubt

186
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:38,400
it's like oh this practice I'm not sure what to do and it turns out often we use this type of Doubt to distract us from

187
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,520
something else that's really uncomfortable this is what humans do

188
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,200
right we don't like to feel uncomfortable so we avoid and part of the avoidance is distraction right we

189
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:56,039
have Untold ways to distract ourselves and then when we distract ourselves with doubt we start to feel like no I'm doing

190
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:02,880
important spiritual work here when in fact we're just just going around and around in circles and not being with uh

191
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,400
whatever is uncomfortable so one thing to do is just

192
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:14,320
recognize what's happening recognize either the velation or recognize oh yeah

193
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:22,159
there is that flicker of something that I really don't want to see or experience you can be just recognize

194
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:28,840
either whichever is uh available to you at that moment chances are it'll be most likely the doubt if you don't want to

195
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:37,520
feel this difficult uncomfortable experience that's happening and then can you just allow it

196
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:44,159
to be there can you just allow it to be there I'm talking about this vacillation

197
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:51,000
that's happening what if we don't make it be a problem I'm talking it as a hindrance

198
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:59,039
but what if we just say oh yeah there's this feeling like I'm don't really know

199
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:07,120
what to do I'm not even sure if I can practice and just allow it to be there

200
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:14,279
and how we can allow it to be there is to feel it in the body feel it in the body all these types

201
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:19,919
of thoughts they have sematic signatures they have a physical correlates they may

202
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:26,400
be subtle they may be obvious there this way that can we get out of the abstract

203
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:32,080
thinking and philosophizing and trying to figure something out and instead just

204
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:39,240
feel it in the body feel the maybe it's restlessness or

205
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:46,159
uncomfortableness or this sense of not really knowing I noticed like I'm like foring my brow like I'm not sure what to

206
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,880
do maybe we feel there's some tension in the face maybe we feel like that um

207
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:59,000
often there can be tightness in the mouth or the jaw that we can be doing when we're like

208
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:05,200
trying to figure something out or make it be a little bit different or maybe

209
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:11,039
there's a sense of heaviness maybe like the shoulders feel kind of heavy and we feel like

210
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:19,120
H really am I going to do this you know there's or something like this to allow

211
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:26,360
it to be there and one way we can do that is to feel it in the body maybe there's a jitteriness this restlessness

212
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:32,320
really wanting something different to happen this feeling like oh I I want to get up off the

213
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:40,919
cushion and if you feel like I I can't I'm not quite sure what you're talking about or I just can't be with the bodily

214
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:46,720
experience there's a reason why I'm in the head is because I don't want to be with my bodily

215
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:52,159
experience then we can say well is there a way that you can relax the

216
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,240
body just notice the way that you're sitting maybe your shoulders are up near

217
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:04,360
your ears or is there a way that you can relax the body and then maybe take a big

218
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,480
inhale and then with the exhale there's a way maybe just follow the breath into

219
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:16,480
the bodily experience and just feel the breath and

220
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:24,840
you'll feel like maybe the shoulders the chest and the belly and it turns out this is where

221
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:30,520
most of our emotions or our experiences you know in the Torso and the face in

222
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:37,360
the front of the body the face throat chest belly and often that's where the

223
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:44,880
breath is too so if we're feeling really disconnected and we can't feel the sensations in the body you just take a

224
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,159
breath and follow the breath into the body and that can be a way that can help

225
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:55,360
uh bring the awareness into the bodily

226
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:02,000
experience so it doesn't matter this bodily experience where it is it doesn't

227
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,200
matter what it is it doesn't matter why it's there it doesn't matter whether it's a

228
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:14,399
identifiable emotion or something like that but instead it's this movement

229
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:20,000
towards actually just being with our experience whatever that experience is

230
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,760
and this is the practice and then the second thing to do

231
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:34,760
I'm saying just to allow it to be there so first to feel it in the body and then the second is to remind yourself or that

232
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:42,799
thoughts are just thoughts they're just thoughts how many thoughts a day do we

233
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:49,960
have how many of them do we remember how many of them just arise and uh they just

234
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,320
pass away I heard uh written uh in a

235
00:25:55,320 --> 00:26:02,159
book uh this I think the book was published some time ago and I just stumbled upon this and it was uh

236
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,880
somebody talking about uh they were like doing their all their thoughts out loud

237
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,600
were on paper it was hilarious because they were uh driving and they were

238
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:20,600
trying to decide you know what to have for dinner and they were like should I have this I don't know do I like that

239
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:27,000
and I don't know the last time I had it was terrible and then you would hear them say get out of the way buddy where

240
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,399
didd you learn how to drive you know and then it was just funny to look at we

241
00:26:32,399 --> 00:26:40,679
think that we have like clear thoughts but we have so many thoughts about all kinds of stuff all the time so working

242
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:47,000
with doubt allowing them to be there feel them in the body and remind ourselves

243
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:55,360
thoughts are just thoughts we don't have to believe them they're insubstantial of course

244
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:03,559
they are like what are they they there's there're don't have any inherent existence and they're not uh

245
00:27:03,559 --> 00:27:09,520
something that we can uh grab onto and hold or something like

246
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:15,039
this but some of the thoughts that we have we might not be recognizing them as

247
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:21,240
thoughts there might be some of these subtle thoughts of like it shouldn't be this

248
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:29,600
way it should be different that's just a thought or why is this happening to me

249
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:37,000
that's just a thought can we can just let him go or or I don't deserve this

250
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:43,960
you know maybe we have this idea that it should be better because uh we've been meditating for so long or because of

251
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:50,760
whatever reason we feel like we should have better experiences or maybe like I can't handle

252
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:58,840
this maybe we're bored we feel like oh we can't handle boredom or maybe we're feeling restless and something like this

253
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:04,039
these are just thoughts you'll have other thoughts you know the next moment

254
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:11,399
maybe some of them get stuck on repeat for a little bit but there's just there'll be other thoughts or maybe if

255
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:19,640
not those thoughts that I said maybe there would be um the maybe they're like these thoughts

256
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:26,640
from a childhood when you've had some difficulty and maybe there's a flash of something that feels like oh yeah I've

257
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:33,240
had this thought my whole life that doesn't make it more substantial it

258
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:40,519
makes it more familiar but we want to give it Authority we don't have to give it

259
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:48,320
Authority there's a way in which you know we can tend to get identified with our thoughts but we don't need to be

260
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,399
there's this way in which thoughts can actually uh be a type of a prison a type

261
00:28:53,399 --> 00:29:00,640
of a way in which they really trap us into a certain identity about who we are

262
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:07,720
or who the world is and how things should be I'm not saying we shouldn't have those thoughts but not allow them

263
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:15,320
to uh get stuck to get stuck there just to arise that all allow them to arise

264
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,640
and then pass away and then as soon as you recognize

265
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,960
that they are thoughts then there's an opportunity to turn back against to the physical experience you might be having

266
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:32,080
a similar physical experience that you had before maybe something

267
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:38,399
different and so this way of like undermining the authority of the

268
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:45,120
thoughts by turning towards your physical experience interrupting the momentum of

269
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,960
thinking chances are you will not want to do this chances are there will be

270
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,120
some resistance to go towards the bodily experience instead there might be these

271
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:03,279
types of thoughts of like oh I I have to figure this out I have to think about it in some

272
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:08,919
kind of way to make it better or I have to solve this problem this is often this

273
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:16,480
thought is often not so clearly articulated this way but it's a belief it's a view that we have that's fueling

274
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,720
these types of thoughts or maybe we have this thought like I have to find a way to make this stop and we think we're

275
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,320
going to be able to think our way into having different thoughts but it doesn't

276
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:36,679
work that way instead just be with the physical

277
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:42,440
experience the thoughts won't stop right away but they'll just start running out

278
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:48,120
of momentum they'll just start running out of authority they'll just start

279
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:55,600
becoming less interesting and instead we can just be with our bodily

280
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:04,720
experience and then once you're with those bodily experience nothing needs to be

281
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:11,159
done nothing needs to be done chances are there'll be resistance to this idea

282
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:16,799
also because we have to figure it out we want to make something happen and but

283
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:22,679
this whole idea of like no just be with what's

284
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:29,600
happening maybe it's a lump in the throat because you I don't even know why

285
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:37,200
because for me sometimes when I'm like tuning into the bodily experience I often have a some tightness in the

286
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,080
throat this or sometimes I mentioned earlier the heaviness in the shoulders

287
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:51,279
or the shoulders are up near the ears or there's a sense of heaviness and can we just bring some

288
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:58,679
kindhearted curiosity to that experience and then here we are are in

289
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:06,960
the heart of practice in the heart of practice we're just being with our

290
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,080
experience without um having to like gone is this feeling like okay I have to

291
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:20,440
fix it instead it's like oh it's like this right now there's a lump in the

292
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:25,799
throat and now there's a this feeling of

293
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:32,559
tightness in the shoulders and pressure against the body where I'm sitting and know just being with the

294
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:38,080
felt experience so working with doubt and I

295
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,720
would say such a big part about practice whether it's about doubt or anything else is just really learning to

296
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,960
distinguish between thoughts and physical

297
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:57,279
Sensations so often we're lost in thought and disconnected from our bodies disconnected from our physical

298
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:05,919
experience but just dropping into Sensations is always valuable always

299
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:11,880
valuable because that's what's happening that's actually the truth of the

300
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:18,519
moment and then as we learn to drop into our physical Sensations and tune into

301
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:24,399
the truth of the moment there's this way that the thinking will just naturally

302
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:31,600
start to quiet down it'll just happen naturally and then there can be a way in

303
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:40,080
which there's maybe this feeling of the senses being cleansed in some kind of way like

304
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:46,399
we can hear a little bit more clearly see a little bit more clearly feel a

305
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:53,639
little bit more clearly when the thinking starts to quiet down then the experiences of the

306
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:59,799
senses become more clear and then we can start to see

307
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:05,840
things as they are not so much what we're projecting onto them the sense of

308
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:11,679
whether I like it or I don't like it whether this is mine or not or whether this is going to help me or not or all

309
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:18,200
these subtle things that we're projecting onto all the objects out there including

310
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:24,800
people as the quiet as we start to pay attention to the body the thinking

311
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:32,320
quiets down there's a brightness that comes to our experience start to see things closer to

312
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:39,638
how they are and we start to notice Beauty in a way that wasn't possible

313
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:45,040
before when we're just busy with what's happening kind like some of the radiance

314
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,200
of the beauty of just ordinary things starts to

315
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:58,040
arise and we start to see oh yeah things are changing that sound arose of the born

316
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:03,560
and now it's gone I that sensation of the pressure

317
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:09,079
against the body that wasn't I'm was didn't notice it and now I notice it

318
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:14,760
again then as we start to notice things are changing then there's no longer a

319
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:20,160
feeling of stuckness but not only that there's a

320
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:27,800
feeling of oh I I kind of feel like myself as this

321
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:33,359
stable consistent thing that's constant but then we just start

322
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:40,240
to notice oh yeah there's just all these experiences happening and that starts to loosen up

323
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,920
this idea of a fixed self to which all experience is happening and when that

324
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:53,920
happens there starts to be much more freedom much more ease and freedom so in this way having

325
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,160
doubt this feeling of like I don't know can be really The Way

326
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:06,319
Forward just this way of like well can we recognize that it's happening and

327
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:12,720
just allow it to be there allow it to be the physical

328
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,079
Sensations and to notice some of the thoughts that are there and remember

329
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:24,040
that okay thoughts are just thoughts we don't have to ascribe a truth to them we

330
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:30,119
don't have to ascribe nontruth to them can we just let them do what thoughts do they just come and go come and go come

331
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:37,680
and go we'll want to grab on to them as best you can can you be with

332
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,839
your bodily experience instead and then you're right in there with

333
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:49,560
practice starting to see things as they really are not without all the stories

334
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:57,000
without all the I'll just use that word stories we start to see the beauty we start to see

335
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:02,119
how things are changing and this is practice and this is where we find

336
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:09,800
Freedom this is where we find Freedom and so I talked I said about how

337
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,839
this poem v v not exactly sure how to

338
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:22,040
pronounce it is um that Maddie weast wrote was inspired

339
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:28,520
by these Awakening poems from these nuns these women and in the original

340
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:35,560
Awakening poem that inspired mad West here she does become awakened the poem

341
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:41,599
ends with her becoming awakened it starts with in general with

342
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:49,240
her having difficulties in going to a nun and the nun giving her instructions and then she becomes awakened in M Wanga

343
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,880
poem we don't see the Awakening but uh for me I feel touched that uh in the

344
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,760
original poem that's there so here's Med one guasp

345
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:07,240
again when everyone else was meditating I'd be outside circling the

346
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:15,560
hall finally I went to confess I am hopeless I said the Elder

347
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:22,920
nun smiled just keep going she said nothing stays in orbit

348
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:29,079
forever if this circling is all you have why not make this circling your

349
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:37,119
home I did as she told me and went on circling the hall if you find yourself partly in and

350
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:43,960
partly out if you find yourself drawn to this path and also drawing away I can

351
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:51,920
assure you you're in good company just keep going sometimes the most direct path

352
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,880
isn't a straight line and I'll stop there there and open

353
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,520
it up to see if there's some questions or comments thank

354
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,800
you this idea of

355
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:25,040
circling and doubt and turning what can be a hindrance into the way that leads to

356
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:32,000
Freedom peace Awakening that's the importance of paying

357
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,560
attention to our bodily experience even though that's often what we don't want to do and certainly we have a culture

358
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:47,440
that uh like fetishizes the body and and but the mind is uh you know held up in

359
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:53,040
high highly of course it is right it helps solve problems create beautiful

360
00:39:53,040 --> 00:40:01,720
things I mean the mind is a beautiful thing but there's this way we can get trapped thinking that it's the only way

361
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,640
forward

362
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:20,079
yes all right uh is it on yeah um I guess my doubt mostly shows up

363
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:26,839
in the form of um feeling that maybe other people can have these experiences

364
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:32,880
that I've heard of but uh I don't seem to be able to get there kind of thing

365
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:40,680
that um or that maybe people are having having these experiences

366
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:48,240
because they somehow believe in in these experiences and and

367
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:54,119
uh um and maybe I'm I'm just not capable of

368
00:40:54,119 --> 00:41:00,599
of doing that of that that kind of belief you know you hear of these things of meditative states of you know deep

369
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:07,960
calm and and that kind of thing and uh yeah I guess I guess my doubt is

370
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:13,960
more along the lines of not believing that I can achieve what other people can

371
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:19,920
achieve um I wonder if you can speak to that well I'll say a few things about

372
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:26,480
some of these meditative states that um it just seems and I've I talked to a number of Dharma teachers about this and

373
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:31,560
certainly in my role as a Dharma teacher I've seen this too that some people have

374
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,680
uh little bit their minds work in such a way that they can get settled a little

375
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:42,520
bit easier and some people they can't and often this has to do not always but

376
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,839
sometimes like with how we spend our time if you're like uh an office manager

377
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:52,920
or a preschool teacher or running a household with a lot of things happening

378
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:59,920
then you're having to take care of this and so many things all at once and your mind is really good at going like this to one thing to the next thing as

379
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,000
opposed to if you're a mathematician or a theoretical physicist who sits and

380
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,960
thinks and focuses so just you know how we've trained our brains with our livelihoods

381
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:17,480
or how our families are has shows up and the Beautiful part is that we don't have

382
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,839
to have particular meditative States we don't have to have them for the for

383
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:29,960
certainly for the uh first stage of Awakening you don't it's you don't have to have you know some of these really

384
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:35,960
concentrated States so I'll just say that some people's minds you know just

385
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:41,000
have different uh capacities whether they're born that way I have no idea but

386
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,200
it can be um just how they spend their

387
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:52,839
time and then the second is I'll just say this for myself that uh my

388
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:58,280
meditation really took a shift uh where I could settle more when two things

389
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:04,359
happened one Retreat practice but it wasn't Retreat practice alone it had to

390
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:09,960
be Retreat practice that included walking meditation there was I I thought

391
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:17,319
like walking meditation that's recess you know I don't know that's just a break but it was something when I

392
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:22,680
started to really uh be attentive to

393
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:28,000
walking meditation and kind like being really embodied that way I don't know

394
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,839
then it really carried over into my sitting practice and and allowed me to

395
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:38,880
be more embodied for the sitting practice um concentration turns out to

396
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,359
be a lot about uh being embodied and not only that it allows a person to like to

397
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:51,079
do a Sit walk sit right or or you know all day long with uh some mindfulness I

398
00:43:51,079 --> 00:43:58,920
don't know is is this helpful uh some of these things yes thank you you're welcome

399
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:07,318
yeah so maybe we'll end with the here

400
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:16,160
s thanks for the talk I think it um gave me a lot to think about um I think at some point you had

401
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:22,280
mentioned um between thoughts and emotions they have something called like

402
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:29,599
somatic signature or something that phrase um is it do you find it or I'm trying to

403
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:36,280
think about it as like um an object to meditate on like trying

404
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:41,480
to um whether it's a emotion a feeling like

405
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:47,319
how is it interacting with my body during a meditation I wonder if like that's

406
00:44:47,319 --> 00:44:53,480
helpful being able to like parse out these sematic signatures or is the idea

407
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:59,599
that you know even that's kind of too far we should just feel our body and not

408
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:05,040
not try and name these and map the signatures but I was trying to

409
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:13,040
understand how to I guess meditate on that but yeah yeah this is a great question thank you I would say uh it

410
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,720
doesn't have to be so complicated I would just feel what there is to feel and we don't necessarily have to use

411
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:25,800
words because sometimes if we use words and trying to when I say sematic signature maybe that or map it to that

412
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:33,520
does feel like a cogni activity so maybe that's I should use different language but it's just like just feel and maybe

413
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:42,200
you don't have exact words sometimes I know in the beginning I used words to kind of help me stay there like feels

414
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:47,280
tight contracted feels uh congealed you know

415
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:54,000
just to help me stay there but as I got more accustomed to just hanging out with

416
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,200
Sensations than the words kind of uh kind of went away but uh in the

417
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:05,640
beginning sometimes it's useful to use adjectives or yeah Des

418
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:12,000
scriptures as opposed as just a way to kind of like help the Mind

419
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:18,480
stay is that helpful very helpful thank you you're welcome you're

420
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:24,000
welcome okay so thank you all for your kind attention and I wish you all a

421
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,200
wonderful evening thank you
