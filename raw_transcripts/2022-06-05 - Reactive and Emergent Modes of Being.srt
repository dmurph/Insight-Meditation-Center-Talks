1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,160
so good morning to all of you here at imc and

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:14,240
warm greetings to those of you who are participating online youtube

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,758
it's nice that uh

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:27,199
nice that the people online are part of this community and that kind of the sense of who we are practicing together

5
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:33,920
meditating inclusive of such a bigger circle of people than it used to be when we just it was just the

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,760
people here so thank you

7
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,440
so um

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,840
one of the very interesting and important topics for people who do this practice

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,800
is to consider what the source is within you for what animates you

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,520
or to say it maybe in simpler terms where's the where what are the motivations what is

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:15,759
the sensibilities from which you act in the world you live your life

12
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,280
sometimes i like the idea of where do you take up residence

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,280
where do you where do you live what's the reference point

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,439
for your values for how you speak for how you live your life

15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:41,520
and in buddhism one of the powerful words we have is dharma

16
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,880
and one of the reasons one of the nice things about the word dharma is that it's a word which is not limited to

17
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:56,640
buddhism oh kind of all the indians as far as i know almost all indian religions

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,000
and the indian culture has this very strong reference to this term dharma which

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,280
is not it's not limited to just the buddhist dharma so it's a and i think in india

20
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,040
i wouldn't be surprised if the word dharma encompasses the kind of some of the

21
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:22,480
overlaps or some of the span of what the english word spiritual might be where spiritual isn't limited to just

22
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,760
buddhism or christianity or something but spiritual has some is something that people in different

23
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:35,200
religions all can kind of kind of find some commonality or some residency

24
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,120
and um so to take up residence in the dharma or

25
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,879
have the dharma be the source of what animates us or this reference point for how we live our

26
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:53,200
lives uh is uh it involves a paradigm shift a very

27
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:00,480
radical reorientation of our life from where we usually live

28
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,319
and where do we usually live and i don't want to speak for any of you per se

29
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:12,000
but uh but some of the common places people live is some people live in their

30
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,840
fear their anxiety and fear is kind of the place where they have kind of taken up

31
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,760
residency though they never assume that they've chosen that residency but

32
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,560
in fact the so so much of who they are that it animates them it directs their thinking their speech how

33
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,159
they behave in the world for some people it's their desires

34
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:42,400
and their desires what they want is so important it's kind of like that's where they that's the reference

35
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,239
point the orientation for everything is their desires other people their reference point their

36
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,519
residency is uh their aversion

37
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,560
what they don't want other people it's their confusion

38
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,000
their uncertainty they're kind of grasping trying to figure out what's what in the world is going on here in this world and

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,560
what am i supposed to do and somehow that that's the center of gravity

40
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,720
for some people it's uh conceit some strong sense of

41
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:24,639
this is who i am some role quality a characteristic

42
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,560
something and the part of the difficulty with conceit is that it's often

43
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:38,000
animated by some of these other qualities fear desire aversion and confusion

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,520
and that's what makes conceits sometimes problematic when these others come in and make it much more complicated than

45
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,440
it needs to be and all these ways of being taking up residence

46
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,360
are limited residences they involve a kind of

47
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,240
but everyone's going to have a different way of feeling the difficulty of them or the shortcomings

48
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,680
of them i like very much the language of constriction they're all constricting

49
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,639
they limit how much we you know we're constricted by it or limited by it

50
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:21,759
and one way where they're constricted and limited is that it constricts the the range the span

51
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:28,720
of what we take in what we include as part of our lived experience

52
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,919
if it's fear that is the residence we're oriented some people then around more

53
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,600
than anything else maybe things that are threatening or potentially threatening

54
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,560
if it's desire it's the things that we want and we're kind of searching and looking for you know what we want and

55
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,680
we come to imc and for a sunday morning talk and like where's the best seat i

56
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:58,080
want to sit in the nice seat that's the seat where i set before you know that's what i want someone else comes is like i i don't

57
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,919
want to you know let me sit in the right place i don't want that place i don't want that place and by default i'm only

58
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,880
left with this one and and so we don't we don't see the

59
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,400
situation and abroad filled with potential filled with all

60
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,440
kinds of other range of orientations to understand it the perspective has gotten narrow

61
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,639
and in that narrowness and that constriction sometimes

62
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:35,759
how we respond to the world around us uh is uh

63
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:42,160
we call in english we talk about being reactive so something it strikes us

64
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:49,120
deep enough or impacts us or makes an impression deeply on us and it and it strikes these one these

65
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:56,960
residencies that i'm talking about those residencies will be become reactive or become upset or activated in

66
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,039
some strong way sometimes so that we act impulsively so

67
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:09,680
you know fear desire aversion confusion can lead to all kinds of behavior

68
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,560
people who are afraid can act very very impulsively

69
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:21,599
sometimes and some people who are take up residency in how they're hurt

70
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,440
how they've been treated poorly or badly and that's what they're or they're oriented around

71
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,880
if somebody comes from the outside and touches that limited residence of limited point of view in

72
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,919
which we operate for it's very easy we want to protect ourselves or we want to assert ourselves

73
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:44,160
or we want to you know we we want to have blame or we want to fix

74
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,360
or something and of course those some of that

75
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,960
can be healthy and appropriate but if that's their orientation

76
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,960
their reactivity in that kind of way it continues to restrict or constrict

77
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,840
the the range of how we see what we take in from the environment and also constricts and

78
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:14,720
limits the range of how we experience ourselves the more reactive we are the more less

79
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,000
we're in touch with the range of our humanity the range of who we are and how we feel

80
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,800
if we living with anger or resentment all the time then it's possible that there's no room

81
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,840
for a capacity for goodwill or love or friendliness

82
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,719
if we're living with desire as the primary orientation and then react to being frustrated desire

83
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,159
maybe there's very little room for feeling of having generosity or tuning into people

84
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:49,680
so we feel like we want to be generous to them because the orientation is the way we take up residency is in this

85
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,120
desire and the reactivity of it and sometimes the reactive mode we've

86
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,160
reacted to is taking it becomes comes so strong

87
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:05,519
that it's the reactivity that somehow has been set in motion

88
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:12,080
that becomes the place of residence where we take up where we live from

89
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,720
and what i'd like to propose is that that living out of reactivity living out of

90
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,680
these residencies of anxiety and desire and aversion and confusion

91
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,120
are places of uh heightened uh

92
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:38,800
mental activity there are places of of alertness or alarm

93
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:45,839
that i associate with kind of living a life that's more on the surface

94
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,760
and so it doesn't allow us to kind of drop below that surface

95
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,640
to experience something that's deeper within us which i associate with the dharma

96
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,760
if we're going to take up residency in the dharma some of you might not care for the metaphor of going deep

97
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:14,320
another way of another metaphor is is that an unrestricted unconstricted way of being

98
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,920
that the dharma is the way is how to of all kind of a wide open

99
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,519
heart a wide open sensibility that is not limited

100
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:34,160
in these ways but there's a kind of unlimited quality to attention to awareness and how we are

101
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:42,560
and and so and out of that dharma the life is not a reactive life

102
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,160
we could say it becomes a responsive life that those distinctions are

103
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:53,680
often used and they're nice but the language i like

104
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,600
to bring introduced today is there's the reactive way of living

105
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,279
and then there's the emergent way because the dharma is something that

106
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:12,320
emerges within us rather than something that gets

107
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,279
triggered by events of the life of the world around us all kinds of things can happen to us

108
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,920
but when we live a dharma life we take a presidency in the dharma in a sense residency in the heart presents

109
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,800
something deeper where there is a

110
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,720
a an arising of a response

111
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,160
an emerging of a response that has a very satisfying feeling that

112
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:48,480
it doesn't feel it necessarily has to do with conceit or me it's a different residency

113
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:55,600
taking everything to live in that place to live in that place of the dharma is to be available to something that is

114
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,959
much broader wider deeper fuller

115
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:09,800
than any of the constricted residencies that people commonly live by

116
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,160
so the uh the metaphor one of the metaphors that i

117
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,160
like to borrow from the buddha for this idea of the emergence is

118
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:28,240
that of a lake this has that's not being disturbed by

119
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,760
rain coming in not being disturbed by streams of rivers flowing into the lake

120
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,760
so there's no wind ruffling it but there is an underwater spring

121
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:46,320
in the middle of the lake that's bringing fresh water into the lake and the fresh refreshing water kind of

122
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,560
spreads out like a fountain and spreads out throughout the whole lake continually being renewed from the

123
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:58,079
depths of the lake and so this is a metaphor is used for

124
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:06,399
the buddha for what can happen in in when we're really absorbed in meditation

125
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:13,360
enough in this practice of meditation that the other residencies are not we're not living there we're not living

126
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,720
in the places where the rain falls where and that agitates where the water is

127
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:23,760
agitated or we don't have all these streams coming in that that somehow are

128
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,800
muddying the water so we're not operating from our reactivity

129
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,760
but we're allowing something deep inside the bubble up just and appear

130
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,519
the uh the other metaphor that's also one of water that i like very much the

131
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,440
naturalness of all this is uh the uh when rain does fall on the side

132
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:56,320
of the mountain and there's enough rain and the raindrops join together and create little trickles of stream of you

133
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:03,600
know water going down the side of the hill and the trickles be joined together and become teeny little streams and streams

134
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:09,600
become creeks and brooks and kind of then rivers and eventually you have something large

135
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,519
that's coming and just keeps flowing down the naturalness is it it keeps flowing down

136
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,800
it is flowing and sometimes if it reads if it comes to a lake and the lake is not full

137
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,079
it takes time to fill the lake but once the lake is full it spills over

138
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:32,959
the edge of the lake and down down the mountain some more if there's a big boulder

139
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:40,079
water will find a way around the boulder sooner or later even if it has to fill up above it or something go for the top

140
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,600
and but the naturalness that the the water just keeps flowing and joining and getting bigger and bigger until it comes

141
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:52,000
down from the mountains onto the plains and and then india for the buddha they get the ganges planes and maybe joins the

142
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:59,839
ganges and joy and then goes out into the ocean and uh the buddha uses this analogy to

143
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:06,000
say that as as we take up residency in the practice in the dharma

144
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,760
there is a natural unfolding and deepening or filling or expanding

145
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,880
flowing of our inner life that has a naturalness to it that's a

146
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:25,120
distinct from what we're trying any attempt we have to to construct to make to want to do

147
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,720
uh these dharma state dharmic states that can arise

148
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,360
things like certain even like mindfulness and

149
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,759
joy and tranquility happiness equanimity it's all kinds of wonderful things that

150
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:47,120
can kind of arise and flow i associated with

151
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,639
metta and karuna mudita and upeka is good will and

152
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,800
compassion and sympathetic joy and equanimity that uh

153
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:05,759
these also can arise from the bottom of the lake and surface and flow through us

154
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,800
and in fact so the the so these are the metaphors that buddha

155
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,560
uses for this kind of emergence and i think there's no appalling word i

156
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,320
think that obviously is usually translated as emergence but there's a lot of words that buddha used for the

157
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,759
arising the appearing of these things as opposed to the making

158
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,800
of them the naturalness in which these things arise

159
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:39,680
so one of the very interesting distinctions that the buddha makes that points to this little bit to this

160
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,600
distinction i'm making here between the reactive and the immersion emergent

161
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:52,000
is some people i call the distinction one between spiritual and non-spiritual or

162
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:00,480
spiritual and worldly some people translated it as these terms these two terms as

163
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:06,319
carnal and non-carnal which probably has very strong associations with certain western ideas

164
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,720
that maybe we don't want to borrow be too too associated with but

165
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,918
the literal uh meaning in the pal leave is that the the

166
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:24,160
first one sa amisa carnal or non-spiritual uh is um

167
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,679
or worldly is uh it literally means of the flesh so that's why carnal can kind

168
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:36,640
of work and and the other is which is uh

169
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:44,400
literally means not of the flesh so non-carnal and how i understand it is the first the

170
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,000
the non-spiritually carnal the worldly whatever way we want to translate not

171
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,400
of the flesh of the flesh is um it has to do with when experiences of

172
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,760
the world touch us

173
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:08,080
and it's that place where we're triggered so uh you know particularly if the six you

174
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,640
know this the five senses of eyes ears nose tongue and touch

175
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:21,919
that if somebody comes along and we get a nice massage and we feel the pleasure of it that pleasure would be considered

176
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,919
of the flesh kind of a worldly pleasure or a non-spiritual pleasure

177
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:34,799
nothing wrong with that pleasure buddhism doesn't negate the value of it but it's not it's it's coming from the

178
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:41,200
outside and stimulating our nerves kind of literally of the surface

179
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,280
the the the knot of the flesh this uh spiritual is part of this what

180
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:54,880
it can emerge from deeper within and this flowing of this of the of the spring

181
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:01,919
that can come and uh and the one of the primary associations that

182
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,919
this this knot of the flesh this dharmic flow

183
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,360
is joy and happiness but there's other qualities as well

184
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,840
confidence peacefulness brightness

185
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,280
sense of purity all kinds of things we can feel from this place exactly how we should feel it and be

186
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:31,360
with it it depends on individuals and circumstances and time but but

187
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:37,960
what i associated with is being available

188
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:47,039
to the world being available to ourselves a kind of a capacity for attentiveness for attention

189
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:53,280
that's not restricted not being defined by the different residencies we take up

190
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,039
that are not that limit us and constrict us we have a preoccupation we have a

191
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:06,320
perspective that we always bring but rather the attention the attentiveness is more

192
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,240
open available without an agenda

193
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,480
without a lot of hopefully presuppositions

194
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,640
preconceived ideas biased but it's developing this capacity to be

195
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,799
centered and present so that we're not leaning ahead of

196
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:38,000
ourselves into the future into things not pulling back not closing down but we're kind of opening up relaxing

197
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,039
into settling into taking up residency

198
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:48,960
in a place that is kind of unlimited that represents

199
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:56,799
something deep that where there's space for something to feel this life of ours in a deeper way

200
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:03,360
a place where there's space to allow some deeper motivation to animate our life

201
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,400
to guide our life feel our life

202
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:15,200
and this is you know i associate this with the dharma to take a presidency in the dharma

203
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,559
and then to trust it

204
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:26,000
rather than trusting or having faith in the reactive places we can take up

205
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,559
residency the reactive places where you know desire exists or frustration exist

206
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,840
uh aversion exists not all forms of a desire are

207
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,159
problematic it's a taking up residency with it not all forms of aversions are problematic

208
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:49,360
it's taking up residency so that it limits the scope of our

209
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,120
attentiveness our availability for this world for being here

210
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,679
well the buddha associates it with things like joy and happiness these beautiful qualities

211
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:08,240
i think it's by what's words really gets tested and where i find it most powerful

212
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:16,640
is when we're on when i'm uncomfortable when things are challenging and difficult

213
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:26,240
to then be available to sit in this place where the emergence happens where things can

214
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:32,960
bubble up and appear it's in a context that doesn't feel comfortable

215
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,440
and how to trust this place when we're uncomfortable as opposed to when we're uncomfortable

216
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:45,120
it's very easy for the reactive to fix it the blame that like something

217
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:52,240
is wrong here the judgments the stories the ideas the impatience to be there

218
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:59,600
and and then it can't be right you know this this is supposed to be the dharma world that i'm in i'm supposed to be

219
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:06,640
it's supposed to be you know riding on the clouds and being good and feeling right and everything is fine

220
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,559
occasionally that might happen occasionally but it's plenty of our life that is

221
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:20,320
uncomfortable the world we live in that's where the trusting

222
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,480
this place this deeper place the dharmic place is really significant really helpful

223
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,679
to take a rep residence for there trust that

224
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,280
more than the reactivity uh is uh

225
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:44,400
an area of tremendous growth tremendous challenge because you'll come you'll probably find in yourself

226
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,080
strong arguments this can't be right i can't i can't just be here and be

227
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,600
available for this i have to you know

228
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,760
be angry i'm supposed to be get something i wanted that to have to have something else to happen and

229
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,799
there's strong strong pull into this

230
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:13,360
what i call the reactive world or the this back up into this place where things are more superficial or the

231
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,679
activated mind the activated mind that is

232
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:25,760
easily activated reactivated reactivated over and over again

233
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:32,880
and the art of it the practice of it is to have discovered the dharmic dimension

234
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:39,120
the non-reacted place within where the wellsprings the naturalness of stuff

235
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:46,559
can exist even when we're uncomfortable to stay in that and breathe with it

236
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,600
to take our time with it to be available i'm uncomfortable but i i can be on i

237
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,600
can be available for now for this let's see what happens if i'm available as opposed to

238
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:02,799
rushing in with the reactivity with it's you know right now it needs to be

239
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:09,200
different this emerges place where things emerge

240
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,960
doesn't mean that we're just sitting patient sometimes with patients and just waiting for something to happen and

241
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:20,480
you know five minutes later you know the the rice is burning on the stove because

242
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:26,159
we there's something there's something wrong here and i'm just going to be available and

243
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,200
see what emerges the the

244
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:38,880
urge inside of us can act quickly sometimes they can act forcefully sometimes

245
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:45,278
but it's a very different place to live then

246
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:53,919
you know this dharmic this reactive place so where do you take a presidency

247
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,600
and i'm using this language residency today as an alternative to another way i could

248
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,120
have talked about it which maybe is more confusing or more problematic

249
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:13,760
sometimes and that is where do you create an identity what do you identify with this is who i am

250
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,600
and uh so rather than talking about that and then you question well i'm supposed to be somebody ain't i you know how can

251
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,840
i not be anything but where do you take up residency where do you live

252
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:32,720
and i like it because it also involves even though might be unconscious some kind of choice

253
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,360
that we've we've made that maybe we can make a different choice

254
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,880
and being able to make a different choice becomes possible

255
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,039
at some point i hope as we practice more and more as we meditate or

256
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:59,120
show up for our life with mindfulness and care and compassion that we begin to um

257
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:06,960
get a stronger feeling there isn't knowing we are stronger knowing

258
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,320
that there is an alternative way of living there is an alternative way

259
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:18,159
of showing up for the world that's not centered on conceit

260
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:25,120
we haven't taken up residency and this is who i am and that everything has to kind of fit into my desires or i have to

261
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:32,799
fit into everything the world wants and but it's taking up this place that

262
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:39,919
is uh is not you

263
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:45,520
but is found within you i love this kind of language

264
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:51,679
that so it's not something apart from you but it's not you but it's within you it's something so it's not the place we

265
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:58,960
don't take a presidency in an identity we don't take residency in claiming this

266
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:05,279
is you know claiming something as mine and that's one of the reasons i i find

267
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:12,000
it valuable to associate with the dharma it's the dharma the dharma knows the dharma is

268
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,600
responding the dharma i can trust take refuge in this dharma

269
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:24,640
so that we don't i don't you know appropriate it for me myself and mine

270
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:31,120
but to be available to be available

271
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:38,240
in an unlimited way and open to possibilities not constricted

272
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,919
not coagulated not

273
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:49,919
restricted but a place where attentiveness

274
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,520
care love

275
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:03,760
awareness kind of flows or is open or available like a

276
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:11,279
spring in a lake that might flow other there's fresh water might flow up into

277
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:18,080
all the places where we're uncomfortable all the places that are challenging they actually can flow into the place where

278
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:25,120
we are restricted where we are identified and caught

279
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:31,520
and but it's a you know wonder wonderful

280
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:38,080
an important part of dharma practice is to discover this other residency

281
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,919
not in opposition or as a complete substitute for the old residencies

282
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,679
but as a perspective with which now to begin investigating and seeing

283
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:58,000
the reactivities we have the places where we kind of keep kind of

284
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:06,080
taking up residency or acting from that are not healthy and for anybody and everyone

285
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:14,000
so there's the reactive side of us and there's the emergent

286
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:19,279
side of us and as we do this practice we begin to

287
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:24,640
discover an alternative to the reactive mode of being

288
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:31,679
to discovering the emergent mode what emerges from the dharma what emergence emerges from the spiritual

289
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,360
from the from the from that which is not of the flesh in a

290
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:44,158
sense that which is deeper within us that it flows like a

291
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:51,600
spring in a mountain lake so i hope this gives you something to think about i hope you practice with

292
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,760
something to investigate and look and see if there's these if you can if where

293
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,960
where in your life what i've talked about today uh you can identify or see and discover

294
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,200
and then maybe some point over the next week you might have the occasion to be

295
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,440
reactive to something maybe

296
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,919
and uh and then maybe right you know rather than brushing it off um

297
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:27,039
you know it's good to be respect respect our reactivity

298
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:33,120
but maybe you can try to meet it in a different way the the emerging side the available side

299
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:40,159
the place where there's a kind of open just being sensitive to what is this can open and meet the places of

300
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:47,399
reactivity in a new way what's that like for you what happens then

301
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,880
so thank you and

302
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:59,120
we have we have a little bit of time if some of you would like to ask a question

303
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:05,279
or comment about this a testimonial or

304
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:11,880
a reservation about it all anything else

305
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,799
i really enjoyed your talk this is wonderful points to live by i just wanted to mention that uh when

306
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:35,679
you are in a grip of fear uh you know which is seems at the time to be profound

307
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:42,880
and engulfing so forth and you um you want to work your way out of that

308
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:48,880
you know in that particular respect um i found

309
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,640
i had this problem last year over a period and that the

310
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:00,159
the consequences were pretty serious over over that period and i

311
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,519
i find myself when i just instead of being in a group of fear

312
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,799
i laid out a plan for myself and that plan really helped me

313
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:15,840
to get out of the fear and be more in more

314
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,880
uh how shall i say more at peace with the issue and how to

315
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:28,000
approach it and an end point potentially for the for the issue that was at hand

316
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,120
and i found that to be useful just at the very minimum just come up with a

317
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:39,120
plan be proactive about how do i deal with this great i love it i know what i

318
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:45,760
hear from that is that it's possible to step out far enough from fear and off the

319
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:51,760
grip of fear and operate from a different place and one of the different places is to sit down with a piece of

320
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:57,519
paper and pen maybe and uh and make a plan and consider what are their alternatives what are the ways

321
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:04,320
i you know you can't make a plan in the middle of the crisis but maybe ahead of time you could think about some options

322
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,879
and then to live with that plan it sounds like a wonderfully wise way thank you

323
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,280
sometimes in my life when uh uh

324
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:28,480
i've had some kind of personal challenge that really troubled me the uh

325
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,960
you know how to step out of the reactive mind how to not to have the usual way of thinking

326
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,320
always be the way that we live in the world is especially if the usual way of

327
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:45,520
thinking is just like second nature it's like you know it's like the like the fish doesn't see the water

328
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,679
supposedly that they swim in we don't necessarily see the thinking that we live in and don't really see what goes

329
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:57,359
on so when i've been troubled by some things occasionally what i've done is gone someplace where i was alone like

330
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:03,440
driving a car and spoken out loud and because i find that when i

331
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:09,359
speak out loud it's actually speaking from a different place within me

332
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:15,920
than where i think from and so there's access to different wisdom different understanding different

333
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,880
perspectives different attitudes different care it's it's different enough

334
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:29,760
but if i'm only thinking about things all the time i mean my thoughts i'm actually limiting myself the scope and

335
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,280
the range of how i can consider something and so you might some of you if you ever

336
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:42,880
find yourself troubled and want a new perspective you might try find a place where you're alone

337
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,400
or at least have you know earbuds that people think you're on the phone

338
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,599
and so so this is kind of building what you said this ability to sit back and plan

339
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:01,599
is also maybe calling on a different part of the brain the mind and just the usual just letting things go thinking go

340
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:03,839
along

341
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:15,680
great talk thank you so much and never um

342
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:23,839
heard exactly those two words coupled uh emergence and reactive a little bit

343
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:29,520
closer oh is that better yeah okay thank you so much was such a

344
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:35,440
beautiful talk and i have never heard those two words coupled uh

345
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,520
emergent and reactive so um and one thing i was

346
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,200
thinking about just now about where a person takes up residence

347
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:53,280
is um i follow on youtube and so your talks last

348
00:36:53,280 --> 00:37:00,000
week about the different bodies and i just wondered if it would be possible

349
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:06,480
for you to speak about that a little bit again particularly the karmic body

350
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:13,200
and then um the like the intersection between um

351
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:20,240
emergence so the you that's not your identified you but or

352
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:26,720
identified self and your residency because i'm seeing that there's

353
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,240
great like that's so real right so something i think yeah so the uh i very much

354
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:39,359
associated the karmic body or karmic activity as being the reactive

355
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:44,640
and uh the word karma means activity action or activity

356
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,400
and so it kind of works you know reactivity you know reaction

357
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:57,440
so it's the it's the actions which uh reverberate or repeat themselves or

358
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,960
uh come from some place that is uh that

359
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,880
karma is activity which our activity our actions that we do or i like activities sometimes because not

360
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:15,200
always so conscious there are ones that leave a trace the ones that uh uh

361
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:22,800
trigger more things to occur and on and on the emergent doesn't automatically

362
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,079
require or trigger ongoing activity to be there it can kind

363
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,440
of exist without leaving a trace and so last week when i talked about the

364
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:41,119
four or five kinds of body the last four were the emergent qualities of the body

365
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:49,200
and and so yeah so the second half of your question about more identity what was that

366
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,240
um yeah in in a way you almost just

367
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:02,480
answered it but yeah just like the intersection of you you said to try to um

368
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,240
be with it you know when you're uncomfortable um to not uh

369
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:13,359
shut down or you know whatever that wasn't your word that's mine but um

370
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:21,760
and how to sort of uh maybe note or in so much as

371
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:28,560
it's even possible to know your own residency and how that is kind of maybe did i

372
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:33,920
understand you to say that your residency can is like thwarting

373
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:39,440
your emergence yeah so i'm not sure it's a great

374
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,560
question i'm not sure i have them good answer for you

375
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:50,800
that the deserves but the one that i prefer is that all this becomes known as you keep

376
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,079
practicing mindfulness just keep practicing mindfulness let your mindfulness become stronger and

377
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:03,119
developed and to develop a skill or capacity to be uncomfortable

378
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:09,680
to be to be comfortable some people have trouble feeling joy whatever it might be

379
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:15,920
but be able to become familiar with yourself more and more so you start seeing the places

380
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,440
where the maybe the inflection points between what brings stress and what brings the

381
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:27,760
opposite of stress and the more you do that the more you'll start getting the you'll start reading

382
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:34,400
the book in your body of what's pointing towards the emergent and what points to the reactive

383
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:40,720
but it becomes you know the real place is just keep studying yourself being present and seeing and learning

384
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:48,640
to now because because i talked about the emergent quality and maybe in a nice way so okay now that's what i'm gonna do

385
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:54,319
you know okay i'm gonna you know you know probably that's it's so too easy for that to come from a reactive place

386
00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:01,200
or to take up residency doing that i'm gonna be the one who's gonna be the emergent one you know and just like that's not it

387
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,839
either but this is something that begins to arise to surface and become clear and

388
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:14,640
something we trust and something we rest in as we know ourselves better and better and as we know the difference between

389
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:20,480
these different modes and so i'm using the modes of reactive

390
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:29,200
and emergent today some people another mode that's related is skillful and unskillful wholesome and unwholesome

391
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:34,880
so there's there's all these different things but the the recipe is to understand yourself better

392
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,960
is that okay great okay well thank you

393
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,880
so uh last few weeks i've been here we've had a meeting out in the parking lot for those people who want to stay

394
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:54,000
it's been really lovely and taking off the masks and just sitting in a circle and talking unfortunately i can't stay today because

395
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,800
i'm going to the retreat center to be there early today to help set up for the retreat that starts today

396
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,880
however um it occurred well you're welcome i encourage those of you who want to do it today hillary will be

397
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,560
there and hillary will facilitate some discussion and and just sharing amongst yourselves nice

398
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:18,240
to hang out a little bit with each other so if you want to bring up a folding chair and bring it out to the parking lot

399
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:24,000
that would be quite nice and uh because i'm doing this retreat i won't be here next week

400
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,200
next week a long time imc practitioner and person who does a lot

401
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,280
of teaching here for us is maria stratman will come and give a talk and people love her talks when she comes

402
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,720
here so i think you're in good hands and um

403
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,838
so thank you very much and
