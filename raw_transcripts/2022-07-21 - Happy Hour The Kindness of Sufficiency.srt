enough it's enough it's okay no it's enough this is enough

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,860
I'm enough in this moment just showing up is enough maybe you've had a hard day

11
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:15,299
it's been a long day and just showing up sitting

12
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,939
in Sangha or or maybe if you're listening to the side of your leader uh

13
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:27,180
on your own just showing up making an attempt this is enough this is enough a

14
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:35,520
sense of comfort of not always driving ourselves uh ragged more more

15
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:44,360
and more but it's okay opening up to the enoughness of this moment

16
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:52,619
enoughness of this amazing being who is ourselves and is doing their best

17
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,719
this is enough and maybe through this acceptance of

18
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:03,798
the enoughness or rather the plenty of this moment

19
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:12,599
we can appreciate and see and really touch into this care the

20
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:19,080
sentence of care the sense of holding of ourselves this non-judgment it's a sense of

21
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,959
enoughness actually is the opposite of self-judgment because self-judgment is not oh that's not good

22
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,360
enough you're not good enough this is not good enough you should be doing this that or not be doing that's okay

23
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,860
sweetheart it's okay dear heart it's not a sense of Solace calm

24
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:45,060
So Meta warm-heartedness loving kindness showing up in this other

25
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,720
wearing the the clothes of it's enough this is enough it can be a very soothing

26
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,019
calming um meta not necessarily very energized

27
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:03,840
or energy energetic law so as you know by now you're maybe you're getting to

28
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,120
know that meta loving kindness can show up in practice

29
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:17,640
in so many ways it can wear many many many different beautiful guises so this

30
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:23,940
is one way I'm inviting us to explore it it's not very energetic but very calming

31
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:30,480
it becomes more similar more um

32
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:38,040
um expressive uh of itself similar to Equanimity this is a calming soothing

33
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:47,159
because of course Equanimity opeca is a practice that's one of the Brahma viharas one of the pr or Heavenly abodes

34
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:52,500
meta being the first one Equanimity being the fourth one they're related of

35
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,959
course they're related so this way of us is enough it's okay it's okay it's all

36
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,299
right it's it's expressing meta expressing itself

37
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:08,400
um its similarity or its its relationship with Equanimity in this way

38
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:15,000
of showing up and this nuanced way comforting way of showing up so that's

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,160
all I want to say to set up the space for our practice together

40

godmother

185
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:47,780
you're welcome and all your fairy godmothers are welcome yes Fred please

186
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:54,740
thank you Nikki I find it relatively easy to think

187
00:38:54,740 --> 00:39:02,040
certainly I have enough in the material side of life and in the many ways that

188
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:07,200
that plays out [Music] but as I

189
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:12,900
come back to feeling am I am I enough now am I sufficient in

190
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:18,599
my aspiration and my um my efforts to be as I want in the

191
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:24,660
world to be more open to be more loving to be engaged in useful ways you know

192
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:31,160
the answer is no I'm not and um I I think you're asking us to

193
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:37,200
simultaneously maintain two contradictory ideas that to not let go

194
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:43,920
of aspiration and effort but perhaps to also say well

195
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:51,119
you know that's one can Aspire and still

196
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:57,440
feel some peaceableness in the present effort

197
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,900
exactly Fred right on and you put it so eloquently thank you that's exactly it

198
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:12,720
and don't mute yourself just yet it's um it's like the Suzuki roshi famous line

199
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:18,780
you are perfect as you are and you can use a little Improvement

200
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:24,780
how is that that's exactly the intention because there needs to be a sense of

201
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:30,599
because the you need a little Improvement alone it brings tightness in

202
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:37,980
the heart and the mind as you know and there's a sense of insufficiency and lacking and and envy and or shame or

203
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:44,819
whatever it's like it's not conducive so there needs to be a sense of I'm enough or there's enoughness there's a sense of

204
00:40:44,819 --> 00:40:52,140
sufficiency gladness goodness that the heart can feel settled and rested in so

205
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:57,599
that it can be so that it can aspire

206
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:06,180
for further goodness exactly yeah right on okay thank you

207
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:14,280
thank you not easy to do but thank you it's not and yet I so appreciate that you verbalized the you you really

208
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:22,740
brought out what what the intention was here so I really appreciate you for doing that thanks red yeah

209
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:35,099

218
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:30,720
um Pat says such a relief for the practice of just enough after a long

219
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:38,339
involved day yeah sometimes it's yeah appreciation coming

220
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:43,440
thanks red thanks Christine I think you sent that just to me not to the group

221
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:52,160
this was private so if you want to send it to everyone you're welcome to ah Nadine I just saw your hand please

222
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:57,660
yeah so I just something kind of funny happened

223
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:05,880
um when I'm you know pushing thoughts away and just being present the thoughts are always kind of words in

224
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:11,520
my mind or I just I'm talking to myself and suddenly my mind just shot me a

225
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,460
picture and I thought oh sneaky mind what a sneaky mind it's like you're not

226
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:25,020
talking to you shot me a picture and I I could push that away too that was the first time I had my mind ever tricked me

227
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:32,160
with a picture hmm that's interesting it's it's cute it's

228
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:40,319
many Minds do that so here's here's an invitation I haven't had Dean so so when all the thoughts come and also

229
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:46,079
if pictures come again now that the mind is you know presenting people that's not unusual

230
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:51,660
um see what happens if you shift your position from pushing it away you know

231
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:57,560
your hand gesture was also like this pushing it away instead of welcoming it

232
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:04,500
see what happens if you do that oh hello dear mine hi sweetheart you're calm sit

233
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:09,720
down calm see there is so much plenty there's so much goodness here so so see

234
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:16,980
if you just shift it around see what happens be curious does that make sense what I'm suggesting maybe it'll send me

235
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:25,140
a pretty picture thank you it's all just bring it here come come here it's okay because that

236
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:31,920
that pushing that that movement of the heart that movement of the mind which actually you represent it beautifully

237
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:38,660
and um that that can actually

238
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:46,500
create more involvement in thinking that that energy so I'm inviting you to bring

239
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:52,859
more just more care more attention more love to that movement it's not needed make it

240
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:58,859
this make it yeah and it's not about giving into thinking and ruminating but

241
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:04,160
it actually shifts the dynamic then I invite you to be curious about that

242
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:10,980
yeah thank you you're welcome thank you so

243
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:18,119
um one last reflection um this one is private thank you Nikki I

244
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:25,319
have been in a lot of emotional pain over the past 24 hours many feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy this

245
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:30,560
practice really helped to soothe me ah thank you for sharing that

246
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:37,140
