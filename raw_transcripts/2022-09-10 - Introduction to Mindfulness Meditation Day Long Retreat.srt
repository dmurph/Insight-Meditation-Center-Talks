1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:07,279
sure um

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:17,039
that would have to be on her side yeah she has to do that but I think she was muted whenever she

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,720
wasn't talking so it's essentially the same and then I was controlling the um

4
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:28,740
her mic I had it off when she wasn't talking

5
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,460
and we can't turn the volume off on the laptop because I can't get up and down every

6
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,700
time

7
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:49,640
sure that's what we'll set it up we'll set it up the first time

8
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,500
yeah yeah

9
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,920
I gotta go thanks brother appreciate it

10
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:19,080
okay so now you want to test the mics is that the first one is that kill this

11
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:26,820
is the normal one that's usually plugged in so I can hear myself a little bit and so far it seems that probably is

12
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,460
plenty loud Sage sorry

13
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,140
yeah okay

14
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,220
losers

15
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,799
she has it with her oh okay it's just this

16
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:55,020
don't you like to be the mic person today if you don't want to listen if you don't

17
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,880
you don't need to for sure

18
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:07,439
and you can actually it's on you can just butt it right up against almost touch the bike testing one two

19
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,739
testing I'll use my normal speaking voice secret

20
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:21,300
title oh my God yep is that good oh to me but

21
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,920
yeah oh okay well

22
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:43,019
uh this is a normal tone but then when I do guided it's a little too loud it's

23
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:49,560
echoing okay and when I do guided meditations I'm a

24
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:57,119
little soft Sage [Music]

25
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:05,400
you're right I do know that so okay so when I do uh guided and I'm soft

26
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:12,000
you can still hear this yeah right

27
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,239
that people's signal us they can't hear

28
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,340
foreign

29
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:37,740
so we're just going to have sort of a sitting period between now and about

30
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:45,720
um just a little before 10. to get settled and to allow people to come in and

31
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:52,319
so I'll just I don't want to offer too much instructions but I do want to welcome

32
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:59,460
you I do want to invite you to

33
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,319
bring all of yourself here

34
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:12,180
and to maybe just sort of start you know if people do wander in

35
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:18,780
it's an opportunity to practice sort of welcoming the disruptions The Sounds the

36
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:25,259
energy that's not settled but just to sort of see it and say

37
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:31,919
welcome it's a nice practice to sort of support

38
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:39,260
an opening in your mind and heart to what's happening instead of resisting

39
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:50,279
so so as not to surprise you I will probably if more people come in I'll offer some more instructions at some

40
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,320
point similar ly maybe a little more guidance

41
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,320
and you're welcome to just ignore my voice at any point

42
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,740
welcome

43
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,800
thank you

44
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:26,580
so one of the first things we invite people to do when we start papasana

45
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:34,759
practice is to find an upright embodied posture

46
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,779
and to kind of create some sort of an anchor to help your mindfulness stay

47
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:49,620
present anchor can be the breath flowing in and

48
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:56,760
out if that breath works well for you

49
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:04,220
it's a nice one because it has a rhythm but it changes comes and goes

50
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,339
and we can connect with the breathing in a variety of ways

51
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:18,060
feeling the air flow through the nostrils or in the belly

52
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,640
chest or the whole body

53
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:32,779
and if the breath doesn't somehow work quite well for you

54
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:42,360
you might experiment with sort of resting your awareness and the

55
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:49,639
feelings of your hands or your body sitting on your chair

56
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:04,339
what we're wanting is a anchor that is easy for you to connect with

57
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,120
another option is sound

58
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:18,720
and when we do listening meditation really the same with all of them but

59
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,120
we're receiving receiving sounds receiving the breath

60
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,500
receiving Sensations

61
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,720
so just checking in today to notice your body your mind your heart

62
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:47,700
and what part of your experience is it easiest to connect with

63
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:56,300
that helps you stay here connected with present moment experience

64
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:08,540
in vipassana we tend to close our eyes for meditation but it is not required

65
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:15,480
sometimes it's very useful and helpful to open our eyes to help us Orient or

66
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,899
ground

67
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:30,360
if you like to just practice with eyes open you can be supportive to

68
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,300
sort of let your eyes gently rest

69
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:44,220
a little bit ahead of you maybe a little bit down in front of you just a gentle Focus not this sort of

70
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:51,500
searching or looking but more just a a soft gaze

71
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:04,320
this morning before we begin the formal welcome it's a great great

72
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:12,500
opportunity to just check in and notice how your mind and body are this morning

73
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:22,260
what's easy to connect with that keeps you here practice play a little bit with this

74
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:28,399
just helping yourself slowly enter into this day of practice

75
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:43,339
welcoming just as much as you can whatever comes up fear resistance not liking hoping

76
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:50,660
all of it can just be seen and allowed to come in and move through

77
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:59,339
this is maybe one of the most important moments of the day establishing

78
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:06,899
a relationship with your experience establishing an anchor for your

79
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,380
awareness

80
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:01,460
foreign

81
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,140
foreign

82
00:23:48,919 --> 00:23:53,779
just noticing what you're aware of now

83
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:05,900
may be lost in thought maybe with your anchor or the sound

84
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:11,720
just as gently as possible

85
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:18,299
and a sit back metaphorically perhaps energetically in

86
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:25,580
your body relax a little bit more

87
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,679
nothing has to happen

88
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:42,900
posture in your mind might be kind of this image of somebody upright but kind of leaning

89
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:49,280
back a little hands Palms open

90
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:58,940
sort of receptive receptive stance

91
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:08,960
being soft with experience patient

92
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:21,080
maybe just doing a slight gentle body scan

93
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:28,380
inviting the head the face the forehead

94
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:34,200
the jaw to relax maybe even opening the mouth a little

95
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,440
bit

96
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:57,559
inviting the eyes to soften forehead to soften

97
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:02,840
temples to soften

98
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:19,559
sort of like warm honey bringing your attention down through the head and neck and face

99
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:22,700
into the shoulders

100
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,799
just still letting go of anything extra

101
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:35,658
anything extra that isn't needed

102
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:44,340
sort of allowing that soft warm attention

103
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:49,799
to gently flow down through the arms

104
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:55,860
inviting the muscles even the bones

105
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,539
to soften just a bit

106
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,740
through the chest back body

107
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,960
the heart the lungs the belly

108
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:30,900
good morning good morning body good morning muscles

109
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:39,620
welcome may you be at ease may you feel the warmth of my gaze

110
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:51,260
down into the bottom hips pelvic area

111
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,760
down through the legs

112
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:15,980
feeling the fronts and the backs and the sides of the legs

113
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:28,820
maybe noticing the aliveness of the body

114
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,740
into the ankles

115
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:45,380
and the feet

116
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,700
thank you

117
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,200

and I'm going to offer you a little bit of an orientation to the space we're sitting in I also want to welcome and

124
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:08,580
thank Richard who is our manager today so the three of us have been meditating

125
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:15,539
for a while this is my 18th year much to my surprise of meditating at uh IMC and

126
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:21,480
in this community and uh so this if you haven't been here

128
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:32,640
um I want to let you know that there are three bathrooms in the back of the hall you're welcome to get up and use the

129
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,679
bathroom anytime you need there's also a counter in the back there

130
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:42,779
that has hot water for tea or coffee and there's tea available that you can take

131
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:48,419
out of the drawers to drink um there is a kitchen with sink and

132

microwave your lunch so feel free to use this as your home

134
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,700
and we have a couple of other things that are very useful for some people if

135
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:12,618
you have trouble hearing you have a couple of different options one is that on the counter nearest this wall

136
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:21,540
in the Social Hall there are hearing assistive devices so you can get one of them and turn them

137
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:26,760
on Richard's showing it hooks over your ear and you can turn it on and adjust

138
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:32,520
the line thank you Richard will help also if during the meditation sometimes

139
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:38,760
I know my voice gets really quiet during guided meditation raise your hand or put your thumb up or

140
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,980
just let us know you can even say something out loud because we don't want you to miss it you know you don't have

141
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:51,358
to be concerned about speaking up another thing that we have available

142
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:58,920
during the day we're going to do I'm going to orient you to what we'll be doing today but during the day there's a

143
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,440
sign up sheet on the stage and we have a few what are called practice discussions

144
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:10,079
and you can feel free to sign up for one of those that's just a short opportunity

145
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:16,040
to talk with Tanya or me and ask questions you might have get acquainted

146
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,960
ask about what's going on for you in the meditation so it's a chance for some

147
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:28,440
one-on-one support we'll also have a question and answer period later in the day and you can approach US during the

148
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:34,200
day uh with questions this is one of the wonderful things

149
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:40,440
about Insight Meditation Center is it's entirely run by volunteers everybody here is a volunteer

150
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:45,900
and so it's also maintained by volunteers and we ask that at the end of

151
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:51,540
this day long if there are about six of you five or six who could stay late for

152
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:58,200
just 15 minutes we you know sweep the floors throw the trash and compost out just simple things

153
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:04,140
like that so anybody who could do that could stay for 15 minutes thank you very

154
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:10,220
much wonderful and we'll be joining you during the the chores

155
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:16,380
so um one thing to know about today that's very important is there's no

156
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:22,380
there's no mistakes there are no mistakes and there's nothing that can go wrong everything that we're doing today

157
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:30,599
is an opportunity just to be aware of what's Happening so um I would like you to be able to

158
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:34,280
relax and enjoy the day

159
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:44,280
no good that's why there's two of us one is that to support our practice

160
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:51,540
today we want to invite other than you know in here if there's a specific question about practice silence in the

161
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:58,619
hall so in the whole Center silence um it helps us keep watching our minds

162
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:05,700
and not get lost right in interactions during lunch we'll invite people to talk

163
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:11,760
outside right and also if there's people who want silence outside we can set up two

164
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,579
separate areas for eating so but it just seems like if that's if you know a nice

165
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:26,480
way to support the continuity because you're going to be building up a lot of practice continuity today so

166
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,220
and one other little thing which is nobody has any liquids in here but

167
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:38,700
only water into the Hall so tea and stuff just keep it out there

168
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:45,780
thank you Liz yes we have this lovely light colored

169
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:51,359
carpet to keep us on our toes as far as mindfulness and keep keep it free of

170
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:58,020
stains so um I'm just going to stretch my body a

171
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:02,359
little bit get comfortable here

172
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:10,500
one of the things about today too is please feel free if you need to to go

173
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:18,480
out and get more cushions to shift from chair to floor floor to chair you know you don't have to I when I

174
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,640
first came here I had no introduction class and I sat down on the floor right

175
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:29,460
there just on the floor didn't know anything about cushions and within 15 minutes it was a Sunday

176
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:36,420
sitting within 15 minutes I was sweating Loosely and I was in so much pain

177
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:43,440
everybody still I thought I can't move a muscle I don't want it to be like that for you

178
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,520
today you're allowed to move and you're allowed to get yourself comfortable

179
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:57,660
um I want to start by asking for who is

180
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:03,180
will this be your first introduction to meditation you've never come to a center

181
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:10,800
before taking any meditation classes I think Anna said she's not yeah great

182
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:20,339
wonderful welcome this class is designed for you and who has been taking Tanya and kodo's

183
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:27,060
intro to mindfulness meditation class Great Sage and Corey and

184
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:33,240
wonderful welcome who took a prior introductory course somewhere

185
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,940
yeah great so for for you some of what I have to

186
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:46,020
say may serve as Refresher um and uh then how how many have been

187
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:51,540
practicing for a little while maybe you've been practicing for a few months if you've been practicing for at least a

188
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:56,579
few months and about how many have been practicing for a year or

189
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:02,460
how about more than a year and decades yes decades okay so this day is for

190
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:08,160
everyone and um what we're going to be doing is called

191
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:15,200
mindfulness meditation it's also called Insight Meditation which you may have seen on the sign Outdoors

192
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:21,660
what mindfulness you know there's a lot of teachers who say I can't really Define mindfulness but I'll give it a

193
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:29,640
attempt paying attention on purpose to what is happening right here and now

194
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:36,300
moment to moment in the body in the emotions in the mind

195
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:43,820
in your surroundings but largely you know we're turning Inward and paying attention to what's arising in US

196
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:50,339
now over time as we notice what's happening now we may also be able to see

197
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:58,020
some patterns some conditioned habits we have so what comes up routinely may start to

198
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:05,940
teach us quite a bit about how we've been conditioned or what we've learned over the course of our lifetime

199
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:12,720
and over the time this practice of mindfulness cultivates a clear

200
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:19,619
stable non-judgmental awareness awareness is a capacity we all have it's

201
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:27,599
a natural thing right now I bet if we did a poll we'd probably be able to tell

202
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:32,760
approximately what the temperature in the room is you know kind of a little

203
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:38,579
bit about what the weather is the awareness is functioning all the time for a lot of different purposes but

204
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:45,000
we're going to aim our awareness at specific things

205
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,339
so this mindfulness meditation practice that we do over and over again can

206
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:55,920
certainly bring calm and Clarity to our

207
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,079
daily life into the pressures that we experience in life and it's also

208
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:08,520
available as a spiritual path that helps us gradually experience more freedom and

209
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:16,560
happiness it sort of dissolves barriers to wisdom compassion and other beautiful human

210
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:24,240
qualities so it's twofold now how we're going to proceed to begin

211
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:30,839
today is we're going to go through the same sequence that those of you have been going through the intro class have

212
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:37,020
gone through and we're doing one skill after another and the skills build on one another they

213
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:42,320
complement one another so we'll start with basics of meditation

214
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:47,520
and where people often start in this tradition is with mindfulness of

215
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:53,640
breathing so we'll begin with that then the next segment we'll do a little

216
00:42:53,640 --> 00:43:00,000
bit of walking so we'll start to come into mindfulness of our bodies in that case with with mindfulness of our feet

217
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,099
and legs then we'll come back and we'll do a

218
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:12,180
sitting where we develop mindfulness of the body and we take in different kinds of Sensations in addition to those of

219
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:19,980
breathing in the rest of the body we'll move into next into mindfulness of

220
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:27,300
emotions feeling and then we'll do and by the way we'll

221
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:35,040
have breaks during this we'll have other walking meditation periods so you won't be uh sitting without a break all day

222
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:40,440
you'll get plenty of breaks and often the sitting meditations will be

223
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:48,839
interspersed with walking meditations to help relieve the body and get the circulation going and change it up

224
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:54,839
we'll move into the mindfulness of thinking something

225
00:43:54,839 --> 00:44:00,599
that goes on quite a bit perhaps and then we'll have a

226
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:05,880
mindfulness of open awareness and what that is is paying attention to the flow

227
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:11,700
of what's happening so right now as you experience what's happening as you sit

228
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:16,859
here there could be thoughts and then there could be a body sensation there could be attention to the breath there

229
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:23,880
could be emotions and all these things come and go come and go come and go so with open awareness we pay attention to

230
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:32,700
that changing flow um as we focus on each of what Tanya

231
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:39,359
called anchors we're going to use each of these things as what we call an anchor so if you think about for example

232
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:44,420
paying attention or being aware of breathing

233
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:51,359
the way we use that is let's say a sailor has been sailing all day long and

234
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:57,300
they've been working hard at the tiller and they've been you know gauging the winds and doing a lot of work and they

235
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:04,020
decide to come to a rest um they could weigh anchor they could drop an anchor into the water

236
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:09,060
and the anchors provides a stable point you know so the boat is no longer going

237
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:17,099
to be blown by the wind or caught by the currents or the tides it's going to stay there so similarly we're using the

238
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:23,520
breath to stabilize our awareness and our attention and we'll when we're practicing mindfulness of the breath

239
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:30,540
we'll come back to breathing again and again and it's not that thinking might not happen or a sensation in the body's

240
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:36,420
noticed other things will come up but then we just gently return the attention when we're aware the mind has gone off

241
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:42,000
we'll gently return our attention to the breathing so there's many different

242
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,540
types of anchors that the breathing is one then we'll shift to the body the body could be your anchor of attention

243
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:54,480
you could keep coming back to Sensations in the body again and again

244
00:45:54,480 --> 00:46:01,760
um so that's what's meant by an anchor or some people will call it an object of meditation

245
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:07,380
please know it's not that we expect that only breathing is going to be happening when we're practicing mindfulness of the

246
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:15,660
breathing it's simply that we're going to come back to that anchor again and again and in doing that we are training

247
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:21,300
the mind we're training the awareness to come back to something that will

248
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:26,579
stabilize it when we start out we have what some people call Monkey mind it's

249
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:31,800
jumping all around all over the place if you experience that no problem there are

250
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:39,300
no mistakes there are no problems um you know we'll also offer with these

251
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:45,720
guided meditations that we'll do on each of these topics we'll offer some time we'll talk about

252
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:54,599
them briefly we'll do this lightly guided meditation and then we'll offer some time that is just quiet so that you

253
00:46:54,599 --> 00:47:00,900
can notice what happens in your mind and body um have people here have anybody here

254
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:06,720
been listening to a lot of the morning guided meditations that Gil's been doing at seven o'clock

255
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:12,420
yeah guided meditations are wonderful and these guided meditations serve to

256
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:19,260
help give you an idea of what you might pay attention to you know to kind of train your mind in okay here's kind of

257
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:24,780
how I go about this mindfulness of breathing for example but also guided

258
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:31,020
meditations are a bit like training wheels and there comes a point where if you want to ride a bike you use the

259
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:37,220
training wheels to get your balance but then after a while you take them off and similarly it's good to practice

260
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:43,680
meditation with the guidance off and just see what happens because we learn a

261
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:49,640
whole lot about how our minds have been conditioned and what's going on for us

262
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:55,619
so um just briefly I wonder how many people

263
00:47:55,619 --> 00:48:02,460
here are not so familiar with how you use chairs and cushions and things like that

264
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:09,420
if you haven't really great I'm gonna and maybe some of you are but I'm going to give a little Brief Review of it

265
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:15,240
it does not matter which and by the way when I talk about postures I want to

266
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:20,640
include that one of the postures that can be used at any time if you're super

267
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:27,900
sleepy or you just need a break is standing posture you can stand usually people don't close their eyes when they

268
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:35,220
do this they keep them resting at a spot on the floor but you can stand while you're meditating

269
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:42,300
and you can feel your body swaying a little bit or but it's fine to use anything you need

270
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:49,440
so you'll see I I usually use a chair and I'll show you this kind of from the side so you can see it when you're

271
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,599
sitting on a chair usually what you're trying to do is um

272
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:59,760
have your feet flat on the floor and parallel or you can have your legs

273
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:06,480
splayed a little if your feet don't reach the floor there are some cushions and wedges out in the shelves and you

274
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:13,440
can put you know you can put them under your feet ideally you want your knees slightly lower than your hips or level

275
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:19,619
but definitely not higher so if you find your feet don't reach the floor you

276
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:26,240
um or you need some hip height you can put a cushion under yourself like this

277
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:34,700
free of the back rest with all sitting we're trying to establish a little bit of an independent

278
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:41,780
posture and this takes time to develop by the way at first our muscles may feel

279
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:46,859
the new activity and some of us who have

280
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:55,260
lower back injuries might prop cushions very low behind ourselves like that so

281
00:49:55,260 --> 00:50:00,300
that's that can help but then from there you're going to place your hands

282
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:06,020
somewhere where they're not pulling you forward they're not pulling your shoulders forward or too far forward

283
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:13,619
they're comfortably resting on your lap in kind of a symmetrical way or when it

284
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:19,260
gets hot I do Palms up so that I have one more evaporative cooling Source you

285
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:25,859
can also rest your hands in your lap like this whatever oops whatever's comfortable for

286
00:50:25,859 --> 00:50:32,700
you then some people prefer to sit on the

287
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:38,460
floor it's comfortable for them and you have a lot of options there

288
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:45,599
so I'm not going to sit on one cushion because I know I'm not flexible enough but some people can sit simply on one

289
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:53,520
cushion the idea with the chair the cushion anything is that you're forming a tripod a sturdy base for yourself so

290
00:50:53,520 --> 00:51:01,819
I'm going to sit on two cushions and what that enables me to do what you want to do is be able to have both knees

291
00:51:01,819 --> 00:51:07,319
forming two corners of the tripod and then the cushion forming the third your

292
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:12,960
sit bones against the cushion um sitting on the front third is helpful

293
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:20,339
for stability and we tend to sit Burmese style or tailor style like this with one leg and

294
00:51:20,339 --> 00:51:26,280
foot in front of the other if I were sitting here and one knee was still a little high it just didn't have the

295
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:32,160
flexibility in my hips I could put a cushion under so that I then have

296
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:38,160
the stability so use props as you need and then with

297
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:43,920
each of these things with sitting and on the floor in the chair it's

298
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:50,339
helpful to have your upper body you know allowing your spine to be alert you want

299
00:51:50,339 --> 00:51:55,559
a balance between alertness awakeness you know that helps you focus

300
00:51:55,559 --> 00:52:02,700
and relaxness relaxation so sometimes what I do to kind of align

301
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:09,420
myself is I think of additional space between my top vertebra and I I tuck my

302
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:14,520
chin just a little bit not like this but just tiny bit down instead of you know

303
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:21,839
our head is really heavy and we can if we're focusing on meditation you can see people start to go like that

304
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:27,960
so um what I do to help myself is I lift my shoulders and then drop them

305
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:33,619
back feel that little bit of space in my spine

306
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:40,980
and feel this balance between alertness and relaxation

307
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:48,960
it takes time to find these things people who've been doing this for years take their time to settle into this

308
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:55,920
so feel free to continually you know tiny little adjustments or even big changes

309
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:03,119
you know if you're sitting here and like if I tried to sit here like this for the whole time I would be very hard on my

310
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:09,420
arthritis and I wouldn't be able to get up off the floor so another option we have are these

311
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:15,300
benches I have not frequently used a bench but

312
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:21,720
theoretically you can sit on it oh boy my knees won't do that but you can sit

313
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:27,000
on it and balance that way you can also turn one of these cushions

314
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,059
on its end and sit on it like this and I won't go all the way down because my knees won't

315
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:39,180
tolerate it um those give you a few options

316
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:44,819
and as I said um experiment with it

317
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:50,460
try different things until you find what helps you

318
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:56,480
find that balance between alertness and relaxation

319
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:10,260
especially if they have physical challenges may use lying down meditation

320
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:16,380
I'm not going to spend time on that today because that's more challenging it's hard for most of us not to fall

321
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:24,740
asleep so you can talk to us individually about that

322
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:32,880
if it's a little bit uncomfortable that's normal as we start doing this

323
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:38,180
it's unfamiliar and it can be a little bit uncomfortable

324
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:43,859
but often we'll just hang in with it for a little bit to notice what we can

325
00:54:43,859 --> 00:54:49,740
notice about that but please don't hurt yourself so if

326
00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:55,579
something is uncomfortable after a while a little while you can

327
00:54:55,579 --> 00:55:00,900
intentionally mindfully move so if I've been sitting and I find that I'm getting

328
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:08,880
uncomfortable I may recognize discomfort recognize I'm going to move and follow

329
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:15,200
what happens in my body as I make the adjustment

330
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:25,520
if when you get up from meditation your body hurts still is in pain

331
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:30,839
especially after five minutes that's a sign that your

332
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:38,839
possibly starting to injure yourself and you don't need to do that you can find other ways to support yourself

333
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:44,280
so um just a little bit of an overview

334
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:50,760
of all of this with any of it with attention to the

335
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:57,119
posture with attention to any of these anchors we're developing our ability to pay

336
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:02,460
attention to our immediate experience instead of being preoccupied with the

337
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:08,520
past or future as you study the monkey mind you'll find

338
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:15,780
that wow it's pretty frequent that we're thinking about the future of the past and it could be innocent enough we might

339
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:22,400
need to think a little bit about tomorrow but often our preoccupation with this

340
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:28,559
contributes to stress suffering fear and other things that

341
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:34,200
kind of keep us from being free so mindfulness is learning how to

342
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:42,059
overcome those preoccupations by coming into the lived experience right now what we're living right now

343
00:56:42,059 --> 00:56:49,920
it relies on this natural capacity we have for awareness and awareness by itself doesn't judge it

344
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:56,960
doesn't resist it doesn't cling it just notices

345
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:02,400
it doesn't mean that resistance or cleaning my judgment might not come up

346
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:10,380
they might and then we just notice those too as I said there's no problem it's like okay judging is going on

347
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:16,880
let me return my attention to what's happening in the breath right now

348
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:28,079
awareness of what's happening and this can include I'm distracted I feel

349
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:33,660
disrupted while I'm yesterday I was foggy all day it felt like I was my eyes

350
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:40,260
weren't focused and I was looking through a layer of fog all day long fine I included it in the mindfulness wow

351
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:45,300
foggy today thank you there's nothing that isn't supposed to

352
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:52,740
happen we're not trying to achieve an altered state we're not trying to be different than how we are right now

353
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:57,960
trying to become somebody in particular we are being with just the way things

354
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:03,780
are right now with everything that arises whether it's comfortable uncomfortable we like it we don't like

355
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:09,380
it it's all folded into mindfulness

356
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:16,380
and the freedom is actually in seeing that you know you're no longer enslaved by something if you

357
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:22,099
um recognize oh wow I was just thinking for the last 15 minutes okay awareness

358
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:26,900
thinking let me return to the breathing

359
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:33,480
there's a lot of um disentangling ourselves that can go on

360
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:39,119
from these conditioned habits and we can develop a friendlier more compassionate

361
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:44,700
relationship with the stuff that comes up I've sat down here before and found

362
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:49,920
that my breathing was just incredibly labored and I was like wow I'm just

363
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:58,200
working and breathing and instead of thinking oh I'm a bad meditator and that's wrong I got the ability over time

364
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:04,260
to go okay today for whatever reason the body is really grabbing air

365
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:10,200
or another time sitting down here thinking like crazy wow and then

366
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:15,359
recognizing you know what I just had a incredibly stimulating day no wonder the

367
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:23,400
mind is being pulled into thinking mindfulness of thinking return to whatever anchor I was using

368
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:30,660
so this is what I mean by we can be compassionate and friendly towards it it's just the way we human beings become

369
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:36,480
conditioned so mindfulness again just attentively

370
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:42,240
being present with What's Happening Here and Now on purpose no matter what it is

371
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:48,420
and it's called to practice in the same way that we practice a piano or a musical instrument

372
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:53,520
we we come back and we do it again do it again do it again

373
00:59:53,520 --> 01:00:00,000
um we don't we're not trying to get perfect the first time and there is no perfect or imperfect anyway we're just

374
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,240
practicing practicing awareness and it develops uh well if we can just

375
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:11,940
set aside any expectations any judgments if they come up like okay I've got an

376
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:19,859
expectation that I'm going to be oh peaceful okay it's an expectation and what's

377
01:00:19,859 --> 01:00:25,980
actually going on is okay there's some calm there's some energy in the body

378
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:31,079
the breath is coming to support the speaking

379
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:36,780
the body's pretty tired just you know this is what's happening

380
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:43,619
so uh with that that's just a little scope of why we're doing this what we

381
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:52,500
might be able to receive from it and the biggest part of it relax enjoy

382
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:59,460
the day appreciate anything you're discovering or aware of welcome

383
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:02,240
thank you

384
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:16,220
let's check in and notice how you're doing right now it's a lot to take in

385
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:29,460
we're gonna move into a breathing meditation but I'm wondering if you if

386
01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:34,859
you need a break can you nod your head if you think yeah

387
01:01:34,859 --> 01:01:40,400
yeah five minutes please go ahead and take care of yourselves

388
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:31,740
also just a reminder the sign up for if you want to practice discussion where

389
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:39,140
Sage is um near the end of the stage there's a place there to sign up for a practice discussion

390
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:45,020
foreign foreign

391
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:26,718
finding your posture finding your body

392
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:32,758
and giving it to your cushion the Earth your chair

393
01:08:32,759 --> 01:08:37,519
your bones to hold

394
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:46,400
letting things settle

395
01:08:57,540 --> 01:09:02,480
just in this simple direct way

396
01:09:02,940 --> 01:09:08,880
connecting with your Felts lived present moment

397
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:17,178
experience your mind will think

398
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:25,920
seeing if you can play with resting more awareness

399
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:31,440
kind of on the directness of your experience

400
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:35,600
start that with the breath this morning

401
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:43,440
seeing if the breath can be sort of in the center of your

402
01:09:43,440 --> 01:09:48,859
awareness the center of your experience

403
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:56,520
so it can be helpful to start with some longer

404
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:02,540
slower Fuller and conscious breaths

405
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:13,340
with the exhale it can be helpful to invite a Letting Go feeling

406
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:22,860
maybe with the inhale bringing your shoulders up toward your ears

407
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:28,020
kind of squeezing in that way and then with exhale

408
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:32,600
letting the shoulders fall back and down

409
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:58,400
breathing in I calm my body breathing out I calm my mind

410
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:27,560
so we'll become a little bit more intimate with our breathing experience

411
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:41,178
maybe just starting with knowing you're breathing in as you breathe in

412
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:47,420
on knowing you're breathing out as you breathe out

413
01:11:53,219 --> 01:11:59,300
and you can know this by the sensation and the feeling and the flow

414
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:08,280
and if it's helpful you can do a quiet noting in your mind of in with

415
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:14,000
inhale and out with exhale

416
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:20,940
seeing what's supportive for you what helps you connect more fully

417
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:25,280
with inhale and the exhale

418
01:13:44,280 --> 01:13:47,599
and if it's helpful

419
01:13:49,380 --> 01:13:55,380
you can also start to include awareness of the breath as it leaves and enters

420
01:13:55,380 --> 01:14:01,039
maybe noticing the temperature of the breath

421
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:09,679
where it touches your nostrils

422
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:18,920
how it feels different coming in versus out

423
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:37,340
you might also notice the feeling of it in your throat

424
01:14:45,659 --> 01:14:53,000
or feeling the chest as it expands with the inhale

425
01:14:53,460 --> 01:14:57,440
and contracts with the exhale

426
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:17,960
you may feel it in your belly

427
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:26,360
allowing giving your belly permission to expand with the inhale

428
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,639
for the belly to relax

429
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:04,620
and just being curious where it's easiest for you

430
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:11,840
to feel the flow of the breath what part of your experience of breathing

431
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:18,139
can you rest into more easily

432
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:45,179
and there's no need to try and stop from thinking or

433
01:16:45,179 --> 01:16:50,600
stop hearing or feeling

434
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:57,420
it's more about trying to invite the breath to be in the foreground or in the

435
01:16:57,420 --> 01:17:03,140
center of your experience your awareness

436
01:17:05,460 --> 01:17:10,460
just maybe holding a little bit closer to it

437
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:17,659
a little more intimate with that part of your experience

438
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:45,980
maybe just three breaths at a time

439
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:52,920
seeing if you can follow the full flow of the in and the out

440
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:56,480
for three breaths in a row

441
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:06,500
being easy with ourselves with our experience

442
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:13,219
soft and gentle with whatever's happening

443
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:37,520
foreign

444
01:23:04,520 --> 01:23:10,698
just in case there's some struggle in the mind

445
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:21,000
maybe just inviting the mind to help you attend

446
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:28,880
in a simple way to receiving the experience of breathing

447
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:38,420
and not trying to force it but more like this invitation

448
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:47,540
Maybe like if you have a puppy

449
01:23:48,659 --> 01:23:54,540
you gently pick it up and invited

450
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:58,219
to a particular area

451
01:24:01,140 --> 01:24:06,260
not yanking it around and knowing that uh

452
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:11,658
we need to be gentle and persistent

453
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:41,699
maybe in the way that we learn to enjoy the puppy

454
01:24:41,699 --> 01:24:50,300
while we're also watching over the puppy

455
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:06,380
that it needs a certain amount of room

456
01:25:14,219 --> 01:25:19,940
in the same way can we give our own minds a little bit of room

457
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:45,179
while staying connected to the experience that the body knows how to do

458
01:25:45,179 --> 01:25:51,600
the breathing that is so natural and the first thing we do when we come into this

459
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:57,659
world and the last thing we do when we leave

460
01:25:57,659 --> 01:26:01,920
this world is to Exhale

461
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:10,158
a constant companion

462
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:07,100
foreign

463
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:10,580
foreign

464
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:57,960
if you're new to meditation you may see us bowing at the end of meditation and

465
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:05,760
that's just a way of acknowledging um I I've heard it said that uh the light

466
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:11,159
in me sees the light in you so it's just an acknowledgment you don't have to do

467
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:16,320
it but I wanted people to know why we do that [Music]

468
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:21,900
um what we'll do next is have a chance to do a half hour of walking meditation

469
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:28,620
and when we do walking meditation the anchor is the feeling in the feet and

470
01:37:28,620 --> 01:37:36,420
legs or the just keeping the focus on the feet and legs or returning again and again and generally what's

471
01:37:36,420 --> 01:37:41,639
done is we find a place we can go crosswise in the hall here maybe we can

472
01:37:41,639 --> 01:37:48,000
move some chairs out of the way you can walk crosswise in the hall or you can walk Outdoors

473
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:53,659
on the front porch in the gravel on the sidewalks of the neighborhood

474
01:37:53,659 --> 01:38:01,320
and you pick a path maybe 15 to 20 steps along and instead of taking a walk what

475
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:08,400
we're doing is we're walking back and forth and that gives us an opportunity to stay

476
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:13,460
focused on this the feet and legs returning our attention

477
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:21,179
and to pick a pace that fits with the pace of mindfulness so this varies by person a lot of people

478
01:38:21,179 --> 01:38:28,800
like to slow down a little bit some people like to slow down a lot but whatever helps you to or supports

479
01:38:28,800 --> 01:38:34,739
you to return your attention to your feet and legs and it's not that other things won't

480
01:38:34,739 --> 01:38:40,679
happen you know you may your eyes may be caught by some bright flower and or you

481
01:38:40,679 --> 01:38:46,440
may pick up a sound of a bird you've never heard anything like that it's fine to pause

482
01:38:46,440 --> 01:38:55,199
notice what the awareness has been drawn to and ah hearing then come back focus

483
01:38:55,199 --> 01:39:01,739
again on the feet and legs and continue with the walking um

484
01:39:01,739 --> 01:39:07,500
so one thing about being out on the sidewalks is just please be considerate

485
01:39:07,500 --> 01:39:14,159
of neighbors who might be walking by and actually taking a walk and you know move out of the way so that they're not

486
01:39:14,159 --> 01:39:19,440
struggling to pass you um I would recommend not walking in the

487
01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:25,980
parking lot we'll be having practice discussions so please don't use this parking lot the

488
01:39:25,980 --> 01:39:32,100
dentist prefers we don't use the parking lot there or the one across the street so instead it's better to find space on

489
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:39,120
the sidewalk and um just taking your time and seeing what you discover as you walk some

490
01:39:39,120 --> 01:39:45,900
people I'll just demonstrate a little um often what I do is I pause at the

491
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:51,480
beginning of my walking path and allow my attention to collect and for some people they're just

492
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:55,820
noticing the movement of their feet and legs

493
01:39:57,239 --> 01:40:04,699
they come okay you know you know I noticed my mind drifted off to a sound outside

494
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:13,280
back to the feet and legs I come to the end of my path

495
01:40:14,159 --> 01:40:21,659
take a breath and pause and notice the movement of my feet and

496
01:40:21,659 --> 01:40:27,960
legs as I turn around for other people sometimes the way I'd

497
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:34,380
like to do it is I like to feel the lifting the motion the settling of the

498
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:42,260
foot against the ground lifting the other foot the motion of the leg forward

499
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:47,699
settling the foot against the ground so you can do it in a more General way or a

500
01:40:47,699 --> 01:40:51,020
more focused way like that

501
01:40:53,900 --> 01:40:59,280
a couple of people have signed up for practice discussions during that time so

502
01:40:59,280 --> 01:41:04,800
Tanya and I will be in the back parking lot in chairs back there to meet with

503
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:10,100
you if you signed up so meanwhile please enjoy the meditation

504
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:16,679
we will come back at 11 35 and if you're somewhere nearby Richard will ring a

505
01:41:16,679 --> 01:41:22,260
bell about five minutes before it's time to come back you may not hear it if you're further

506
01:41:22,260 --> 01:41:29,580
away so just take your watch above all relax and enjoy see what you

507
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:34,940
discover about what happens in the mind and body as you walk

508
01:41:35,159 --> 01:41:42,380
and we'll see you again at 11 35. foreign

509
02:07:09,980 --> 02:07:12,980
thank you

510
02:11:12,920 --> 02:11:18,599
thank you foreign

511
02:11:55,380 --> 02:11:58,380
foreign

512
02:12:13,739 --> 02:12:21,599
so now we'll have a period of focus on body meditation and I'll start

513
02:12:21,599 --> 02:12:28,860
with a few comments what we're doing today is we're building our ability to notice what's happening

514
02:12:28,860 --> 02:12:36,119
right here and now we're starting with the breath as an anchor or the movement of our feet and

515
02:12:36,119 --> 02:12:42,179
legs and walking meditation as an anchor using those anchors to stabilize the

516
02:12:42,179 --> 02:12:47,580
attention and bring it into the Here and Now we're also noticing when the attention

517
02:12:47,580 --> 02:12:52,340
drifts away from the here and now and when it comes back

518
02:12:52,980 --> 02:12:59,219
so we're going to move in this next meditation from the sensations of breathing

519
02:12:59,219 --> 02:13:05,520
to a broader sense of feeling in the body

520
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:09,800
the rest of our physical experience

521
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:19,219
the reason we do this or what's great about it is that the body is always operating in the present moment

522
02:13:19,619 --> 02:13:24,719
breathing in the present moment the hearts beating in the present moment everything's going on in the present

523
02:13:24,719 --> 02:13:29,760
moment in the body and when we bring the mind to those

524
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:35,579
things that are happening in the body right now they're working in Harmony and this is

525
02:13:35,579 --> 02:13:41,460
different than for example if you sit your body down here and your mind is planning what you'd like to eat for

526
02:13:41,460 --> 02:13:46,739
dinner and thinking about what happened at work yesterday then these two are not

527
02:13:46,739 --> 02:13:49,219
in harmony

528
02:13:53,040 --> 02:13:59,099
so first we'll in this meditation we'll take in sensations of breathing as fully

529
02:13:59,099 --> 02:14:06,900
as possible and then we'll turn to the body I want to make the distinction that the

530
02:14:06,900 --> 02:14:13,739
mindfulness or awareness we're bringing is not in itself commentary or judgment

531
02:14:13,739 --> 02:14:20,099
or evaluation of the breathing or Sensations in the body

532
02:14:20,099 --> 02:14:27,360
and not judging ourselves we're just training ourselves to notice Here and Now how the breathing is

533
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:35,040
feeling sensing sensations of the breathing sensing Sensations in the body

534
02:14:35,040 --> 02:14:40,400
we could call that knowing the breathing or knowing the body

535
02:14:40,500 --> 02:14:47,520
commentary and judgment may happen anyway if they come up you can just notice ah

536
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:53,460
I'm judging myself a little bit and then maybe release that

537
02:14:53,460 --> 02:15:00,300
relax and return to the breathing or the body

538
02:15:00,300 --> 02:15:05,940
for some of us we spend so much time thinking

539
02:15:05,940 --> 02:15:11,159
that it may you know sometimes we're not so aware of our body and it may be a

540
02:15:11,159 --> 02:15:16,679
slow Reawakening don't worry if that's the case just allow yourself to notice

541
02:15:16,679 --> 02:15:23,520
what you can and sometimes we can use a word like

542
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:29,940
here to bring ourselves back to the body Here and Now

543
02:15:29,940 --> 02:15:37,139
so I'll go into a guided meditation now giving yourself a moment to re-establish

544
02:15:37,139 --> 02:15:43,440
your posture in a way that's alert

545
02:15:43,440 --> 02:15:49,800
alert spine and also relaxed and taking time

546
02:15:49,800 --> 02:15:57,320
to make those little adjustments maybe rolling the shoulders

547
02:15:59,040 --> 02:16:02,000
in the out breath

548
02:16:06,780 --> 02:16:12,599
perhaps taking a few longer slower breaths

549
02:16:12,599 --> 02:16:15,599
foreign

550
02:16:43,821 --> 02:16:49,800
letting the breathing return to normal whatever that is in this moment there's

551
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:53,598
no right or wrong way to breathe

552
02:17:05,639 --> 02:17:12,978
it can be helpful to scan the body from head to foot

553
02:17:12,979 --> 02:17:18,120
noticing Sensations in the head right now

554
02:17:18,120 --> 02:17:22,160
the scalp the forehead

555
02:17:23,940 --> 02:17:32,939
the cheeks and jaw perhaps bringing some ease to them

556
02:17:32,940 --> 02:17:38,779
perhaps letting the jaw drop open a little relaxing it

557
02:17:40,019 --> 02:17:45,780
with a mask on sometimes I find I breathe with my mouth open

558
02:17:45,781 --> 02:17:52,760
with mask off I gently bring the lips back together

559
02:17:55,880 --> 02:18:02,820
and letting the attention flow down the neck to the shoulders

560
02:18:02,821 --> 02:18:11,340
perhaps allowing the shoulders to drop a little letting the weight of the arms

561
02:18:11,340 --> 02:18:17,160
and hands rest comfortably

562
02:18:17,160 --> 02:18:21,678
on your legs or lap

563
02:18:29,639 --> 02:18:38,300
letting attention Glide down the back upper middle lower back

564
02:18:39,479 --> 02:18:45,478
it's there if it's possible to soften

565
02:18:45,479 --> 02:18:51,920
an area you can soften it or if there's activity there that

566
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:59,120
remains they're simply noticing that it's there it's not a problem

567
02:19:00,080 --> 02:19:04,399
allowing whatever is present

568
02:19:08,099 --> 02:19:13,700
with the next exhale perhaps relaxing the belly

569
02:19:14,719 --> 02:19:19,800
softening the hips if it's possible

570
02:19:19,800 --> 02:19:25,558
letting gravity receive the weight of the legs and feet

571
02:19:25,559 --> 02:19:29,239
against the floor

572
02:19:46,321 --> 02:19:54,080
you may become more broadly aware of the entire body sitting here

573
02:19:58,680 --> 02:20:04,220
you might feel a sense of aliveness

574
02:20:04,620 --> 02:20:10,819
a little bit of vibration or pulsing

575
02:20:12,120 --> 02:20:17,939
some energy or some relaxation

576
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:26,000
sleepiness or alertness warmth

577
02:20:27,380 --> 02:20:31,700
cool air in some places

578
02:20:36,180 --> 02:20:43,040
it's allowing yourself to take in that broader sense of the body

579
02:20:46,260 --> 02:20:49,760
sitting here in the hall

580
02:21:04,859 --> 02:21:07,859
foreign

581
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:21,000
just to get a idea or a feeling for what it is to

582
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:28,200
feel the sensations of the body for a moment turning the attention to

583
02:21:28,200 --> 02:21:32,840
the sensations in the right hand

584
02:21:33,899 --> 02:21:40,620
you might feel a light pressure of where the hand is in

585
02:21:40,620 --> 02:21:46,460
contact with your leg or in contact with your other hand

586
02:21:53,880 --> 02:22:00,200
perhaps there's some warmth in certain areas

587
02:22:04,859 --> 02:22:10,640
perhaps coolness in other areas of the hand

588
02:22:20,760 --> 02:22:28,560
perhaps you can feel a little pulsing or vibration in the fingertips

589
02:22:28,560 --> 02:22:32,000
or somewhere in the hand

590
02:22:41,640 --> 02:22:48,920
foreign taking in whatever Sensations are present in the right hand

591
02:22:49,020 --> 02:22:56,760
and just that's what we mean when we say paying attention to Sensations in the

592
02:22:56,760 --> 02:23:05,220
body sometimes we can be aware of an absence of sensation in a particular area of the

593
02:23:05,220 --> 02:23:09,500
body and that's also fine

594
02:23:16,319 --> 02:23:22,680
to a broader sense of the overall body as it sits here the whole

595
02:23:22,680 --> 02:23:24,920
body

596
02:23:40,859 --> 02:23:48,500
becoming aware of how the body experiences the sensations of breathing

597
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:59,420
it may be through sensations of the chest

598
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:03,619
rising and falling

599
02:24:12,180 --> 02:24:19,040
or perhaps you experience the belly expanding

600
02:24:20,640 --> 02:24:24,080
and then releasing

601
02:24:37,560 --> 02:24:47,300
or Sensations flowing in and out of the nose or throat

602
02:24:57,260 --> 02:25:03,200
wherever you feel the physical sensations of breathing

603
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:07,399
centering on those Sensations

604
02:25:41,460 --> 02:25:48,420
if there's any commentary or evaluation simply noticing it

605
02:25:48,420 --> 02:25:55,859
and gently returning attention centering it on the sensations of

606
02:25:55,859 --> 02:26:03,619
breathing in and breathing out

607
02:26:12,420 --> 02:26:18,420
if it's difficult for you being with the breathing simply acknowledge the difficulty

608
02:26:18,420 --> 02:26:22,520
and be with it as best you can

609
02:26:41,840 --> 02:26:48,420
returning to the sensations of breathing wherever it's most prominently felt in

610
02:26:48,420 --> 02:26:50,840
the body

611
02:27:20,540 --> 02:27:26,280
then letting go of any effort to be with the breathing

612
02:27:26,280 --> 02:27:36,318
and allowing your attention to turn to the strongest or most obvious Sensations in the body

613
02:27:42,960 --> 02:27:49,080
it might be the feeling of your hands resting against your thighs or your feet

614
02:27:49,080 --> 02:27:53,359
against the floor or cushion

615
02:28:02,520 --> 02:28:09,780
maybe something else if it disappears as you are aware of it

616
02:28:09,780 --> 02:28:15,479
allowing your attention to be present

617
02:28:15,479 --> 02:28:21,920
for the next prominent Sensation that arises

618
02:28:58,740 --> 02:29:05,340
the intention could return to the sensations of breathing if that is the

619
02:29:05,340 --> 02:29:12,080
most prominent until something else becomes

620
02:29:12,359 --> 02:29:17,061
the most pronounced in the attention

621
02:29:17,819 --> 02:29:21,920
in sensation in the body

622
02:30:14,520 --> 02:30:17,119
right

623
02:30:51,899 --> 02:30:59,880
if there is discomfort in the body simply noticing that

624
02:30:59,880 --> 02:31:06,060
I need to try to get rid of it or to focus in on it

625
02:31:06,060 --> 02:31:12,500
just included in a global sense of the body sitting here

626
02:31:13,740 --> 02:31:21,500
and allow your attention to take in other Sensations in the body

627
02:31:23,040 --> 02:31:25,819
as well

628
02:31:48,840 --> 02:31:51,380
here

629
02:32:31,080 --> 02:32:39,920
if the attention is drifted away into thinking or somewhere else sounds

630
02:32:40,080 --> 02:32:46,500
simply noting where it went and gently returning to the most

631
02:32:46,500 --> 02:32:51,920
prominent sensation in the body right now

632
02:33:32,760 --> 02:33:34,880
thank you

633
02:33:38,880 --> 02:33:41,000
okay

634
02:33:55,740 --> 02:34:03,960
if there's a need to adjust your posture remembering to be mindful

635
02:34:03,960 --> 02:34:11,939
as you feel the need as you begin the movement and during the movement just feeling the

636
02:34:11,939 --> 02:34:15,261
sensations of moving

637
02:34:55,260 --> 02:35:02,060
all right if a sensation in the body is getting very strong

638
02:35:05,700 --> 02:35:11,899
it's possible to be with it from a greater distance

639
02:35:11,899 --> 02:35:17,399
imagining being a bird high above the building

640
02:35:17,399 --> 02:35:21,859
and taking in the strong sensation

641
02:35:22,439 --> 02:35:25,221

02:35:41,819 --> 02:35:45,801
if it's getting to be too much

644
02:35:47,160 --> 02:35:52,620
if something is very strong firstly be hanging out with it for a few

645
02:35:52,620 --> 02:35:59,120
minutes and then if it's wearing the mind or

646
02:35:59,120 --> 02:36:05,460
exhausting the body then mindfully moving to a more

647
02:36:05,460 --> 02:36:12,300
comfortable posture staying with the sensations of the

648
02:36:12,300 --> 02:36:18,380
movement and noticing what changes after the movement

649
02:36:40,859 --> 02:36:43,280

661
02:42:42,420 --> 02:42:48,660
just a few comments afterwards it's usual in our tradition that

662
02:42:48,660 --> 02:42:55,620
breathing is placed at the center the grounding anchor at the beginning and

663
02:42:55,620 --> 02:43:02,220
there are some people for whom the breath is useful and some For Whom the

664
02:43:02,220 --> 02:43:09,120
breath is not so useful or there can be periods of time where it's not so when I first began practicing

665
02:43:09,120 --> 02:43:15,479
I wasn't so able to use breathing so I use the body as my anchor until I

666
02:43:15,479 --> 02:43:21,300
became my attention became stable enough over a period of time for breathing for

667
02:43:21,300 --> 02:43:29,520
me to turn to breathing um so often breathing is used or the body

668
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:36,840
may be used until another experience becomes more compelling or prominent in the attention and then we turn our

669
02:43:36,840 --> 02:43:43,800
attention to that and then perhaps return to the Anchor now sometimes what comes

670
02:43:43,800 --> 02:43:50,340
up is Pleasant sometimes it's not so pleasant and as I mentioned there can be discomfort in the body

671
02:43:50,340 --> 02:43:56,399
it may not use bees to this posture it can take a while to become stronger more

672
02:43:56,399 --> 02:44:02,100
flexible or can just be conditions of that particular day or that particular

673
02:44:02,100 --> 02:44:05,060
phase of life

674
02:44:07,260 --> 02:44:13,760
There's No Agenda again for what you pay attention to whatever is coming up

675
02:44:13,760 --> 02:44:19,800
arthritis Sensations in the knee mindful of that

676
02:44:19,800 --> 02:44:25,040
returning to the breathing and mindful of that

677
02:44:25,560 --> 02:44:30,660
just using whatever anchor you're using is a way to come back and stabilize the

678
02:44:30,660 --> 02:44:37,859
attention there's no hurry with any of this it's sometimes called a purification process

679
02:44:37,859 --> 02:44:43,800
which means that we're becoming aware of all the ways we've been conditioned and

680
02:44:43,800 --> 02:44:50,760
sometimes things are coming up like poison coming out of a wound and we're experiencing that

681
02:44:50,760 --> 02:44:56,840
so we're just noticing whatever is prominent allowing it getting to know it better

682
02:44:56,840 --> 02:45:02,819
being present with it and as I mentioned if it's sometimes too

683
02:45:02,819 --> 02:45:11,640
much it's okay to take a different view like move out to a distance in our attention or not not try to hammer into

684
02:45:11,640 --> 02:45:17,000
it or get rid of it I'm just feeling it and if necessary

685
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:25,260
mindfully Shifting the posture and noticing how it felt during and

686
02:45:25,260 --> 02:45:32,460
after so you're encouraged when discomfort comes up to hang in there with it for a

687
02:45:32,460 --> 02:45:39,319
little bit or even for a long while but not to injure yourself

688
02:45:40,680 --> 02:45:46,740
so being present with these Sensations in the body again and again practicing

689
02:45:46,740 --> 02:45:54,000
like we're practicing an instrument um can begin to help the body relax over

690
02:45:54,000 --> 02:46:00,359
time I went through many Retreats at the beginning years of my practice where it

691
02:46:00,359 --> 02:46:05,780
felt like the whole retreat was working with discomfort in the body and then

692
02:46:05,780 --> 02:46:13,160
over time that became not the case my body was more relaxed

693
02:46:14,760 --> 02:46:22,319
so this idea of staying unified with mind and body being present here and now as the body is here

694
02:46:22,319 --> 02:46:28,819
and now we start to become aware of Habitual

695
02:46:28,819 --> 02:46:35,340
preferences Cravings aversions judgments all the stuff that comes up

696
02:46:35,340 --> 02:46:40,680
that is being purified and we get a chance to understand it

697
02:46:40,680 --> 02:46:46,800
more deeply so thank you very much for your practice of

698
02:46:46,800 --> 02:46:50,060
mindfulness and body

699
02:46:51,899 --> 02:46:58,260
so just checking in with yourself right now noticing what you need Maybe

700
02:46:58,260 --> 02:47:03,479
and where you're at we're going to have a lunch break at 12 35 so if you're

701
02:47:03,479 --> 02:47:09,960
feeling hungry just you know orienting we have a period

702
02:47:09,960 --> 02:47:14,359
of time now for some questions

703
02:47:15,479 --> 02:47:21,300
reflections but I want to just sort of let you know

704
02:47:21,300 --> 02:47:29,160
that that's what's going to happen so if you feel like you need to stand up and go to the bathroom or maybe it's better

705
02:47:29,160 --> 02:47:35,100
for you to stay in silence so you want to go and do some walking during this period

706
02:47:35,100 --> 02:47:44,060
please take care of your practice right track track what is needed for you

707
02:47:46,140 --> 02:47:52,380
one of the things that can happen is we get more and more sensitive to

708
02:47:52,380 --> 02:47:57,021
the talking as we're quiet

709
02:48:12,540 --> 02:48:19,579
does anyone have um any questions or Reflections they'd like to share

710
02:48:27,319 --> 02:48:33,780
during the walking meditation one of the things I noticed uh

711
02:48:33,780 --> 02:48:41,340
was that when I was putting my attention on my feet and my legs I noticed

712
02:48:41,340 --> 02:48:47,760
just all the little tiny adjustments things were were happening just to maintain balance

713
02:48:47,760 --> 02:48:56,040
so I was noticing how wobbly I felt and then I or how wobbly I was and then

714
02:48:56,040 --> 02:49:04,080
I started putting attention on just the act of willing myself to move forward

715
02:49:04,080 --> 02:49:09,780
uh more gracefully so to speak and when I

716
02:49:09,780 --> 02:49:15,540
put my intention on that intention of doing that my body just naturally did it

717
02:49:15,540 --> 02:49:22,920
and I thought that was really interesting that's great great to observe sort of

718
02:49:22,920 --> 02:49:29,939
essentially one you know we're bringing our awareness more intimately to something

719
02:49:29,939 --> 02:49:36,359
we maybe don't usually pay attention to right and then you start to see all that

720
02:49:36,359 --> 02:49:41,640
goes into walking and how it can feel quite wobbly

721
02:49:41,640 --> 02:49:48,359
um and then it was it sounds like it was uh your mind responded well

722
02:49:48,359 --> 02:49:54,479
to the kind of in the invocation or the intention the you know

723
02:49:54,479 --> 02:49:59,939
to film Marty's or more smooth in the walking

724
02:49:59,939 --> 02:50:05,819
and that was interesting for you to see just how it happened you put in an intention

725
02:50:05,819 --> 02:50:12,359
and something happened and you got to witness it it wasn't like you were in there doing all these little things

726
02:50:12,359 --> 02:50:18,560
right so is that uh a fair summary yeah it's like the body

727
02:50:18,560 --> 02:50:26,899
had a intelligence of its own that was just sort of carrying out my wishes of

728
02:50:26,899 --> 02:50:32,899
more naturalness and it just it was interesting

729
02:50:33,660 --> 02:50:38,939
body does have an intelligence of its own it's a wonderful thing to witness

730
02:50:38,939 --> 02:50:42,920
for sure thank you

731
02:50:43,979 --> 02:50:49,800
over here Richard if you want to say your name before you

732
02:50:49,800 --> 02:50:54,960
speak feel free hello everyone my name is Abhishek I was

733
02:50:54,960 --> 02:51:01,920
able to actually write happy but I see you know therapy sitting there side I'll write the full name okay yeah I'm happy

734
02:51:01,920 --> 02:51:07,560
to be here it's I haven't been here in a long time and just to add to what you

735
02:51:07,560 --> 02:51:15,840
said Corey I was diagnosed with gout more than two months ago it's been tough but

736
02:51:15,840 --> 02:51:24,420
I'm trying like this walk just a simple walk kind of made me realize where it hurts like this

737
02:51:24,420 --> 02:51:31,080
deep realization I've I've had it for two months but I didn't have that realization so I would push myself to walk more but

738
02:51:31,080 --> 02:51:38,280
you know just kind of figuring out how the leg balances things out and varied hurts and

739
02:51:38,280 --> 02:51:43,521
where it doesn't hurt was insightful yeah yeah

740
02:51:44,939 --> 02:51:51,800
foreign about walking in the hall

741
02:51:51,800 --> 02:51:59,960
is it's okay to wear shoes in the hall if you need them for support okay

742
02:52:03,600 --> 02:52:08,760
and it is so interesting as our bodies change over time which they do with this

743
02:52:08,760 --> 02:52:16,380
and that to notice the different Sensations and the different compensations that happen and

744
02:52:16,380 --> 02:52:22,859
pretty amazing the tiny little adjustments that the body's sensitive to like ah walking on

745
02:52:22,859 --> 02:52:26,660
the inside of my foot the outside

746
02:52:41,460 --> 02:52:47,220
I'm wondering how it is when there's a prolonged period of silence for you

747
02:52:47,220 --> 02:52:55,319
during the meditation periods what are you noticing Corey thumbs up

748
02:52:55,319 --> 02:53:00,380
okay Jan thumbs up

749
02:53:01,920 --> 02:53:08,240
anybody struggling more when there's a longer period of quiet or is it okay just getting some feedback here about

750
02:53:08,240 --> 02:53:14,760
how much guidance we're providing right yeah what

751
02:53:14,760 --> 02:53:20,600
oh thank you I think my thoughts tend to wander when there's more silence

752
02:53:20,600 --> 02:53:29,040
yeah but then like when um you say something else then I can bring my attention back yes

753
02:53:29,040 --> 02:53:35,700
what have you noticed in your own you know have you you you're brand new yeah

754
02:53:35,700 --> 02:53:43,200
did you notice anything else that you did that helped or when you noticed on your own you were thinking

755
02:53:43,200 --> 02:53:49,319
um how was that for you when I noticed that I was thinking I

756
02:53:49,319 --> 02:53:54,899
like thought that I'm thinking and then I would remember like what it what it

757
02:53:54,899 --> 02:54:00,840
was that I was focusing on before I would try to bring myself back to that beautiful and

758
02:54:00,840 --> 02:54:06,180
um so sometimes we can have that in a very simple way

759
02:54:06,180 --> 02:54:12,420
or sometimes there can be added judgments to the fact that we were thinking

760
02:54:12,420 --> 02:54:19,080
yeah yeah I think that would come up like I would feel like a little bad

761
02:54:19,080 --> 02:54:24,420
a few times felt like I was drifting away from what I was focusing

762
02:54:24,420 --> 02:54:30,120
on so one thing that has helped me is um

763
02:54:30,120 --> 02:54:37,939
kind of just to know that the moment we wake up to thinking we're aware already

764
02:54:37,939 --> 02:54:46,500
and that it's an opportunity to then sort of oh just appreciate oh

765
02:54:46,500 --> 02:54:53,760
it happened awareness came back I mean I'm aware and and sort of choose to rest into that

766
02:54:53,760 --> 02:55:00,899
and that sort of reinforces it um it is tempting to get critical but I

767
02:55:00,899 --> 02:55:08,240
think that reinforces being critical as opposed to reinforcing just the

768
02:55:08,240 --> 02:55:13,979
Gratitude or receptivity the appreciation that we could become

769
02:55:13,979 --> 02:55:22,140
aware again um yeah so there's just just like wow

770
02:55:22,140 --> 02:55:27,779
what's that's cool that's cool all of a sudden I'm aware

771
02:55:27,779 --> 02:55:33,479
again sort of like and then like oh like

772
02:55:33,479 --> 02:55:38,779
okay yeah this is gonna this is

773
02:55:38,779 --> 02:55:45,560
that's what the Mind does it thinks So yeah thank you thank you

774
02:55:45,560 --> 02:55:52,859
uh very experienced teachers have been teaching for decades say wow you know and that meditation my

775
02:55:52,859 --> 02:56:01,140
mind was just thinking and thinking and they keep coming back keep coming back keep coming back so it's not a problem

776
02:56:01,140 --> 02:56:07,699
which is great to discover and even when we go oh judging not a problem

777
02:56:10,920 --> 02:56:18,960
um my name is Noel and this is more of a meta observation about my experience

778
02:56:18,960 --> 02:56:26,000
today um because of covid and the center shutting down

779
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:33,540
after I was very very involved here it was a great loss for me and now that

780
02:56:33,540 --> 02:56:41,700
it's reopening I'm very anxious that it be successful and it's reopening and

781
02:56:41,700 --> 02:56:48,180
um I I experience personal disappointment when I saw that not a lot of people were here

782
02:56:48,180 --> 02:56:53,399
and I began to feel like perhaps you as Leaders felt like this is a lot of

783
02:56:53,399 --> 02:57:02,460
effort for 10 people and I know this is just me and I began to gallop into a

784
02:57:02,460 --> 02:57:10,439
sense of um what if we can't restore its figure here and that I didn't ever have that

785
02:57:10,439 --> 02:57:15,479
fear of this collapsing before covid and

786
02:57:15,479 --> 02:57:22,160
this is new for me to feel this want of of

787
02:57:22,160 --> 02:57:29,580
success and um and so uh you don't need to address this

788
02:57:29,580 --> 02:57:35,100
because I know this is just me but this is what I sit with now

789
02:57:35,100 --> 02:57:40,140
um and it does it does

790
02:57:40,140 --> 02:57:47,220
um um bruise a little bit of my pleasure just

791
02:57:47,220 --> 02:57:53,040
being here because of my anxiety that this um

792
02:57:53,040 --> 02:57:58,560
uh Sangha be restored

793
02:57:58,560 --> 02:58:04,979
and its Vitality be restored and that's what I sit with now when I'm

794
02:58:04,979 --> 02:58:11,760
here so thank you so Noel I just want to thank you for sharing you know that's a

795
02:58:11,760 --> 02:58:19,380
lot of mindful awareness of what is actually going on and you may not be the only person who's experiencing some you

796
02:58:19,380 --> 02:58:24,420
know responses to covet and noticing what the emotions are sitting here with

797
02:58:24,420 --> 02:58:31,800
the hall looking like this and also I just want to share that for

798
02:58:31,800 --> 02:58:37,620
me even if one person shows up I'm delighted to be with that one person

799
02:58:37,620 --> 02:58:43,500
and this song is very healthy very healthy so

800
02:58:43,500 --> 02:58:46,220
thank you

801
02:58:48,540 --> 02:58:55,439
yeah there's a lot of tenderness there Noel so maybe just

802
02:58:55,439 --> 02:59:02,520
um really holding yourself dear you know holding the care that you're

803
02:59:02,520 --> 02:59:07,680
expressing dearly the preciousness of the practice and the

804
02:59:07,680 --> 02:59:14,420
Sangha yeah and then you know

805
02:59:18,960 --> 02:59:22,340
great thank you

806
02:59:24,740 --> 02:59:30,240
hi my name is Nena and I um wonder if

807
02:59:30,240 --> 02:59:36,920
you have any additional ideas in terms of this particular

808
02:59:36,920 --> 02:59:42,000
process I go through after sitting So eventually

809
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:47,520
when I said to meditate a pressure or a

810
02:59:47,520 --> 02:59:53,279
pain comes to my heart and this is like I can sit for hours

811
02:59:53,279 --> 03:00:00,840
with pain in my heart and I am there is the um

812
03:00:00,840 --> 03:00:06,060
because of like somatic experience in training and so on

813
03:00:06,060 --> 03:00:12,180
I stay there and I say to it

814
03:00:12,180 --> 03:00:18,960
not that I want to disregard but I'm gonna go to other places in my

815
03:00:18,960 --> 03:00:24,720
body that are comfortable right now all right and

816
03:00:24,720 --> 03:00:30,720
um and so I go maybe to the back or to the hips or to the feet places where are

817
03:00:30,720 --> 03:00:37,140
more quiet and um

818
03:00:37,140 --> 03:00:42,600
there is so perhaps there is not perhaps there is

819
03:00:42,600 --> 03:00:50,580
a kind of impatience happening within me that this is something that that this is

820
03:00:50,580 --> 03:00:56,359
what it has come to be after sitting for for a long time

821
03:00:56,359 --> 03:01:00,681
and and so

822
03:01:02,000 --> 03:01:07,080
my question is sometimes

823
03:01:07,080 --> 03:01:14,840
coming back to the breath I think has caused a certain amount of

824
03:01:14,880 --> 03:01:22,080
um maybe disregarding maybe a certain amount of

825
03:01:22,080 --> 03:01:28,620
like lack of a deeper relationship to that which is coming up which is

826
03:01:28,620 --> 03:01:34,319
challenging and and I eventually thought that I had

827
03:01:34,319 --> 03:01:39,181
created a spiritual bypass

828
03:01:41,939 --> 03:01:47,340
and I this is probably you know and I just wonder

829
03:01:47,340 --> 03:01:53,340
um in terms of how does if you have any any suggestions

830
03:01:53,340 --> 03:01:58,740
any kind that take on this and how

831
03:01:58,740 --> 03:02:04,859
do I said and lightly people who might have experiences like me said

832
03:02:04,859 --> 03:02:10,200
in a way that will not create that spiritual bypass

833
03:02:10,200 --> 03:02:15,240
yeah or perhaps you know redirecting but at the same time

834
03:02:15,240 --> 03:02:22,101
creating a kind of deeper relationship with with what's happening

835
03:02:22,979 --> 03:02:29,760
so what I'm hearing you say I'm just going to State it back to you a little to make sure that I'm clear so you've

836
03:02:29,760 --> 03:02:35,399
sat for some time with a pain in your heart and you can sit for a long time

837
03:02:35,399 --> 03:02:41,340
with it and then as a result of somatic experiencing training you became aware

838
03:02:41,340 --> 03:02:47,580
that sometimes it's useful to turn the attention towards other areas of the

839
03:02:47,580 --> 03:02:55,020
body that might be not as heavy a pain and that's a way to titrate an intense

840
03:02:55,020 --> 03:03:02,220
experience that can be useful but it sounds like over time you became concerned that that could become a kind

841
03:03:02,220 --> 03:03:09,600
of spiritual bypass getting around what this is trying to tell you and you were wondering whether there's a

842
03:03:09,600 --> 03:03:15,540
way to be with this more fully and understand it come to be with it is am I

843
03:03:15,540 --> 03:03:22,380
understanding correctly very much so except sometimes my concern

844
03:03:22,380 --> 03:03:31,460
is that the instructions in their mindfulness Community might be what could also has has this spiritual bypass

845
03:03:31,460 --> 03:03:37,620
yeah just like coming back to their breath coming back to the breath yeah

846
03:03:37,620 --> 03:03:43,800
you know in in not creating a deeper relationship to that which is coming up

847
03:03:43,800 --> 03:03:51,120
and as a result we are in a layer of okayness and underneath all of this pain

848
03:03:51,120 --> 03:03:57,600
right that that I come with yes so your point into something very

849
03:03:57,600 --> 03:04:03,120
important that it may be unfamiliar to people who are newer to practice but

850
03:04:03,120 --> 03:04:08,760
this idea of spiritual bypass is when you you know take something that's part

851
03:04:08,760 --> 03:04:15,479
of a spiritual tradition as a way to escape some of the deeper issues in your life

852
03:04:15,479 --> 03:04:20,520
your body your heart so you know I could think that I'm just a really great

853
03:04:20,520 --> 03:04:25,620
Buddhist sitting here with my breath and ignoring that a relationship's falling

854
03:04:25,620 --> 03:04:32,700
apart or something and I could just it could feel very soothing to come back to the breath however and so you're right

855
03:04:32,700 --> 03:04:38,000
that this training has that sometimes that could happen to people

856
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:43,620
don't be afraid of coming to the breath coming to the breath but as you get into

857
03:04:43,620 --> 03:04:50,160
it more deeply as Nina has for many years you this is that other layer we were

858
03:04:50,160 --> 03:04:57,779
talking about conditioned experience habits things in our lives that have happened trauma all kinds of experiences

859
03:04:57,779 --> 03:05:07,080
may present themselves to awareness and we over time can become aware of oh boy

860
03:05:07,080 --> 03:05:13,220
I keep skipping around this but maybe I need to be with it maybe I need to understand it

861
03:05:13,220 --> 03:05:20,040
so because you're so alert to the possibility I have this feeling that

862
03:05:20,040 --> 03:05:25,620
you're not going to fall into spiritual bypass for too long you're raising it right now it's like I wonder if I'm

863
03:05:25,620 --> 03:05:33,420
doing that so I just encourage you to continue to to deepen with it if it feels like for

864
03:05:33,420 --> 03:05:40,319
you I'm not going to just keep kind of stepping around it by feeling sensation

865
03:05:40,319 --> 03:05:45,420
in the body or breathing I need to be with this thing and be patient with how

866
03:05:45,420 --> 03:05:52,140
much it hurts and maybe occasionally not as a demand or an agenda but

867
03:05:52,140 --> 03:05:57,540
occasionally drop in what is this

868
03:05:57,540 --> 03:06:03,720
you know and let it reveal itself to you over time so I noticed over a long

869
03:06:03,720 --> 03:06:10,979
period of time sitting here every time I would sit here I would gradually end up in this

870
03:06:10,979 --> 03:06:16,080
position where one shoulder was this shoulder was tight

871
03:06:16,080 --> 03:06:22,560
and I was in pain and over and I'd be like what the heck

872
03:06:22,560 --> 03:06:27,899
I thought I could relax at the end of a sitting I'd be like that

873
03:06:27,899 --> 03:06:34,020
again and over many years it took a long time to become aware

874
03:06:34,020 --> 03:06:41,160
that this is sometimes called guarding the heart that the musculature kind of

875
03:06:41,160 --> 03:06:46,620
is protecting that little heart that's been hurt so much or been through so

876
03:06:46,620 --> 03:06:54,240
much in life and over many years just being aware guarding the heart what's in that heart

877
03:06:54,240 --> 03:07:01,319
what's going on with that heart uh the body began to relax so that now that doesn't happen so much 18 years in

878
03:07:01,319 --> 03:07:08,100
that doesn't happen very often so it's this slow peeling back and you

879
03:07:08,100 --> 03:07:15,479
know I really am appreciating your awareness of this issue of when is it appropriate to

880
03:07:15,479 --> 03:07:21,479
stay with it so am I understanding you and is is this helpful yeah exactly how

881
03:07:21,479 --> 03:07:29,279
much attention what is appropriate to give attention to something that is challenging in in the neurology a bit

882
03:07:29,279 --> 03:07:36,420
that it said becoming Amplified or you know how how to I don't

883
03:07:36,420 --> 03:07:41,580
understand this is kind of a complex situation but but it is you know how to

884
03:07:41,580 --> 03:07:47,460
find that balance between the neurology the amplification of an experience

885
03:07:47,460 --> 03:07:55,620
and and how to kind of work with it yeah yeah I think um one of the will shift here

886
03:07:55,620 --> 03:08:00,899
after I say this but um I think one thing to really pay

887
03:08:00,899 --> 03:08:06,420
attention to Naina is the results of however you practice

888
03:08:06,420 --> 03:08:12,420
so try practicing differently with the heart and notice

889
03:08:12,420 --> 03:08:17,700
what happens like thinking about this is a feedback you're getting feedback

890
03:08:17,700 --> 03:08:24,660
so you keep tuning in you know if it's um you're clear that right now you've been practicing this other way and

891
03:08:24,660 --> 03:08:30,359
well it's not changing so let me try something a little different and

892
03:08:30,359 --> 03:08:36,240
um and stay tuned in listening listening to what happens inside of you

893
03:08:36,240 --> 03:08:44,460
and paying attention to one thing you said which was maybe there's at times some a mind or

894
03:08:44,460 --> 03:08:49,680
perspective that comes up that thinks has some judgment or impatience about it

895
03:08:49,680 --> 03:08:58,760
so that too don't let that slip without being seen yeah so beautiful

896
03:09:01,920 --> 03:09:10,020
as Tanya said we're gonna shift gears here we're in five minutes one last Quick

897
03:09:10,020 --> 03:09:16,260
comment yeah a couple of the YouTube participants which are many hundreds by the way oh

898
03:09:16,260 --> 03:09:22,020
thank you YouTube are also accommodating that it's not just 10 people uh thank

899
03:09:22,020 --> 03:09:29,340
you thank you we forget we have all of our companions in cyberspace so welcome to the YouTube

900
03:09:29,340 --> 03:09:36,840
participants and we'll this afternoon will be attentive to questions or comments that you may have

901
03:09:36,840 --> 03:09:43,500
um we're going to turn to lunch in a few minutes here and

902
03:09:43,500 --> 03:09:49,140
are you surprised to learn that it's another opportunity for mindfulness so

903
03:09:49,140 --> 03:09:55,380
there's a beautiful practice of mindfulness of eating that can begin

904
03:09:55,380 --> 03:10:02,939
here right now as you think about oh we're about to eat lunch what comes up in you do you feel sensations of hunger

905
03:10:02,939 --> 03:10:08,160
in the stomach or not hungry at all bored with lunch thinking like oh I

906
03:10:08,160 --> 03:10:13,500
brought that or wow I can't wait and then as you get up and walk to lunch and

907
03:10:13,500 --> 03:10:19,740
sit down and start to eat you can have a practice of noticing the sight the sound

908
03:10:19,740 --> 03:10:25,140
the smell of the food you can feel the Body Sensations of

909
03:10:25,140 --> 03:10:32,399
lifting it to your mouth placing it in your mouth and tasting chewing noticing the difference between

910
03:10:32,399 --> 03:10:38,220
the beginning of the tasting and the end swallowing feeling the sensations of

911
03:10:38,220 --> 03:10:44,340
swallowing sometimes people put their spoon or Fork down between bites and

912
03:10:44,340 --> 03:10:52,680
take a breath then begin the practice again feeling the sensation of picking up the fork so it can be that detailed

913
03:10:52,680 --> 03:10:59,460
or can be generally noticing what's happening to the heart and mind around eating

914
03:10:59,460 --> 03:11:06,779
um budget this is an opportunity and we're going to set up tables inside and outside inside I think just outside oh

915
03:11:06,779 --> 03:11:12,660
just outside okay so yeah thank you one table will be in silence if people want

916
03:11:12,660 --> 03:11:18,240
silence maybe let's say to the right silence to the left we can put we could

917
03:11:18,240 --> 03:11:23,399
see does anybody want to eat in silence just raise your hand great so let's put

918
03:11:23,399 --> 03:11:30,000
a table on this side by the redwood tree in the gravel for silence and then there can be a couple of tables

919
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:35,040
in the parking lot perfect thank you she's been here a lot more often lately

920
03:11:35,040 --> 03:11:40,200
than I have so and then there's mindfulness of

921
03:11:40,200 --> 03:11:47,100
speaking and listening so if you're speaking you can pause

922
03:11:47,760 --> 03:11:54,840
take a breath notice what's arising in you in terms of wanting to speak and then just being is it keeping one hand

923
03:11:54,840 --> 03:12:00,979
in touch with what's going on in you as you speak when other people are speaking

924
03:12:00,979 --> 03:12:07,080
mindfulness of listening am I really taking in what they're saying is is my

925
03:12:07,080 --> 03:12:13,740
urgency building up oh oh I want to tell you this so there's a lot to notice

926
03:12:13,740 --> 03:12:20,540
um so with that enjoy your lunch enjoy this mindfulness of eating and speaking

927
03:12:20,540 --> 03:12:26,520
and please come back at 1 30.

928
03:12:26,520 --> 03:12:32,520

935
04:05:55,979 --> 04:06:01,199
let me say oh look I'm looking at the schedule because maybe you could post

936
04:06:01,199 --> 04:06:06,739
that we will have another question and area

937
04:06:08,040 --> 04:06:14,119
well you have the schedule in front of you right can you look and and post it

938
04:06:17,160 --> 04:06:22,818
okay foreign

939
04:06:22,979 --> 04:06:28,340
that sounds right so just posting so people know

940
04:06:40,739 --> 04:06:47,340
the information kiosk over there oh it's not huh

941
04:06:47,340 --> 04:06:53,160
okay huh

942
04:06:53,160 --> 04:07:01,279
okay you know how I don't know how to adjust that but you can make donations on the

943
04:07:01,279 --> 04:07:07,979
website I'm not even sure who how that gets

944
04:07:07,979 --> 04:07:14,399
done so but thank you I can I can find out at some point

945
04:07:14,399 --> 04:07:20,580
so let's um find ourselves back and

946
04:07:20,580 --> 04:07:27,438
maybe our friends will slowly return from the lunch

947
04:07:30,540 --> 04:07:37,739
and we've been um sort of talking about the way of apasana is taught at least at

948
04:07:37,739 --> 04:07:44,399
the center is can be thought of sort of like eccentric circles that

949
04:07:44,399 --> 04:07:50,520
um we start with the breath right that that's our main sort of focus and then

950
04:07:50,520 --> 04:07:56,580
we expand to include breath and body and then we go from breath body to

951
04:07:56,580 --> 04:08:03,180
breath body and emotions and so that's what I'll be uh providing

952
04:08:03,180 --> 04:08:10,160
guidance on in the sit is mindfulness of our emotions

953
04:08:10,439 --> 04:08:15,920
um it's worth saying a few words about emotions

954
04:08:17,100 --> 04:08:23,840
you know their um a pretty dynamic

955
04:08:23,960 --> 04:08:29,760
part of our lives may be connected to some of our

956
04:08:29,760 --> 04:08:35,040
best experiences and most difficult experiences yeah

957
04:08:35,040 --> 04:08:40,399
and part of being alive is having emotions

958
04:08:40,439 --> 04:08:48,779
and uh it's not possible to try and prevent having

959
04:08:48,779 --> 04:08:54,540
negative emotions without also blocking positive emotions

960
04:08:54,540 --> 04:09:02,160
so in this practice the aim the instructions are to learn how to be with emotions and

961
04:09:02,160 --> 04:09:07,859
allow them to flow through move through without kind of trying to cling to them

962
04:09:07,859 --> 04:09:13,739
or push them away the word emotion

963
04:09:13,739 --> 04:09:19,439
to emote means you knows referencing this idea of letting things move through

964
04:09:19,439 --> 04:09:27,300
move through us when we run into trouble with emotions

965
04:09:27,300 --> 04:09:33,300
it's often because couple of metaphors come up one is we

966
04:09:33,300 --> 04:09:41,601
try and block and prevent feeling certain things and then we kind of move into a frozen emotional numb space

967
04:09:41,880 --> 04:09:49,220
and that frozenness is you know that kind of trying Contracting that binding

968
04:09:49,500 --> 04:09:55,020
shuts us off from like I said all the aspects of Life connecting more fully

969
04:09:55,020 --> 04:10:02,160
with them experiencing the small Joys even and can create distance between

970
04:10:02,160 --> 04:10:11,520
ourselves and ourselves ourselves and others another uh kind of simile that describes

971
04:10:11,520 --> 04:10:18,300
what can happen is a sense of trying to repress or push down certain feelings

972
04:10:18,300 --> 04:10:24,239
and um it can be thought of like a spring we're pushing a spring and pushing and

973
04:10:24,239 --> 04:10:31,739
pushing and pushing the spring down and at some point the spring winds and then we get flooded

974
04:10:31,739 --> 04:10:38,239
with an overwhelming kind of rebound of emotions

975
04:10:39,540 --> 04:10:46,560
so how do we let feelings arise and pass away and not in a

976
04:10:46,560 --> 04:10:52,140
dismissive way not in a bypassing way

977
04:10:52,140 --> 04:11:00,180
but um more inspirationally like allowing ourselves to be moved by experience

978
04:11:00,180 --> 04:11:06,120
the Dalai Lama as kind of famous for being described as somebody who when

979
04:11:06,120 --> 04:11:11,340
talking with him will just like if somebody says something he might start

980
04:11:11,340 --> 04:11:17,460
just sobbing he might just allow that emotion to just come in and be expressed

981
04:11:17,460 --> 04:11:24,620
and then kind of it recedes and he moves on and then the next minute he's joyful and laughing

982
04:11:26,520 --> 04:11:31,920
so just sort of understanding this is part of our Human Experience

983
04:11:31,920 --> 04:11:37,199
and it's we don't have to be um

984
04:11:37,199 --> 04:11:42,540
like unfeeling or unbothered or unimpacted

985
04:11:42,540 --> 04:11:48,680
sometimes with this practice I think some people start to feel like they should always be fine

986
04:11:48,680 --> 04:11:54,479
you know it's really more about our relationship to our experience that we

987
04:11:54,479 --> 04:11:59,880
want to be fine with not that we can't be moved by

988
04:11:59,880 --> 04:12:05,760
the other part though is that we also don't want our emotions to carry us down

989
04:12:05,760 --> 04:12:12,239
the stream emotions come with energy they they

990
04:12:12,239 --> 04:12:19,500
they're like a motivational system they want us to do something they want expression

991
04:12:19,500 --> 04:12:24,720
sometimes when it's you know intense feelings those expressions aren't

992
04:12:24,720 --> 04:12:30,000
helpful they're harmful to ourselves or to others

993
04:12:30,000 --> 04:12:38,101
so another way to think about being with emotions is to think about rivers

994
04:12:38,460 --> 04:12:44,340
and emotions are like the water and the bed is like what we can learn to do and

995
04:12:44,340 --> 04:12:50,160
be which is to hold the space for the flow of the water

996
04:12:50,160 --> 04:12:53,660
the flow of the emotion

997
04:12:55,380 --> 04:13:03,120
and sometimes we might feel like a very small River and sometimes we might feel open and

998
04:13:03,120 --> 04:13:10,319
wide and expansive and like just really able to allow it all to come through

999
04:13:10,319 --> 04:13:16,500
and sometimes it's actually skillful to be with emotions for a short period of

1000
04:13:16,500 --> 04:13:22,560
time and then to take a break the idea is yeah to let them move

1001
04:13:22,560 --> 04:13:29,160
through but sometimes we can't without getting carried Downstream by them so in those situations we need to keep

1002
04:13:29,160 --> 04:13:35,160
Discerning wisdom on board what can I manage what am I able to open

1003
04:13:35,160 --> 04:13:38,180
up to right now

1004
04:13:40,500 --> 04:13:47,880
another thing that's I think very helpful to kind of uh some science about

1005
04:13:47,880 --> 04:13:53,040
this that I think helps me there's the book my stroke of insight by

1006
04:13:53,040 --> 04:13:59,340
Jill bolt Taylor I don't know if you're familiar with it it's a great book but one of the things

1007
04:13:59,340 --> 04:14:04,979
she says in this book is the natural lifespan of an emotion

1008
04:14:04,979 --> 04:14:10,080
meaning the average time it takes for it to move through the nervous system and body

1009
04:14:10,080 --> 04:14:17,721
is a minute and a half a minute and a half

1010
04:14:20,880 --> 04:14:27,420
so sometimes if we just sort of hold that in mind it can help us turn

1011
04:14:27,420 --> 04:14:32,939
toward and be willing tricky part is it really doesn't matter

1012
04:14:32,939 --> 04:14:41,180
how we are with those emotions because we all know we don't just fill things for a minute and a half all the time

1013
04:14:41,220 --> 04:14:48,239
and what happens then is that we're retriggering our thoughts our reactions you know feed

1014
04:14:48,239 --> 04:14:54,560
that emotional so it just keeps getting triggered and triggered and triggered and triggered and triggered

1015
04:14:55,500 --> 04:15:01,979
but each time we trigger hypothetically it's another minute and a half so at any time we can pull back

1016
04:15:01,979 --> 04:15:09,120
stop the reactivity stop the in the Buddha's simile he talks about

1017
04:15:09,120 --> 04:15:14,180
getting hit with an arrow and how that causes pain or

1018
04:15:14,180 --> 04:15:19,640
you know pain to us and then he says

1019
04:15:19,640 --> 04:15:24,899
now imagine getting struck with another arrow and another arrow

1020
04:15:24,899 --> 04:15:33,120
do they keep hurting and does the pain grow over time yeah yes I would say yes

1021
04:15:33,120 --> 04:15:40,979
and so the Buddha is essentially saying in the simile when he talks about it that those extra arrows are the optional

1022
04:15:40,979 --> 04:15:46,739
arrows that's the re-triggering and retriggering of emotional states and the

1023
04:15:46,739 --> 04:15:52,620
self-criticism and the other kind of discursive mental formations and

1024
04:15:52,620 --> 04:15:59,279
thoughts and stories and and emotional reactions to our reactions that keep

1025
04:15:59,279 --> 04:16:04,938
causing deeper and deeper pain suffering

1026
04:16:05,699 --> 04:16:12,960
so can we just let the one Arrow come in and be with it without adding

1027
04:16:12,960 --> 04:16:19,859
more Gil gives an example and so such a silly simple example his his examples usually

1028
04:16:19,859 --> 04:16:25,920
are which speaks to their Brilliance I think of being a meditation teacher he talks

1029
04:16:25,920 --> 04:16:34,380
about walking outside and tripping so he hurts his toe because he trips

1030
04:16:34,380 --> 04:16:39,779
and then that's the first Arrow that's the like that's the pain of

1031
04:16:39,779 --> 04:16:46,560
stubbing one's toe and then he wonders

1032
04:16:46,560 --> 04:16:52,800
oh did somebody see me do I look like a fool

1033
04:16:52,800 --> 04:16:58,380
oh my God I'm a meditation teacher I wasn't being mindful or I wouldn't have

1034
04:16:58,380 --> 04:17:03,660
tripped right and on and on the Mind goes

1035
04:17:03,660 --> 04:17:09,000
just on and on just Adam I so stupid how could I have not been what was I lost

1036
04:17:09,000 --> 04:17:15,120
and thought about you know and we're just it's Arrow after Arrow after Arrow

1037
04:17:15,120 --> 04:17:22,260
so when we when we notice this happening maybe just go okay enough I don't want

1038
04:17:22,260 --> 04:17:29,939
to keep shooting arrows at myself here enough it's enough this hurts

1039
04:17:29,939 --> 04:17:33,859
and this hurts I care

1040
04:17:38,100 --> 04:17:47,580
so feeling into your posture finding your body here taking the time

1041
04:17:47,580 --> 04:17:52,040
to roll the shoulders up and back

1042
04:17:54,199 --> 04:18:01,080
inviting some deeper press in so we habitually Lean Forward

1043
04:18:01,080 --> 04:18:06,239
over our phones and computers and then it closes the chest

1044
04:18:06,239 --> 04:18:12,899
which shuts the lungs down from breathing fully so rolling those shoulders up and back

1045
04:18:12,899 --> 04:18:19,920
can really help just let the lungs do what they know how to do breathe

1046
04:18:19,979 --> 04:18:22,880
ah

1047
04:18:26,100 --> 04:18:31,698
so we'll start finding our posture again

1048
04:18:31,800 --> 04:18:37,560
and if your anchor is the breath connecting with that anchor to help

1049
04:18:37,560 --> 04:18:44,699
ourselves ground in this moment come back into direct contact

1050
04:18:44,699 --> 04:18:52,620
with what's happening Sensations the feeling the receptive feeling of

1051
04:18:52,620 --> 04:18:59,460
sound we don't have to know what's making a sound we can just know the experience of

1052
04:18:59,460 --> 04:19:06,300
hearing we don't know have don't have to know what's causing a sensation in the body

1053
04:19:06,300 --> 04:19:10,880
we can just receive the experience

1054
04:19:11,699 --> 04:19:17,600
being with our experience directly and simply

1055
04:19:33,479 --> 04:19:39,619
hmm yeah breathing in and breathing out

1056
04:19:55,380 --> 04:19:59,898
breathing in I know I'm breathing in

1057
04:20:00,960 --> 04:20:06,080
breathing out knowing breathing out

1058
04:20:24,779 --> 04:20:30,060
giving space for things to settle in the body heart

1059
04:20:30,060 --> 04:20:36,300
and mind being generous

1060
04:20:36,300 --> 04:20:39,500
with our experience

1061
04:21:40,680 --> 04:21:46,800
sometimes the settling is really about more our response

1062
04:21:46,800 --> 04:21:55,859
to what's arising then to what is arising so if a thought a Feeling

1063
04:21:55,859 --> 04:22:03,859
a sensation comes up if we can be with it really simply

1064
04:22:22,380 --> 04:22:27,080
sort of like water and a pond

1065
04:22:30,060 --> 04:22:35,399
we might be able to toss some little rocks little pebbles in and

1066
04:22:35,399 --> 04:22:42,199
they create a little wave pattern on the surface

1067
04:22:43,020 --> 04:22:48,801
and then things settle and slow smooth

1068
04:22:51,120 --> 04:22:57,840
but if we toss a little Pebble in and then we follow that petal into the water

1069
04:22:57,840 --> 04:23:05,040
walk on the bottom of the Little Pond try and find that Pebble again

1070
04:23:05,040 --> 04:23:11,119
that whole process stirs up so much more activity

1071
04:23:14,040 --> 04:23:22,979
so if we can let a thought or a feeling come up and just sort of Ripple across the water and be simple with it it'll

1072
04:23:22,979 --> 04:23:25,938
settle on its own

1073
04:23:30,899 --> 04:23:36,840
but if we feel we need to argue with it comment on it

1074
04:23:36,840 --> 04:23:42,738
try and get rid of it we might just be stirring things up

1075
04:24:05,640 --> 04:24:11,720
so because emotions can be complicated for us

1076
04:24:12,660 --> 04:24:19,880
I'm gonna offer a very structured practice a guided practice

1077
04:24:20,279 --> 04:24:26,520
with the acronym of raft with two T's r-a-f-t-t

1078
04:24:28,560 --> 04:24:33,140
it's one way to practice with emotions

1079
04:24:38,760 --> 04:24:45,840
so I want to invite you to notice what emotions are present for

1080
04:24:45,840 --> 04:24:48,560
you right now

1081
04:24:52,560 --> 04:25:01,938
it's maybe simply noting naming them this is the r of rafter recognizing

1082
04:25:02,340 --> 04:25:11,040
kind of a simple acknowledgment I see you sadness I see you anxiety I

1083
04:25:11,040 --> 04:25:18,380
see you whatever is there

1084
04:25:38,220 --> 04:25:42,318
and of the things that are present

1085
04:25:45,060 --> 04:25:52,340
is there something small and manageable

1086
04:25:53,159 --> 04:26:01,040
an emotion that you can turn toward that's a small little thing

1087
04:26:01,260 --> 04:26:07,520
a small Ripple tolerable

1088
04:26:13,859 --> 04:26:20,520
and if so the next part of the practice is the a

1089
04:26:20,520 --> 04:26:29,341
which is just allowing the truth of this emotion to be seen and felt acknowledged

1090
04:26:31,920 --> 04:26:38,220
can we allow knowing and connecting with this emotion In This

1091
04:26:38,220 --> 04:26:40,520
Moment

1092
04:26:44,939 --> 04:26:49,761
and if there is a simple sort of yes

1093
04:26:51,779 --> 04:26:59,300
find and feel where that emotion resides in the body

1094
04:27:00,540 --> 04:27:06,681
maybe leaving the story connected to it behind

1095
04:27:07,620 --> 04:27:15,420
and simply finding and feeling if there's a no I can't really allow or

1096
04:27:15,420 --> 04:27:21,300
feel it's not tolerable then maybe you can turn toward the

1097
04:27:21,300 --> 04:27:26,580
resistance that feeling of not okay

1098
04:27:26,580 --> 04:27:33,739
too much and practice with that welcome that

1099
04:27:35,040 --> 04:27:40,699
maybe it's your friend maybe it's wise

1100
04:27:41,399 --> 04:27:47,699
and can you find and feel where that resides in the body how it

1101
04:27:47,699 --> 04:27:50,721
feels in the body

1102
04:27:56,699 --> 04:28:01,221
not resisting and not succumbing

1103
04:28:02,399 --> 04:28:08,479
not resisting and not so coming being the banks of the river

1104
04:28:08,479 --> 04:28:13,880
allowing the emotional energy to flow through

1105
04:28:22,680 --> 04:28:30,180
and that may be all you need to do with this emotion it may be over a minute and a half come

1106
04:28:30,180 --> 04:28:32,600
and gone

1107
04:28:35,279 --> 04:28:41,640
if so enjoy relax

1108
04:28:41,640 --> 04:28:47,760
and maybe when another emotion comes up that you feel you can practice with you

1109
04:28:47,760 --> 04:28:55,199
might name it recognize it create an atmosphere of allowing

1110
04:28:55,199 --> 04:29:02,100
if it's tolerable and finding it feeling it in the body

1111
04:29:02,100 --> 04:29:06,318
sort of leaving the story behind

1112
04:29:11,159 --> 04:29:17,779
if you're still working with an emotion the next part of the practice

1113
04:29:18,720 --> 04:29:25,680
the T is to tease apart the different pieces

1114
04:29:25,680 --> 04:29:34,199
that are here meaning there might be a memory

1115
04:29:34,199 --> 04:29:39,540
an image a story

1116
04:29:39,540 --> 04:29:45,540
a belief an expectation

1117
04:29:45,540 --> 04:29:50,359
or all of the above present as well

1118
04:29:52,680 --> 04:29:59,720
so I'd like to imagine for myself a big spacious room

1119
04:30:00,060 --> 04:30:07,159
maybe even like a cathedral it's just very large

1120
04:30:10,380 --> 04:30:17,120
and maybe there's a big table or maybe there are chairs spread around

1121
04:30:17,580 --> 04:30:23,760
and inviting each thing that you notice that comes up that's connected to this

1122
04:30:23,760 --> 04:30:30,199
emotion to have its own space its own seat

1123
04:30:38,760 --> 04:30:44,880
as many chairs as much space as needed there's enough room

1124
04:30:44,880 --> 04:30:49,939
sometimes maybe something needs to go in another room

1125
04:30:58,800 --> 04:31:04,500
watch out for thoughts like yeah why did I do that again because that that is yet

1126
04:31:04,500 --> 04:31:10,881
another part to tease apart giving that space

1127
04:31:14,580 --> 04:31:20,180
there might be a feeling of bracing that might need space

1128
04:31:23,159 --> 04:31:28,560
sort of untangling all the things that get put together in

1129
04:31:28,560 --> 04:31:34,800
the mind to create one experience that's really a combination of many

1130
04:31:34,800 --> 04:31:37,520
different things

1131
04:31:46,020 --> 04:31:52,199
maybe imagining all these pieces sitting around the table

1132
04:31:52,199 --> 04:31:59,840
but you get to sit at the head of the table your awareness your choice

1133
04:32:01,800 --> 04:32:07,680
just taking it in with some distance perspective

1134
04:32:11,580 --> 04:32:18,779
and whatever has occurred has occurred without expectations

1135
04:32:19,859 --> 04:32:28,520
to end the practice we add a second t and that tea is Trust

1136
04:32:29,399 --> 04:32:35,699
finding and connecting with what we can trust in this situation

1137
04:32:35,699 --> 04:32:41,061
can we trust awareness mindfulness

1138
04:32:42,060 --> 04:32:47,479
can we trust the idea that emotions come and go

1139
04:32:47,819 --> 04:32:51,021
that things change

1140
04:32:54,600 --> 04:33:00,540
can you trust that you no

1141
04:33:00,540 --> 04:33:08,641
something important here and rest rest in whatever you can

1142
04:33:08,641 --> 04:33:13,680
take refuge in what you can trust the Dharma

1143
04:33:13,680 --> 04:33:17,660
the Buddha the Sangha

1144
04:33:20,580 --> 04:33:26,641
and see if you can linger here and what you can trust for the last few

1145
04:33:26,641 --> 04:33:29,660
minutes of the practice

1146
04:40:18,180 --> 04:40:25,216
I'm gonna drop in a reflection for the last two minutes of practice

1147
04:40:25,980 --> 04:40:31,140
my emotions can be thought of in lots of different ways

1148
04:40:31,140 --> 04:40:37,378
Helen Keller said the best and most beautiful things in

1149
04:40:37,378 --> 04:40:42,718
the world cannot be seen or even touched

1150
04:40:42,718 --> 04:40:47,122
they must be felt with a heart

1151
04:41:52,180 --> 04:41:59,180
[Music] foreign

1152
04:42:01,660 --> 04:42:08,010
[Music]

1153
04:42:11,820 --> 04:42:17,878
so staying in silence we have a 15 minute stretch or walking break

1154
04:42:17,878 --> 04:42:24,780
before we come back for instructions on mindfulness of thinking so we will begin

1155
04:42:24,780 --> 04:42:29,296
at 2 20 with the next meditation

1156
04:57:15,620 --> 04:57:22,980
so we'll be doing a guided mindfulness of thinking meditation

1157
04:57:22,980 --> 04:57:29,280
giving yourself time to settle into a meditative posture

1158
04:57:29,280 --> 04:57:37,522
that's comfortable for you perhaps gently closing your eyes

1159
04:57:37,560 --> 04:57:42,378
and giving some attention to your spine

1160
04:57:42,780 --> 04:57:49,798
perhaps sitting up a little straighter than usual at this time in the afternoon

1161
04:57:49,798 --> 04:57:54,560
to bring some energy into the body

1162
04:57:54,900 --> 04:58:02,360
perhaps emphasizing the in-breath a little bit to bring in that energy

1163
04:58:05,160 --> 04:58:13,458
and creating a strong core around which you can relax

1164
04:58:30,958 --> 04:58:38,780
perhaps taking a few long slow full breath

1165
04:58:40,980 --> 04:58:44,240
as you breathe in

1166
04:58:47,760 --> 04:58:55,440
feeling energy enter the body as you breathe out

1167
04:58:55,440 --> 04:58:58,636
some ease

1168
04:59:16,860 --> 04:59:24,022
perhaps as you breathe in feeling the rib cage expand

1169
04:59:26,100 --> 04:59:32,240
the front of the rib cage in the back of the rib cage

1170
04:59:39,660 --> 04:59:44,060
and softening them as you breathe out

1171
05:00:06,480 --> 05:00:13,798
breathing in and breathing out perhaps softening the muscles of the

1172
05:00:13,798 --> 05:00:16,102
face

1173
05:00:21,298 --> 05:00:25,042
releasing the shoulders

1174
05:00:33,718 --> 05:00:39,620
softening the belly thank you

1175
05:00:46,820 --> 05:00:53,600
letting your breath return to normal however that is right now

1176
05:00:59,638 --> 05:01:06,660
seeing if there's a way the breathing can support the uprightness of the spine

1177
05:01:06,660 --> 05:01:10,700
in the sense of ease

1178
05:01:34,440 --> 05:01:43,042
and then as we've done before Beginning by entering into the world of breathing

1179
05:01:46,020 --> 05:01:51,620
into the way your body experiences breathing

1180
05:02:11,340 --> 05:02:16,560
for now letting go of any thoughts or concerns

1181
05:02:16,560 --> 05:02:25,702
so you can better feel and sense the physical experience of breathing

1182
05:02:45,440 --> 05:02:54,680
noticing how the inhalation differs from the exhalation

1183
05:03:24,958 --> 05:03:32,940
if any thoughts arise either letting go of them or perhaps

1184
05:03:32,940 --> 05:03:38,240
letting them recede into the background

1185
05:03:39,180 --> 05:03:44,000
so that in the foreground you're with your breathing

1186
05:03:44,878 --> 05:03:51,020
feeling the full breath in from start to finish

1187
05:03:53,160 --> 05:03:59,660
feeling the top of the breath where it switches to breathing out

1188
05:04:05,100 --> 05:04:09,320
feeling the full breath out

1189
05:04:38,100 --> 05:04:42,920
giving yourself over to your breathing

1190
05:04:43,920 --> 05:04:52,636
so that breathing has a chance to settle you and calm you

1191
05:04:53,520 --> 05:04:58,560
ground the attention Center the attention in yourself around the

1192
05:04:58,560 --> 05:05:00,862
breathing

1193
05:05:48,360 --> 05:05:50,600
foreign

1194
05:05:57,660 --> 05:06:04,218
natural simply notice it

1195
05:06:04,920 --> 05:06:12,080
and gently re-center yourself around the breathing

1196
05:06:14,340 --> 05:06:22,138
thank you for the next several minutes

1197
05:06:22,138 --> 05:06:28,560
gently letting go of any thinking that arises after noticing it

1198
05:06:28,560 --> 05:06:35,362
and re-establishing yourself in feeling the breathing

1199
05:09:11,600 --> 05:09:18,600
and now with calm and deliberateless deliberateness

1200
05:09:19,340 --> 05:09:26,940
letting go of your breathing of paying attention to your breathing

1201
05:09:26,940 --> 05:09:31,876
and simply notice when you're thinking

1202
05:09:33,840 --> 05:09:42,978
you're welcome to think no need to stop thinking now

1203
05:09:49,080 --> 05:09:55,702
but as you're thinking being clearly aware that thinking is happening

1204
05:10:01,020 --> 05:10:07,920
rather than letting go of thinking looking at thinking directly

1205
05:10:07,920 --> 05:10:10,876
head on

1206
05:10:26,700 --> 05:10:33,420
your thoughts disappear or fade away as you watch them

1207
05:10:33,420 --> 05:10:41,700
quite natural just waiting until they come back or

1208
05:10:41,700 --> 05:10:49,458
going back to mindfulness of breathing until you notice thinking begins again

1209
05:11:13,740 --> 05:11:20,782
when thinking begins again clearly knowing it

1210
05:11:21,660 --> 05:11:25,700
being aware that it's happening

1211
05:12:11,878 --> 05:12:17,660
perhaps when you notice thinking arising

1212
05:12:17,660 --> 05:12:25,520
Whispering very very softly in the mind thinking

1213
05:12:26,280 --> 05:12:34,040
thinking very Softly

1214
05:12:53,280 --> 05:12:55,818
foreign

1215
05:13:11,820 --> 05:13:17,122
what you are thinking is not so important

1216
05:13:17,878 --> 05:13:25,980
but as you're paying attention to thinking and meditation perhaps noticing other aspects of it

1217
05:13:25,980 --> 05:13:29,542
besides the content

1218
05:13:31,378 --> 05:13:36,500
you might notice if you're thinking in images

1219
05:13:37,760 --> 05:13:42,020
or it's like a movie

1220
05:13:47,458 --> 05:13:51,680
perhaps you're thinking in words

1221
05:13:53,400 --> 05:13:56,782
or conversation

1222
05:14:00,958 --> 05:14:03,260
foreign

1223
05:14:09,740 --> 05:14:16,680
what's the quality of the images are they

1224
05:14:16,680 --> 05:14:20,420
fuzzy or clear

1225
05:14:30,798 --> 05:14:39,740
if you're thinking in words what's the tone of those words

1226
05:14:51,958 --> 05:14:56,478
is there an inner voice that thinks

1227
05:15:04,080 --> 05:15:09,860
is it harsh or is it soft and gentle

1228
05:15:13,200 --> 05:15:15,318
thank you

1229
05:15:20,400 --> 05:15:25,400
are your thoughts pushing you or critical

1230
05:15:25,860 --> 05:15:31,138
or are they supportive accepting

1231
05:15:35,160 --> 05:15:42,060
just allowing yourself to explore the process the quality

1232
05:15:42,060 --> 05:15:46,522
the texture of the thoughts

1233
05:16:15,480 --> 05:16:24,180
is there a lot of energy in the thinking or is the thinking very subtle

1234
05:16:24,180 --> 05:16:28,136
or almost elusive

1235
05:17:10,040 --> 05:17:15,298
you might notice if there are any emotions connected to what you're

1236
05:17:15,298 --> 05:17:17,958
thinking about

1237
05:17:22,560 --> 05:17:28,320
the thinking might be coming out of a particular emotion

1238
05:17:28,320 --> 05:17:34,638
or connected with it and if that's so

1239
05:17:34,638 --> 05:17:39,442
quietly note the emotion

1240
05:17:39,840 --> 05:17:43,520
as well as the thinking

1241
05:18:33,540 --> 05:18:43,160
if thinking goes away as you're mindful of it allowing the space that's left behind

1242
05:18:44,718 --> 05:18:50,420
enjoying the spaciousness of a quiet mind

1243
05:19:41,060 --> 05:19:47,660
perhaps noticing if there's a physical side to any thinking

1244
05:19:50,100 --> 05:19:56,638
is there any pressure or tension connected to thinking

1245
05:19:56,638 --> 05:20:03,660
somewhere in the body tightness or even pressure in the brain

1246
05:20:03,660 --> 05:20:09,260
that feels activated with thinking as part of it

1247
05:20:14,280 --> 05:20:20,058
any tightening of the forehead or around the eyes

1248
05:20:24,420 --> 05:20:32,820
and possibly releasing softening any tension you find

1249
05:20:32,820 --> 05:20:39,000
or pressure perhaps

1250
05:20:39,000 --> 05:20:45,540
as you exhale releasing the tension the way you might

1251
05:20:45,540 --> 05:20:53,420
relax a muscle relaxing the thinking muscle

1252
05:21:00,718 --> 05:21:03,718
foreign

1253
05:22:12,120 --> 05:22:14,898
foreign

1254
05:22:20,340 --> 05:22:27,060
and now letting go of thinking enough to re-enter

1255
05:22:27,060 --> 05:22:32,240
breathing re-centering yourself on breathing

1256
05:22:34,260 --> 05:22:39,718
gently letting go of any thoughts perhaps letting them recede into the

1257
05:22:39,718 --> 05:22:42,022
background

1258
05:22:49,080 --> 05:22:54,376
in re-entering into the world of your breathing

1259
05:23:16,620 --> 05:23:23,160
thank you hanging in there with the breathing

1260
05:23:23,160 --> 05:23:31,878
perhaps seeing if you can stay connected through a whole series of breaths

1261
05:23:32,700 --> 05:23:38,120
full experience of breathing in and breathing out

1262
05:24:40,020 --> 05:24:42,200
foreign

1263
05:24:48,500 --> 05:24:53,900
perhaps taking a couple of deep breaths

1264
05:24:55,260 --> 05:25:03,376
sitting and when you're ready opening your eyes

1265
05:25:14,580 --> 05:25:17,420
foreign

1266
05:25:26,760 --> 05:25:35,400
like life on planet Earth can be likened to living here with all

1267
05:25:35,400 --> 05:25:41,760
kinds of variations in the weather we have periods in meditation when it's

1268
05:25:41,760 --> 05:25:48,600
like a calm day with blue skies and no wind just peaceful

1269
05:25:48,600 --> 05:25:54,480
other times it's like a storm has arisen and suddenly we're in the middle of

1270
05:25:54,480 --> 05:26:02,340
thunder clouds of emotion or a blizzard of thoughts or it's a very very hot

1271
05:26:02,340 --> 05:26:07,458
day and the body is very uncomfortable

1272
05:26:08,480 --> 05:26:14,340
sometimes the analogy is used that the mind is like a clear blue sky and

1273
05:26:14,340 --> 05:26:20,820
thoughts are like the clouds passing by we establish mindfulness of the breath

1274
05:26:20,820 --> 05:26:26,760
of breath relaxed and tented

1275
05:26:26,760 --> 05:26:31,860
and sooner or later a thought Cloud floats by

1276
05:26:31,860 --> 05:26:39,360
or a whole storm of thoughts come by we may not even see it coming we just

1277
05:26:39,360 --> 05:26:45,780
suddenly aware that we've been caught on those thought clouds for some time

1278
05:26:45,780 --> 05:26:51,958
a really common one is planning that were tomorrow bubbles up in your

1279
05:26:51,958 --> 05:26:59,160
mind or later today bubbles up in your mind and you're thinking of what you're going to say or do

1280
05:26:59,160 --> 05:27:04,280
a thought comes along about the past and you start living in the world of

1281
05:27:04,280 --> 05:27:10,940
regrets or beautiful memories how wonderful the past was

1282
05:27:11,040 --> 05:27:17,760
you've still gotten on a cloud the mind is caught Maybe by these

1283
05:27:17,760 --> 05:27:23,218
passing clouds and storms and some are beautiful you know thinking is totally

1284
05:27:23,218 --> 05:27:31,620
healthy and appropriate at different times and they can carry us away into areas

1285
05:27:31,620 --> 05:27:39,718
where we lose our stability or our groundedness and we lose our independence from what's

1286
05:27:39,718 --> 05:27:46,200
what we're thinking about we're really caught in it so one of the things we're doing with

1287
05:27:46,200 --> 05:27:51,718
mindfulness and meditation practice is we're returning again and again to the

1288
05:27:51,718 --> 05:27:56,878
groundedness of awareness we use awareness of the breathing awareness of

1289
05:27:56,878 --> 05:28:05,280
the body awareness of motions awareness of thinking itself thinking thinking and learning not to

1290
05:28:05,280 --> 05:28:10,920
get totally lost in the weather whatever the weather is

1291
05:28:10,920 --> 05:28:17,218
so you can you can't stop thinking from arising and you need not try

1292
05:28:17,218 --> 05:28:23,360
but you don't necessarily have to pick it up maybe you had a little bit of an experience with this meditation then

1293
05:28:23,360 --> 05:28:31,680
instead of picking up the content you could look at oh I'm noticing how my face and head tense

1294
05:28:31,680 --> 05:28:37,860
up when I'm thinking or noticing the tone of The Voice or the kinds of images

1295
05:28:37,860 --> 05:28:43,260
that arise or simply noticing the fact of thinking

1296
05:28:43,260 --> 05:28:50,480
it's a huge and important part of human life so we're not anti-thinking in the scene

1297
05:28:50,480 --> 05:28:57,360
and when we learned to clearly see it we have a choice with it we have a

1298
05:28:57,360 --> 05:29:03,420
choice of how to relate to it instead of being dragged around by our thinking

1299
05:29:03,420 --> 05:29:10,740
and wherever it wants to go we start to become a little less identified with it we we are not our thoughts during the

1300
05:29:10,740 --> 05:29:17,160
class that Tanya and Koto have been teaching they read this lovely book you are not your thoughts a child's book but

1301
05:29:17,160 --> 05:29:24,360
could be an adult book it's a great book um and a lot of times we we tend to

1302
05:29:24,360 --> 05:29:31,740
believe for a while that we are our thoughts that's who we are but actually if we you

1303
05:29:31,740 --> 05:29:36,780
know it's kind of like if I stop thinking then who am I where am I so it

1304
05:29:36,780 --> 05:29:43,500
can be challenging to let go of all the stories we create about ourselves the interpretations we

1305
05:29:43,500 --> 05:29:50,218
have of events past present future so an important really important part of

1306
05:29:50,218 --> 05:29:56,040
mindfulness is learning to see this phenomenon of thinking

1307
05:29:56,040 --> 05:30:01,440
we're not at war with it we're not trying to push it away or say it's bad

1308
05:30:01,440 --> 05:30:07,138
but we can notice some thinking's painful some is pleasant we get to be

1309
05:30:07,138 --> 05:30:12,420
more grounded with it and um start to notice things we haven't

1310
05:30:12,420 --> 05:30:18,060
noticed before about our thinking you know are we ruminating a lot stirring up

1311
05:30:18,060 --> 05:30:24,600
a lot of anxiety trying to rework the past until it works out just right I used to rework the past all the time

1312
05:30:24,600 --> 05:30:29,760
like trying to make a more perfect past in my thinking guess what it never

1313
05:30:29,760 --> 05:30:37,200
worked um or to control okay if I just can figure this out I can control the chaos

1314
05:30:37,200 --> 05:30:43,560
that is life so by learning to be mindful of thinking

1315
05:30:43,560 --> 05:30:48,660
we can start to notice those patterns oh look at that I'm planning again look at

1316
05:30:48,660 --> 05:30:54,298
that I'm ruminating look at that I'm fantasizing and drifting off into this Pleasant

1317
05:30:54,298 --> 05:31:01,080
feeling um just noticing the emotional quality that

1318
05:31:01,080 --> 05:31:06,780
it can have sometimes the tone of voice you hear all these aspects are really

1319
05:31:06,780 --> 05:31:13,740
giving you information about how you've been conditioned and it's valuable every time you step

1320
05:31:13,740 --> 05:31:19,260
back from thinking and just notice that it's happening you're no longer enmeshed

1321
05:31:19,260 --> 05:31:25,378
in it and this is actually a huge movement of mind

1322
05:31:25,378 --> 05:31:33,958
and it takes time it takes time because we've developed a lifetime of being enmeshed and engaged in our thinking

1323
05:31:33,958 --> 05:31:40,378
so it's not always easy I for a while I had to deliberately think thoughts to be

1324
05:31:40,378 --> 05:31:46,200
mindful while thinking those thoughts in order to catch the feeling of what this was like

1325
05:31:46,200 --> 05:31:52,020
I'm sometimes thinking just evaporates when you're all ready to work with it poof it's gone

1326
05:31:52,020 --> 05:31:58,020
or it can be quite clear but when just this is an invitation when

1327
05:31:58,020 --> 05:32:03,120
it arises in meditation and it's easy to let go of

1328
05:32:03,120 --> 05:32:08,878
Let It Go and come back to the breathing come back to the body when it's difficult

1329
05:32:08,878 --> 05:32:13,980
you know sooner or later it's going to be difficult and you're going to be caught and you're going to think oh my

1330
05:32:13,980 --> 05:32:19,200
gosh I was just gone for the last half hour thinking

1331
05:32:19,200 --> 05:32:24,958
and you when you come back that's always a great Moment Like Tanya was saying I'm back

1332
05:32:24,958 --> 05:32:31,260
I was aware that thinking was just happening um and you can think oh I was caught in

1333
05:32:31,260 --> 05:32:38,100
thinking it's not a huge problem we're just developing the awareness of coming back and then noticing as much of it as

1334
05:32:38,100 --> 05:32:45,958
we can things were strengthening our ability to

1335
05:32:45,958 --> 05:32:51,060
be aware in the here and now which leads to more freedom

1336
05:32:51,060 --> 05:32:56,218
so thank you for that and we're now you know let's give 15

1337
05:32:56,218 --> 05:33:02,218
minutes I agree so we're going to take a 15 minute break you can walk you can

1338
05:33:02,218 --> 05:33:09,978
stretch so enjoy the 15 minutes and come back at 3 10 please

1339
05:46:24,240 --> 05:46:26,360
okay

1340
05:47:28,020 --> 05:47:35,820
as you come in and take your seats just kind of notice

1341
05:47:35,820 --> 05:47:45,200
notice how you are now live allow yourself some space to

1342
05:47:45,200 --> 05:47:51,620
receive and connect your own experience right now

1343
05:47:51,780 --> 05:47:55,940
after this day of practice

1344
05:47:57,058 --> 05:48:00,500
feeling tired

1345
05:48:03,660 --> 05:48:07,320
feeling energized

1346
05:48:12,058 --> 05:48:18,240
just caring just meeting what shows up with a sense

1347
05:48:18,240 --> 05:48:24,540
of receptivity [Music] welcoming

1348
05:48:24,540 --> 05:48:27,540
allowing

1349
05:48:29,638 --> 05:48:36,500
inviting the inside Space to be like the meditation Hall

1350
05:48:36,600 --> 05:48:41,478
there's a lot more space than there are things

1351
05:48:42,620 --> 05:48:49,160
in the same way can we open up inside expand our

1352
05:48:49,160 --> 05:48:58,520
awareness the way we're holding and create the sense of spaciousness

1353
05:49:00,540 --> 05:49:09,298
and just taking these first few minutes to just Witness what's coming up in our own minds hearts

1354
05:49:09,298 --> 05:49:15,120
and bodies foreign

1355
05:49:15,120 --> 05:49:21,862
maybe there were moments today of surprise

1356
05:49:23,520 --> 05:49:30,180
I remember during a walking period the wind was blowing and

1357
05:49:30,180 --> 05:49:36,000
the redwood tree you know it was like rain it sounded

1358
05:49:36,000 --> 05:49:41,700
like rain and every little dried little thing that

1359
05:49:41,700 --> 05:49:47,520
came down made me smile I felt joyful it was like I was so present for this

1360
05:49:47,520 --> 05:49:53,878
delight the surprise the warm air but with wind and the sound

1361
05:49:53,878 --> 05:49:59,400
of rain but knowing it wasn't water just like maybe there were some moments

1362
05:49:59,400 --> 05:50:05,878
like that to you that happened to you today a different way of relating to a thought

1363
05:50:05,878 --> 05:50:14,362
or a Feeling just giving it some space right now

1364
05:50:19,200 --> 05:50:24,376
to be held in this maybe wide Riverbank

1365
05:50:29,638 --> 05:50:36,600
and maybe some of the things that arise right now they might need a little

1366
05:50:36,600 --> 05:50:42,360
more snuggly energy they might need the riverbank to be a little

1367
05:50:42,360 --> 05:50:48,780
closer and so playing with that too

1368
05:50:48,780 --> 05:50:54,780
opening a little bit again and then feeling what needs a little

1369
05:50:54,780 --> 05:51:00,120
more tension touching a little more connection [Music]

1370
05:51:00,120 --> 05:51:03,920
and then resting back again

1371
05:51:08,400 --> 05:51:14,638
and just like the sky is incredibly spacious so generous

1372
05:51:14,638 --> 05:51:20,540
does this guy care that planes fly through

1373
05:51:20,878 --> 05:51:28,080
does it care that there's a weather storm or that it's clear now the sky is fine

1374
05:51:28,080 --> 05:51:32,420
with it all it knows it's the sky

1375
05:51:35,820 --> 05:51:43,282
nothing offends it there's room for it all

1376
05:51:44,520 --> 05:51:49,940
and this is the the type of practice we'll invite now

1377
05:51:50,218 --> 05:51:55,860
spacious open awareness

1378
05:51:56,280 --> 05:52:02,780
and when you find that you have a hard time being spacious

1379
05:52:02,820 --> 05:52:08,240
it's okay to find your anchor and breathe a little bit

1380
05:52:08,240 --> 05:52:15,718
grounding centering and then when it feels okay to relax and

1381
05:52:15,718 --> 05:52:23,700
open up again no problems can't do anything wrong no

1382
05:52:23,700 --> 05:52:30,058
mistakes just being as easy as you can with

1383
05:52:30,058 --> 05:52:37,620
whatever arises and using the skills and tools we covered today as you need them trusting

1384
05:52:37,620 --> 05:52:44,820
yourself paying attention to the results of how you meet your

1385
05:52:44,820 --> 05:52:53,056
experience so maybe putting your hand on your heart

1386
05:52:53,400 --> 05:52:59,240
just a sense of okay I can feel myself I'm here

1387
05:52:59,638 --> 05:53:06,920
I'm gonna bear loving Witness just setting an intention really

1388
05:53:06,920 --> 05:53:14,420
inviting the mind a heart the body to be open

1389
05:53:16,200 --> 05:53:22,558
and for awareness to witness [Music]

1390
05:53:22,558 --> 05:53:25,580
it all

1391
05:54:09,298 --> 05:54:16,942
can we be the knowing be with the knowing

1392
05:54:17,718 --> 05:54:23,520
allowing experience thoughts emotions to move through and watch

1393
05:54:23,520 --> 05:54:31,320
but we don't have to be them I'm Not My Thoughts I'm not my feelings

1394
05:54:31,320 --> 05:54:36,922
it's a part of my experience and I could know it

1395
05:54:37,200 --> 05:54:40,340
can be with it

1396
06:04:30,480 --> 06:04:33,480
foreign

1397
06:04:39,680 --> 06:04:44,120
to notice things

1398
06:04:45,240 --> 06:04:52,138
we come into a space and we notice the chairs or the decorations or the

1399
06:04:52,138 --> 06:05:00,378
people how someone's dressed or what we're trained to do

1400
06:05:00,600 --> 06:05:06,718
so in this practice the invitation is actually to do the opposite

1401
06:05:06,718 --> 06:05:11,542
to notice the space in between things

1402
06:05:12,600 --> 06:05:19,440
to look up around to broaden expand

1403
06:05:20,160 --> 06:05:27,600
to invite the mind to be open spacious

1404
06:05:30,180 --> 06:05:37,216
to connect with awareness knowing at all

1405
06:05:39,420 --> 06:05:43,218
and noticing the space

1406
06:05:45,240 --> 06:05:48,260
the emptiness

1407
06:05:53,760 --> 06:05:56,840
the allowing

1408
06:06:07,860 --> 06:06:11,716
the mind can be boundless

1409
06:10:19,620 --> 06:10:26,542
it might be really helpful to notice the gaps

1410
06:10:26,700 --> 06:10:30,318
the end of a sound

1411
06:10:33,240 --> 06:10:36,440
it's fading away

1412
06:10:47,100 --> 06:10:54,740
new sounds will come and then noticing when they fade

1413
06:20:10,920 --> 06:20:16,100
it's very natural for the mind to

1414
06:20:16,558 --> 06:20:20,958
move from one thing to the next

1415
06:20:22,500 --> 06:20:27,540
what we can do is hold our attention

1416
06:20:27,540 --> 06:20:34,558
on the gaps endings

1417
06:20:35,700 --> 06:20:40,100
sort of sinking into it

1418
06:20:41,700 --> 06:20:47,160
letting it soak in those moments of quiet or

1419
06:20:47,160 --> 06:20:50,160
is

1420
06:20:53,458 --> 06:20:58,820
noticing receiving

1421
06:21:03,000 --> 06:21:06,020
the space

1422
06:21:19,740 --> 06:21:25,280
if it feels appropriate for you you might

1423
06:21:25,378 --> 06:21:32,056
I'll tell you this and you can decide if you want to try this

1424
06:21:33,840 --> 06:21:40,522
but you might actually very gently and slowly open your eyes

1425
06:21:41,100 --> 06:21:47,238
and just notice where the eyes go what they take in

1426
06:21:51,840 --> 06:21:58,260
and then see if you can't

1427
06:21:58,260 --> 06:22:06,420
shift your gaze something that is space

1428
06:22:06,420 --> 06:22:12,680
a gap the openness the light

1429
06:22:13,200 --> 06:22:20,040
and just try and hold your attention on that emptiness

1430
06:22:20,040 --> 06:22:22,940
that space

1431
06:22:30,120 --> 06:22:33,796
the objects are still there

1432
06:22:35,458 --> 06:22:39,500
but we're shifting our awareness

1433
06:22:40,798 --> 06:22:44,362
to what we're taking in

1434
06:22:51,900 --> 06:22:58,558
in the same way you may close your eyes again and just see how that helps you

1435
06:22:58,558 --> 06:23:05,900
practice in the last five minutes with connecting with the spaciousness

1436
06:23:05,900 --> 06:23:09,740
the sky Within

1437
06:25:44,520 --> 06:25:49,216
I'm going to ring the bell slowly

1438
06:25:50,638 --> 06:25:56,340
and allow silence between the bells to allow you space and time

1439
06:25:56,340 --> 06:26:04,702
before you come out of the meditation to stay with

1440
06:26:14,440 --> 06:26:17,848
[Music]

1441
06:27:14,670 --> 06:27:17,860
[Music]

1442
06:28:09,240 --> 06:28:18,660
foreign taking some time to stand and stretch or

1443
06:28:18,660 --> 06:28:25,400
to shift the position of the body as you need

1444
06:28:32,100 --> 06:28:37,458
noticing how the body is right now

1445
06:28:46,440 --> 06:28:48,620
foreign

1446
06:29:16,200 --> 06:29:18,376
thank you

1447
06:29:42,860 --> 06:29:49,160
we now have another period for Reflections questions

1448
06:29:49,160 --> 06:29:54,298
anything that you'd like to share and I'd like to include the YouTube

1449
06:29:54,298 --> 06:30:00,000
folks so thanks Richard for noticing anything

1450
06:30:00,000 --> 06:30:07,080
that they have to share but just could be anything about the meditation you just or the

1451
06:30:07,080 --> 06:30:13,558
meditations you just went through the day a general question

1452
06:30:13,558 --> 06:30:20,840
or a reflection on what you've been noticing and how that is for you

1453
06:30:22,440 --> 06:30:25,280
yes please

1454
06:30:28,740 --> 06:30:36,180
all right um okay so I've been meditating for a

1455
06:30:36,180 --> 06:30:43,260
few months and I've noticed that it does help with like the I guess like the strength of

1456
06:30:43,260 --> 06:30:49,620
thoughts and emotions but as you kind of dig deeper into some of like the

1457
06:30:49,620 --> 06:30:57,058
thoughts and emotions they tend to be triggered by specific like strong negative core beliefs so all meditation

1458
06:30:57,058 --> 06:31:03,780
seems to help like mitigate the symptoms of these core beliefs it doesn't really feel like it helps

1459
06:31:03,780 --> 06:31:10,080
really address the issue at hand which is like these strong negative core beliefs so I'm curious how you work with

1460
06:31:10,080 --> 06:31:17,100
that well first of all it's great that you notice that they're coming out of these

1461
06:31:17,100 --> 06:31:25,378
core beliefs you know we all get conditioned into beliefs views about ourself about others

1462
06:31:25,378 --> 06:31:31,138
and about how the world works over a lifetime so the fact that you've

1463
06:31:31,138 --> 06:31:39,058
identified that is great and I would say allowing time for yourself to see the

1464
06:31:39,058 --> 06:31:44,958
manifestations of that is much more valuable than you might imagine because

1465
06:31:44,958 --> 06:31:50,638
sometimes these play out in how we hold our body

1466
06:31:50,638 --> 06:31:57,058
how we think what emotions come up how we interact it's a huge world

1467
06:31:57,058 --> 06:32:03,958
so taking time to notice that world and the core and

1468
06:32:03,958 --> 06:32:09,058
then over time there may be something evident about what's underneath the core

1469
06:32:09,058 --> 06:32:15,660
beliefs or what all is in there I mean gradually kind of unfold for you

1470
06:32:15,660 --> 06:32:23,660
and ultimately it's just a process that I think requires a lot of patience

1471
06:32:24,480 --> 06:32:31,500
great great question great observation I think I just I I want to offer

1472
06:32:31,500 --> 06:32:39,078
something just to see because you know some people are more or less connected with this idea of core beliefs

1473
06:32:39,180 --> 06:32:44,940
um maybe a way to think about a core belief is sort of like um

1474
06:32:44,940 --> 06:32:50,400
the Earth is round it's like kind of a fact

1475
06:32:50,400 --> 06:32:57,000
right for most of us not all of us but it's just it within your own being

1476
06:32:57,000 --> 06:33:03,540
it's so just unquestionable it's just there it's like almost you don't even

1477
06:33:03,540 --> 06:33:10,860
know it's there because it's so just accepted

1478
06:33:10,860 --> 06:33:16,620
and a view might be more like um or a general belief might you might notice it

1479
06:33:16,620 --> 06:33:22,282
sounds like something in your head it's more like a

1480
06:33:22,620 --> 06:33:28,280
you know it's really impolite to do X

1481
06:33:28,620 --> 06:33:35,638
you're supposed to stop at the stop sign all the way not roll like that's like

1482
06:33:35,638 --> 06:33:42,600
more of like um more of a kind of a belief that's just sort of you know something that you

1483
06:33:42,600 --> 06:33:49,080
if there's more narration around it narrative right so just to try and get a

1484
06:33:49,080 --> 06:33:54,120
feel for how core beliefs exist within us they're very they're kind of

1485
06:33:54,120 --> 06:34:00,120
structural foreign they're kind of structural so they can be hard to notice

1486
06:34:00,120 --> 06:34:09,298
and um so you know when we and they are very influential in terms of like uh

1487
06:34:09,298 --> 06:34:14,638
very influential in in some ways that are it's a kind of I don't know out of

1488
06:34:14,638 --> 06:34:20,100
sight almost but just holding that just sort of

1489
06:34:20,100 --> 06:34:25,200
seeing Oh there's a core belief and like sort of maybe doing some of

1490
06:34:25,200 --> 06:34:31,558
this opening around it with this curiosity like is the Earth

1491
06:34:31,558 --> 06:34:38,280
really round how do I know that it's round you know kind of idea and

1492
06:34:38,280 --> 06:34:45,718
what happens if I believe the Earth is round what would it be like if I believe the Earth was flat instead

1493
06:34:45,718 --> 06:34:51,600
sort of just loosening it up a little bit and exploring it in that way can

1494
06:34:51,600 --> 06:34:58,798
might be helpful thank you one of the things I really

1495
06:34:58,798 --> 06:35:04,620
appreciate the way Tanya opened that up just now and some examples this is where

1496
06:35:04,620 --> 06:35:10,020
practice often leads us we we may be going along noticing our

1497
06:35:10,020 --> 06:35:17,760
thoughts noticing the patterns of our emotions and what happens in suddenly discover that we have a core belief

1498
06:35:17,760 --> 06:35:24,240
I'm not good enough or a core belief other people do stuff wrong and that's

1499
06:35:24,240 --> 06:35:30,000
what makes me unhappy so there there are very many of these

1500
06:35:30,000 --> 06:35:37,400
but that is actually what often what this meditation peels back to reveal

1501
06:35:37,500 --> 06:35:46,260
that helpful great other Reflections comments or questions

1502
06:35:46,260 --> 06:35:53,120
things you notice today that you'd like to share with others as a gift

1503
06:36:02,520 --> 06:36:08,218
um I would just like to say that I'm just kind of Blown Away with how moved I

1504
06:36:08,218 --> 06:36:16,320
am just to be in the space again after covid and and the Buddha statue so unperturbed

1505
06:36:16,320 --> 06:36:22,320
and the redwood tree you know that um it's just

1506
06:36:22,320 --> 06:36:28,680
I don't know just a lot of feelings have come up and I want to say thank you Liz

1507
06:36:28,680 --> 06:36:32,900
and Tanya I feel very nurtured

1508
06:36:34,138 --> 06:36:40,500
you Jan maybe I'll say to this moment that um

1509
06:36:40,500 --> 06:36:48,058
I also feel very nurtured by the YouTube people it really helps me to know that there's

1510
06:36:48,058 --> 06:36:56,638
this worldwide net of people connected to IMC and practicing with us supporting

1511
06:36:56,638 --> 06:37:02,458
us and how important each of you are here to help

1512
06:37:02,458 --> 06:37:08,218
you know you're helping create the space that holds what we're all sharing

1513
06:37:08,218 --> 06:37:14,638
together so thank you Jan and every one of you and all of you out there

1514
06:37:14,638 --> 06:37:21,480
all right Naina yeah to your question about the gift um to give it's mostly

1515
06:37:21,480 --> 06:37:27,540
really appreciation for for both of you for the

1516
06:37:27,540 --> 06:37:34,440
effort you have put into coming and making this space available for us

1517
06:37:34,440 --> 06:37:41,400
and I too have felt the care that you have put into it and so so thank you I'm

1518
06:37:41,400 --> 06:37:44,180
so touched

1519
06:37:47,218 --> 06:37:54,660
thank you So speaking of YouTube great Diane is

1520
06:37:54,660 --> 06:38:01,920
your last name working with emotions I sometimes tend to go down the rabbit hole of looking for why that emotion

1521
06:38:01,920 --> 06:38:09,020
came up yeah that's a really good observation

1522
06:38:09,020 --> 06:38:15,600
and there's so there are many different ways to work with emotions one thing

1523
06:38:15,600 --> 06:38:22,440
that's interesting about mindfulness is oftentimes we can let go of the why and

1524
06:38:22,440 --> 06:38:28,080
notice that something is happening anger is arising

1525
06:38:28,080 --> 06:38:35,400
Palm is arising Joy is arising disappointment is arising just that we

1526
06:38:35,400 --> 06:38:41,280
notice that's Rising we notice how it affects the body we notice how thoughts

1527
06:38:41,280 --> 06:38:49,260
May spin out of it so that's one very uh amazing advantage of mindfulness that

1528
06:38:49,260 --> 06:38:55,020
sometimes we don't have to know why and things can transform just by noticing

1529
06:38:55,020 --> 06:39:01,680
them and that they arise and that they're Rising of course it can be very

1530
06:39:01,680 --> 06:39:07,878
helpful to understand the origin of motions as well so sometimes

1531
06:39:07,878 --> 06:39:14,458
meditators may spend time journaling or reflecting on the the background of

1532
06:39:14,458 --> 06:39:22,320
their emotional life what you were taught to accept as common emotions growing up

1533
06:39:22,320 --> 06:39:28,138
with the people you grew up with what emotions surface most frequently so

1534
06:39:28,138 --> 06:39:35,280
this this is also a very worthy area of of study so there's no one way but there

1535
06:39:35,280 --> 06:39:44,400
are many ways to work with it thank you Liz um Diane is that what her name was Diane

1536
06:39:44,400 --> 06:39:50,400
um one thing I want to say to Diane is you describe something so for me

1537
06:39:50,400 --> 06:39:56,100
visceral which is the rabbit hole going down the rabbit hole which

1538
06:39:56,100 --> 06:40:02,420
um it describes actually to me it says you have an awareness of what it feels like to get

1539
06:40:02,420 --> 06:40:08,400
entangled and caught in the emotion that's sort of how it feels in in my

1540
06:40:08,400 --> 06:40:15,298
body so that is a huge gift that you can describe it that way

1541
06:40:15,298 --> 06:40:20,400
and so again sort of the opposite of

1542
06:40:20,400 --> 06:40:26,458
that might be the riverbed allowing things to flow through the opening up

1543
06:40:26,458 --> 06:40:35,058
around the experience even if you find yourself in the rabbit hole it's like this and then okay so I feel like this

1544
06:40:35,058 --> 06:40:40,440
and then you know is it possible to open up around it

1545
06:40:40,440 --> 06:40:46,798
is it possible to kind of create a little bit of space because

1546
06:40:46,798 --> 06:40:52,740
emotion is an experience it's an experience we're having but

1547
06:40:52,740 --> 06:41:01,320
again it's not Who We Are and if we're over involved in it we're

1548
06:41:01,320 --> 06:41:09,240
um we don't have the space to let it move through and we tend to be re-igniting reigniting and then the

1549
06:41:09,240 --> 06:41:15,240
teasing apart idea of that the raft practice where we tease it apart here is

1550
06:41:15,240 --> 06:41:23,760
a memory here's a view here's a core belief you know here's an image just trying to

1551
06:41:23,760 --> 06:41:28,798
again it's like everything gets knotted up and tied up together

1552
06:41:28,798 --> 06:41:33,840
and it's pretty hard to deal with things when they're like that so relaxing

1553
06:41:33,840 --> 06:41:41,100
opening and then sort of helping sift through can be helpful so I'll ask Diane

1554
06:41:41,100 --> 06:41:46,320
if she feels that that was helpful if she has any further questions she can

1555
06:41:46,320 --> 06:41:51,718
well she's responded a little bit so great uh because she's typing and I'm

1556
06:41:51,718 --> 06:41:57,058
speaking for her so she says thank you and then yes as you describe the rabbit

1557
06:41:57,058 --> 06:42:04,860
hole process and then she says the rabbit hole to me seems more like the thinking process around the emotion

1558
06:42:04,860 --> 06:42:11,520
and then Diane says the why of it sort of thinking about the emotion the why of

1559
06:42:11,520 --> 06:42:18,120
it which is reminding me true too yeah um really good points that she's raising

1560
06:42:18,120 --> 06:42:23,878
that and that tiny just alluded to that there's such a thing as fuel that we

1561
06:42:23,878 --> 06:42:30,360
throw on the Fire we're in the rabbit hole and we throw more thoughts in and we're down further

1562
06:42:30,360 --> 06:42:36,058
in the rabbit hole or we can have this thought of is there any way I can open out of this

1563
06:42:36,058 --> 06:42:42,860
so um this is a huge area practice and I'd encourage patients

1564
06:42:42,860 --> 06:42:49,500
infinite patience for allowing Discovery over time

1565
06:42:49,500 --> 06:42:54,660
about emotions I have a great quote I want to share if

1566
06:42:54,660 --> 06:43:02,280
I can find it um it's by Rick rorden

1567
06:43:02,280 --> 06:43:11,580
you can't think your way out of your emotions you can't think your way out of emotions

1568
06:43:11,580 --> 06:43:16,980
doesn't work yeah they're already here for one thing

1569
06:43:16,980 --> 06:43:24,480
they and they are a record perhaps of our conditioning because they show us in a moment in a

1570
06:43:24,480 --> 06:43:29,520
Flash how we've been conditioned you know around

1571
06:43:29,520 --> 06:43:34,558
oops around the thoughts that have FedEd the

1572
06:43:34,558 --> 06:43:42,058
experiences that have had it they're kind of a flash reaction summarizing the past

1573
06:43:42,058 --> 06:43:47,600
all right Diane says thank you great great

1574
06:43:52,558 --> 06:43:58,700
almonds great Iris

1575
06:43:58,700 --> 06:44:03,796
uh there Naina has it thank you Naina

1576
06:44:07,260 --> 06:44:15,058
okay um I guess the question before kind of brought up so if you like or with an

1577
06:44:15,058 --> 06:44:21,058
emotion and maybe you don't really understand why it was triggered do you just kind of let that be and be okay

1578
06:44:21,058 --> 06:44:27,780
with it in summary like as you're trying to tease it apart maybe you don't understand like what

1579
06:44:27,780 --> 06:44:34,500
specifically caused it um that's part of that you recognize

1580
06:44:34,500 --> 06:44:40,378
what you can about it you allow what it is even if it's kind of unknown it's

1581
06:44:40,378 --> 06:44:47,520
kind of murky allow it feel it however it feels notice where it

1582
06:44:47,520 --> 06:44:55,680
is in the body and even if you can't tease it apart that kind of accept allow feel will

1583
06:44:55,680 --> 06:45:01,500
serve you trust that it's there for a reason it's you know it's coming up for

1584
06:45:01,500 --> 06:45:07,440
in response to something and you can be with the fact that it's there

1585
06:45:07,440 --> 06:45:14,458
hmm yeah that's you know one thing to know it helps me sometimes to look at

1586
06:45:14,458 --> 06:45:20,040
neuroscience and what we know from that about studying the brain and one way

1587
06:45:20,040 --> 06:45:26,218
they describe the brain in Neuroscience is that it is an organ and its job is to

1588
06:45:26,218 --> 06:45:33,240
predict and it predicts based on past experience or associations

1589
06:45:33,240 --> 06:45:40,138
and so sometimes emotions can be triggered before we're even conscious of what's going on because the the brain is

1590
06:45:40,138 --> 06:45:47,340
predicting something and it doesn't come to be but the emotion still got triggered or we don't notice that it

1591
06:45:47,340 --> 06:45:53,638
didn't come to be whatever we were expecting because we get so caught up in our our predicting or anticipating you

1592
06:45:53,638 --> 06:45:58,160
know mind so it's a tricky thing

1593
06:45:59,340 --> 06:46:05,100
thank you and also thank you for taking the data set this is very helpful

1594
06:46:05,100 --> 06:46:07,636
great

1595
06:46:20,458 --> 06:46:25,876
I think one of the um the gifts of mindfulness

1596
06:46:27,000 --> 06:46:36,360
is it gives us choice having the capacity to sit back a bit

1597
06:46:36,360 --> 06:46:43,260
to observe to pause gives us so much more freedom in our

1598
06:46:43,260 --> 06:46:50,100
life so much more choice without it without the mindfulness

1599
06:46:50,100 --> 06:46:58,520
without the capacity to kind of let go or sit back

1600
06:46:58,798 --> 06:47:05,700
here's a quote a different quote about emotions I feel like this is what can happen to us it's not it's Elizabeth

1601
06:47:05,700 --> 06:47:12,660
Gilbert says this and it I don't think it's a fact the way it is but without mindfulness I think it's what happens

1602
06:47:12,660 --> 06:47:18,440
your emotions are the slaves to your thoughts

1603
06:47:18,780 --> 06:47:27,240
and you are the slave to your emotions and that's what happens without

1604
06:47:27,240 --> 06:47:38,000
the capacity to witness to observe to know to let go to pause to breathe to choose

1605
06:47:39,740 --> 06:47:45,058
pointing to something really valuable about mindfulness meditation practice

1606
06:47:45,058 --> 06:47:50,458
and where this leads because you'll come to a point after you've done this for a

1607
06:47:50,458 --> 06:47:55,920
while where you can see the rabbit hole you can go I'm not going down that

1608
06:47:55,920 --> 06:48:03,058
rabbit hole it's not worth it I could worry and worry about this thing that's never happened

1609
06:48:03,058 --> 06:48:10,920
most of the horrible experiences in my life have never happened it's just the mind has created these and

1610
06:48:10,920 --> 06:48:18,202
so you can see the choice after a time after observing these things for a while

1611
06:48:18,420 --> 06:48:24,718
or the horrible experience happened once but I've relived it a hundred times

1612
06:48:24,718 --> 06:48:30,738
and I didn't have to yeah

1613
06:48:43,458 --> 06:48:48,900
any last comments

1614
06:48:49,320 --> 06:48:54,320
things that have happened that you're sitting with

1615
06:49:06,240 --> 06:49:13,080
so I'd like to invite everybody to take a moment to recognize how much you've

1616
06:49:13,080 --> 06:49:18,180
been through today you've actually been through a

1617
06:49:18,180 --> 06:49:24,558
significant amount of practice and training a whole day devoted to

1618
06:49:24,558 --> 06:49:29,122
mindfulness to seeing what's coming up

1619
06:49:30,240 --> 06:49:35,700
and how that's been for you maybe some things you really found

1620
06:49:35,700 --> 06:49:41,478
helpful you could use them it was really great and some things were challenging

1621
06:49:41,478 --> 06:49:50,040
or maybe it was all challenging or it was all helpful so just appreciating that whatever you

1622
06:49:50,040 --> 06:49:55,320
put into today every moment of mindfulness matters is

1623
06:49:55,320 --> 06:50:02,280
what that's what I've noticed in the years of practice that every moment every

1624
06:50:02,280 --> 06:50:08,160
sitting it may not the fruits of it may not be apparent right away

1625
06:50:08,160 --> 06:50:14,580
in fact it often isn't but later something has subtly shifted something

1626
06:50:14,580 --> 06:50:22,260
shows up it's like wow it really was useful it really was useful to sit

1627
06:50:22,260 --> 06:50:28,138
and maybe reflecting for a moment are you do you feel different in some ways

1628
06:50:28,138 --> 06:50:31,702
than when you came in this morning

1629
06:50:38,040 --> 06:50:44,218
and then how what's your relationship with how it was today

1630
06:50:44,218 --> 06:50:52,080
meaning do you have an attitude towards it like yeah that felt that felt

1631
06:50:52,080 --> 06:50:58,620
really good and wonderful or while I'm worried I'm not sure I can get this thing or it could be anything but just

1632
06:50:58,620 --> 06:51:04,978
taking a moment to notice what your relationship is with what has happened

1633
06:51:04,978 --> 06:51:12,120
today is just information about conditioning

1634
06:51:16,080 --> 06:51:24,058
we could look at today as a day full of experimentation and play and just

1635
06:51:24,058 --> 06:51:27,138
learning new things

1636
06:51:30,360 --> 06:51:39,860
one of the things that can be helpful is um reflecting on any wholesome or helpful

1637
06:51:39,860 --> 06:51:45,900
or good feeling that has come up for you today or is present with you right knee

1638
06:51:45,900 --> 06:51:51,478
now even if you're just a little bit calmer than you were when you came in

1639
06:51:51,478 --> 06:51:57,442
this morning that landing on and feeling

1640
06:51:57,798 --> 06:52:03,420
beneficial feelings or body States or states of

1641
06:52:03,420 --> 06:52:10,320
mind or even the spaciousness that Tanya just invited us into just that quality

1642
06:52:10,320 --> 06:52:16,440
of spaciousness when we take the time out to appreciate those

1643
06:52:16,440 --> 06:52:23,638
feel them that reinforces those beautiful qualities and the

1644
06:52:23,638 --> 06:52:26,958
can realize again

1645
06:52:32,638 --> 06:52:39,718
and if today showed you some difficulties some areas

1646
06:52:39,718 --> 06:52:47,520
that were challenging I'd like to say that's also excellent that you saw that and to keep in mind

1647
06:52:47,520 --> 06:52:55,558
that this is called the gradual path it slowly unfolds us

1648
06:52:55,558 --> 06:53:04,218
in our own time allow that allow it to unfold

1649
06:53:04,218 --> 06:53:09,840
there's a a kind of story I'm going to paraphrase maybe not quite accurately

1650
06:53:09,840 --> 06:53:15,298
but a story in one of the books that Gil francon has written called the monastery

1651
06:53:15,298 --> 06:53:22,138
within that's about you know a monastic who's living in the monastery who's on

1652
06:53:22,138 --> 06:53:29,100
fire to be totally free and asks the abbess so how long will it take me if I

1653
06:53:29,100 --> 06:53:36,958
really really focus on this and the Abba says you know something maybe seven years and

1654
06:53:36,958 --> 06:53:42,058
the the monastic says yeah but what if I really work on it harder oh it'll take a

1655
06:53:42,058 --> 06:53:47,780
lot longer so I love that story because

1656
06:53:47,780 --> 06:53:53,580
you know we can we can move at a more natural pace and let ourselves

1657
06:53:53,580 --> 06:53:59,580
unfold and show us what we need to look at and know

1658
06:53:59,580 --> 06:54:04,740
we don't need to rush ourselves another thing Gill says that I really

1659
06:54:04,740 --> 06:54:09,900
love is that if this practice leads us to full

1660
06:54:09,900 --> 06:54:15,000
Liberation in this lifetime wonderful but if it doesn't we've lived a way

1661
06:54:15,000 --> 06:54:20,280
better life in the process and I'll attest that the last 18 years of my life

1662
06:54:20,280 --> 06:54:26,400
have been happier and happier and happier and more

1663
06:54:26,400 --> 06:54:35,122
smooth and free of Affliction so what's not to love about that

1664
06:54:48,200 --> 06:54:54,558
one of the things you can do taking this practice back into your life

1665
06:54:54,558 --> 06:55:01,440
is use some of these tools even during the middle of the day I've known parents that have trained

1666
06:55:01,440 --> 06:55:09,080
their young children to we're both going to stop right now and we're just going to take three breaths

1667
06:55:28,260 --> 06:55:34,920
I've had a practice for a long time of whenever I get up from my chair

1668
06:55:34,920 --> 06:55:41,940
at work or at home I tune into the body and how it feels to walk to the restroom

1669
06:55:41,940 --> 06:55:49,620
to the kitchen wherever I'm going I just feel that walking so there's these mini mindfulness breaks

1670
06:55:49,620 --> 06:55:56,340
throughout the day and as you pay attention taking breaks

1671
06:55:56,340 --> 06:56:02,340
out to breathe paying attention to the body catching yourself in the middle of

1672
06:56:02,340 --> 06:56:07,440
thinking or a Feeling you could say You're Building more

1673
06:56:07,440 --> 06:56:15,860
steadiness more collectedness more sometimes it's called concentration

1674
06:56:17,718 --> 06:56:22,978
but by noticing these things in some of the questions we can notice

1675
06:56:22,978 --> 06:56:32,100
what we're feeding there's this story about um the wolf you feed and the Wolf you feed

1676
06:56:32,100 --> 06:56:37,860
grows stronger and the Wolf you don't feed grows weaker so we can watch what

1677
06:56:37,860 --> 06:56:43,320
we're feeding you know as we watch our thoughts as we watch our

1678
06:56:43,320 --> 06:56:49,680
emotions and as we watch our attitudes we can understand what have I been

1679
06:56:49,680 --> 06:56:55,320
feeding am I feeding things that are helping me or am I

1680
06:56:55,320 --> 06:57:02,520
feeding things that are making things harder for me these are just some of the things that may come up for you

1681
06:57:02,520 --> 06:57:11,280
so as we leave today um this is you know a wonderful Center that

1682
06:57:11,280 --> 06:57:19,080
has a lot of programs that can help you continue this practice Tanya's going to have a class

1683
06:57:19,080 --> 06:57:26,040
in building a practice that's coming up so I'd encourage you to attend that and

1684
06:57:26,040 --> 06:57:31,378
about a month from now I think there will be another day long with kodo and Tanya

1685
06:57:31,378 --> 06:57:37,200
so that's a resource there are sittings on Sundays Monday nights there's a half

1686
06:57:37,200 --> 06:57:43,740
day on Wednesday that's wonderful to attend if your schedule has that flexibility and there are all kinds of

1687
06:57:43,740 --> 06:57:50,040
programs Tuesday Morning Thursday evening so there's a a lot of ways here

1688
06:57:50,040 --> 06:57:58,500
to continue to cultivate your practice it's valuable to continue to to build a

1689
06:57:58,500 --> 06:58:04,138
daily practice of finding a time of day that you can do this sitting practice

1690
06:58:04,138 --> 06:58:10,080
that works for you and sometimes it takes some experimentation you know first thing in the morning is better or

1691
06:58:10,080 --> 06:58:15,600
the evening or do I do it during my lunch break but even if you start small

1692
06:58:15,600 --> 06:58:20,700
you know start with a 20-minute meditation do that for a while then

1693
06:58:20,700 --> 06:58:26,520
maybe 25 or even if it's 20 21 22 you

1694
06:58:26,520 --> 06:58:32,820
can build a practice but the the daily quality of it can really help to

1695
06:58:32,820 --> 06:58:40,860
reinforce what you've been learning today and um it's very interesting but often the day

1696
06:58:40,860 --> 06:58:48,058
goes better no matter what kind of sitting you have quite an interesting phenomenon

1697
06:58:48,058 --> 06:58:55,878
we have a library here with lots of different books on Buddhism that can be checked out and brought back

1698
06:58:55,878 --> 06:59:01,760
there's as you know there are these online offerings gills morning sitting

1699
06:59:01,760 --> 06:59:10,100
and Dharma talk so there are tons of tools and

1700
06:59:10,100 --> 06:59:17,400
opportunities here at IMC and online the YouTube folks I'm I'm usually one of

1701
06:59:17,400 --> 06:59:22,680
you I don't live here so I'm normally out there in cyberspace with the rest of

1702
06:59:22,680 --> 06:59:27,900
you so I wonder if there are any questions

1703
06:59:27,900 --> 06:59:33,958
about what's available here or about Tanya's class maybe you could say a little bit

1704
06:59:33,958 --> 06:59:40,500
about when that's going to be it started last week oh great Thursday

1705
06:59:40,500 --> 06:59:47,100
but pretty much every Thursday night assuming people show up I'll be teaching

1706
06:59:47,100 --> 06:59:52,860
a class one class after another so right now the plan is establishing a practice

1707
06:59:52,860 --> 06:59:59,218
is the focus for the month of September October will be let's talk about

1708
06:59:59,218 --> 07:00:05,520
practice November we'll be living the practice

1709
07:00:05,520 --> 07:00:11,100
December will be the four noble truths so each month will sort of be a class

1710
07:00:11,100 --> 07:00:16,378
format where there's a combination of teachings practice guided practices and

1711
07:00:16,378 --> 07:00:24,000
small group discussions and Q a so would love to see any of you there at any time

1712
07:00:24,000 --> 07:00:30,360
thank you and it will be on YouTube yes

1713
07:00:30,600 --> 07:00:36,180
I forgot to mention one of my favorites that happens here every night every week

1714
07:00:36,180 --> 07:00:42,298
night at six o'clock uh Pacific time is called happy hour

1715
07:00:42,298 --> 07:00:48,240
and happy hour is dedicated to some practices that uh

1716
07:00:48,240 --> 07:00:53,638
we work with qualities of loving kindness or we could just call it

1717
07:00:53,638 --> 07:01:00,240
kindness compassion equanimity sympathetic Joy so the qualities of the

1718
07:01:00,240 --> 07:01:07,200
heart that are that really feel good and actually that's the way we're going to end today so some of you may never have

1719
07:01:07,200 --> 07:01:13,020
heard of this practice before but we'll just do a couple of minutes of it

1720
07:01:13,020 --> 07:01:20,058
and so you may find a comfortable posture this time

1721
07:01:22,080 --> 07:01:28,458
and allow yourself to take some breaths

1722
07:01:37,638 --> 07:01:43,440
sometimes this kindness practice or loving kindness practice

1723
07:01:43,440 --> 07:01:52,378
which is also called meta practice is done in the form of phrases

1724
07:01:52,378 --> 07:01:58,978
so we'll do just a little bit of that right now bring to mind

1725
07:01:58,978 --> 07:02:04,680
the effort that you've put in today the way you

1726
07:02:04,680 --> 07:02:11,580
've come back to the breath come back to the body and worked with what we've presented

1727
07:02:11,580 --> 07:02:18,120
today really bringing that fully into your mind and heart seeing

1728
07:02:18,120 --> 07:02:23,638

1736
07:03:27,660 --> 07:03:36,900
today or found some things challenging bringing that to mind as a dear friend
