okay

7
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,439
so

8
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,759
so just as we begin using the ambient sound

9
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:48,799
people trickling in to bring you more deeply

10
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,200
into the moment

11
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,680
we treat all all phenomena as a gateway

12
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,519
affording ourselves the relief of not needing to sort out

13
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,200
the pleasant and the unpleasant

14
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,160
everything helping us arrive

15
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,239
so

16
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,800
so

17
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:21,479
and we breathe sensitive to the whole body

18
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:37,240
as if the whole body were breathing

19
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,400
so

20
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,919
come back

21
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,440
so

22
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,560
so

23
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,440
um

24
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,039
this realm samsara

25
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,399
is relentlessly presenting options

26
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,360
of what might be what should be

27
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,680
and so often we're seduced into

28
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,959
optimizing the moment

29
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,639
maybe it's safe enough

30
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,360
to let go

31
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,040
to not read the tea leaves of pleasure and pain

32
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:38,000
to be present is to be utterly undefended

33
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,800
against imperfection

34
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,040
uh

35
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,480

um

84
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,160
so in january tiknot han died at the age of

85
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:23,680
95. which was i think about seven years after a major

86
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,880
stroke and

87
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:35,839
when i i heard i didn't find myself especially

88
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:40,640
emotional but then i

89
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,920
looked at some pictures of him you know

90
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:53,599
found myself crying just seeing seeing his face

91
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:59,960
and all that is conveyed by his face

92
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:07,440
and one of my my uh first uh deep encounters with dharma was

93
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,480
a a tiknothon young adult sangha in uh in los angeles and

94
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,920
i had kind of passing academic interest in

95
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:27,359
meditation but had never really encountered the dharma and

96
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:33,760
i had a couple apartment mates at the time who

97
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:40,000
two friends moved out two new people moved in and

98
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,400
they were both meditators long-term meditators and um they they told me that they were going

99
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:52,480
to have a housewarming party which was their way of not

100
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:59,839
freaking me out that it was going to be a gathering of the sangha yeah

101
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:06,319
and um and so i at the time was working in

102
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:14,480
residential treatment uh with adolescent boys really intense

103
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:22,319
work beautiful work and really intense and i had no idea about like

104
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:30,000
self-care or anything like that every day i just sort of left it all on the table you know and

105
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,480
would come home just like kind of wrecked you know and uh

106
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,160
heartful and wrecked and uh i remember

107
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:47,440
one of those nights i uh i kind of like barreled in the front door

108
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,760
after a long day and a group of people were sitting around

109
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,280
candlelight talking about love you know

110
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:05,839
and that made an impression you know

111
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:10,960
like okay this is

112
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:21,000
like a parallel universe kind of and uh i sat down i sat down

113
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,359
i hadn't i hadn't heard from the group in 20 years that kind of everyone went their

114
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,800
own ways hadn't heard literally 20 years and

115
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:39,839
and a week before uh tiknahan who people call him tai the week before he

116
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:46,838
died somebody started a thread out of nowhere no

117
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:55,760
so i i went through different relationships to his teaching

118
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:03,440
sort of uh feeling like uh that it times it reaching me at times

119
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:09,280
feeling [Applause] somehow kind of sentimental or something

120
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:15,440
or idealistic and i found that as my own

121
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:22,400
practice my own encounter with the dharma deepens what what a text what a person what a tradition does to one's

122
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:29,760
heart changes too and you really see how much you might have missed in

123
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,839
earlier encounters and with his teaching

124
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:40,880
for sure i see

125
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,800
yeah just tremendous depth and grace

126
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:55,200
and so i was not uh you know i did not have a lot of contact with him but did practice at

127
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,480
a deer park outside san diego and

128
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:07,440
peace walks in in los angeles and

129
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,838
taught with some later taught with some of his his monastics and

130
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:25,078
yeah he left a kind of mark and so what a pay tribute to that

131
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:33,119
who can you talk who can you really trust when they talk about love

132
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,839
like who has earned the moral credibility to actually

133
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:45,599
say love and it's trustworthy

134
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:54,880
one way of earning that moral credibility is to

135
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,319
encounter tremendous hardship and persist

136
00:44:00,319 --> 00:44:05,520
in a sense of love devotion to love

137
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:13,680
and tai was on the front lines of war of religious persecution of exile for

138
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,280
almost 40 years and so when he says love i take that

139
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,400
seriously when he persists in that that

140
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:31,599
um our redemption is through love i take that seriously

141
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,319
this is uh him in in conversation with bill hoax is 2000.

142
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:47,359
martin luther king was among us as a brother as a friend as a leader he was able to

143
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:54,480
maintain that love when you touch him you touch a bodhisattva for his understanding and love

144
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:01,520
was enough to hold everything to him he tried to transmit his insight and his

145
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:07,280
love to the community but maybe we have not received it enough

146
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:15,200
he was trying to transmit the best things to us his goodness his love his non-duality

147
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:21,520
but because we had clung so much to him as a person we did not bring the essence of what he

148
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:27,200
was teaching into our community so now that he's no longer here we are

149
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:33,680
at a loss we have to be aware that the crucial

150
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:41,680
transmission he was making was not the transmission of power of authority of position

151
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:47,838
but the transmission of the dharma it means love

152
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:58,160
it can be can be hard to trace the influences of

153
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,960
one's teachers on one's own being

154
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:12,079
and myself now doing some teaching i

155
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:18,640
am cognizant that i'm sort of like plagiarizing all of my teachers all of

156
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:25,440
the time without being aware of it it feels like it's my original thought

157
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:33,680
but it's not and it's not because they become part of us you know

158
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:41,359
like when we encounter them a teacher open heartedly their goodness we sort of like distill

159
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:48,560
out the medicine that they have for our own heart and it becomes a part of us and it feels

160
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:54,720
native to our heart and so it's hard to tell what is them

161
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,800
and what is oneself

162
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:08,079
and ty's teachings have they've had a major impact on

163
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:15,599
the kind of certainly the buddhist practice in this country many countries

164
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:22,880
one of the things i remember most was his body the way he

165
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,280
he moved it was just

166
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:33,839
it just had a kind of moral force to it you know it was like it was the teaching

167
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:38,960
itself and i don't know i'm not

168
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,480
temperamentally a kind of patient person

169
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:52,240
but to see him take a step kind of like issue this commandment you

170
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:57,280
know to like get still

171
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:03,359
because all of my movement or impatience or the activities of my mind in those

172
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:09,839
moments they just they just had this kind of absurd sort of

173
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:16,960
look in the mirror of his presence and stillness

174
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:25,440
and i heard that after his stroke uh two monks would stand on each shoulder

175
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:32,839
and two monks with his legs and would support him in taking mindful steps

176
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:40,000
yeah even given the the compromised state of his body

177
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,480
so i'd watch him move uh to and from the deus around the

178
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:54,000
monastery through the streets of los angeles and i think about what he said

179
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:01,839
the kingdom of god is available to you in the here and now but the question is whether you are

180
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:07,839
available to the kingdom our practice is to make ourselves ready

181
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:14,880
for the kingdom so that it can manifest in the here and now you don't have to die in order to enter

182
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,960
the kingdom of heaven you have to be truly alive in order to

183
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,520
do so

184
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:33,280
so much kind of yeah wonder in that what what is the

185
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:38,319
kingdom of god i would hear that you know what

186
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:43,760
in his ecumenical style of kind of mixing language buddhist and

187
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,800
theistic language would enter the kingdom of god be available to the

188
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:55,040
kingdom of god and i had no idea what that meant

189
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:01,359
but the best instructions are the instructions that evoke

190
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:06,640
sincerity and curiosity and wonder

191
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:12,319
what is that how do i make my heart available to the

192
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:20,640
kingdom [Applause] he says no mud no lotus and

193
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:28,720
that is really a kind of poetic way of rendering the path of purification

194
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:34,720
no mud no lotus and

195
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:40,640
some of the metaphors around purification you know of uh kind of

196
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:46,400
military metaphors of like uh you know killing the kaleisas the

197
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:52,319
defilements the force of greed hatred delusion you know sometimes a really strong language

198
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:57,839
of uh um the force that we we

199
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:05,520
must use the energy and effort actually required to meet the depth of

200
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:13,119
the forces of suffering of mara but this is rendered much more gently no

201
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:19,680
mud no lotus and so of course there is mud there is

202
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:27,440
great suffering and that is the compost and the fertilizer

203
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:34,160
for our growing freedom and so in this way life

204
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:40,960
becomes or our teacher i said in the sit something like um

205
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:51,160
to be present is to be utterly undefended against imperfection

206
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:59,200
that is beckoning us into this path of purification

207
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,880
where anything everything is a kind of doorway

208
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:08,720
into a deeper presence

209
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:18,160
he emphasized the non-duality of wisdom and compassion often rendering that as

210
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:24,800
understanding and love and

211
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,920
sometimes it feels like we have wisdom over here and love over here and on the

212
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,280
wisdom side it's like every phenomena every arising is a

213
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:41,519
gateway to emptiness and

214
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,960
then on this side there's an image of like love

215
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:53,520
pervading all things you know boundless measureless

216
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:59,920
and we can be attracted to one side or the other but tiknahan

217
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:05,440
articulated the the non-duality of wisdom and love

218
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:12,240
and specifically he tied the notion of egoic identification

219
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:16,720
with deficits of love

220
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:23,760
the real power of the buddha he wrote was that he had so much love he saw

221
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:29,520
people trapped in their own notions of small separate self

222
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:34,880
feeling guilty or proud of that self and he offered revolutionary teachings that

223
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:40,720
resounded like a lion's roar helping people to wake up

224
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:46,240
to break free from the prison of ignorance

225
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:53,680
and indeed we do see that um

226
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:00,720
i think ego is a is a function of fear

227
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:06,200
and its hallmark is defensiveness

228
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:11,160
and its expression is clinging

229
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:19,280
and the more energy we actually divest from the egoic

230
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:27,920
not the more it flows into

231
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:31,760
wholesomeness into love

232
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,720
and so wisdom and love they're connected

233
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:47,599
this is again thai

234
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:53,040
if you pour a handful of salt into a cup of water the water becomes undrinkable

235
00:54:53,040 --> 00:55:00,640
but if you pour the salt into a river people can continue to draw the water to cook wash and drink

236
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:07,839
the river is immense and it has the capacity to receive embrace and transform

237
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:14,400
when our hearts are small our understanding and compassion are limited and we suffer

238
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:21,920
we can't accept or tolerate others and their shortcomings and we demand that they change

239
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:28,640
but when our hearts expand these same things don't make us suffer anymore we have a lot of understanding and

240
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:34,400
compassion and can embrace others we accept others as they are

241
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:39,640
and then they have a chance to transform

242
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:45,040
understanding someone's suffering is the best gift you can give another

243
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:51,920
person understanding is love's other name

244
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:56,960
if you don't understand you can't love

245
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,559
understanding is love's other name that is very

246
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,200
beautiful

247
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:18,000
and it speaks to this this um understanding that we develop this

248
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,599
insight we develop over the dharma life

249
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:29,280
that the more

250
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:36,559
deeply we look into conditionality the more reason we will have to love

251
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:42,160
the less tenable hatred becomes

252
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:49,760
yeah that that that hatred is never the last word it may be a first word it may be an

253
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:55,440
important first word but it is never the last word

254
00:56:56,799 --> 00:57:04,319
and so understanding understanding is love's other name

255
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:16,000
i've returned to his uh reflections on on anger often

256
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:22,720
and see it as a kind of yeah service that he he was

257
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:30,799
you know he was ordained quite young and was a you know monastic for his whole life

258
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:37,520
and yet he was doing what he could to try to speak to a lay life the life of

259
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,640
of of family and relationships and the the

260
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:48,079
the joys of that and the upper spiritual opportunity of that and the

261
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:54,400
tremendous suffering of it and so

262
00:57:54,400 --> 00:58:00,880
um on anger on anger the book i

263
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:07,280
um so it comes up in my own own reflections and

264
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:16,079
talks often is his counsel was not to suppress anger

265
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:23,838
not to vent he called venting anger rehearsing it yeah

266
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:32,319
and not to pretend you're not angry but to uh basically care for it as a one cares

267
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:38,559
for a child and so uh says just like our organs our anger

268
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:44,880
is part of us when we're angry we have to go back to ourselves and take good care of our anger

269
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:50,240
we cannot say go away anger i don't want you when you have a stomach ache you

270
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:57,040
don't say i don't want your stomach no you take care of it in the same way we have to embrace and

271
00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:01,280
take care good care of our

272
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:09,359
anger and so um he described this kind of approach to i

273
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:14,880
think what he called peace talks to actually expressing anger

274
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:21,520
neither neither suppressing it nor acting it out

275
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:30,480
and to talk about anger to confess one's anger without doing it in an aggressive

276
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:35,520
way is very vulnerable it's more vulnerable sometimes than to

277
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:41,040
say i am angry with you than to say i love you

278
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:48,880
and he articulated a yeah a kind of

279
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:55,200
just a few mantras gatas to like

280
00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:01,920
to support the conversation that they work like

281
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:07,680
in this kind of like they're diametrically opposed to the the kind of core

282
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:13,599
energy of anger which is to declare our invulnerability

283
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:19,680
our independence to declare our certainty

284
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:27,280
to be an island but the very truth that we are angry is a testament that we

285
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:32,160
can be hurt that we have been hurt

286
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:38,480
and so he invites us into the kind of courage of

287
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:45,359
meeting meeting this interpersonally

288
01:00:45,359 --> 01:00:53,200
and in the context of relationship he offers these these three

289
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:59,839
kind of statements and one doesn't even have to make these statements even just to

290
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:06,480
reflect on them is potent enough to do something to one's heart

291
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:12,480
and so i would go to the person you know i'm

292
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:17,599
angry with and um after having practiced and done my best

293
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:25,599
to you know to manage to take good care of the the child of anger you know

294
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:32,960
and um and then the the the the statements the confessions the pleas

295
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:40,400
are i am angry i suffer

296
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:50,359
i'm doing my best i need your help

297
01:01:52,400 --> 01:02:00,318
yeah i'm angry i suffer i'm doing my best i need your help

298
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:06,720
and i think what i find so so touching about that like okay

299
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:13,280
it is exactly what anger wishes to conceal

300
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,119
namely our dependence

301
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:25,920
and here we just come right out with it i need your help

302
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:39,680
tai highlighted um nonduality in a particular way that all

303
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:45,680
things inter are the order of inter being was his uh

304
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:53,119
um committed practitioners the order of inter being all things inter are

305
01:02:53,680 --> 01:03:01,240
and at first it sort of sounds like a kind of philosophical analysis of

306
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:07,599
interdependence that that um you know of dependent dependent

307
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:14,640
origination that this is because that is when this is not that is not

308
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:21,839
but it it feels like more than a philosophical reflection it is being

309
01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:27,200
invited into an in insight into uh

310
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:32,880
emptiness if you're a poet you will see that

311
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:38,160
there's a cloud floating in this sheet of paper without a cloud

312
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:44,640
there's no rain without rain no trees without trees cannot make paper

313
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:50,240
so we can say that the cloud and the paper enter are

314
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:57,200
looking even more deeply we can see we are in it too it's not so difficult to see because

315
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:03,920
when we look at this sheet of paper sheet of paper is part of our perception

316
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:09,200
your mind is in here and mine is also

317
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:14,880
so we can say everything is in here with this sheet of paper you cannot point out

318
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:21,280
one thing that is not here time space the earth the rain the

319
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:28,880
minerals in the soil the sunshine the cloud the river and the heat

320
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:36,280
this sheet of paper is because everything else is

321
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:46,079
if that's a sheet of paper what are you

322
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:55,559
yeah that can stop us in our tracks

323
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:08,599
this understanding provides a basis for um

324
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:14,559
for non-division for compassion

325
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:17,839
and

326
01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:26,720
and it points to

327
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:33,680
this suggestion no no birth no death

328
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:40,480
there's no coherent place to demarcate

329
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:45,920
a life a birth a death

330
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:53,200
we think of our body as ourself belonging to ourself but if you

331
01:05:53,200 --> 01:06:00,160
look deeply you see the body as the body of your ancestors of your parents of your children

332
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:06,240
their children so it's not me it's a not mine

333
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:12,079
your body is full of everything else limitless non-body elements

334
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:17,839
to die in our notion of death means that from something you suddenly become nothing

335
01:06:17,839 --> 01:06:24,079
from someone you become no one that is a horrible idea

336
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:29,200
that makes no sense if something has not been born will that

337
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:33,720
something have to die sometime

338
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:42,558
and this he said was the key to fearlessness fearlessness

339
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,280
it's often said ignorance is the kind of fundamental wellspring of suffering but

340
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:55,440
i often have the thought that it's

341
01:06:55,440 --> 01:07:00,559
fear that that this is even more foundational

342
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:03,680
than ignorance

343
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:10,640
and so fearlessness he said is the ultimate joy

344
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:15,798
fearlessness is the ultimate joy

345
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:29,119
and this understanding reframes how we construe death and endings

346
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:34,720
and so tai did not talk about reincarnation as a kind of

347
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:40,839
um the seed consciousness you know

348
01:07:40,839 --> 01:07:46,240
reanimating a new body or something like this no it's like the the

349
01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:52,480
sum total of our you know the

350
01:07:52,480 --> 01:08:00,720
lineage or our kind of lineage and the effects of our life on everything else

351
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:14,240
and so one last piece this begins

352
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:19,758
the talk begins with ty saying

353
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:25,040
she was 20 years old when i first met her

354
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:32,159
and it's kind of like record scratch kind of like wait

355
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:37,159
20 years old when i first met her

356
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:44,880
in indeed it is a love story and he describes being a um

357
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:52,600
a 24 year old monk celibate monk and falling in love with a nun

358
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:58,960
and said as a monk you're not supposed to fall in love but sometimes love is

359
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:06,000
stronger than your determination and so this is from a series of talks

360
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:11,440
given in 1992 he was 65 i believe

361
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:16,798
and called cultivating the mind of love

362
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:22,880
and um he's falling in love and she seems to

363
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:29,120
be falling in love too and uh he has a

364
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:34,960
sleepless night and tries to write

365
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:41,199
poetry but can't even get one sentence down you know he's trying

366
01:09:41,199 --> 01:09:48,719
to redirect the intensity of this kind of falling you know

367
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:54,960
and and he's up late at night and

368
01:09:54,960 --> 01:10:00,840
desperately wants to go to her room and indeed

369
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:06,159
she has a similar kind of longing

370
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:12,719
and he because of his vows his commitments and and the sense of like his vow to protect

371
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:17,840
her to protect her he does not go

372
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:24,400
and they decide together given their vows that they they must be away from

373
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:30,880
each other they have to be a part in different monasteries and so she's

374
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,600
about to move to somewhere else

375
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:44,320
he says i remember the moment we parted

376
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:53,920
we sat across from each other she too seemed overwhelmed by despair

377
01:10:54,159 --> 01:11:01,600
she stood up came close to me took my head in her arms

378
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:06,719
and drew me close to her in a very natural way

379
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:13,280
i allowed myself to be embraced it was the first and last time we had

380
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:18,800
any physical contact then we bowed

381
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,119
and separated

382
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:32,880
so what to do with that despair with that poignancy with that

383
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:39,158
longing what to do with it

384
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:48,960
no mud no lotus and through a kind of alchemical process

385
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:55,280
that is transformed maybe we call it sublimation maybe we call it

386
01:11:55,280 --> 01:12:01,840
purification but there's a way of actually

387
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:08,800
he's describing of redirecting his own narrow personal longing into

388
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:13,920
the channel of a greater love and pro-social

389
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:22,719
commitment and so he says over time my love for her

390
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:28,159
did not diminish but it was no longer confined to one

391
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:35,080
person i began to see her everywhere

392
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:46,320
so this is a sacrifice and a renunciation and

393
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:51,920
it's one that he made for her and for himself and for

394
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:58,080
us we are the inheritors of that gesture

395
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:05,000
we're the beneficiaries of that love

396
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:12,320
and so the question then is like what what will we do

397
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:16,119
with ty's love

398
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:26,440
let's just sit for a moment

399
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:51,960
