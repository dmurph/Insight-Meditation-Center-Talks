1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:07,240
all right so hello everyone nice to be with you

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:14,120
again for our meditation today I just want to comment in advance

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:20,000
about something you may have noticed in the mind which is that our minds are

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,840
very associative so you know a sense experience of some kind appears when

5
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:33,280
we're sitting that tends to be a sensation or a thought our eyes are closed or a

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,840
sound um and then the mind has all these associations that come along with that

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:45,600
it reminds us of something or it we react to some of the content or the if

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,879
there's an an experience that's Pleasant or unpleasant then the mind has something to say about that so it's like

9
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:59,359
we don't get just the experience we get all of our a cloud of things around it

10
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,720
right and often these clouds which are innocent enough that's how the mind

11
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:12,400
functions but often they have um hooks in them essentially so something happens

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,080
these other associations are are there in the mind and one of them is sticky in

13
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,119
some way and then we we get drawn into that and we're off on a thought Trail or

14
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:30,759
a reaction of some kind and it wasn't you know particularly anything wrong with the input or even with the

15
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,960
functioning of the mind but it's that we mistak essentially mistook the

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,399
association for the next moment instead of the next unfolding moment of reality

17
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:49,079
we go off onto a side branch and then several minutes later we realize oh

18
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:54,680
right I'm supposed to be meditating so the invitation is to

19
00:01:54,680 --> 00:02:00,320
observe this process in the mind and we'll get into that um as we do the

20
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,399
meditation together but understanding these hooks is a um an important part of

21
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,400
learning how to be with the mind and going through

22
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:20,200
life okay so let's settle in finding a comfortable position for

23
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,640
meditating it's fine if you're sitting or lying down or you could even be

24
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,920
standing or walking and just allow yourself to come

25
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:37,720
into the sense of being in meditation you can close your eyes if

26
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:44,920
that's comfortable for you and just allowing the attention to

27
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:53,159
settle down inward feeling the body in whatever

28
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:57,400
posture or position it's

29
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:07,640
in maybe taking a couple of long slow deep breaths breathing in breathing

30
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:14,480
out and on the out breath softening softening a little bit more

31
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:23,360
comfortably into the posture that you're in such that your body is soft relaxed

32
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:30,680
and also alert upright or straight in some way

33
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:37,200
that tends to bring in some energy and some dignity to what we're

34
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:46,200
doing perhaps taking a moment to connect explicitly with the body so

35
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:53,959
softening into the muscles of the face letting the expression

36
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,360
relax down into the shoulders

37
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,560
softening the

38
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:16,199
shoulders arms and hands down into the chest and belly

39
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:25,520
area really feeling the contact point if you're sitting the

40
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,680
seat letting yourself be supported by what you're sitting

41
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:39,400
on and then down into the legs and feet releasing any bracing that's

42
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,240
there and as always we can invite EAS in the body but not necessarily make it

43
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,360
relax so we just invite that ease through connecting

44
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,960
gently with this body

45
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,400
which just fine as it

46
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,800
is and then connecting into the the mind the

47
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:26,720
heart how are you sensing any mood that may be

48
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:31,639
present sensing the energy level

49
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:43,160
and again inviting some calm presence some ease in the

50
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,919
mind and knowing that at this moment there may be some

51
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:55,080
agitation and that's fine also we just be with that

52
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:09,160
becoming aware that the mind is for the moment mindful having a sense of what

53
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,490
mindfulness feels like for us in our mind at this

54
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:19,840
[Music] moment might feel Broad and

55
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:27,680
spacious might feel warm and connected it might feel like a cool

56
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,000
Observer might feel very

57
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,319
intimate how is mindfulness right

58
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:01,520
now and then in the middle of all of that experience

59
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:09,560
sensing just the simple flow of the breath in and out in the

60
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:18,759
body we don't need to narrow down onto the breath but just let it be kind of a

61
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:28,280
simple presence in the middle of experience a friendly presence

62
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:56,440
perhaps keeping the breath as a a background flow or pulse that we

63
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:04,319
feel just as a connection opening to the flow of

64
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:13,759
experience changing sounds my voice any sounds in the room or outside

65
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:21,159
that you can hear the Natural Body

66
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:26,440
Sensations that we will become aware of

67
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:36,760
and Associated thoughts or emotions that are flickering around in

68
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,880
the mind even when there isn't so much

69
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,800
input the mind is

70
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:59,519
generative a bird song reminds us that we need to add water to the bird bath

71
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:09,920
or a thought arising from something that happened

72
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:19,519
yesterday reminds us that we should call a friend today and then we think about our

73
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:33,640
friend is this a natural operation of the mind but in

74
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:39,640
meditation we want to stay with each experience as its own

75
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:45,519
thing each one like a flower instead of creating a bouquet out

76
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,279
of each one we go from one flower to the

77
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,440
next so it's a little bit different process than the Mind normal

78
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,959
operates

79
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:13,240
under in one way that we get switched in from just being with the

80
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,399
flow to following a thought Trail is

81
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,800
that there's a hook on the experience one of those associations is

82
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:32,640
not just an association that could be noticed but it has has some juice to

83
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:41,040
it and then we decide that's more interesting there's a desire there or a

84
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,279
belief some sense that that's the way to [Music]

85
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:56,880
go one thing we can become aware of is the hook it's actually a a visceral

86
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,680
Sense on an experience a

87
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:09,000
little bright spot or sticky spot or sharp

88
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:17,480
spot see how you experience it so being with the flow a bit

89
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:26,720
and when the mind gets hooked looking back for the hook

90
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:35,359
before resuming staying with the [Music]

91
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
flow

92
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

93
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

94
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

95
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

96
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,079
e e

97
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:26,000
so one way that we work with the mind's associative tendency to wander

98
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:34,680
off is to keep the attention on a single object and just decide to do it that way

99
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,639
and it works well another way is

100
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:48,480
to allow some of those associations be able to see them maybe

101
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:55,360
as little flickers to the side appearing but to not follow them and to

102
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,759
stay with the flow of what is most promis in the

103
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:12,160
moment it can be that experiences start to look like they have streamers

104
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:18,360
trailing from them associations that we could

105
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,959
follow but we don't it's interesting to see the

106
00:16:25,959 --> 00:16:31,959
streamers are trailing off of each thing that

107
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,959
comes sometimes it's helpful to imagine that we have a mindfulness eraser that

108
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:48,440
erases those streamers so we just have the bare object or a sword that cuts through them

109
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:56,600
freeing experience to flow without these trails

110
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:07,000
see if this resonates in the flow of your experience learning to navigate our boat

111
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,038
through the water without it getting caught in the

112
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:18,390
kelp and the reads and the other things that could drag the boat

113
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,479
[Music]

114
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840

115

e e

122
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:50,400
letting experience be released from our

123
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:59,360
minds books [Music] associations Embellishments

124
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:07,360
so that experience just unfolds no wind

125
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:14,960
drag no seaweed holding it back

126
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,799
just flowing

127
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,440
frictionless soone for the

128
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440

e e

135
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:48,559
as we get a sense of how to unhook or not bite the hooks that

136
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:57,039
come with experience in meditation we may find ways to carry

137
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:05,559
that into our daily life also such that we can flow more flexibly

138
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:10,720
more freely with experience as it

139
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:17,679
unfolds we're less likely to have our habitual emotional responses to things

140
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:24,799
or our habitual closing down in certain

141
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:31,799
situations that was just a hook in the mind and we may find ourselves seeing that

142
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:38,799
possibility but not taking it noticing that we have other

143
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:49,440
options and this brings a lot of benefits not only to us but to others

144
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:58,960
that we're interacting with we can see people more freshly we can find alternative ways of

145
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:06,640
relating then the habitual paths we flow down lined with

146
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:15,120
hooks and other people can feel more free in our presence because our mind is

147
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:23,519
more open more gentle less caught and that can Ripple out in many

148
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:27,120
beautiful ways

149
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:35,120
so may it be that we see some see more freshly today especially the people

150
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:42,880
around us even someone you've known for many decades could you see something fresh in

151
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:51,440
them today not just the usual way of seeing or

152
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:58,760
relating seeing what opens up to the mind when we don't take the

153
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,720
easy route of traveling from Hook to

154
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,440
hook and may it be that our world can

155
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:19,200
find some measure of unhooking from

156
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:27,159
habitual ideas ideals ways of relating and when that begins with us

157
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:34,480
there is some Poss ability so may all beings find happiness

158
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,279
peace free flow and an

159
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:46,600
opportunity to live without hooks

160
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:51,219
[Music]

161
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:57,988
[Music]

162
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:31,399
so as human beings we live in a world that is Rich with sense

163
00:30:31,399 --> 00:30:38,519
experience the Buddha even defined the world as simply the six sense spaces and

164
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:44,919
their objects the sixth one being the Mind along with seeing hearing smelling

165
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:53,679
tasting and touch this is it this is our world and it's a very relevant spiritual

166
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:59,919
question what to do with the sense world uh I think it's fair to say that

167
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:05,080
Buddhism claims that it is our mismanagement of the sense world that

168
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:11,760
brings stress and suffering and that it is possible to learn to handle it well

169
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:17,840
even to the point of having no suffering no Dua while still having a body and and

170
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,360
all the sense experiences so today we get to the final

171
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:30,039
hindrance in our list which is classically the first hindrance and that is is sensual

172
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:37,399
desire so as sensual beings we need to be careful how we understand

173
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:43,000
this because we are by definition immersed in the sense world it's

174
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:49,320
actually not easy to understand clearly a term like sensual desire especially

175
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:55,919
when we're told it's a hindrance so in our framing this week we're exploring

176
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,240
how the five hindrances are UNH wholesome or unhealthy responses to

177
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:07,960
experience and we're learning how to relate to the hindrances skillfully such that we can discover the

178
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:13,200
wholesomeness that gets uncovered when we're not under the sway of the

179
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,360
hindrance so to explore sensual desire I'd like to bring in the story of the

180
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:25,519
Buddha in his quest for awakening so he had the natural wish for happiness that

181
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:32,120
we all have that's a very nor noral thing for the human heart but he had to

182
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:38,480
go through a long process of learning to relate to the sense world skillfully

183
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,799
that was his quest in a way and we can learn a lot from his

184
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:50,519
path so the Buddha started out by relating to sense experience essentially

185
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:56,159
with greed he was wealthy enough to have access to many Pleasures he was

186
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:03,600
protected by his parents from the difficulties of Aging illness death he actually lived in the way that

187
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,600
most of us do by default he enjoyed sensual experience as an end in and of

188
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:18,840
itself and then he pursued additional Pleasant experiences so there could be as unbroken as possible of a string of

189
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:24,519
pleasantness and this is kind of our default strategy for happiness we have to

190
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:30,919
admit um but the Buddha found this to be spiritually

191
00:33:30,919 --> 00:33:36,440
unsatisfying and that was important that was a turning point for him um and so he

192
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:44,159
started out his spiritual Quest by going and learning these very refined formless

193
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:51,440
meditation states that are very lofty and the body disappears um it's kind of like I'm

194
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:58,120
going to claim this is like relating to sense experience with delusion so he started out with greed then he went into

195
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:03,720
delusion he thought he could transcend the sense World by seeking loftier and

196
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:12,118
more spiritual forms of pleasure and happiness so he's still looking for happiness but he deluded tried to escape

197
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:20,040
the limits of sensual Happiness by going into higher mental Realms and we have to admit that this

198
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:27,320
works for a while but in the end it is also unsatisfying because even the loftiest

199
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:32,560
pleasure are still impermanent um they don't offer a final

200
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:40,878
solution if you will so in the next stage of the Buddhist practice he related to sense

201
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:45,960
experience with aversion he became an extreme aesthetic trying to crush his

202
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:53,320
wish for happiness through austerity practices he said all right if all happiness is fleeing in temporary I'm

203
00:34:53,320 --> 00:35:00,280
going to find a way not to want it I'm going to punish my body deliberately seeking out painful

204
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:09,480
experiences he became a connoisseur of pain if you will but alas this too did not free his

205
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:18,280
mind so he was stuck greed delusion and hatred had all failed um and then he remembered a time

206
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:25,079
from his childhood when he was relaxed and happy his mind naturally entered a

207
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:32,320
state of unification his sense experience in the body was fully present and his mind was

208
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:38,960
in a beautiful state of contentment Clarity Tranquility

209
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:46,000
Vitality it was beautiful and you know this is not the goal in and of itself because we can't

210
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,119
always have conditions like that but the Buddha did see in his memory of this

211
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:58,200
that that this is the path the path somehow involves cultivating this

212
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:04,599
tranquil clear presence that harmonizes the experience of the moment and then he

213
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:10,160
needed to develop and refine that a lot more but that was a really important

214
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,960
insight and the point here is that he had found within the sense World a

215
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:22,040
wholesome thread that he could follow and it actually involves pleasure um so

216
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:28,200
it's a path to happiness he could make a path out of this very experience

217
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:34,839
and then that's what he taught us to do so now I think with that as

218
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:43,680
background we're prepared to talk about sensual desire as a hindrance so sensual desire is a way of

219
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,200
missing the path in this moment because we mistake the pleasure of some sense

220
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:55,480
object or the Deep spiritual happiness that we're actually seeking so zeroing

221
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:04,319
in and fixating on an object of pleasure covers over the open ease of the path

222
00:37:04,319 --> 00:37:12,200
that we could otherwise find it's a major turning point in spiritual life when we realize that the

223
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:19,040
happiness available from sensual Pleasures is limited and that there is a pathway

224
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:25,920
forward that neither settles for that limited happiness nor tries to deny

225
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:34,520
happiness and pleasure Buddha called that the middle way Joseph Goldstein tells a story about

226
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,720
how on a retreat he was reflecting on the Buddha's freedom from greed hatred

227
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:44,920
and delusion and you know he was having this inspirational reflection and

228
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:50,319
suddenly his mind switched over to thinking about his favorite comfy

229
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:58,440
meditation sweatshirt and how he'd like to have several of them in different colors so his mind had been open to this

230
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:06,400
great spiritual inspiration and aspiration and then it literally collapsed onto a

231
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,680
sweatshirt and I would suspect that we all have similarly humbling experiences

232
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:20,880
in our mind right things that we've suddenly gotten distracted by so the point with this though is to

233
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:28,400
start feeling into how um when we buy into sense Des

234
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,839
it Narrows our experience such that we don't really see the whole scope of it

235
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:40,000
we start seeing partially um there are the physical feelings can be feelings of Leaning

236
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,040
forward or tumbling forward um grasping there's a there's a contraction

237
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:51,920
associated with sense desire it might feel kind of pleasant you know like oh I

238
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,640
want that it would be great if I could get that um or it would be great if I could hold on to this it's so wonderful

239
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:04,440
what I have but there is a feeling of um

240
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:10,440
collapse in that somehow um and it's important to perceive that as unhealthy

241
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:17,200
I might call it unho because we've lost the whole for this one part that we

242
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:24,920
like the Buddha liken sensual desire to being in debt so we enslave ourselves to

243
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:30,800
the Future by wanting to get something or wanting to keep something and then we

244
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:37,839
have to put out energy to service that desire like we service a loan or debt

245
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:43,160
that we've taken out so if we're mindful of Desire we can

246
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:49,800
feel the weight that it places on us it's also important I think to say

247
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:55,599
and clearly in talks like this that there is no fault in enjoying some

248
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:02,839
pleasant experience that has come to us and there's also no problem with choosing things that we like or enjoy

249
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:08,280
when we have a choice if you're going to the store because you need a meditation

250
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:15,079
sweatshirt get the comfy one you know but know that it can't provide lasting

251
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:20,680
happiness for you and also watch your mind to see the way it Narrows when it

252
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:26,680
moves toward something that it finds desirable actually just a few days ago I

253
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:32,920
was um I was out walking and I passed by one of those little kiosks that offers free

254
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:41,440
books that someone has set up it's like a book exchange and I took a look because I like books and my eyes were

255
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:46,560
drawn uh to a poetry book so first I had been looking at the whole street while I

256
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:54,160
was walking and then my vision narrowed down to the kiosk and then to the book and this is not necessarily bad but it

257
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:00,440
is interesting to watch and I I read a few the poems and I thought hey these

258
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:06,319
might be good for Dhat talks wholesome right so I started to take the book with

259
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:13,720
me and then I realized no this is just desire actually I I don't actually need

260
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:20,960
this book and I felt how taking the book would add one more piece of stuff to my

261
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,720
life one more thing to have and in that moment it felt burdensome so I made the

262
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:33,920
decision um not to take it so that's not to say that there wouldn't be a time when

263
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:39,480
taking the book would be fine that might might happen at a different time that

264
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:44,560
has to be something that's discerned in the Moment by you when it's your

265
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:51,359
experience so notice in a given moment is there a burdensome feeling to this

266
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:58,560
object that I'm zeroing in if yes probably there's you know there's a hindrance there that just

267
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:05,480
desire so sensual desire is one of the trickiest hindrances because we're continually

268
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,800
engaged with the sense world and we need to fulfill our basic bodily needs like

269
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:17,319
food shelter Etc and our social needs for community and relationships and

270
00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:24,960
support and yet we have to do so in a way that remains free from expecting

271
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:33,119
limited things to supply deep and Lasting happiness so the Buddhist texts say that

272
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,720
ill will is more blameable but easier to

273
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:45,119
remove and sensual desire is less blameable but harder to

274
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:52,240
remove so that's what we're up against in a sense but we start to overcome UNH

275
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:57,520
wholesome Desire by learning to see it learning to feel its weight its

276
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,800
stickiness its burden and then we have a chance of noticing what what gets

277
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:09,319
uncovered we have a chance of noticing the place where the path opens in this

278
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:15,960
moment the path is a kind of ease that doesn't Depend On Any Given sense of

279
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:24,040
pleasure being there and a good way to sense that path is to cultivate a calm

280
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:29,359
awareness within this Rich sense world that we find ourselves in if we

281
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:34,480
cultivate this tranquil knowing of what is arising whether Pleasant or

282
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:41,040
unpleasant we can find that that thread of ease that wholesomeness that the

283
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,680
Buddha found that's what the Buddha did in his own practice and we can do it

284
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:53,839
too so the sense world is not our enemy but neither is

285
00:43:53,839 --> 00:44:01,119
it our Salvation in instead there's a little thread that runs through it called the

286
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:07,680
path that we can find that consists of an ease that is unhooked from all the

287
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:13,000
things that are coming in and all the associations our mind

288
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:20,280
makes so I'll end by mentioning that I'll be here again for all of next week

289
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:28,319
U we spent this week looking at the hindrances which are UNH wholesome and that's very important um to tune into

290
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:36,839
those so that we can uncover what's possible when we're not hooked in them another aspect of practice is to

291
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:43,280
deeply recognize and be inspired by things that are wholesome so that's what

292
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:49,040
we'll focus on next week now classically the wholesome qualities that stand in

293
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:56,599
contrast to the hindrances are the seven factors of Awakening but I thought we'd look at a

294
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:03,440
different list of wholesome qualities that is taught less often in our scene

295
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:10,160
and that is a list of qualities of the mind of the Buddha so we talked today

296
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:17,000
about the Buddha's quest to understand how to live freely in this human life

297
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,040
what was his mind like what is a mind like that can do that so if you're

298
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:29,440
interested in that um please come next week and we'll explore that together so

299
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,000
thank you very much
