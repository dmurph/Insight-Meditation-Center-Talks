1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:07,279
so so hello hello and welcome again to happy hour

2
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,160
wonderful to be with you and practicing together

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:21,289
so so for today's practice um [Music]

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:28,240
there are two themes i like to bring in and invite us to work with one is that it's friday it's kind of the end of the

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:34,719
week and also for some it's saturday those joining from uh from different time zones i

6
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,480
acknowledge that but it's kind of the end of the week perhaps so this way of um

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,000
bringing in some silence some quiet some rest some

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,600
some nourishment and that theme together with another theme that actually they can really go

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:59,680
together and that is um the theme that i've been sitting with and

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:07,680
exploring because um some of you know and actually you signed up i'm teaching a course

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,760
starting in less than two weeks called befriending mortality befriending

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,320
mortality um and actually i might as well tell you where that is

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:27,360
for those who might be curiosity might be peaked it's um could be fined on insight

14
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,640
inside as an insight meditation in sight practice so it's

15
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:43,280
insight.podiapodia.com and there's all kinds of information there about it anyway so insight that podia is sorry

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,399
the the um i meant to say is the befriending mortality so so befriending mortality

17
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:57,439
this perspective of of the arc of our life the arc of our life looking and this is

18
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,439
a theme we worked with um last week also which is a world

19
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:08,640
meta from this perspective from this perspective of looking at their our

20
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,680
lives for this being who is us

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,879
this being who has done their best um

22
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:26,720
hopefully with no regrets at that point maybe there are some but but the sense of meta the sense of

23
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,560
love the sense of acceptance of all there is goodness challenges

24
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:40,720
of regrets difficulty just the sense of complete acceptance and love as if

25
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:48,080
our inner buddha our inner compassion itself is getting supercharged and really is

26
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,400
taking on we're taking on that perspective of looking at our lives

27
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,599
with with sense of freedom sense of peace sense of

28
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,440
letting go and sense of ultimate love complete love and acceptance for

29
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,720
ourselves for all the mistakes we made for all the shortcomings all the quirks

30
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,959
we had and all the goodness also all the goodness we brought as well as all the

31
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,000
interactions all the interactions

32
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,879
all the interactions so um

33
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,200
so [Music] that is the theme that is the theme for

34
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,360
our um [Music] practice tonight and

35
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,840
you think about if there is more i want to say about it

36
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,319
um yeah i see there is a question about the course coming i'll answer that later

37
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:57,439
uh marianne i see that coming through but in terms of our practice in this moment

38
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:04,480
to stay with to stay with to stay with the sense of meta this perspective

39
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:11,599

40
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,840

43
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:37,040
if sadness grief arises if joy arises if freedom arises

44
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,479
whatever rises trust that that's the right thing that needs to arise right now

45
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:50,639
as long as you hold it with compassion as long as you hold it with love it's okay it's okay it's okay as long as

46
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,960
you don't push it away as a mistake as long as you love it you may not like it

47
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:04,240
but as long as you love it you're doing the practice perfectly right there's no wrong here there's no

with love with care sometimes crawled with sadness

124
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:06,080
with pain sometimes was alone and lonely

125
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:12,400
sometimes was connected interconnected with loved ones friends

126
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:20,159

i as much forgiveness as possible they did their best if they could have

131
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:24,039
done better given all the causes and conditions they would

132
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:24,480
can we just open up to love

133
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,960
from the perspective

134
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,600
of a compassionate compassionate inner buddha

135
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,080
in your divinity just love just held in

136
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:09,279
love and if there are areas in life that perhaps call for

137
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:18,120
more love more care more forgiveness see what's needed right now

138
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,400
both for yourself and other beings you are entangled with

139
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,840
you can also just choose the time of this being who is you

140
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,240
had a vulnerable time it's a challenging time to just love i

141
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,960
just love this being

142
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:12,400
and recognize the courage the goodness

143
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,039
of having hung in there

144
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:25,320

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:05,119
may all beings including ourselves know how precious and limited our time

170
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:11,440
our precious human birth is and may we use it wild wisely and

171
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,440
compassionately

172
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:43,440
thank you thank you dear sangha for your practice

173
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:52,240
for showing up mark i see your hand shut up please

174
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,839
many times i'm completely out of sync with what you're talking about

175
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:07,440
and sometimes like tonight i'm totally in sync with it

176
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:14,960
early this week i was watching a tv program and there was a song

177
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:21,200
playing in the background for just a couple minutes about a little girl in her

178
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:27,839
made up little world with a little house where she fed her guests bark and leaves

179
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:34,320
and went on and i was intrigued and so i looked up the song afterwards

180
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:40,480
and i found it on youtube and i played about half a dozen

181
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:47,280
versions of it and um went to bed and i woke up the next

182
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:54,800
morning this is a few days ago just feeling that i had lived

183
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:03,119
i was satisfied with my life i had done all that that i needed to do i was ready i died

184
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:10,400
this afternoon that was absolutely fine there was no problem i

185
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:17,040
you know i certainly had made loads of mistakes and it all wasn't

186
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,040
perfect perfection but it was i was happy with his life

187
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,240
and it was enough i was satisfied and i was ready

188
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,400
to go and um in case anyone else

189
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:42,889

196
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,839
thank you nikki um i raised my hand because this is such a beautiful coincidence i was on the

197
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:31,839
phone about two hours ago with a friend who had had a serious accent we were

198
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:38,160
talking about her medical needs and so forth and then somehow we got on to the subject of death

199
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,280
and you know if she had how seriously she had injured herself

200
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,200
uh and the thing that i she and you know so this was you know just to follow on to that

201
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,320
conversation but what i shared with her at the time is that i have had a near-death

202
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,680
experience um and it was it was really uh

203
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:07,280
it changed me forever in terms of the way i live my life the way i see myself

204
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:13,680
and the gratitude i feel for having had the life that i've had

205
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:18,880
you know i as i lay on the stretcher i thought you know it doesn't really matter now i'm

206
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,720
i i has the previous speaker just said i haven't done everything i wanted to do i haven't

207
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:31,680
done it all very well but i've had a chance and i've tried hard uh and i will you know always be

208
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:37,760
grateful and i'm no longer afraid of death because i was able to look at it and say

209
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,839
it's okay whatever happens is just fine um with me

210
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:49,119
and so there you go thank you claire thank

211
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:56,079
you also for sharing your sense of ease and freedom with the inevitable it's just

212
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:03,440
part of life death and and also the um the profound shift that your near-death

213
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:09,040
experience has had in fact i was looking at um some studies on it's called

214
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:15,280
post-traumatic growth and and um one thing that

215
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:20,480
happens after some such traumatic experiences um

216
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,720
the post-traumatic growth is one's um priorities shift the way one shows up

217
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,839
once actually lives more fully and more completely and yeah there's a lot of

218
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:37,440
research on post-traumatic growth so thank you claire for sharing your insights your

219
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,440
experience life really firsthand yeah thank you

220
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,720
yeah any other reflections you can share oh yes and now i can come back um so you

221
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:57,040
can share your reflections if they're privately sent to me i won't see you read your name if they're to everyone

222
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:04,000
i'll read your reflections and your name and uh and there was a question about the

223
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,680
course that i had mentioned [Music] befriending mortality and one person had

224
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:15,599
asked but they have too many conflicts and work conflicts on wednesdays for the

225
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:22,000
four wednesdays or in their courses starting january 26th

226
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,880
whether it's possible appropriate to sign up and listen to the sessions after they're recorded that is okay we're

227
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,160
allowing that option because it's not just listening to the recordings but

228
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:41,119
they're also homeworks and the reflections and the participation in that way with the sangha online

229
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:47,119
through writings and reflections and sharing that you're more than welcome to participate

230
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:54,480
and even if it's not possible to be in all of the live sessions in real time

231
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:02,960
jerry says sometimes ego gets in the way of accepting death and then one gets lost absolutely of course that is so

232
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:09,040
natural and and normal of course it is if it wasn't if it were easy it wouldn't be a

233
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:15,200
practice it would just it would be perfect we would just have it all we would all have it whereas there was so

234
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,880
much about ego it's so hard for the ego to contemplate its own demise

235
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,240
hence terror management theory and psychology anyway there's so much i can say about

236
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:31,440
this but i'll save all of that for the course anyway the other reflections from the their

237
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:36,720
meditation tonight before we turn to small groups any that you like to share

238

to uh practicing in small groups in

249
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:50,319
in size of roughly three and um and the invitation is to start

250
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:58,240
with about 15 seconds of silence and then here we are these beautiful amazing impermanent

251
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:03,680
beings and whatever you like to share to support

252
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:11,520
others practice your own practice as little or as much as you'd like to share you are welcome so

253
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:17,040
be kind to yourself be kind to each other this is where the practice really

254
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:24,400
the rubber meets the road in these small groups so so okay so i'm going to open the rooms

255
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:29,839
and here we go take care of yourselves take care of each other

256
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:36,240
okay welcome back everyone the rooms are closed so and we have a

257
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:42,480
couple minutes for any reflections that might have come up from the practice from speaking with

258
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,160
each other that can be of benefit uh to yourself to be held witness or for

259
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:54,800
the sangha any questions confusions um aha moments it's all good

260
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:01,760
so this is your sangha what would be helpful to bring up to share

261
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,240
very close

262
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:17,920
greg please i was just sharing with the other folks

263
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:25,520
that um i had the curious experience of finding myself in an er

264
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:31,520
and being a young black trying to sort of get up

265
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:37,520
and then being told by the attending physicians that they may not be able to save me

266
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:44,319
um as in don't move don't be a don't be a young buck we don't know if you're going to survive

267
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:49,839
so don't try and make any movement at all and it was just curious how

268
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:57,200
absolutely sort of average no trumpets were playing no angels descended there was just this sort of

269
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:05,359
averageness of this existence and i have to say it inspired a real curiosity about

270
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:11,760
whether that was like a normal an average or a desirable reaction to

271
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:17,599
the core existential challenge to me as a little old person

272
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:23,520
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah thank you thanks for bringing that

273
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:30,880
up and i so appreciate how you are sitting with that not taking it as good or bad but as oh

274
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,960
interesting this is one experience that showed up out of so many different experiences that could have possibly

275
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:42,400
showed up in that moment well this is the one that showed up and i'm curious oh what how

276
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,160
feeling into that what does that feel like what does that say what is just exploring it a little more and and being

277
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:53,520
curious for it to continue perhaps to continue to open up thank you greg

278
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:59,279
yeah and rachel i see your hand please

279
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,560
hi nikki it's good to see you too i was in your marana sati retreat a

280
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,760
few years ago um and i just signed up for your course also

281
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,760
so i'm looking forward to that um i i'm not sure if it's a question or

282
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:23,440
just an observation but do you know how there's this concept of

283
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,960
worse almost practicing for our death in a sense right where we're working with

284
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:35,440
being comfortable in the moment and and being able to tolerate you know uncertainty and all of that

285
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:41,359
and lately i've been i've been doing a lot of meta practice a lot

286
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:49,040
and a lot towards myself and others and i've been thinking backwards in time and i don't

287
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:55,200
know if there's a is there sort of a parallel teaching in buddhism that we're not just practicing

288
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:01,440
for our death but we can actually send meta back to our younger selves because that's what i've started doing

289
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,800
and it seems like it's really helping yeah yeah yeah beautiful that's that's

290
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:13,359
great keep doing that it's what what what lights me up is when i hear that ah

291
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:18,720
i'm doing that and it's helping it's helping like wow this is working this is

292
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:24,559
helping so yes trust even even before i turn into the buddhist

293
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:30,160
you know the buddha said on his deathbed which again talking about death and your clear

294
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:37,040
important message be a light unto yourself be a light unto yourself and what i'm hearing rachel

295
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:42,960
is that when you're light unto yourself like yes this is working this is helping this is

296
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:48,400
opening something up for my humanity for my being the way i'm loving and showing up

297
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:55,280
so absolutely yes keep this is beautiful please keep practicing in this way

298
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:00,400
and yes i can you know talk about you know practices etc etc so i think i'll

299
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:06,880
just leave it at that so yes keep doing this is great all right thanks so much for sharing that lovely

300
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:12,640
yeah and we close with this last um reflection in

301
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:18,640
chat from uh soy min i was thinking about the experience of moments

302
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:25,520
uh fear i've had the habit of being kind to others and ourselves i feel it would

303
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:31,839
help in being kind and calming ourselves in those moments yes absolutely very

304
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:37,760
much so the meta is an antidote to fear especially in those moments of

305
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:43,280
of challenge being afraid and being kind to ourselves and others yeah another

306
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:48,800
beautiful insight so thank you all thank you for showing up

307
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:54,160
thank you for your practice thank you thank you thank you deep bowels to each
