1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,959
good evening welcome welcome

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,719
nice to see you all

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,240
maybe before i turn on the recording i'll just make a note there was

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,240
for those people that are on youtube there's a little bit of technical difficulty but that just

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,359
i know somehow when i was sitting it was kind of funny it just popped in my mind oh

6
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:35,920
this is probably what the problem is so if you saw me kind of get off here and

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,200
go play with something like what is she doing just

8
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,718
fixing that so okay

9
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,640
so again i'll say a really warm welcome to everybody

10
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:01,359
so nice to practice together makes it makes a difference

11
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:12,040
so a few weeks ago i gave a talk um about some of these poems that were inspiring

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,240
and i wanted to build on one of the poems there that um i don't know for some

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,680
reason really touches me and i kind of wanted to flush it out a little bit

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,400
and bring in some other teachings around it

15
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,720
so i'll start with this poem it's by maddie weingast

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,280
who is somebody who was inspired by some of the poems in the early literature

17
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,000
and then wrote his own poems so it goes like this

18
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,079
while walking along the river after a long day meditating on vulture

19
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:03,600
peak i watched an elephant splashing its way out of the water and

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,000
up the bank hello my friend

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,040
a person waiting there said scratching the elephant behind its ear

22
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,920
did you have a good bath the elephant stretched out its leg

23
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,120
the person climbed up and the two rode off like that

24
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,760
together seeing what had once been so

25
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,440
wild now a friend and companion to this good

26
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,840
person i took a seat under the nearest tree

27
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,959
and reached out a gentle hand to my own mind

28
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,360
truly i thought this is why i came to the woods

29
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:10,080
i like this poem it's very evocative this idea of this elephant and this person scratching behind the ears hello

30
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:17,040
did you have a good bath i know it seems like very sweet and you know certain intimacy there too

31
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,040
and then how to seeing this this perhaps i don't know how commonplace it was in

32
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,239
ancient india but maybe not extraordinary

33
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:37,680
this little just this you know mundane event inspires somebody

34
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,040
and partly why it inspires this person is because there's this line

35
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:49,040
um seeing what had once been so wild

36
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,959
so the meditator right had this idea that in this case it's a woman the meditator

37
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,640
that her mind used to be so wild isn't this true right when we start

38
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,920
meditating it it seems like it's this wild thing

39
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,000
a little bit out of control but then this uh this this shift in this

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:21,600
relationship in the poem the person has befriended the elephant and now the meditator realizes oh yeah

41
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,199
befriending the mind is the practice

42
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,240
rather than somehow thinking that we have to get rid of the thoughts we have to

43
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,919
make the mind be completely different we have to be completely different

44
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,440
instead just this idea of befriending the experience

45
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,720
reaching out a hand it's kind of just this gesture

46
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,280
so it says maybe this uh person has now kind of like is maybe a little bit more maturity and practice i think this i

47
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,479
suspect it's universal that when you first start meditating you're like oh my goodness i

48
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,600
had no idea my mind was like that but then our relationship we start to be

49
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,880
more accepting more allowing more relaxing and just allowing things to

50
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,919
unfold so

51
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,960
at the time of the buddha there were questions about

52
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,600
training just in the same way that maybe there are some ideas like okay

53
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:35,360
well how did this elephant get from this wild elephant to something that

54
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,960
steps out its leg and allows the person to climb on board like how does that happen this process

55
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:50,000
so there's a suta that's from mogallana the accountant

56
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,440
ganaka mogalana he's talking to the buddha

57
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,720
in the palace of megara's mother i'll just

58
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,520
because i'm a woman i'll make this tiny little statement right this is not so common

59
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:15,280
that some a place is named after a woman but this is megara's mother's palace

60
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,880
another suit as we learn her name but so this

61
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,840
woman who was a donor donated this palace i'm sorry mogallana the accountant is

62
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,720
talking to the buddha so he's not a monk

63
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,330
and he asks there's they're standing there in the midst of this um

64
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,840
[Music] palace which was donated to the buddha and some of his other monastics would be

65
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,759
there and they were practicing together and i can imagine that it was recently

66
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:56,960
completed in its construction because mogallana asks

67
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:03,520
do his followers do the buddha's followers have this progressive training do they

68
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,880
have training just like other people do just like other professions do

69
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,520
we can imagine that at that time they were the kind of the question was like are you magical can you just zap people

70
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:23,680
when they become awakened or do people have to work at it

71
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:30,560
because mogallana he's when he asks the question he also is drawing from his present moment experience exactly what

72
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:38,080
he is seeing right then and he asks them

73
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:45,759
this is a quote from the suta now master gotama that's how the buddha is

74
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,680
addressed by somebody who is not a follower master gautama in this palace of

75
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,280
megara's mother we can see gradual or progressive

76
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:03,440
gradual progress down to the last step of this staircase highlighting that when you're making a

77
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,879
staircase you make them one step at a time right you can't like start at the top and have the bottom right you have

78
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:15,280
to just do them sequentially so they're standing in this palace he points to you notice how there's these

79
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,879
uh steps is your training like that

80
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,240
and then he goes uh on and he says among the brahmana priests we can see

81
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,000
gradual progress in learning the scriptures among archers we see gradual progress in

82
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,039
archery among us accountants we see gradual progress in mathematics

83
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:48,160
for when we get an apprentice we first make them count one one two twos three threes

84
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:54,000
all the way up to a hundred we make them count is it possible to similarly describe a

85
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,120
gradual training for you and your what you're teaching

86
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:07,440
so ganaka mogalona is just recognizes that there's a natural way in which people learn

87
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:14,720
and that there's a way in which there's also uh different people in

88
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,320
different professions also have the results of their efforts right

89
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,600
they the people who are counting they can become accountants the

90
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,080
people who are practicing archery can become archers the brahmana priests become priests

91
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,440
during their training so in my mind mogalona is also looking

92
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,760
around and saying okay well there's all these people sitting but

93
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,360
do they get anything is there any purpose of this

94
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,440
so mogallana asks is it possible to describe a gradual training gradual

95
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,720
progress and gradual practice in your teachings

96
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:11,120
and the buddha says yes it is possible and then he gives a little simile

97
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:19,120
suppose a horse trainer were to obtain a fine thoroughbred horse

98
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,480
first the trainer would make it get used to wearing the bit

99
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:31,600
i don't know anything about horses so i'm just assuming that this is what uh happened

100
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,680
and then they would train it further so in the same way when the tattogata

101
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,720
when the buddha gets a person for training so that is

102
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,279
when somebody ordains underneath him first he guides him in one way and when

103
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,440
they have learned that he guides them further

104
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,760
so first one way and then further

105
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:07,279
maybe in some ways it feels really obvious to us but maybe in some ways when we think

106
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:12,399
about our practice it sometimes just feels like a mumbo jum or a whole jumble

107
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,920
of things i know certainly from me in the beginning it did partly because i would go to dharma

108
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,839
talks and then the dharma talks you know that not always started you know start here's

109
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,920
the the first dharma talk you hear isn't where you should start and then the sex second dermatogen the second one you

110
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:39,040
start right it takes took me quite a while to figure it out that oh there's a progressive practice here

111
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,120
and it wasn't until actually you know i heard gil give a talk about a suta that i realized oh

112
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,200
that's like this happens before that and this and something like this so

113
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,639
so you can imagine that maybe this person moghalana sees these people sitting around

114
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:03,519
he knows how he was trained and he's heard some things and maybe he's a little bit confused

115
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,519
so the buddha does give him this progressive this gradual training

116
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:16,320
i'm going to talk a little bit about that but before i do i also want to say because mokelana he

117
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,360
asks this other question so

118
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:29,120
when your followers are instructed and advised like this by you the buddha

119
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,800
do all of them achieve the ultimate goal nabana

120
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:41,600
or do some of them not like what good are instructions if nobody can follow them or achieve with

121
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:47,760
your want to i think this is a great question

122
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:55,120
it's a legitimate question it's a fair question and then the buddha responds well

123
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,959
some accomplish the ultimate goal nibbana while others do not

124
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:07,600
and then he asks the next i think a great question why

125
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,319
why do some reach it and some don't

126
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,120
and then the buddha responds and includes a simile in his response

127
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,519
he says well mogulana suppose a person were to come along who

128
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:31,120
wanted to go to raja gaha he'd approach you and say

129
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,480
i wish to go to rajagaha town not too far away

130
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,320
i wish to go to raja gahap please point out the road to rajakaha then you'd say

131
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,320
to him here this road goes to raja gaho go along for a while and then you'll see a certain

132
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,680
village go a little further and then you'll see a town and then go a little further and then

133
00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:01,040
you'll see raja gaha with the delightful parks woods meadows and lotus ponds so you'll know

134
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:09,199
when you get there because it's really beautiful and you see these lotus ponds and these lakes and things

135
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:18,399
and then the buddha continues talking to this uh to mogola instructed that like this by you

136
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,959
they might still take the wrong road heading west

137
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:32,639
but then a second person comes along with the same question you give the same example the same instructions and

138
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:41,120
instructed by you they do safely arrive at raja gaha and why is that because raja gaha's

139
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,639
present the path leading to raja gaha is present and you are there to give them the

140
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:54,880
instructions and one person takes the wrong path and heads west while another arrives safely

141
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:00,560
at rajakaha and then mogallana responds well what can i do about that

142
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:08,959
i am the one who just shows the way i just give the instructions

143
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:16,959
he's not physically carrying them there or something like this just gives them the instructions

144
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:25,279
and then of course the buddha says in the same way although nabana is present and the path

145
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:31,120
leading to nabana is present and i am present to encourage them

146
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:38,320
some of my disciples instructed and advised like me the chief the ultimate goal nabana while

147
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:46,000
some of them do not and what can i do about that the tatakata is the one who shows the

148
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,320
way kind of highlighting his role as a

149
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,000
person the buddha's role is to guide others we can't

150
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,959
make it happen for them can't make it happen for us

151
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,240
so what is this path what is this uh

152
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:16,240
this gradual training sometimes it's called or progressive training

153
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,800
many of you will be familiar with this maybe in the um less obvious ways

154
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:30,160
or the more um uh and in a certain form and it shows up in

155
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:37,440
lots of different forms at the bird's eye view is sila samari

156
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:44,000
panya ethics mental development and wisdom probably we've many of you have heard

157
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,120
this and certainly we talk about the eightfold path this way but the gradual training has some other

158
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,759
details in there that often we don't talk about in dermatox so i thought i would uh pull

159
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:04,400
out a few of them and uh talk about them a little bit

160
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:11,600
but this idea that uh it's progressive you know certainly in the west we don't us don't necessarily

161
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,640
teach about okay ethics first get that down and then when you're ready

162
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,918
go on to the next step when you're ready go on to the next step

163
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:30,160
for some people that works perfectly fine to have it not be progressive not to wait until you're

164
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:35,280
ready to receive the next instruction until you do but for some other people maybe it's

165
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,799
helpful to especially if you're feeling stuck or things don't quite make sense

166
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:46,799
or you're feeling lost and confused or overwhelmed or some of these things

167
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:53,919
one potential thing to do is to kind of go back to some of the earlier steps quote

168
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,559
unquote okay so what are these steps

169
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:05,919
i'm not first one is sila ethical behavior

170
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:11,760
moral restraint following the five precepts for a lay person if you're a monastic to follow the

171
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,760
patamoka i'm not going to talk about ethics today

172
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:24,400
but in this suta maybe i'll back up and say the gradual training this shows up i don't know how many

173
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,520
times in the suit does 20 or 30 different times and each time it's a little bit

174
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:38,160
different there aren't any that are exactly the same so we might imagine maybe with the

175
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:44,559
buddha was speaking to different people and had a sense that this person maybe needed

176
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:50,480
something a little bit different or i don't know exactly why

177
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,400
and there are some scholars and some practitioners who love to do this who love to compare all the different

178
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,679
versions of this and postulate why they're a little bit different

179
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,240
so i'm going to focus on the on three

180
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:14,080
supportive practices that are in here that often we don't hear about so much and

181
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,320
i'm going to talk about them in terms of if then statements

182
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:29,760
because they're presented not exactly that way but often um i find practice is feels

183
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:36,640
a little more like an invitation a little bit more like okay here's something you can do

184
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,799
you can try you can work with as opposed to that you better do this

185
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:48,559
you know we don't i think many of us don't respond so well i know i don't i don't like it when

186
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:55,919
people tell me what to do sometimes this gets me into trouble but i think there's also this uh

187
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:03,280
that comes in the flu in flavor more of an invitation if it's an if then statement so what do i mean by this

188
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:09,200
if you would like a particular experience or outcome then

189
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,120
do a particular thing to help create the conditions if you're not so interested in that

190
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,520
outcome then there's no need to do it okay

191
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:28,559
so if you don't want unhelpful states to

192
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:35,720
overwhelm you then guard the scent stores

193
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,440
so if you don't want unhelpful states to overwhelm you

194
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,760
so what are what's being pointed to here is and here and i'll read the exactly

195
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,200
how it is in the suta but these unhelpful states

196
00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:02,559
a kusala dhamma some of you may know this word kusala unhelpful and skillful and wholesome

197
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:08,080
the specific ones that are being pointed to are greed and aversion

198
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:14,400
so often right this just this even subtle or not so subtle i i want more

199
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:21,120
i want less get that away from me these are the first of the hindrances

200
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,120
the first two hindrances so these are things that definitely get in the way of our

201
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,720
settling down and having some peace and ease

202
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:39,280
and a short this also kind of greed and aversion is sometimes also a shorthand

203
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:45,840
way of saying everything that's not equanimity like any kind of like response we're having that isn't

204
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:52,000
equanimous if you don't want unhelpful states to

205
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:59,120
overwhelm you then guard the sense doors well what does this mean to guard the

206
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,159
scent stores scent stores of course are the

207
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:10,159
senses taste hearing feeling

208
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,919
seeing there's probably one i'm missing the mind is one i don't know if i have

209
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:22,240
them all but the six senses and maybe i'll just say a classic

210
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:28,480
example of not guarding the scent stores is when you see somebody attractive and

211
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,000
you just start watching them or they're going like this and you're kind of going around to look at this

212
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,919
right this is a typical thing we see in the movies right how somebody catches somebody else's eye and they look at

213
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:46,880
them and watch them and then usually their partner is angry right or something like this in the movies

214
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:53,039
so that's not guardian ascent stores so garden the scent stores is about

215
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,480
it's not that we have to close down and always avert our gaze

216
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:04,080
but it's that we're not like prolonging if there's like a peak of interest we're

217
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,120
not grabbing onto and like watching to

218
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:17,039
have that uh experience of attraction desire just grow and grow and grow

219
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,679
there might be oh yep that's an attractive person and just allow them to come into view

220
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,880
and out of you in the same way that uh you might be

221
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:35,919
standing on the sidewalk and there's cars that are going by like okay there's thoughts that are going by there are

222
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:43,120
sense there are physical experiences there's visual stimulus going by

223
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,720
so you know they're going by but and you also know when it's safe to step

224
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,919
out and what it's safe not to but something like this is guarding the

225
00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:01,440
scent stores it's a way of taking stimuli

226
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,200
as they are without pushing or pulling

227
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,640
but instead just allowing us to have experiences and allowing the experience

228
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:18,799
to arise and pass away so it's not a shutting down it's not a

229
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:24,799
shunning it's not a locking oneself up into a cave or a

230
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:31,840
closet when we're on retreat we do we do kind of guard the sun stores and a little bit

231
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,278
more legitimate or not legitimate a little bit more

232
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,279
i don't know what the word is i'm looking for but in a way that it's uh really

233
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:51,039
exaggerated necessary than how we are in daily life right we have kind of are isolated from so many of these

234
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:56,640
things that might impinge our senses just as a support but that's not the expectation that

235
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,799
we're doing that with our daily life so here's how the suta goes so here's

236
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:07,919
the quote here's the instruction here's the buddha's words

237
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:16,400
guard your scent stores when you see a site for example with your eyes don't get

238
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:22,640
caught up in the features and details if the faculty of sight were left

239
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:30,960
unrestrained bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming

240
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,880
for this reason practice restraint protect the faculty of sight and achieve

241
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:43,480
restraint over it and he goes on with the other five senses

242
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:49,360
so just this recognition that if it's unrestrained the translator here is

243
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:57,200
saying desire and aversion would become overwhelming maybe not overwhelming in terms of

244
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:03,840
uncomfortable but overwhelming in terms of we would lose our mindfulness we would get lost in the desire and

245
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:11,440
aversion so then the next uh

246
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:19,279
step in this gradual training i'll state it as an if then statement

247
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:27,039
if you want to be healthy and live blamelessly and in comfort

248
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:32,559
than be moderate in eating sometimes we don't talk about this so

249
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:40,400
much about being moderate and eating but just pointing to consuming just enough

250
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,240
to end our hunger and to eat enough

251
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:52,400
that's not starving right the buddha we know in his life story he had both when

252
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:58,880
he was younger in the palace we were imagining that he was a overeating and then

253
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,880
when later as a practitioner he was starving himself so this recognition that moderate and

254
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:11,919
eating is part of taking care of ourselves

255
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:18,240
is part of having a healthy body as well as a healthy mind

256
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:24,320
guarding the scent stores is to help sort of protect the mind and eating in a healthy way

257
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:30,240
is to protect the body for me it's a little bit interesting to

258
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,720
note that thousands of years ago as well as today there is a lot of concern about food

259
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,919
and of course religious traditions often have restrictions on eating or there's

260
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:48,960
or and certainly monastics for example in this tradition don't eat after them uh

261
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:55,840
then when the sun is up at so 12 o'clock or depending on daylight savings

262
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:03,320
whenever this soon the moon is sorry whenever the sun is straight overhead

263
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:11,520
so and there's a way of i mean today there are people of course they're

264
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,799
identified by what they eat and what they don't eat

265
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:23,840
and when we think about how much mental energy and how much even like

266
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:30,320
commerce and is concerned with food like how many

267
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:36,159
websites how many advertisements how many apps

268
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:42,159
how many you know what people talk about and stuff is food and there's nothing wrong with that

269
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:47,360
except that when it's a way that you get a little distorted view

270
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,480
that it becomes not so much about taking care of yourself

271
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:59,840
but some how it becomes more about the meaning of the food or

272
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:06,399
what it means for you in such a way that's not supportive for practice

273
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,640
i don't want to say that we shouldn't ever have uh you know there's

274
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,559
food that maybe our is our family or our traditions

275
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:24,240
have but just this to notice that this is such a rich place

276
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:30,000
where we often don't even want to look at it or consider it

277
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:38,159
how we might be using food in terms of stress or when we're feeling a little bit out of sorts or boredom or something like this

278
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:44,480
this is certainly a rich place for me to practice i have this thing with cookies

279
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:49,600
that sometimes you know when i'm feeling stressed or out of sorts or something that

280
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:55,360
i don't know i like to have cookies so

281
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,799
reflecting on the role that food has in our lives and allowing it to have a role

282
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:07,200
that is supportive and this is not easy because there is so much

283
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,880
because societal pressure about meaning of food or

284
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,919
what it should mean and what you shouldn't eat and something like this

285
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:25,840
so here's some how it's worded in the suta eat in moderation

286
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:32,559
reflect properly on the food that you eat not for fun or indulgence or adornment

287
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:37,679
or decoration but to sustain the body

288
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,440
to avoid harm and to support spiritual practice

289
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:50,799
and reflect that in this way so like eating eating this way i shall put an end to

290
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:58,320
old discomfort and not give rise to new discomfort and i will live healthy blameless and at

291
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:03,840
ease so to put an end to the feeling of being hungry

292
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:10,000
but not eating so much that then you feel sick from overeating

293
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,640
and in this way to live healthy blameless and at ease i appreciate very much right the buddha

294
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,000
is encouraging us to have some comfort and ease

295
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,760
sometimes when we think about these practitioners we are not thinking about comfort and ease we're thinking about

296
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:33,039
you know striving and working really hard or really

297
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:39,518
abstaining or restraining you know these uh asceticism and hardships

298
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,679
but the buddha is talking about eat in moderation in a way that supports you

299
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:51,919
so then having created favorable conditions to meditate one was

300
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:59,039
behaving ethically which i didn't go into any detail the second was to guard the sun store so

301
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:06,159
that the mind is not flooded with desire and aversion and just chasing after them

302
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:13,279
taking care of the body that's getting expressed in the way that and eating

303
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,799
so then the buddha sources talk about meditation practice

304
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:25,600
and he talks about by first by having a commitment to practice

305
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:35,519
so the the way it stated is to be committed to wakefulness

306
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:42,399
and wakefulness interestingly is used both ways that we might use it in english to be

307
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:48,559
awake that is to not be asleep and to be awake is also to be aware of

308
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:54,159
what's happening so this

309
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,240
the buddha he had this emphasis you know to be committed to practice to be committed to

310
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:08,080
wakefulness it means that you're not sleeping your life away you're not sleeping your days away

311
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:14,880
and maybe we i would consider or invite you to consider like well what

312
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:21,840
are there's ways in which we are maybe not literally sleeping but figuratively like that we're kind of

313
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:28,320
numbing ourselves and no longer aware of what's happening around us and

314
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,480
disconnected from ourselves and others

315
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,919
for example watching too much tv there's a way right in which the mind just

316
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:48,399
kind of gets into a a stupor or something i know this having done this recently

317
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:54,799
visiting someone who had a tv like watching tv and just noticing like how just watching

318
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,559
it it just kind of i don't want to say that old tv watching is bad but

319
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:06,880
right we're not going to become awakened if we're watching tv all hours of the day so

320
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,560
here's how the buddha expresses it he expresses it in terms of

321
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:18,839
what to do with yourself in the evenings be committed to

322
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:27,280
wakefulness practice walking and sitting meditation by day purifying your mind from obstacles

323
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:35,200
we're here for obstacles are the hindrances again so when the hindrances arise you know work with them

324
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:41,440
in the evening continue to practice walking and sitting meditation

325
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:49,118
in the middle of the night lie down in the lion's posture on the right side placing one foot on

326
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:55,599
top of the other mindful and aware and focused on the time of getting up

327
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:01,680
right of course they don't have alarm clocks so this idea of setting the intention okay i'm going to wake up at a

328
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,280
certain time and then in the last part of the night

329
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:14,079
get up and continue to practice walking and sitting meditation purifying your mind from obstacles so

330
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:21,520
this idea of before you sleep and when you first wake up to be practicing

331
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:26,000
with sitting and walking meditation

332
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,800
and then and this gradual training goes on to a description of mindfulness and

333
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,000
then concentration and then some of the wisdom things so i just wanted to highlight these

334
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,880
three different practices that are in there that sometimes we don't hear about but there can be a real

335
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:52,160
support and i like the way that it's these if then statements are about if you want to have some comfort

336
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:58,320
if you want to not be overwhelmed if you want to be healthy and take care of yourself so

337
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:06,160
it's not only for meditation but it's just to enable us to have our best lives

338
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:11,920
so that we can bring the or the best version of ourselves to our

339
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:19,040
practice and allow the wisdom and to arise and allow meditation to arise

340
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,480
creating the conditions for that

341
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,160
so maybe these are some ways and i don't know how many

342
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:36,480
different steps there are to train an elephant to go from a wild one so that they can then

343
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,880
put their leg out and allow a person to step up on on them

344
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,599
but i imagine there's a lot and it takes time but maybe some of them are mundane and

345
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:55,520
not so glamorous or even fun

346
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,560
but in the same way this practice too has

347
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,680
these steps and some that are maybe supportive that

348
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:14,720
we might overlook or we might consider if we haven't really engaged in them before as a support for our practice

349
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,680
on the way to nirvana the buddha says he's the one that shows the way

350
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,440
and if we would like to be able to follow the way that he is giving

351
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,880
so may our practice be a support for finding more freedom

352
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,920
more ease more comfort and maybe

353
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,520
support for not only ourselves but for all beings everywhere

354
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,760
thank you
