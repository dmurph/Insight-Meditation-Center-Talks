1
00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:10,179
okay people um [Music]

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,600
yeah nice to see the names uh streaming over there in the chat

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:26,279
um very sweet okay

4
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,960
well uh we'll set

5
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:13,140
very gently put your heart into a kind of Dharma

6
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,979
posture

7
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:37,619
no way in in yoga doing a a pose Asana

8
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:44,220
very deliberate about how we get into that

9
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,220
pose

10
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:04,159
same thing with a kind of the Dharma pose of our heart just uh

11
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:07,759
get lined up

12
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,200
foreign

13
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:39,140
the Dharma path is one of the coming progressively sensitized to goodness

14
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,140
being moved by it

15
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,560
being moved by your own goodness

16
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:38,539
for whatever reason we find ourselves in

17
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:48,500
this uh this lineage of wisdom love

18
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:01,160
in so many ways for a human life to unfold so many ways to suffer

19
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:07,880
in so few ways to be free

20
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,100
and wisdom and love

21
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,099
that actually is a path

22
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,680
some hope and wisdom and love

23
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:36,240
no techniques uh way as we Marshal

24
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:43,500
attention kind of efforts we make

25
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:52,280
are infused seasoned with uh

26
00:07:54,360 --> 00:08:00,740
the felt the sense of uh presence

27
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,560
love

28
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:39,719
meditative techniques can be uh recapitulation of our anxiety

29
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,719
vigilance

30
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,560
or self-correction

31
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:06,800
we let the mind marinade and uh

32
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,980
images signs of wisdom love

33
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:26,899
and maybe then we use our attention in particular ways

34
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:50,360
often useful to connect with the affective circuits of your body

35
00:09:53,399 --> 00:10:01,500
the surges of feeling emotion of impulse motivation

36
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,320
the building blocks of the

37
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,660
moving towards and moving away

38
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,000
that characterizes so much of our life

39
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,399
equanimity with feeling

40
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,440
that's so intimately tied up with our freedom

41
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,079
this feeling that Tangles us up with phenomena

42
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:43,860
is the fuel of the the push and pull of aversion grasping

43
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:04,860
it's feeling that make experience feel dense a burden on the

44
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,100
heart

45
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:28,459
so we practice letting the Winds of feeling blow through us

46
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:35,839
interesting that nothing will be blown over

47
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:13,558
and uh surges of feeling seemed to beg us to

48
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,159
think

49
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:25,260
to place the feeling in the context of what we want what we don't want to tell

50
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:31,520
story about this moment about this life

51
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:36,320
very innocent impulse

52
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:57,200
but sometimes we experiment in meditation

53
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:04,820
with not making anything mean anything

54
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:21,380
not over interpreting phenomena the push and pull

55
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:55,799
in other words we start to trust awareness

56
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:02,360
Trust the logic of the Dharma

57
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:04,140
our our understanding comes less from seeking answers more from

58
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:13,340
surrendering surrendering to not knowing

59
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:27,799
surrendering the

60
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:35,840
stories we use to Grapple with the intensity of the moment

61
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:48,260
well the ways we cope with feeling

62
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,700
by thinking

63
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,799
relax

64
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:26,600
as Faith Buddha dhamma Sangha

65
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:26,360
foreign

66
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,600
foreign

67
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:13,220
okay um so uh

68
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,760
wisdom

69
00:30:21,799 --> 00:30:26,940
the uh the Buddha says uh just as the

70
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:32,039
lion is the ruler of the Jungle wisdom rules over

71
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:37,460
mindfulness concentration Faith energy

72
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:46,860
um the the last of the five uh

73
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:53,059
faculties so wisdom

74
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:58,620
philosophy the word breaks down as love love

75
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:05,580
of wisdom and I'll say more about the the Buddhist

76
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:13,260
definition of it but uh in one scientific uh Team

77
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:18,779
uh characterized it in this way as as having six components nothing sacred

78
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:28,020
about six could be five or seven but um they picked six and uh six six facets so

79
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:34,640
wisdom as pro-social attitudes and behaviors

80
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,799
emotional homeostasis self-understanding

81
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:45,360
value tolerance dealing effectively with ambiguity

82
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:51,740
uncertainty and social decision making

83
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:59,279
uh so I offer that just a kind of way another lens from which to understand

84
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:08,940
okay what what is wisdom and often a practitioners ask Dharma

85
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:16,140
teachers questions yeah and uh often boils down to something like

86
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:22,200
how do I be wise and

87
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,919
that's a question I can't really be answered by another person

88
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:34,080
wisdom is uh it can't be mimicked and

89
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,760
it's improvisational and it emerges out of our own

90
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,500
intuitive connection with ourself

91
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:51,000
and our ability to make good predictions

92
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:59,399
about happiness wisdom is about making good predictions

93
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:06,919
about suffering and happiness for ourself and for others

94
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:12,899
given given everything I know about

95
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:18,059
me and you and everyone we know

96
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:23,539
how should we live given

97
00:33:23,539 --> 00:33:30,860
Anita anata how should we live

98
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:39,840
given the vulnerability of our species to Greed to hatred to

99
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:47,580
delusion to violence given the vulnerability of our species to violence

100
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:55,500
how should we live philosophers

101
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:02,460
sometimes distinguish knowledge that

102
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,740
from knowledge how so knowledge that

103
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:14,460
the universe 14 billion years old verse knowledge how

104
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:20,060
how to ride a bike and

105
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:26,820
Dharma Insight wisdom is mostly about knowledge how knowledge

106
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:34,220
how to do what knowledge how not to suffer

107
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:41,940
heard a story of uh this beloved old uh

108
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:47,419
monk in Thailand who

109
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:56,638
apparently saw a satellite in the sky and asked uh his younger

110
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:02,700
you know younger monastic to explain like what what is that you know what is

111
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:08,040
going on there and um and the younger younger monk had

112
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:13,320
to explain the Earth's rotation the Earth is round the you know all these

113
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,359
things and um and that was all news to this old

114
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:24,119
monk yeah it is about the shape of the earth and its movement

115
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:30,119
he didn't know any of that but he knew how not to suffer

116
00:35:30,119 --> 00:35:33,859
how not to cause suffering

117
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:42,780
so the the Journey of uh of wisdom

118
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:48,000
from a kind of latent potential

119
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,880
the the dots inside us that haven't been connected

120
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,960
latent potential to Insight to embodiment and generalization

121
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:06,359
generalization meaning wisdom that's operative in all spheres of our life

122
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:13,200
is a tall order wisdom operative in all spheres of our life

123
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,920
the right we all know their zones contacts relationships moments

124
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:27,020
particular currents of of feeling of thinking

125
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:32,220
where we lose we become alienated from our

126
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:37,680
our wisdom and uh

127
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,280
we want to keep a kind of relationship with the the

128
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:50,040
failures of the of generalization the way is our wisdom doesn't generalize

129
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:55,260
to all contacts and was talking with a friend just a couple

130
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:02,460
days ago another long time Dharma practitioner and just having a very very

131
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:10,400
Frank conversation for the the ways that um our wisdom has been

132
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:16,040
actualized and generalized and the ways it's not

133
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:22,619
and it's inspiring to see the ways in which

134
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:28,740
we have not generalized the wisdom to all

135
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:34,339
corners of our life it's actually motivating

136
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:45,119
so the process we we start um start by thawing out the top layers of

137
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,220
of delusion and that takes that just takes time it

138
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:56,880
takes time where we just I think naturally are kind of confused

139
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:03,300
about the nature of Happiness confused about what we actually want confused about what a good life

140
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:10,859
would be and maybe we we find ourselves getting what

141
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:18,980
we want but then it's not what we thought it was and this kind of recognition the cycle

142
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:26,599
that uh that getting is always different from wanting

143
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:35,059
so wrong View wrong View

144
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:43,800
um feels almost visceral it feels almost visceral like it's in our tissues or something

145
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:50,520
and we have to thaw out and in that process of thawing out which might be

146
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:56,400
months or years there's a lot of Kicking and Screaming

147
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:02,700
that happens a lot of Kicking and Screaming as we're thawing out

148
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:10,279
as we're starting to replace the kind of uh

149
00:39:10,579 --> 00:39:18,980
boards on the the the are our uh boat our raft or whatever

150
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,440
we we find we we can't just um

151
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:34,079
replace all the boards of the boat uh that we carry on at once it's a gradual

152
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:41,838
gradual path and we can't even really pick up

153
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:49,020
new ideas initially we have to almost like make our body mind more porous so

154
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:54,780
that new information can flow in this is um

155
00:39:54,780 --> 00:40:03,240
some of why we emphasize not knowing emphasize surrender emphasize putting

156
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:09,359
down all the familiar reference points of liking and disliking good evil us

157
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:15,800
them we make the mind more porous

158
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:22,680
malleable stable we

159
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:30,000
get settled get happy enough

160
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,660
and um usually we think we have to get wisdom so that we can be happy and that's fair

161
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:43,800
enough but um but happiness often actually precedes insight

162
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:51,480
happiness precedes in sight when we're suffering we're just looking

163
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:58,560
so desperately for ways out it's hard to learn it's hard to learn we

164
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,320
can do it we can do it but it's harder to learn

165
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:12,720
um happiness a kind of positive mood actually modulates our Attention our

166
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:19,619
cognition and broadens The View and so whereas suffering pools the

167
00:41:19,619 --> 00:41:25,859
attention Narrows The View makes resolution feel kind of urgent

168
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:32,240
um happiness sense of well-being broadens The View

169
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:40,680
we become receptive to new information and wisdom often feels like it arises

170
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:49,940
out of almost like out of our peripheral vision not out of our intent gaze

171
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:58,880
ramdas says the quieter you get the more you can hear

172
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:06,140
and uh the function of samadhi

173
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:13,740
quieter you get the more you hear and so

174
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,859
um

175
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:26,180
the wisdom wisdom the actually

176
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:34,980
creates the sense that the oh okay the Dharma the Dharma is real it's real

177
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:40,280
it's been realized it becomes real

178
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:46,400
and our Insight feels

179
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:51,900
Insight feels freeing feels um

180
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:58,260
it feels like it resolves it's like something consistent in our being all

181
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:06,480
the way down from conscious thought to subconscious competition something feels like

182
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:13,578
um something comes into true

183
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:20,819
and sometimes we think that's the end of the

184
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:27,599
story but most Insight needs reinforcement the light from the Stars dims

185
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,900
where we need to to consolidate and to

186
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:39,599
re-practice to re-discover we need to be reminded of our wisdom

187
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:48,480
this is why we have kalyana mitta spiritual friends were way more suggestible than we think

188
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:55,440
and it's really important to have this kind of steady inflow of goodness into

189
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:03,240
our heart we keep practicing to to nurture protect

190
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:10,800
our wisdom Joseph Goldstein just summed it up simply when we practice wisdom grows

191
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:15,680
when we don't wisdom waves

192
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:24,000
we have to keep suffering we do keep suffering and we keep a conscious

193
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,660
relationship to our dukkah this is what inspires us to grow and

194
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:42,540
deepen and we we try acting from our wisdom

195
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:50,760
try acting from our wisdom even sometimes when we don't feel it what would a person be like yeah I okay

196
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:56,819
I knew that Insight around self kindness what

197
00:44:56,819 --> 00:45:01,920
I don't feel so kind right now at all but what what

198
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:09,480
that person do now if they were living from if I were living from this Insight

199
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,880
from this wisdom from the self-kindness how would I behave now let me do that

200
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:22,520
let me try that on so um

201
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:31,319
we prepare the ground until the soil bar delusions and habit-wise view

202
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:39,119
we get still gets quiet stay open to the peripheral

203
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:46,280
vision we consolidate and grow our insight

204
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:50,400
