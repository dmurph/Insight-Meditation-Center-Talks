1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,640
here we go okay so hello and welcome everyone

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,000
to happy hour lovely to be with you

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:18,640
so so for today's practice i'd like to invite us

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,439
to hold both the sorrows and the joys of the world

5
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,359
it is said that the word there are ten thousand joys and ten thousand sorrows

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:38,079
and at times when [Music] it seems like the um

7
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,360
political landscape or the the world landscape and

8
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:50,960
the geopolitical landscape is so dire our minds turn to what is

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,640
painful what is difficult all the suffering in the world and the people

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:04,239
yes there is a lot of suffering in the world right now that we hold with care with compassion we turn towards we don't

11
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:12,640
turn away and in order to support being able to turn more towards

12
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,479
difficulty sadness with compassion it is

13
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,119
helpful to resource ourselves our hearts with gratitude for what is good

14
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:31,280
in the world in our in our lives for the people we care about and love

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,759
in order to resource ourselves so that challenges pain difficulty sorrow

16
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,799
grief it is not the measure

17
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:49,680
of all our waking hours it can be so difficult and draining and and

18
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,000
not helpful not helpful for anyone if we are not resourced to be able to hold and

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,640
hold witness and support and do what we can in the world so

20
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,759
if we are unsettled if we are

21
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:15,599
toppled over um it doesn't help anyone it doesn't help us it doesn't help our loved ones and

22
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:22,720
anyone in the world so it is helpful to have that sense of balance and this past week we've practiced with

23
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:30,080
equanimity we've practiced with equanimity and compassion we practice with stability and compassion just

24
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,920
different ways to bring stability to our practice of compassion and and tonight i'd like to extend that

25
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:45,040
and actually invite us to to dare to have the courage

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:52,560
to practice gratitude and joy in order to balance in order to support

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,080
the the compassion the pain the difficulty in the world it's not about turning away

28
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,680
it's not about la de da i'm just going to be happy and pollyanna that's not the idea

29
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:10,640
you know this i know you know this but i'll still like to say it that it's not about turning it

30
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,519
it's skillfully using skillful means

31
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,560
to be balanced to be resourced to be filled with stability gladness choice so that we can

32
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,920
contain so that we're available for more compassion in the world so that we don't

33
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:35,920
have what's called empathy fatigue or empathy distress and pathetic distress so

34
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,560
so that's the invitation to engage with gratitude with joy tonight

35
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,710
and not feel guilty or bad that um

36
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:54,720
[Music] there are people suffering in the world yes and there's also joy in the world and

37
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:02,640
it's okay it's okay to honor both it's okay in our humanity to embrace both to

38
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,720
honor both so

39
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,760
not turning away from either honoring both appreciating both

40
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,359
really shifting the perspective the perspective really an awakened perspective that

41
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:27,440
allows both joy and sorrows all of that to be just as it is

42
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,080
just as it is without toppling over so so in this practice tonight it's an

43
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,840
invitation to shift to shift our perspective to shift our perspective

44
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,880

211
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,480
blessing this blessing there's so much blessing even in the midst of

212
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:01,640
challenges so thank you for your practice everyone

213
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:11,599
so if there are no more reflections i'd like to invite us to share

214
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:18,400
in small groups and sharing our joy sharing our gratitude it's actually such a beautiful

215
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:27,040
practice so the invitation tonight is after about 15 seconds of silent meta

216
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,040
for ourselves for others is to um

217
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:39,680
around go around round and round and round so the first person shares

218
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:46,000
something they're grateful for something in their life maybe in the moment maybe it's just as simple as

219
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,800
ah i had a moment to sit and be breathed tonight and then the next person shares

220
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,960
a nugget something they're grateful for and then the next person shares a nugget so this way

221
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:05,520
it's we go around round round robin so the one person sharing a monologue it's more sharing in

222
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:11,920
nugget and this format is called the spiral because we keep going around and increasing joy and

223
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:17,359
it's so nourishing to hold each other people's joy just hearing what they're

224
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:24,160
grateful for it brings us joy notice that the medita the the vicarious joy

225
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:29,680
that can come up it's it's so nourishing can be so lovely
