1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:10,559
so good morning good morning uh that is your time zone welcome to uh

2
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,839
all uh lines of latitude and longitudes nice to

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:23,359
lot of familiar names welcome to

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,960
welcome to all of you so

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,719
that's uh that's it

6
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:58,399
just opening and settling your body with

7
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,000
your breath

8
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:35,200
just having some sense of intention maybe even we say val

9
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,280
that for this time

10
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:57,720
the awareness is prioritized

11
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,280
over the details of our life

12
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,840
committing to awareness rather than

13
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,840
optimizing the moment

14
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,560
solving the riddle of our life

15
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:45,040
finding a more direct way to pleasure and more efficient escape

16
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,759
from pain

17
00:04:50,240 --> 00:05:00,759
actually renouncing those agendas for this time

18
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,360
what would we do with the moment if we didn't have to do

19
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,680
our life

20
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,000
maybe we would just rest

21
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,800
and look

22
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,560
we're often subtly imaging the outline of our body

23
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,319
imaging the space of the room

24
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:21,959
keeping track of self another me not me

25
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:39,959
very innocent impulse of the mind and we can soften

26
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:49,240
we keep updating our autobiography

27
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:01,279
keep adding sentences and paragraphs chapters

28
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,639
to the story of me

29
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:22,160
in the words we speak to ourselves these two can be known in awareness can be

30
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:28,040
known as empty

31
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:05,120
and so the subtle visual image we have of ourself and the

32
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,639
narrative of self all of this can be safely surrendered

33
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,880
to awareness

34
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:32,320
the urgent energies in the body

35
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:42,200
just meet those with patience

36
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:54,039
let them drain right down into the center of the earth

37
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:23,000
begin to we begin to feel

38
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:31,760
a little less confined in self

39
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,400
a little less busy

40
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:48,120
with the tasks and duties the demands of i am this

41
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,360
space starts to run through us

42
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:17,440
we don't have to figure out what this moment is good for

43
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,640
i will use it

44
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:43,480
we just surrender to awareness

45
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,240
do

46
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:05,399
so thank you it's good too um good to sit with you

47
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:18,559
sorry this the sense of um uh dharma talks there are a little bit

48
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:26,399
more a little bit of a realization or something the dharma talks they're a little more

49
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:31,840
they're a little more like some weird species of performance art than maybe

50
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:39,760
i've realized and um they're less a kind of

51
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,200
transmission of information or something like that and uh

52
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:51,760
and so i say that just so that we um can

53
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,039
take it whatever impression it makes on our mind whatever is useful we pick up

54
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:02,320
we leave the rest behind

55
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:09,760
so yesterday i spoke about um a certain kind of reverence for the pain

56
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,799
of the other and today

57
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:22,399
it's about reference for their their goodness and their

58
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:24,799
power

59
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,200
and it seems like it should be should be easy to open to the goodness

60
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,720
of another but it involves some measure of surrender

61
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:47,240
some measure of surrender maybe maybe even

62
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,039
idealization that's not that's not a word from our orbit you

63
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:02,320
know idealization gets a bad bad rap in many circles and

64
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:07,760
for good reason there are problems as i'll say

65
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:16,720
but that sense of oh yeah we're supposed to be objective and measured but um

66
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:25,360
idealization has a place in relationships it has a place in our relationship to dhamma

67
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,640
and sometimes to be objective or measured

68
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,960
is actually a lack of courage or a preoccupation

69
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,679
with one's independence

70
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:48,960
and i know when uh when i was younger i there were

71
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:56,240
definitely relationships where i sort of like completely

72
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,720
leap frogged the idealizing honeymoon phase

73
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:10,799
and directly entered a kind of state of vaguely disgruntled ambivalence

74
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:17,200
you know most people live for the honeymoon right but

75
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:25,039
that that leapfrogging yeah that kind of hesitation around

76
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:31,120
certain kind of heart surrender that was not a function of wisdom

77
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,799
nor of equanimity but something more

78
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:42,240
like fear you know this is

79
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:49,120
psychoanalyst stephen mitchell idealization is destabilizing it shifts

80
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:56,960
our values our priorities our purposes it undermines the utilitarian approach

81
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,640
to practical realities that our lives require most of the time

82
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:09,118
falling is not a viable way of life and so we tailor tell ourselves that the

83
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:16,480
transition from falling in love to being in love represents a dispelling of fantasy

84
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:22,878
a landing on solid ground we try to keep our footing sure by

85
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:30,638
degrading idealization into mere intoxicating illusion

86
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,240
we are wiser and know better now however it is not at all clear that

87
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:42,320
the solid ground we perpetually seek is any more real

88
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,280
than the idealizations that inspire passion

89
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,800
wallace um stephen said that something like disillusionment is

90
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,720
sometimes merely another illusion

91
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,880
now of course i'm not uh

92
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:17,839
i'm not talking about surrendering to someone or something

93
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,800
that who lack exquisite care sensitivity

94
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,520
for [Music] your heart and

95
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:37,280
idealization gets problematic when we're kind of using it to prop ourselves

96
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,720
up where it's problematic when we're projecting all of our needs onto

97
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:49,520
the other we're trying to extract their power

98
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,800
what i'm really talking about is uh is reverence

99
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:03,920
reverence how how do we

100
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,839
relate to the power of another do we

101
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:16,400
do we lose ourselves in their power do we cling

102
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,880
tenaciously to our autonomy

103
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,680
and how do we surrender to dhamma

104
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:36,560
we don't ask it on the first day but at some point we're going to have to surrender we're going to have to let go

105
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:43,119
of a certain kind of willfulness and autonomy

106
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,320
offer our heart up to dhamma

107
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,480
and we fall in love with the path

108
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:02,880
we stay in love with the path we grow disenchanted with it

109
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,160
and we fall in love again

110
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:14,480
and our relationship with the path our relationship with others is

111
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:21,079
supported by something like episodes of idealization

112
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:29,680
for our heart to lean with a certain kind of reverence

113
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:37,599
now i'm not temperamentally a kind of devotional

114
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:44,000
person but now when i

115
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:51,838
when i see goodness i know to get on my knees

116
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:01,680
as we grow um as we grow to love ourself

117
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:09,920
more deeply as we grow to understand to appreciate the emptiness of self

118
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,640
more fully

119
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:23,440
the kind of reverence for goodness and that feels more and more natural

120
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:29,119
it feels more and more like a sense of of awe

121
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:36,320
a sense of awe are in the face of goodness

122
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:44,320
we look up at the night sky we see we see stars uh light years away and we

123
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,839
sense that the vastness of space and time

124
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:56,800
and in some ways we feel small

125
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,799
yet sanctified holy

126
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,640
and that sense of awe you know it's easy to feel for the dalai lama or

127
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:17,040
something like this these kinds of people these beings

128
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:23,200
but i feel like we can actually sense

129
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:29,440
some of that that awe that reverence for goodness in um

130
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,240
for all the ordinary people in our lives too

131
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,320
yeah maybe it's just some little thing they do

132
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,400
ah some aw

133
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:53,839
that's beautiful we're not relating

134
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:59,440
ego to ego when

135
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:06,800
when it's ego to ego the power or the goodness of another can spark

136
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,400
envy or self-judgment comparison competitiveness

137
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,599
we're so what i'm talking about we're not using the other's goodness as a kind

138
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:24,280
of measuring stick for ourselves that's the ego to ego

139
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:32,079
competitiveness yeah and that is the wellspring of a lot of pain

140
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:38,560
envy yeah um of the seven deadly sins lust gluttony

141
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:45,040
greed laziness wrath pride and envy

142
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,800
the writer joseph epstein said of the seven deadly sins

143
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:58,960
only envy is no fun at all it's really no fun

144
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:07,000
but is that how we get lost in the power the goodness the potency of another

145
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,160
and so the encouragement as the encouragement

146
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,400
of meta practice is to uh

147
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,400
to uh to see goodness to see it

148
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:34,319
yet to be here to kind of be open to idealization yeah maybe just a moment a

149
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:39,920
moment just such a reference

150
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,720
to feel it to take it in when we see it

151
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:59,200
we're learning to find our self-sufficiency and we're

152
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,319
also very much practicing dependency i feel

153
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:14,560
we're practicing the strength of surrender

154
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,319
the strength of surrender

155
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:31,079
so i offer this for your consideration

156
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:40,560
