1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,379
morning everyone and welcome and both everyone who is might be watching

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:13,740
on YouTube hello and I've been away for a month or so

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,940
it's nice to be back here with all of you here

4
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:27,000
and um I was a way of doing a month-long

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,340
Retreat and and I was really on my own new cabin up in

6
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,860
the series but I had one uh discourse with the Buddha that went

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:44,640
through my mind that I reviewed and was kind of inspiration for it and so I'd like to share that with you

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,640
today and um there's a Core teaching of the Buddha

9
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,539
that this that's given in this course it's not by the Buddha it's he gave it

10
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:03,000
but then someone a disciple is repeats it in the context of the story

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,939
and the story is interesting I mean the teaching is particularly powerful and it's said to be teachings

12
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,979
from the Buddha that was kind of the Genesis of what of Zan of Mahayana

13
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,340
Buddhism of this famous philosopher nagarjuna so it's a very very very very

14
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:28,500
significant teaching but the fact that it's in this wider context of the story is nice

15
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:35,939
and the story has to do with a monk named Chana and China had been a monk for

16
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:42,900
it could be 45 years and and he was distraught for a number

17
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:50,759
of reasons for one of them after 45 years of being a monk in the time of the Buddha he still was an enlightened

18
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,180
he still didn't hit his language he knew the teachings but he had not seen the

19
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,420
teachings and uh just learning the teaching is one thing but to see that see it for

20
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:10,440
yourself and your direct experience that's a whole other thing but not only had he not seen the

21
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,620
teaching discovered and experienced it for himself he apparently was a bit of a troubled

22
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:23,220
man so many of you have heard of him in without his name if you've heard the

23
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,739
story of the Buddha how he left the palace is a prince and he went with his

24
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:36,239
charioteer out into the streets he was he was given a kind of a protected life and somehow able to leave the palace

25
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,900
compound and his Chariot here took him out into the streets and there he encountered What's called the four

26
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:49,620
Heavenly Messengers he saw someone who was sick someone who was old someone who had died and then he

27
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,739
saw a monastic renunciant and he never seen those before so it's

28
00:02:55,739 --> 00:03:01,680
kind of unusual in the world to have people um

29
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,840
Nazi sickness old age and death though many people in the modern world United

30
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,120
States don't see it very brightly especially death and things are put away

31
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,420
coincidentally the first time I ever saw a dead body in my life was when I was 11

32
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,480
years old in Nepal which is where the Buddha went out I was out in the streets

33
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,940
and there was this young child wrapped in blanket being carried to the river to

34
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:36,959
be burned and so the Buddha who was 29 supposedly

35
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,959
and so the charioteer his name was Chana this is the man who became a monk and

36
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:50,220
the story is that he was born around the same time as the Buddha born of a servant maybe a servant in the

37
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:56,400
palace and so probably the Chana and the Buddha grew up together probably they were

38
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,120
friends they'd known each other for and um and then to make it more

39
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,280
kind of powerful this connection from the Buddha and China when the Buddha

40
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:16,680
then eventually escaped to the palace and went to renounce his royalty and go off into down from the area of Foothills

41
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:22,560
to the Himalayas down into the plains of where he did a spiritual seeking as a

42
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,500
renunciant um Chana took him on the first leg of

43
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:35,340
that Journey took him out to the edges of the Kingdom I guess and then uh we would have said okay you

44
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:41,280
can leave me here and he took off his Royal garments his jewels and he hadn't John I

45
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:48,060
don't need this anymore they're yours and um and then John I was supposed to go back to with them all

46
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:53,160
and so that was a momentous role for Chana and it said it was very

47
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,160
meritorious to be the one who supported the Buddha to do his renunciation

48
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,440
so after the Buddha was enlightened he came back to his hometown and uh China

49
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:13,100
then ordained as a monk and uh and then

50
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,040
but it seemed like he was had some problems maybe he was a troubled person

51
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:25,919
and it seemed that for one thing he was he kept breaking the root monastic rules

52
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,919
and uh he kind of would deny that he broke them and and then at some point it was bad enough

53
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:39,900
that the Buddha said okay you have to kind of go live it by yourself for a while you can't live with them together with other monastics for a while so

54
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,600
and so what he did was he just went to found another monastic Community to live in I mean another Buddhist Community

55
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,740
another town and that was kind of like that that wasn't that was breaking the rule so the Buddha called them back and they had a

56
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,900
they work something out and um but he was kind of known to be obstinate

57
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:03,060
stubborn and um and maybe other ways

58
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:09,120
also he was an arrogance conceit that he had because of this special connection he had to the Buddha does it need to be

59
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:16,220
louder is it okay the volume okay so um

60
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:23,100
so this conceit you know that he has a special connection to the Buddha kind of interfered maybe with his

61
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,979
engaging in the practice so uh apparently his behavior as a

62
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:36,060
monastic became bad enough that one of the last kind of declarations that Buddha made

63
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:42,419
before he died like the last note the last thing one of the one of the last things he had to say was something like

64
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:50,940
and by the way the manchana he is going to have the the Brahma danda

65
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:56,520
the Brahma punishment which is one is considered to be one of the highest

66
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:04,740
kind of punishments or something that you can get as a monastic and and that is that no monastic in the

67
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,020
order was supposed to talk to him anymore so he wasn't he wasn't this robe it's

68
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:16,800
just like you know no one should talk to him and that's pretty bad you know kind of may make you isolated so he must have

69
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,580
done something pretty bad but not bad enough to be disrobed and um so that was one of the last

70
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:30,539
things that's the significant thing that Buddha to say so so the Buddha died and then Ananda the Buddhist attendant who

71
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:37,560
was also kind of from the same town and known each other for also for a long time it was his job to go tell Chana

72
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:44,639
about this order this what happened that seemed to have upset China quite a bit I

73
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,680
seemed to have a wake-up call for him and he decided well I better get serious

74
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:56,460
here about my practice I better do something here and maybe that's what the Buddha knew the Buddha knew that China needed some

75
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:04,380
real poking to really get him to get serious after 45 years of being a monk and not really doing the practice

76
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:10,080
and um and so in fact that's what he did he got serious and so the the Sutra

77
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,020
called the Chana suta begins with China going around to the Elder monks of the

78
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:24,000
time going I guess early in the morning and maybe waking them up and um and he says to them may the

79
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,460
elders instruct me May the elders teach me

80
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:36,539
May the elders provide me with a Dharma talk so I can see the dhamma so he

81
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:43,200
really is ready he wants to see it he doesn't just know it however there's this rule Brahma danda

82
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,779
that he's not supposed to be talked to so the Elder monks kind of dismiss them

83
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:56,160
but they do give him a little teaching but they give him this the most wrote kind of simplistic or the most wrote

84
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,620
kind of formulaic teaching the Buddha the core Buddhist teaching of the time

85
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:07,080
that they could they're kind of like like you almost feel like they're like just yelling at him like and they're

86
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,380
saying some of you know the teachings of the five aggregates usually it's called form feeling

87
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:18,779
perception mental formations and Consciousness I prefer to translate it

88
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:27,779
as appearances feelings recognition constructs mental constructs and and

89
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:34,140
cognitions and they tell they tell Chana this Elders say

90
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:41,959
um appearances are impermanent in constant appearances are feelings are in constant

91
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:49,140
recognitions are in constant constructs mental constructs are inconstant and cognitions we have are

92
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:56,279
inconstant and then they close the door sometimes they say and all those things

93
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:02,880
are not self so appearances are not self feelings are not self recognitions are not self

94
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,060
mental constructs are not self and cognitions are not self and they close the door

95
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:14,100
and uh and so China then says wait a minute this is going to distraught

96
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:20,959
because he speaks to himself any uh any thought

97
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:31,019
I know all this I know all this but my um but my mind

98
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:39,140
is not leaping in inspiration by this teaching

99
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,579
it doesn't become my mind has become confident settled resolved

100
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:50,579
about the quieting of all my mental constructs

101
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:57,600
all my mental kind of Shenanigans in my mind my chatter and all that that doesn't I'm not confident about the

102
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:05,399
value of doing that of quieting the mind and constructs of giving up all my attachments

103
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:13,740
of of uh ending my craving of nibana Freedom Liber liberation

104
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,899
so here's a teaching so not only doesn't that he doesn't see it for himself but it doesn't Inspire him he doesn't

105
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:25,800
understand it well enough to that this is great this is a great thing and it is hard to understand how these

106
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,620
teachings on their five Aggregates is a wonderful teaching but maybe I'll try a little bit to get us to give you a

107
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:38,399
feeling because it will prepare you for what's going to come so they say that appearances are in

108
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,959
constant and permanent so appearance is what this means is anything that appears

109
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:54,440
at any of the five cent stores so sites side objects appear

110
00:11:54,779 --> 00:12:00,000
sound objects certainly sounds appear and we hear them smells appear we smell

111
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,820
them tastes appear and we taste them and tactile experiences appear

112
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:12,300
and these are called appearances and these are inconstant they're constantly shifting and changing and

113
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:17,700
flowing and and becoming different things you go through the day and

114
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:24,180
there's a whole series of different physical Sensations you'll experience throughout the day

115
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:30,959
um it's already you know it's a little after 10 and I'm already hot probably we should turn the air conditioner on and then we'll have a

116
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:37,260
different Sensations in our body and but this morning it was kind of cool and nice all kinds of things it's all

117
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:42,540
shifting and changing and so now what's appeared for us for some of us I guess

118
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:49,380
is it's warm that's what's appeared but we know that it's not going to stay warm it's going to be warm for a few

119
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:56,279
hours but sooner or later it'll get cool and things will shift and change and we

120
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:01,980
know this is inconstant and for some things that we hear that they're in constituency okay we'll put up for this

121
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:07,440
for now we'll work with this now it's not going to make it make a big deal I'm not going to get attached to it being

122
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,500
having to be this way or attached to it needing to be different because it's all shifting and changing and the sense of

123
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,260
Shifting and changing can loosen up the grip we have on how things are at any

124
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:25,440
given moment this becomes more important when it has to do with our feelings and feelings

125
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,320
here is in the Buddhist context means that the experience of pleasantness and

126
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:37,740
unpleasantness and that also is Shifting and changing throughout the day and the hour and the

127
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,920
minute depending on what rather the Mind lands on

128
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:49,380
now unfortunately I brought up the fact that it's warm in here so maybe some of you have been reminded of how unpleasant

129
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:54,839
that is or maybe some you find it very pleasant and very satisfying but if I hadn't said it you probably would have

130
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:02,940
been so gripped by my teaching that you wouldn't have noticed it and um and so

131
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,980
and so uh so you can be reminded by things or then you can be I can tell

132
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,920
some tantalizing story more tantalizing that China's story and you'll be the edge of

133
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,940
your seat and you won't notice it anymore your body's uncomfortable it's unpleasant or you won't notice how pleasant certain things are these all

134
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:27,200
these these these all appear they come and go they change and shift and there's something very significant

135
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:34,800
about tuning in to how the flow the stream of Sensations come and go and

136
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,680
shift and change all the time that somehow or other is quite freeing if we see it then live in it

137
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:47,279
we partly don't live in it because we live in our constructs we often live in the stories we tell ourselves and the

138
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:53,220
interpretations or the recognitions the third of these five aggregates

139
00:14:53,220 --> 00:15:00,480
and recognitions have to do with uh how we identify or see something that is

140
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:07,560
innocent enough you see a door and you recognize it as a door it seems no problem but we recognize things that are often a

141
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:14,600
problem you know racism is a recognition right you recognize people in a certain way

142
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:20,060
and or internalized racism you recognize yourself in a certain way

143
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:27,180
or all kinds of other ways in which we recognize other people or recognize ourselves and when we see other people

144
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:33,300
on the street what are we what are we seeing what are we reacting to what are we identifying what are we taking as

145
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:38,579
being the important thing to notice if someone is uh looks big and

146
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:47,220
threatening and dangerous that's their recognition Danger if someone is really attractive then the

147
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,380
recognition is ah this is interesting maybe I shouldn't look

148
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:58,940
or something but we have all these we recognize things but when we can see that the

149
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,959
recognitions that we have are contingent the recognitions are

150
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:09,540
partly a product of our own mind and they also come and go

151
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:16,380
and we can see them come oh there's one so you know I've gone down the street and recognized someone at this being

152
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:24,240
that's a dangerous person and maybe and and then I say oh I could watch my mind have that thought

153
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,120
and because I can see it being born is that really so

154
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:38,579
I didn't have that thought before that thought came out of my mind it's a mind mind creation construct it might not be

155
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:44,459
true but if I don't have the mindful to see the birth of the thought

156
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:50,720
then the person and the danger are not distinct I kind of meld those together

157
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:57,060
and my projection of Danger on that person is is who the person is in my

158
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:03,660
eyes so to be able to see the arising and then the disappearing of these

159
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:10,558
recognitions we have is very freeing and very wise because then you can give

160
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:16,798
that person of Street a second look is this really the case Oh no just the

161
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:22,380
person just looks like my third grade bully and that's all actually the person looks

162
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:28,079
quite sweet and uh and so then kind of the the recognition bubble pops of that

163
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,860
recognition perhaps maybe the person is dangerous I used to live in a dangerous neighborhood all my

164
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:43,260
roommates got robbed at gunpoint or knife Point except for me and um and uh

165
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:49,260
there were people and they you know I think I'll cross the street and then they'd follow me

166
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:55,620
and then I went into a store you know to kind of be safe or something so so there's dangers out there but uh

167
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,900
but you know just to be able to see the recognition and are we really seeing accurately

168
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:06,000
and then these stories the constructs we make is kind of related to what I just said

169
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,179
to see how they come and go and see see how they're born gives us a sense that they're not solid

170
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:19,080
they're not fixed oh there's I made a story up and then cognitions are all kind of in

171
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:24,780
the same regard the difference between cognition and recognition is not that great in their

172
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:31,620
teachings but cognitions are more basic than recognitions recognition is a recognition of something you already

173
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:37,020
know from before so this is this is the emphasis but to

174
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:42,260
say this in a simplistic way over and over again as the Buddhist teachings do

175
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:49,440
makes the mind numb and uh and probably that's what happened to China you know

176
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,660
so they said to him you know this is all these are impermanent all these are not self these are just things that are

177
00:18:54,660 --> 00:19:01,140
occurring not self that you don't make a self out of them so again the heat that's happening here

178
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:07,860
is that who you are are you the sensations of heat at the moment are you the heat no

179
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:13,320
you are you the unpleasantness of the heat if you make yourself like I am that

180
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:19,080
unpleasantness then who are you when it gets cool do you shift and change your identity

181
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:25,320
based on what you're feeling all the time you your identity fixated by your what

182
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:31,559
you recognize or something deeper and submit many of the recognitions we have

183
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:39,179
um about ourselves our contingent our tentative are not so accurate even

184
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:47,220
sometimes but we can live kind of glued onto them and have a lot of suffering

185
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:54,780
so to see these five different areas as being impermanent and not self to see it is one of the things that the

186
00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:01,039
early Buddhist tradition said was freeing so China

187
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:07,559
had enough of this from these guys and so he was distraught and he said I'm

188
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:14,780
not inspired by any of this and uh and he said um

189
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:22,740
instead what arises in me my mind doesn't leap in Inspiration rather what grows is my

190
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:28,980
anxiety and my clinging so he's just an anxious guy you know

191
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:35,280
just the more he looks at this and feels the more anxious he gets the more he clings and holds on it's a poor guy

192
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,919
he says my mind is spinning poor guy you know he's he's really

193
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:46,020
troubled he's spinning he's you know and then his companions in the spiritual

194
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:51,600
life his fellow monks are not really thick you know talking to him anymore

195
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:58,080
so what is he going to do and then he says for someone who sees

196
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:06,960
he's thinking to himself for someone who sees the teachings it does not occur to ask who then is

197
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:12,840
myself who's the self what is the self someone who sees doesn't that ask that

198
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:18,000
question which is a common question it's considered one of the great spiritual

199
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:24,960
questions or existential questions who am I but for the Buddhists there's something about if you really see this life

200
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:31,700
directly in a clear way you wouldn't ask that question why is that

201
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:39,480
um so he says so um so that I can see

202
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:45,120
the teaching who is it who can point the teachings out to me

203
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:51,720
who can make it clear and then he remembers Ananda the Buddha is one of the primary

204
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,799
attendants and fellow person from the same town they grew up in the same town also

205
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:06,000
and he says Ananda was praised by the Buddha and

206
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,880
esteemed by his wise companions in the Holy life vanderbil Ananda can point out the

207
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:17,280
dhamma so I can see the dumb the teaching I have a lot of love

208
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:24,000
for vanderbil and under why don't I visit him it's very touching this guy's so

209
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,559
troubled and he said I have a lot of love for this man and um and so he's gonna go see

210
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:37,740
and so he goes to Ananda and um

211
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:43,799
and he tells him the story of what happened with these Elder monks and and

212
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:50,100
the whole story that led up to why he came and then he says to say he says may

213
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:55,860
venerable and under instruct me May venerable Ananda teach me

214
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:03,320
May venerable Ananda provide me with a dhamma talk so I can see the teaching

215
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:09,600
and uh in reply Ananda said on this

216
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:16,980
matter I am certainly delighted with venerable Chana that you have opened up and cut

217
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:23,400
through your obstacy so you know he apparently it wasn't

218
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:29,940
available for the teachings for 45 years and he was obstinate right so that's quite something to come to the teaching

219
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:36,960
policy was around it and around and rounded but it wouldn't really take it in wouldn't open himself up to really listen and take it in and

220
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:44,880
but now finally after their all this he was willing to and so so Ananda says

221
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,580
I'm delighted that you're opened up and cut through your absentee

222
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:57,419
listen venerable give ear Janna you can

223
00:23:57,419 --> 00:24:03,919
understand the dhamma you can understand the teachings

224
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:10,159
and then China thought to himself very excitedly

225
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:16,559
oh it seems I am capable of understanding the dhamma if Ananda says

226
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:23,460
so it must be true and so a great Rapture and Delight sprung up in

227
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:31,919
venerable China so here's something very significant to have someone else believe in you

228
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:37,140
to have someone else think you can do this you can understand someone and some

229
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:43,620
people grow up without having anyone who believes in them that way in any way in all kinds of ways and so you know

230
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:50,760
there's a real barrier to do to learn to open up to God even go out into the world if you haven't been believed in

231
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:56,159
and supported and and shown that you're capable and loved and cared for and all

232
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:03,419
kinds of things that go on and maybe China maybe you know he was a son of a servants

233
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:10,380
and maybe there's something about that life of poverty and servitude that didn't really support him to have that

234
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:17,220
kind of confidence or maybe it kind of maybe was a difficult life and maybe something shut down or was discouraged

235
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:23,220
or who knows what happened to him who knows why he was so difficult for all his lives maybe he had a very

236
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:29,940
difficult time growing up and and so to someone there's like Ananda say you can

237
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:35,658
that that really went deep he had Rapture and Delight

238
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:42,840
so um so then Ananda says okay so then he starts giving him the teaching and he

239
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:49,020
says I heard this in the very presence of the Buddha because he was his attendant he was

240
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:54,320
there and this is the teachings to a different monk named

241
00:25:54,320 --> 00:26:02,159
gochana gochana gota and um and he asked the Buddha what is

242
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:07,860
Right View what is the Right View it's the right way of seeing or the

243
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:14,279
right understanding to have to engage in the dhamma yeah generally more technically right

244
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:19,500
view in Buddhism is the way we see the world when we have the first glimpse of

245
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,900
enlightenment so it's not just what you learn you know from a book but when you have some kind

246
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:31,799
of your Dharma eye your enlightened pie opens now you see in a new way so when you ask when this monk asks what is the

247
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:37,500
Right View he's asking more than just what's the you know some piece of teaching he's asking what is it what is

248
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:43,460
what's the vision that we have of the world when we when we're enlightened

249
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:49,500
and um so the and this

250
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:55,919
and so the uh the Buddha was said that it said Nando's repeating with the buddhistana

251
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:02,000
this world relies on the on the dyad

252
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:09,360
of the existence and non-existence that things exist or they don't exist

253
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:16,320
but when one sees with right wisdom the arising of the world

254
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:23,460
as it comes to be the thought of non-existence doesn't occur

255
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:30,059
when one sees with right wisdom the cessation of the world

256
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:37,080
doesn't occur that something exists so the idea that things exist and a

257
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,299
particular thing that exists that's a big problem is you

258
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:50,520
of course you know I want to say of course you exist but in the Buddhist worldview you don't exist as a fixed

259
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:58,760
thing there's no essential fixed solid core thing that you are

260
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:04,620
and and also you don't not exist and so this is an enigmatic it's

261
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:11,159
quandary people struggle with kind of teaching how does this mean I don't exist and I don't not exist I mean these

262
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:16,200
Buddhists are crazy and um and giving these kinds of kind of

263
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:23,520
statements and um but then the Buddha says that if you can see

264
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:28,799
that a thought arises maybe it's not paraphrasing a thought arises in your

265
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:35,100
mind that person is dangerous you see that it was just born in that

266
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:42,120
moment it didn't have an existence before it's temporary it's just there it doesn't

267
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:48,059
exist in some permanent solid way it's there as a visitor

268
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:53,340
and um but it's there you can't say it doesn't exist but because you see that

269
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:58,860
it's we see it pass away after a while that you no longer have that thought

270
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:04,980
then you see that it just person just looks like your third grade bully and so immediately you feel okay the person you

271
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:10,320
see oh the person's sweet actually then you see it go you say well that now

272
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,720
I see it went away and so because it's gone away it it was

273
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:20,760
it didn't solidly exist as something so it it you don't say it exists you

274
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:27,179
don't say it doesn't exist what you say is that it's in process

275
00:29:27,179 --> 00:29:33,659
it's it's inconstant it comes and goes it's part of the flow and shifting

276
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:40,380
changing stream of living experience that we live in and the idea is to in Buddhism is to

277
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:47,159
learn how to float swim in the Stream of constantly shifting and changing world

278
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:52,320
that we live in swimming in a stream in a river

279
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,840
as opposed to if I'm allowed to stretch this metaphor

280
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:03,840
um getting stuck in the river in the winter time when it gets frozen over

281
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,419
and you're Frozen in it and you can't get out and so often we get Frozen around our

282
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:15,840
ideas Frozen around our Concepts and feelings and emotions about holding on to them and clinging to them and getting

283
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,899
fixated and so to see their comings and going

284
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:27,720
oh they are just appearing now for a while they just it was born it just came into being

285
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:33,360
and now it's gone and there's something about seeing that and knowing that we begin to relax our

286
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,179
grip something begins to thaw and melt that has been frozen for a long time or

287
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:45,600
fixated for a long time and um so so when the Buddha says the

288
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:52,020
rising of the world he means the world of our experience it's very clear in the teachings it doesn't mean you know the

289
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:57,360
external world it's the world of our experience it comes and goes

290
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:03,000
um so um so that's nice maybe I don't know what

291
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,100
you think of that the next teaching is what was very significant for me in my

292
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:14,179
month-long Retreat that I kind of supported me as I went through

293
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:19,980
um and I'm going to paraphrase it to make it serious so it's real simple and maybe understandable

294
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:26,100
there's a lot of synonyms you know you know there's a lot of words extra words maybe to make it really clear but I

295
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:33,419
think it distracts also um this world mostly this world says mostly

296
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:39,299
this world for all the people is attached

297
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:44,640
that's most people are attached um

298
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,340
but in relationship to these attachments

299
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:59,100
if one does not cling to the attachments

300
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:07,980
if one does not cling to them with the idea this is who I am

301
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:13,740
so it's one thing to be attached it's the other the other thing to put on

302
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:21,059
top of that a second attachment where I'm identifying myself I am that

303
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:29,340
attachment so I might really like ice cream hot day

304
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:37,020
it seems nice attached to ice cream that's maybe you know ordinary enough

305
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:43,679
but then you know I get attached to I am the ice

306
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:51,419
cream eater I am the ice cream Liker and I better let everyone else know that

307
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:57,240
this is who I am and I'm going to prove that I'm a really good ice cream Liker

308
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:03,840
by buying sophisticated ice cream flavors and uh and really show that I'm really

309
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:11,039
kind of like a special ice cream Eater Not just an ordinary ice cream eater and I'm gonna get a little label on my shirt

310
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:18,240
that's you know just you know Champion Ice Cream eater or something and and then it becomes important not

311
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,519
just to go to you know I don't know the ordinary ice cream shop but you have to

312
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,620
go to the Artesian ice cream shop to get you know

313
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:35,100
the most sophisticated ice cream because you know how that says something about who you are as a sophisticated person

314
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:41,940
so it's one thing to really like ice cream and want it and maybe even crave it but the layer of cell thing that can

315
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:48,419
go on top of it can be quite strong so so that's a silly example I'm hoping that you can

316
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:55,380
understand maybe apply it and see that maybe something like this plays itself out in your life also

317
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:00,480
that how much we identify and one identification to clinging especially

318
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:07,799
among Buddhists is because in Buddhism we're trying not to cling and we see that we're clinging and now

319
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:13,440
we say I'm a bad Buddhist and now we've added the second layer of

320
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,500
clinging clinging to a kind of self we've identified I am a bad Buddhist

321
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:24,599
you know it's bad enough to cling to ice cream but to then be a bad Buddhist because

322
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:31,080
you do you know it's you know that's adding these layers right so

323
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:36,320
so that's what the teaching so the teachings are um

324
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:43,500
so and then it goes oh so the world cling the world gets attached

325
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:50,878
and to those attachments uh someone has a right view does not cling

326
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:56,460
to the idea this is who I am um

327
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:05,099
one and then one will have no doubt that that very Duke got that's very

328
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:10,460
suffering of the attachment

329
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,579
is just the arising the appearing of suffering

330
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:23,940
when we'll have no doubt that when it disappears it's just a disappearing of it so there's something about the

331
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:30,420
attachment of self that we have the clinging to self and then applying it to all other different things

332
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:37,440
that obscures the nature of the uh the first layer of attachment

333
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,780
There's Something About Me Myself and mind that we overlay on top of it that

334
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:49,500
freezes it fixates it obscures it but if we don't identify with our

335
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:55,079
clinging don't identify where their attachments you don't say it I'm attached we say

336
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:00,720
there is attachment here then there's a better chance to see

337
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,760
that what all it is it's it's suffering

338
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,820
suffering is occurring so if I get really if you know maybe some of you now too I'm sorry if I cause

339
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:17,220
this for you um you know now you have mostly what

340
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:23,640
you're thinking about now is ice cream and you're like as soon as this is over guilt wins to stop talking because I

341
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,800
need to get out to this ice cream store quickly you know and you're attached to your ice cream

342
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,980
but then if you um if you pay if you're not kind of distracted by I'm because I

343
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:41,940
need to go to ice cream I'm the great ice cream eater and I need to prove it to everyone but you're staying close to the primary

344
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:48,240
attachment then there's an opportunity to see that that's suffering that hurts

345
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:56,220
ouch there's a clinging a contraction or hurt distress any attachment we have involves stress

346
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:01,260
anything anytime we clamp down clings

347
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:07,859
um you know is stressful but to see the stress that what the Buddhists call suffering

348
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:13,619
dukkah as uh just to see it arrive to see it appear to have the ability to be

349
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:20,520
mindfulness there it is it just appeared gives you the opportunity to stay in the

350
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:26,220
Stream and not to freeze oh it's just suffering

351
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:31,560
that's what it is and there now I've gotten distracted

352
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,859
you know I could probably distract you if you some of you are suffering Now by how long this Dharma talk has been

353
00:37:36,859 --> 00:37:42,060
I can probably distract you for a moment if I talk a little bit about say

354
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:48,619
something like you know that it's possible that spiders will fall from the ceiling yeah

355
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:54,200
except for a moment probably you have got everything else but the spiders

356
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:01,740
and um so the anyway so uh

357
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,780
so then the Buddha goes on and so then he says if you see this clearly

358
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:15,060
then you will become independent in the teaching

359
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:22,380
in the in the Buddhist teaching you you won't depend on anybody else or any book or anything because you don't have to

360
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:27,720
it's not learned the teaching now you see it

361
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:35,520
which is the goal that China had he wanted to see and so anandas there's pointing saying

362
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:41,280
you see it by seeing how you get attached to self

363
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,099
around your experiences you have and sometimes there's a negative

364
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:52,680
attachment sometimes it's a positive attachment sometimes just a confused attachment but we often it is a

365
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:59,099
solething thing is a big source of suffering and the attachment of self is considered

366
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:04,800
maybe the primary core suffering of it all because it obscures

367
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,960
all the other clingings we can't see at this part of the stream and the flow and

368
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:17,579
the shifting and changing so we can kind of float along without freezing around it getting caught in it

369
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:23,940
so that's all it takes you don't have to get a PhD in Buddhist studies to understand the Dharma you can just

370
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:29,339
kind of see this is how you see it is to see how things when they appear when you're right there mindful is right

371
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:36,420
there oh there it is there it is it appears oh and there it went it makes the mind the heart more fluid

372
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:41,460
more at ease more open more kind of willing to kind of go be carried along

373
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:49,560
in the Stream of life as it flows and goes through us and the Buddha goes on and says as

374
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:55,859
quoted by Ananda everything exists is one extreme

375
00:39:55,859 --> 00:40:00,980
everything does not exist is the second extreme

376
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:06,839
avoiding the two extremes teaches the Dharma

377
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:12,900
through the middle and the middle is that things arise and they pass

378
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:18,599
that's the alternative that's the way you find your way into the middle of the stream where it's not frozen where

379
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:24,420
everything flows so uh

380
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:29,760
so I sat in my retreat and was reminded of these teachings regularly and right

381
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,540
there awareness arising right there don't don't make this the self

382
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:41,940
don't make this into Me Myself and mine let it be let it be

383
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:47,280
let it just flow let it come and go feel the suffering of it come steal the

384
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:55,079
suffering of a girl there's something very when we see when we feel and see how the arisings and passing are

385
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:01,200
suffering it makes it a lot easier and simpler to want to let go of it

386
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,020
who are sophisticated people sometimes so if we have sophisticated clingings like the ice cream

387
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:13,440
and then it's hard to kind of you know give it up but if we just see oh that's clicking to

388
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,599
ice cream that's suffering that's stress to have it it makes it a lot simpler and easier

389
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:26,359
okay let go let go and um

390
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:31,700
so let's see

391
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:41,119
so uh

392
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:51,720
so then uh China is a story about China at the end so the setup ends with China telling

393
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:59,940
Ananda Reverend Ananda this is how it is to have care

394
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:06,599
to be cared for that nice I mean here I do this is what maybe even Behavior among all these

395
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:12,480
decades maybe he was not open he was not available to feel how the people care

396
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,660
for him this is how it is to have care well wishing

397
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:25,200
instruction and teaching by The venerables Who were our

398
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,300
companions in the Holy life so they come his companions right that's

399
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:38,000
you know the people is having heard this dumb mother's teaching

400
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:46,260
the teaching now has been fully settled very nice standing nice story

401
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:52,079
so I thought there's a huge there's a Humanity to this story about this man who's troubled and

402
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:58,920
and what it took to be somehow open to hear the teachings and and then as he

403
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:06,720
heard these teachings to feel cared for and loved in a certain way perhaps and and uh and then to be and then to

404
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,180
understand now it's settled now he knows so whether you understand that core

405
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:19,079
teachings that is said to be the origin of much of Mahayana Buddhism then even

406
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:26,040
um maybe at least you'd uh were struck by the humanity of

407
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:31,500
care and love and believing in each other and

408
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:37,859
and maybe that's the way to be opens be available to hear these teachings

409
00:43:37,859 --> 00:43:43,338
then maybe some days do have a teaching settled

410
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,520
so thank you very much and um

411
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:54,619
may you all be well

412
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:14,339
sometimes then during these last months we've been meeting out in the parking lot afterwards if people would ask you

413
00:44:14,339 --> 00:44:20,640
know question and discussion it's kind of hot out there probably so I suggest we turn the air conditioner on and and

414
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:28,338
I'll just stay here for a while some of you want to stay and we can have a little discussion and you're not to do the air conditioner

415
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,700
so any questions anyone wants to ask maybe we can ask what the handheld Mike

416
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:09,619
so that so that people can hear them

417
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:16,680
we'll take maybe 10 minutes for this girl just wondering

418
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:21,500
which uh it doesn't sound like it

419
00:45:28,619 --> 00:45:35,660
testing Gil which suta is that about China it's that you call the Chana

420
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:43,260
and it's known by its number is that 22.90 in the connected discourses so the

421
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:49,560
22nd chapter is the 90th suta in that chapter connected connected discourses

422
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:55,279
2290 yeah yeah you can have it thank you this is it

423
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:07,440
okay you can have it I also posted it my this is my translation I posted it on imc's website you know there's a

424
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:13,440
Reflections from Gill under what's new so I put it there in my Reflections for me so you can if you want to read it

425
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,040
again it's there

426
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,220
um

427
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:35,339
thank you very much for that talk Gail I'm really struck by the transition of

428
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:40,980
awareness emptiness and then meta

429
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:48,420
for Chana it's it's it's almost as if he he had the talks but he wasn't aware

430
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:53,880
and then this sense of not belonging somehow cut through

431
00:46:53,880 --> 00:47:01,980
that sense of maybe ignorance delusion and then with the teachings on emptiness

432
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:09,540
it allowed the meta and the karuna to just flow freely it's just thank you it

433
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:17,359
was just told so beautiful and part of the direction their flowed was into him yeah beautiful

434
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:27,540
okay yeah I just wanted to

435
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:33,960
State a interesting quote I heard the other or read the other day Alan Arkin

436
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:39,359
who recently died the actor he said um

437
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:45,000
acting is not who I am acting is what I do and that's really

438
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,720
stuck it really drove home that point of the self of how we identify with the

439
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:58,200
things that we you know are professions and beliefs and all that stuff nice very nice

440
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:04,578
thank you that thing is not who I am it's what I do

441
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,900
including being a Buddhist including being a Buddhist instead of just

442
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:18,319
following the path yeah maybe no one should be a Buddhist

443
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,880
we just do we used to do Buddhism

444
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:31,160
yes all the way in the back

445
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:41,880
thank you so I just wanna say the

446
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:50,099
The Plea believing in me that piece is really inspiring and a resonating in the

447
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:56,099
way that uh sometimes for all the circumstances the people you

448
00:48:56,099 --> 00:49:01,800
close with may not believe in you of your pursue

449
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:10,020
and uh I just want to express the Gratitude of the Sangha in the way that that's aware

450
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:16,619
I find a belief and a care fantastic and it's fantastic that you resonated with that

451
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:22,160
that's really meaningful that that you took that in thank you

452
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:32,359
[Applause] Hey Joe

453
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:41,760
so I was curious how Buddha missed that he missed that didn't he with Chana or

454
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,700
all those uh for 40 years yeah yeah

455
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:56,220
yeah you know and then you can't expect everyone to get it right all the time

456
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:01,920
it's a it's a pretty big order we expect the Buddha to be perfect but

457
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:10,920
it was he was human too that's why we need a sun god community so that uh we all have different kind of

458
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:17,240
capacities or connections and so on when he needed Ananda

459
00:50:19,319 --> 00:50:25,500
and on that point maybe Chana wasn't ready when the Buddha was so he wasn't ready so he he wasn't ready he was he

460
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:31,619
was so closed and so obstinate that he did it and the medicine was that the Buddha finally at

461
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:36,660
the end of his life said Europe you know you know no one's supposed to talk to

462
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:42,119
you anymore no one asked you're not part of this community kind of that's powerful medicine and then I hope that

463
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:48,059
Buddha did that that of all his wisdom he knew what was needed and it seemed to that seemed to have worked that's part

464
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:53,280
of the flow and that that that moment would have led to

465
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:59,520
what eventually happened yep sometimes very strong language

466
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:06,300
strong actions are needed I kill good to have you back

467
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:11,520
I wonder if you feel like sharing more about how you worked with

468
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:16,680
that teaching during your retreat more like

469
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:22,460
specific things you noticed or

470
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:28,920
oh simple things like if I was doing walking meditation

471
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:36,119
and I had this thought that uh oh I'm not getting concentrated enough enough

472
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:41,819
so I said oh that's a stressful thought that just arose it was just a thought that arose I don't

473
00:51:41,819 --> 00:51:49,500
have to believe it I don't have to identify with it or make myself into a bad walking meditator

474
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:55,559
oh look at that was just that was the rising of that and then it was just like oh then it would it would just kind of

475
00:51:55,559 --> 00:51:58,160
dissolve I

476
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,559
think there are a lot a lot of little things like that through the day and so

477
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:21,660
I was also struck by the fact that uh Ananda despite the Buddha's instructions

478
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:28,619
not to speak to China that Ananda not only spoke to China he really

479
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:35,040
engaged with him fully so I I think that's interesting I mean that's profound right to me and I don't know if

480
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:41,160
you have any thoughts about that as well I don't know if there's best thoughts or something but Ananda has this reputation

481
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:46,559
of being a really friendly really friendly Monk and he was much more

482
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:53,220
friendly than some people thought he should be so for example he was he was a big supporter of the nuns and sometimes

483
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:59,819
those can some people thought he was like too friendly to nuns and so he was he had a very friendly disposition and

484
00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:08,660
and um and that's what he was known for so the nice guy

485
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:23,880
and then in terms of this uh this this rule that the Buddha said you know

486
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:30,059
against China China soon thereafter became poorly enlightened and when you're fully enlightened all your those

487
00:53:30,059 --> 00:53:35,720
rules get dissolved they go away so then he was in good standing

488
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:46,619
um one thing when I was hearing this story was that if I were to know China I would feel

489
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:53,880
very frustrated at his kind of uh um closed or closed office and I'm

490
00:53:53,880 --> 00:54:00,599
wondering if there's any anything else around maybe how the rest of the song could maybe if they did feel that

491
00:54:00,599 --> 00:54:06,359
frustration or maybe how they they dealt with with that yeah probably that's why

492
00:54:06,359 --> 00:54:11,819
the elders when they kind of just you know kind of dismissed him with these simple teachings it's all impermanent go

493
00:54:11,819 --> 00:54:17,339
away um it might have been not just the rule that the Buddha established that no one

494
00:54:17,339 --> 00:54:23,819
should talk to him but it might be they've had Decades of you know seeing how difficult he's been and

495
00:54:23,819 --> 00:54:29,040
and how he he wouldn't listen or he wouldn't hear or there was pointless to

496
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:35,160
try to have maybe people had tried for years to try to get through to him and so their frustration was there and

497
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:40,800
and it might have been a very difficult person for others and why he was

498
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:46,079
difficult we don't know and maybe he was I don't know

499
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:54,200
maybe he was uh maybe we shouldn't even say he was difficult maybe he was just that nowadays we have the expression uh

500
00:54:54,200 --> 00:55:00,119
neurodivergent they're different maybe he was maybe he was uh had some kind of different

501
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:05,160
brain than other people and so he behaved differently and I've known

502
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:10,740
people who who I was a little bit cautious around until I found out that that they had

503
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:17,040
some kind of neurodivergence that was completely normal for some people to have and oh that's why they are the way

504
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:22,079
they are okay and then I was just completely happy with him so who knows

505
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:28,200
what story so hard to reconstruct back there but but it's such a common human

506
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:34,559
phenomena for us to for people to be closed down to each other shut down not

507
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:40,859
be available and be judgmental and um and uh

508
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:49,079
and then somehow to for love care respect to somehow dissolve that and

509
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:57,240
opens things up and I think that that's the kind of one of the powerful lessons I think of practice is an Ananda represents that

510
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:04,619
someone who understands the value of the power of love and care and friendliness

511
00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:07,940
even for difficult people

512
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,720
I just wanted to get some explanation on this issue of attachment is in terms of

513
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:25,680
the degree of attachment is strong is is it mild is it uh non-existent and how it

514
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:31,880
obscures the power of observation as we you described and power of awareness

515
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:37,380
is there a um is there a way that you could act normally in regards to these

516
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:44,520
things for example obviously if you come to a totally identify with who you are as a

517
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:52,079
professional of some sort or whatever doctor engineer whatever or is it just a matter of sometimes a matter of simply

518
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:59,040
the security that is required to live and he said is it an attachment and is

519
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:04,319
that if it is does it obscure your power observation

520
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:12,599
so if I understand what you're saying I can reply this way that I think is important not to think

521
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:18,960
that attachment is a crime uh you know because just because Buddhism is about the ending of

522
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:26,220
attachment doesn't mean that it's necessarily wrong to be attached it is stressful it does have a it does

523
00:57:26,220 --> 00:57:33,420
does hurt in some way but uh sometimes attachments better than the alternative

524
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:39,780
you know sometimes it would be like security and safety um and um you know being being attached

525
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:47,339
to a job because if you don't have a job how you can take care of your family or all your old age or something and so you

526
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:52,680
know it's you know you could give up the attachment give up the job attachment keeps you

527
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:58,319
motivated to take do it well if you don't attach you might be lackadaisical

528
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:04,380
and get fired or something or just give it up not show up for work and then all these other things where percussions are

529
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:10,440
worse so if it if the if the alternative attachment is worse maybe it's good to

530
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:15,960
keep the attachment for the time being but don't reify it don't make it into a

531
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:22,800
belief or whole religion that you're supposed to be attached recognize oh this is attachment the wisest this is

532
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:28,380
probably the wisest way I can do right now I don't have to get rid of all my attachments right away just because I'm

533
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:34,200
attached let me keep practicing and when the time is right the practice is quite

534
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:40,460
powerful it's almost like the practice has its own wisdom if you creep to keep doing mindfulness practice and seeing

535
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:46,859
when the time is ready to address an attachment is what you'll know

536
00:58:46,859 --> 00:58:53,220
but and you know the fact that you know that you're attached doesn't mean you have to fix it right away

537
00:58:53,220 --> 00:59:00,359
so when it's the best alternative keep it and I I know Buddhist teachers say even

538
00:59:00,359 --> 00:59:07,319
being attached to Buddhism um is sometimes better than the alternative and and uh you know keep it

539
00:59:07,319 --> 00:59:13,260
as long as it's beneficial at some point it'll benefits will not be there and

540
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:19,260
then you'll know it's self-correcting or if you become obsessed with it if you

541
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:25,280
get upset with it obsessed with it obsessed by the way that's the names that's getting a little bit now

542
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:32,420
edgy because then your family's not going to be happy here thank you your friends

543
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:41,339
thank you so much for the story girl I you know I've been replaying that story in my head again and again a little bit

544
00:59:41,339 --> 00:59:49,980
louder I is it loud now yeah I really like the story and

545
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:56,339
I've been noticing in it you know very recently like how unconditional love is

546
00:59:56,339 --> 01:00:01,680
answer to so many questions and I really loved how Ananda was there

547
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:08,940
and just giving Johanna unconditional love irrespective of all the rules and everything yeah

548
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:16,880
thank you beautiful thank you nice to hear so we should stop I'd like to stop

549
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:24,020
and um thank you all very nice nice to sit here with you and be
