1
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,740
so hello everyone and welcome and uh

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:24,720
so we're at a day for a natural turning of the planet

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:32,220
and it's kind of symbolic of it's being getting darker for many months now

4
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:38,340
days shorter and now with no responsibility in our part

5
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,579
nothing we've done the days will get longer you'll be more light

6
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:50,160
and it's a marvelous wonderful thing that that's the case at least here in the

7
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,199
northern hemisphere and it's different in the southern hemisphere

8
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,840
but they'll appreciate the same thing in six months that there'll be a turn

9
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,060
that towards light towards something it's uh and warmth

10
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:13,619
and so the same way with meditation um we don't

11
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:19,439
cause the light the warmth the goodness the

12
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:26,280
wholesomeness to arise but we enable it we allow it we

13
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:33,780
make room for it the host the unwholesome mental Tendencies thoughts actions

14
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:42,360
motivations belong to a part of the Mind that we do activate we do get involved

15
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:50,579
in it's because they're more the reactive part of the Mind and they hold some certainly we can do

16
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,860
it and activate it and and kind of Bring It about the wholesome

17
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:01,619
State sometimes but in meditation what we learn is that

18
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,960
um is that we are

19
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,020
that a lot of the wholesome that develops a lot of the goodness that comes in meditation doesn't come from us

20
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:20,580
making it so much doing it but more allowing it creating the conditions that allow that

21
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,220
not what's reactive to occur but to real allows something

22
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:33,840
which is a unfolding and emerging and allowing the emergence the wholesome emerges

23
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,500
the unwholesome reacts in a sense

24
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:47,099
so what I'd like to offer today is one of the conditions that can be phenomenally helpful

25
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:52,519
for the emergence of the wholesome further and that is

26
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:59,900
to really stay close to not knowing

27
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,660
stay close to recognizing what's happening so in that sense there's knowing being with mindful of breathing

28
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:13,080
the body the experience you're having but beyond recognizing it the Simplicity

29
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:19,040
of it don't know what it means don't know where it's going what's happening

30
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,900
just get out of the way so I don't know this is what's happening I don't know

31
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,180
not knowing so that we're not riding close with the

32
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:37,080
signing meaning identifying making it Me Myself and mine operating from what should happen or

33
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,720
what shouldn't happen expectations desires for what's supposed to happen desires for what's not

34
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,180
supposed to happen just know what's happening in the sense

35
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:54,260
of recognition recognition clear recognition

36
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,799
and just not know anything else they're kind of not knowing that makes

37
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:08,159
room that kind of empties a crowded mind

38
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:15,540
of all its thoughts and concerns and projections and then emptying of the mind of it's

39
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:22,019
all the crowded visitors makes room for something to emerge

40
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:29,100
then what emerges from your depths trust that

41
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:37,020
trust the Simplicity of not knowing while recognizing oh

42
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:44,820
and the recognition can be phenomenally simple if there's not obvious what something is

43
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:52,560
you can simply recognize it as something don't have to go digging or analyzing

44
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,660
something and then over time just just something

45
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,500
and I don't know and then see what emerges what becomes clear

46
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:09,560
so to assume a meditation posture

47
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:19,440
a posture of feeling Worthy

48
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,660
of something important feeling worthy as a human being a

49
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,919
posture that expresses this even if you don't feel that way

50
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,680
because that sense of worthiness or dignity nobility

51
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:44,160
is a condition that allows something from the depths to emerge that's different

52
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,659
if we take a posture that's the opposite of self-worth or dignity

53
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,060
gently close your eyes

54
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:13,560
and taking a few long slow deep breaths and as you exhale

55
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,039
and let go of knowing let go of

56
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,160
meaning making thinking about the future a past

57
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,960
what should be what shouldn't be

58
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,400
let go and begin let the visitors let the crowd your

59
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:48,740
mind begin to leave float away

60
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:29,840
letting your breath return to normal

61
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:38,240
just sitting here quietly for a few moments finding your way into a

62
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:47,520
wholesome satisfying attitude of not needing to know so much

63
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,840
not needing to judge or assign meaning or

64
00:07:54,840 --> 00:08:02,539
even a sign of future through what's happening just being present

65
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:09,620
making the room of not knowing

66
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,380
and maybe in the middle of this vast field of not knowing

67
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:51,260
your body is breathing the rhythm of breathing

68
00:08:53,700 --> 00:09:00,480
a rhythm that moves through

69
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:08,060
a mind of not knowing a mind that's present

70
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:16,920
maybe they're not knowing is replaced by a

71
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,820
greater attentiveness

72
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:34,459
a peaceful alertness to what is

73
00:10:50,519 --> 00:11:00,000
and if your mind starts thinking about something you might take a moment to see or feel

74
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,740
that the thinking is operating

75
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:12,180
on some kind of thing that doesn't you assume you know the Mind assumes it

76
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,720
knows

77
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,160
even if that simple as assuming it knows that it's supposed to know

78
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:33,860
supposed to figure something out let there be a not knowing

79
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:39,560
that not knowing the mixed room

80
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,620
to be with the depths of your being

81
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,800
when you're lost in thought and recognize it

82
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:26,240
say to yourself not knowing don't know

83
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,519
you don't really know

84
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:39,839
or you don't really need to know whatever you're thinking about that's

85
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:47,000
not right here and now in the simplicity

86
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:56,300
of being with what emerges in the body and in the heart

87
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,080
foreign

88
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,000
not knowing

89
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:14,900
creates different opportunities than knowing

90
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,539
if you go into the world knowing

91
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:27,019
I think it can be effective and have good results

92
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:32,240
but if you enter the world and not knowing

93
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:37,039
you expand the possibilities

94
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:45,900
if you meet a friend and don't be and begin by not knowing

95
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:52,620
you get to experience more of the fullness or the uniqueness of that moment of your

96
00:27:52,620 --> 00:28:01,639
friend and you get to have more room for yourself

97
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:09,720
knowing Narrows possibilities often not knowing

98
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:14,600
taking a few moments not to know but to discover

99
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,720
allows us to open to something new

100
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:30,559
so at this end of this sitting as we do the dedication of Merit

101
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:38,120
what would it be like to care for the world

102
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,658
where there's care

103
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:48,620
but also room for discovery

104
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:55,140
where there's love but the space of not knowing what's

105
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:58,880
supposed to happen and what's going on

106
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:11,059
so I'll say the dedication but maybe let it open you to not knowing

107
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,440
than not knowing that can be there together with love

108
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:25,820
may all beings be happy

109
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:32,179
may all beings be safe

110
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,778
may all beings be peaceful

111
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:45,320
may all beings be free

112
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:55,940
may all beings know the respect

113
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:08,539
of others being available to know who they are

114
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:15,080
without projections and judgments and even a past

115
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:20,179
let people as you go through the world

116
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:27,840
have the respect of the not knowing mind as you bring your presence and attention

117
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:34,679
to take in another person and may that bring peace

118
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,480
than love and happiness

119
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:52,460
[Music]

120
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,220
thank you

121
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:58,039
oh goodness hello everyone and

122
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,320
done their souls to stay

123
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:15,140
and the topic this week is Right effort and today we turn towards

124
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,700
the effort to

125
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:28,679
allow the wholesome to emerge so there's a classically in Buddhism

126
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:35,940
there's a dichotomy the division between those mental States motivations

127
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:41,820
thoughts activities just about anything that is afflictive

128
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:49,220
and that which is beneficial and uh in this dichotomy

129
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:56,159
what might be in the middle that's neither afflictive or beneficial is not really addressed not really

130
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:02,399
talked about not because there's maybe a radical Duality between these two but the

131
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:10,260
neutral is not spiritually so meaningful so important to focus on it's as a place it

132
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:17,159
is what it is but uh in terms of the training and the growth and development

133
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:22,799
that Buddhism is about it's not particularly relevant

134
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:28,320
it would be like something like um

135
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:35,820
I mean I don't know what an example would be but if someone is training

136
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:43,440
for a bicycle race

137
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,840
there are things that they do that could undermine their training and things that can

138
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:55,799
support it and then there's things that can happen that do neither that uh it's just simply something

139
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:01,860
that's happening and so for example if you I don't know

140
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:08,840
um maybe if the person just likes to read about

141
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:15,000
um the score and football football scores and standings

142
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,240
it might be a neutral might be pleasant to do might be nice if a person likes that but in terms of the training for

143
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:28,378
the bicycle race it's neither the here or they're there so the Buddhism has this dichotomy

144
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:33,780
between the wholesome and the unwholesome and the unwholesome is afflictive and the and the wholesome is

145
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:39,898
beneficial and what it implies is that or what it indicates is that there are uh

146
00:34:39,899 --> 00:34:46,500
beneficial states of Mind movements of Mind heart that can live within us

147
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:52,980
that are beneficial that are good and useful and so we want to enable that or evoke

148
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:58,740
those or allow room for those and that these are important

149
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:04,260
and it Buddhism is not just about abandoning and letting go and

150
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:09,839
renouncing the abandoning of Buddhism they're

151
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:15,500
letting go is that when the Buddha talked about it

152
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:23,040
he's very seldom talks about letting go of things it's always an inner world if you're

153
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:30,599
letting go of clinging to things attachments craving the things that we're caught in

154
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:36,260
so we don't have to necessarily let go of things of the world wisdom might tell us to do that

155
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:42,960
compassion might tell us to do that but in terms of the Dharma they what we're letting go of is the

156
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,320
inner the clinging the attachments in the mind but that's not all we're supposed to do

157
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:56,700
sometimes people kind of pick up some simple idea of Buddhism and think oh this Buddhism is all about letting go

158
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:04,079
but in fact that's important that's part of the four right efforts but equally

159
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:10,440
important is the cultivation or the allowance the development of beneficial States

160
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:16,859
wholesome States skillful States and there's a lot of them the ones that

161
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:22,320
are closely associated with the mindfulness practice are the seven

162
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:29,220
factors of Awakening so things like well mindfulness and investigation

163
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:36,119
effort endeavoring again Joy Tranquility concentration equanimity

164
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:41,880
elsewhere happiness is important patience wisdom

165
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:49,079
states of mind that are expansive open peaceful boundless loving kindness

166
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:56,040
compassion sympathetic Joy there's a whole slew of them and there's so many that the mind

167
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:02,640
can go dizzy we're like wow I have to get busy here and do so much but it isn't so much that we have to do

168
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:09,060
them all and all at once there's another art here and it's not necessarily the art of

169
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:18,599
making and doing but the allowing and the um the language is uh uh usually

170
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:24,900
translated into English as the arising uh when when makes room for one makes

171
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:31,619
space for what it puts energy into the arising and of wholesome States

172
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:37,020
the language of rising I sometimes like to to rather than calling it rising to

173
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:42,660
call it emergence and why I like the emergence is that it

174
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:48,780
doesn't imply that we're the doer we're the maker of it but rather there's something within us that wants to be

175
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:55,740
born something that has the capacity of emerging coming out and our job is to

176
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:02,640
make space for that emergence to allow for that and the reason I trust this so much is

177
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,220
that the afflictive emotions and states of mind I associate more with the

178
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:15,119
surface reactivity it's it's the world of reactions to what's happening in the world and how it impacts Us and how it

179
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,160
impacts our attachments and our fears and as deep as that those can feel take

180
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,859
they are uh they still have to do with this interactive world it's more on the surface

181
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:31,440
the emergent world comes from some a different place within

182
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:39,060
and it's uh and it's something that can well up as opposed to react uh react to

183
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:46,380
and so we don't have to have anything in particular happening in the world that triggers us triggers The Beneficial it's

184
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:53,700
more like we get settled and make room for it and this is a remarkable thing to discover in meditation that the more

185
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:58,859
peaceful we become more quiet and calm we become the more we have this kind of

186
00:38:58,859 --> 00:39:05,420
sense of not knowing just willing just to be here in our experience and make room for

187
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:11,099
then then the beneficial kind of begins to flow and come out it's not

188
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:17,460
intentional but it's more uh something that um uh

189
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:22,980
the intention is to make room for it to allow for it to be with it

190
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:29,160
and um so it can seem a little bit passive it can be kind of a little bit magical thinking to think of you sit

191
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:35,040
there and okay I'm just going to sit here and do nothing and something will emerge that's wonderful

192
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:42,599
um maybe that's little like um um you know just you know and a little you

193
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:48,359
know too passive the language of right effort is kind of dramatic

194
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:55,020
um and Powerful I would say so here's the the classic description of

195
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:02,280
the third right effort practitioners take up

196
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:07,859
and so this is my own translation so if you look it up somewhere else you'll find a little bit different they're

197
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:16,020
quite different practitioners take up and take hold of their minds

198
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:24,060
so that take up and take hold of their minds it doesn't mean you know grab on and it means that they enter into the

199
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:30,359
world of their minds they're they uh the thinking mind and the reactive mind

200
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:36,060
doesn't have us we are there for our mind there's kind of Freedom there

201
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:43,140
who's in control the mind or you and in a certain kind of way in this practice you are

202
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:48,780
um uh and the machinations of the mind uh don't have us don't grab us by the

203
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:54,240
nose and pull us around so another way of saying this is uh to

204
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:02,099
really be present in a full way take up and abide in the heart

205
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:09,779
think up and take hold of their minds and generate desire

206
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:17,520
and then Endeavor and initiate courageous effort for the arising of wholesome mental

207
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,800
States that have not yet arisen

208
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:30,060
so generate desire so have some desire for wholesome states that is a good

209
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:36,960
thing and initiate courageous effort Veria

210
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:45,119
not to make space for it but trust it's okay to have it there are times where having

211
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,359
this kind of open experience of presence and attentiveness and and awareness to

212
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:58,619
the world in an open way feels very vulnerable and very scary

213
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:04,020
uh to be able to feel the depth of what's going on for us we have to go through layers of things which are

214
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:10,440
difficult and so they keep opening and being okay this too this too I stay with

215
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:16,740
and this courageous effort to not believe the thoughts in the mind that you have to fix and do and react and

216
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:22,140
blame but this courageous effort to really be present

217
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:28,680
in a simple relaxed way here putting aside all the other things

218
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:34,440
to allow something to emerge and first my wife might have emerges grief and

219
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:40,200
sadness and anger that's been long unresolved but trusting just opening

220
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:46,859
opening and seeing what it wants to emerge and the courageous effort is to keep

221
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:52,740
getting out of the way for that and and this idea of not knowing can be

222
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:59,839
a way to get out of the way to allow something to begin to come and this not knowing and this emergence

223
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:06,240
seems to work best when we're most settled most calm most peaceful

224
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:15,780
it doesn't work so well if we're caught up in our reactive world that's kind of a self-perpetuating world of samsara

225
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:21,900
and um and so to drop down to quiet down

226
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:28,579
or to be pause long enough to have this not knowing this availability

227
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:35,819
for something here to emerge and when you make room when you take the

228
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:40,980
time to stop the running the running of the Mind the running of

229
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:46,700
the body running around doing things if you take the time

230
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:54,060
to pause the sacred pause to feel and be available what is here

231
00:43:54,060 --> 00:44:01,980
what wants to emerge what wants to be born even in times of great crisis unless

232
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:09,780
there's a danger but great challenges become quiet enough to ask the question

233
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:14,880
what here wants to be born in the middle the center of it all what

234
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:20,460
wants to emerge and as things emerge that are wholesome

235
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:26,420
that are beneficial that are nourishing uh that are nutritious for the heart

236
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:32,180
allow for them let them come

237
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:39,480
so a lot of this third right effort is not making something happen

238
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:45,300
but rather availing ourselves of what's already here

239
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:53,400
I'd like to propose to you that you have more beneficial States going on all the time available to you

240
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,980
that if you pause or make room more quiet down just a moment you'll start

241
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:04,800
feeling that things are good there's reasons for Joy there's reasons for happiness there's reasons for

242
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,900
kindness for love there's reasons for um

243
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:19,099
curiosity and interest in a delightful nourishing way what's here as opposed to oh no this again

244
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:25,619
um Avail yourself so more the feet more rather than making yourself a certain

245
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:33,000
way that's wholesome see if you can kind of pause and make space and Avail yourself of the

246
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:41,040
wholesome that's already here and available no matter how small it is no matter that it's

247
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:47,640
um accompanied by unwholesomeness don't give the unwholesome a lot of

248
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:53,940
authority that it takes you and grabs you and pulls you around or you have to kind of

249
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:59,880
listen to it or obey it Avail yourself of the wholesome that's

250
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:07,319
here and if you don't have it for yourself then borrow it from others

251
00:46:07,319 --> 00:46:15,480
if you can be with people or somehow have connection with someone or even if it's you know

252
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:22,079
on the web something you know put yourself in the presence of people

253
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:27,780
who you feel are emanating something wholesome

254
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:32,880
and then kind of borrow it from them so you can Avail yourself of it and begin

255
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:39,359
begin exploring the world of the emergence of the wholesome

256
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:45,180
so that would be the homework for it uh today is make yourself available for the

257
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:53,040
wholesome so it's not so much it's not making it but seeing making space for it it may be

258
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:59,160
available for it to be there and if you're only running around then there's no space

259
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:04,560
no possibility so thank you

260
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:10,040
and uh look forward to our time tomorrow
